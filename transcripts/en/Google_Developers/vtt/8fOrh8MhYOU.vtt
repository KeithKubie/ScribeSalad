LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi, and
welcome to this series

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.130
on Geocasts, where you can
walk your way through what

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.690
you can do with Google Maps.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.690
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.830
In Part 1, we saw how you
can delegate your mapping

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.630
work to the Google Maps app.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.640
I'm Laurence Moroney.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.460
And in the second
part of the series,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.860
I'm going to talk about how you
can go further and incorporate

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.250
Google Maps functionality
right into your app.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.770
So, for example, say I
just want a simple map.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.750
And I want the minimum
of coding overhead.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.280
Well, how would I do this?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.610
There's lots of options.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.700
The first is to use the
Web Static Maps API.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.585
And this is as
simple as it can be.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:44.090
You pass the API a URL,
and you get a map back.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.780
Now, there's a lot of variety in
the type of maps you get back.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.140
And here you can see some styled
maps, some satellite images,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.590
and even some routing.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.240
And it's as simple as
passing at URL like this.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.360
Often, a static
map isn't enough.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.090
And you might want to
embed a map on your site.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.280
But you don't want to handle
writing lots of script.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.490
Well, you can use the Embed
API and an iframe in this case.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.260
Here, you can see an embedded
map, including navigation

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.650
and traffic conditions.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.840
And here, as you can see,
is my favorite technology

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.180
in Google Maps, which is
an embedded Street View.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.870
Now what's more, there
are no quotas for Maps

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.590
or other geo information
presented in this way using

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.430
the embedded API.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.420
OK, now let's talk addresses.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.930
These are notoriously difficult
to get right when you're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.680
typing on a small device.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.320
With that in mind, there's a
place auto-complete control.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.510
And this supports address auto
complete for web, Android,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.690
and iOS.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.690
It gives you an
editable text field

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.610
with accurate suggestions
for addresses and place

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.500
names upon each key press.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.240
And this is how
it works in code.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.050
On iOS, you'll launch an
auto-complete controller

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.940
and then just capture
the result. On Android,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.780
you'll launch an activity using
the place auto-complete intent

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.360
builder.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.750
And then you simply
catch its result.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.960
Now, you might not always
want to type an address

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.060
to share your location.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.020
You might just want to
point to it on a map.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.370
And, with that in mind, there's
the PlacePicker control.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.540
And here's the code.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.190
On iOS, you use a GMS
PlacePicker control.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.160
And you get place
details such as the place

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.760
name from the callback.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.300
And on Android, you just
start a new activity

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.470
that's built from a
PlacePicker intent.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.484
And just cache the data
and the activity results.

00:02:21.484 --> 00:02:23.400
And that brings us to
the end of this episode.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.550
Here, we spoke about
how you can incorporate

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.950
Google Maps into your app
or site with minimal coding.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.350
But many developers
want deeper integration

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.240
and powerful customization.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.920
You'll see that in
the next episode.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.370
