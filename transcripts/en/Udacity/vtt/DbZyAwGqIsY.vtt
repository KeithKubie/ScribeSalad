00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
For this quiz, your goal is to define a procedure.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000
We'll call it abbaize.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is very useful if you need to come up with names,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and what it does is take 2 strings as its inputs and outputs a string

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that is the first input, followed by 2 repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As an example, if we called abbaize, passing in the string 'a' and the string 'b'--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
single character strings--

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
what we should get as a result is the string 'abba'.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If we called abbaize, passing in the string 'dog' and the string 'cat',

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what we should get is the string 'dogcatcatdog',

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and there aren't any spaces between the strings.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They're just all pasted together.
