00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Evans] Now we're ready for a quiz to see if you understand the goal of the hash table.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The question is, if we have b buckets in our hash table

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and we have k keywords--and we should assume that k is much greater than b,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that there are more keywords than we have buckets--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the question is, which of the properties should the hash function have?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And remember what the hash function is.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a function that takes in a keyword,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
produces a number, and what that number does is gives us the position in the hash table

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is the bucket where that keyword would appear.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The first choice is output a unique number between 0 and k - 1,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so each keyword maps to its own output number.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The second choice is output a number between 0 and b - 1

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the number of buckets that we have.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The third choice is it should map approximately k/b of the keywords to bucket 0.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That means for that number of keywords

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the output of the hash should be 0 and it should map to the first bucket.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The fourth choice is map approximately k/b of the keywords to bucket b - 1.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That's the last bucket.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And the final choice is it should map more of the keywords to bucket 0

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
than it maps to bucket 1.

00:01:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all of the properties that we would like the hash function to have.
