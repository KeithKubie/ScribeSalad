00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
[Captions by Y Translator]
Guys, today, we're going
to be taking a look

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.300
at how to make some sort
of post apocalyptic weapons.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:13.940
[Music]

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.460
There's YouTube channel
called Make or Break

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:16.904
that has a video showing

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:20.055
how they made some throwing
knives modeled after those seen

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.920
in the game Far Cry 4.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.140
We thought those looked really cool,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.180
and we wanted
to try doing something similar,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.879
but with a little bit
of a twist on it.

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:28.750
So today, I'm here
with my friend Clay,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.680
and we are going to try
and make some Far Cry 4 knives,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.942
but in sort
of a post-apocalyptic way.

00:00:34.942 --> 00:00:35.940
We've come to an area

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.139
where there just
happens to be a lot

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.180
of vehicles that are
not in prime condition...

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.820
And we're going to try
and harvest materials from here

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.760
that we can then use
to make these knives.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.200
Here is the basic idea.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020
We've got two hacksaw
and some pliers,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.940
and we're going to find

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.120
what looks like good throwing
knife material on a car,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.100
chop that off, and then
shape it into what we want.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.552
So Clay, why are we here
with all these broken down cars?

00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:05.450
Well, so in a post-apocalyptic
world, of course,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.813
they're going to be tons
of broken down cars.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:08.520
And that.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.592
So logically, that's
the first place you'd go,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.780
and a new I would be a little
bit expensive for the budget.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.100
So we're going to take advantage
of what we have available to us,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.500
and use this as a source
of good cheap materials.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.820
I think what we're looking

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.540
for is some pretty straight
flat-ish pieces of steel,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.400
ideally, something

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
that's like around an eighth
of an inch thick.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.600
Enough thickness that we
can carve into a little bit,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.551
give it some shape,

00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:32.001
and really make it look
like what we're going for.

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:32.646
I think...

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:33.720
I think I'll take it.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.940
What are you--

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.080
What are you asking for it?

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.400
$20.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.580
Sold.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:55.000
[Music]

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.175
Okay, we found
this pretty sweet truck.

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:58.328
It had what looks

00:01:58.328 --> 00:02:02.190
like some sort of carrying
system built into it,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.540
and I think we can try
harvesting some pieces of that.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.600
It has some angle iron

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.180
that I think's going to be
the perfect thickness for it.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.420
Yeah, I think we might try

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.760
and snag this whole
piece off right here.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.820
So how long its going to take
us to cut through this?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.360
Forever?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:30.460
[Music]

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.720
Yes!

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.320
So this angle iron is
like perfect thickness.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.020
It's about 1/8 inch thick,

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:40.150
which should be the perfect size
for making some throwing knives.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.950
Very cool.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.260
So now, we are going to take
this back to our studio.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.380
I know it said post-apocalyptic,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.260
but I was referring
to our source for materials.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.380
We're going to cheat
a little bit,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.920
and use some not quite

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.540
apocalyptic tools to finish
this bad boy up.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:56.910
Okay, we've got
our bar right here

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.480
that we cut off of our...

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.040
Truck.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.720
Weirdly demolished truck,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.100
and we've got a picture of the
knife that were trying to make.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.100
So now, I think we're going
to do is print this out,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.050
and we're going to glue
that onto our bar,

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.900
and that's going to be

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.720
our guide for the shape
we're trying to make.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.900
[Music]

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.427
I printed out a picture
of the knife.

00:03:16.427 --> 00:03:17.649
That's the size we want,

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.450
and I just sanded down this
piece of metal a little bit,

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.862
because it's all
covered in rust,

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:22.968
and I want to be able

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:25.984
to glue this down
onto the metal right there,

00:03:25.984 --> 00:03:28.300
so we can basically just
cut right around it.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:37.900
[Music]

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.880
All right, and now the fun part,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.000
which is just so
very much cutting...

00:03:44.102 --> 00:03:44.902
Yeah.

00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:46.452
Until we have this all removed.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.040
So right now, we're just
going to take a drill bit,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.020
and drill out
these contour edges here.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.100
So then we don't have to later

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.580
on take a file to them
to really get them.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.440
And if we cut the rest

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.300
of the profile
of the knife out first,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.022
then like we have a really hard time
getting the drill bit to stay in place.

00:04:02.022 --> 00:04:17.260
[Music]

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.800
All right.

00:04:17.812 --> 00:04:20.062
Now, the really fun part,

00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:22.650
we get to start cutting
all of that out.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.972
We could use a jigsaw.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.620
We could use the hacksaw.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.352
We can use an angle grinder,

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.274
but we can start with hacksaw
while I run and get

00:04:32.274 --> 00:04:33.901
some metal blades if you want.

00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:35.150
Oh, so I see how it is.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.432
You go get the metal blades
for the jigsaw,

00:04:37.432 --> 00:04:38.900
and I start with a hacksaw.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.599
That's very fair.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:05:01.440
[Music]

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.360
Done.

00:05:02.362 --> 00:05:03.252
Woo.

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:08.060
[Music]

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.594
We've got our basic
shape cut out.

00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:11.210
What's our next step?

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.850
So, we need to take
either a file,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.318
or if you have
an angle grinder,

00:05:15.318 --> 00:05:16.034
that works too.

00:05:16.034 --> 00:05:17.959
We just need to kind
of finish shaping,

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.367
because if you noticed,

00:05:19.367 --> 00:05:22.393
it's definitely not the correct
shape we really want,

00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:25.922
and then we also want to put
bevels on the knife edge of it.

00:05:25.922 --> 00:05:26.763
Start with the file,

00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:28.950
and see how well we're getting
things done with that.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.582
But we actually want the handle

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:33.822
right here tapered
outward that way.

00:05:33.822 --> 00:05:34.175
Right.

00:05:34.175 --> 00:05:36.250
So when we wrap
the paracord around it,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.639
it won't just slip off.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.694
Right, not parallel.

00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:39.494
Just not--

00:05:39.494 --> 00:05:41.060
They're currently curved
is what I'm...

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.732
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:49.540
[Music]

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.680
We've got the profile
all cut and filed out.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.700
Clay, what's our next step?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.550
So we want to cut

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.650
and drill a few holes out here
at the base of the handle,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.312
so you can have a nice...

00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:01.850
Rounded removed area
from the handle.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.180
So I think you could put a strap
or a cord through it.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.680
Yeah.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.058
And then after that,

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:08.492
we're going to start adding
the taper on to the blades,

00:06:08.492 --> 00:06:09.277
right at the bevel.

00:06:09.277 --> 00:06:10.650
Yes, we're going
to do the bevels,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.300
and we're not going to make
them like perfectly sharp.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.550
For a throwing knife,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.440
you kind of want
them dull a little bit.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:37.980
[Music]

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.600
So now, we've added
our little slot in the back.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.340
And we want to start
adding a bevel,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.453
and I've marked off,

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:46.116
before I tore the paper off,

00:06:46.116 --> 00:06:49.382
I marked off where we want
the bevel to go on each side.

00:06:49.382 --> 00:06:54.720
[Music]

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.733
That's basically what

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.740
we're going for is
removing all of this.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.140
[Music]

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.092
We're going to cheat,

00:07:02.092 --> 00:07:04.042
because filing takes
a really long time.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.122
So to take
slightly shorter forever,

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:09.699
we are going to use power tools.

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.818
Because in this
post-apocalyptic world...

00:07:12.872 --> 00:07:14.842
Everybody have this.
&gt;&gt; Everybody has power tools.

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:45.380
[Music]

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.009
We got our shape
pretty well cut out,

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:48.689
and filed and
sanded and everything.

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:49.650
Now, we need to make

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.599
it look a little bit more
like the one in the game.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.300
So we're going to take
a little bit of spray paint,

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.820
and just age it up a bit.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:10.860
[Music]

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.240
So now that we've got
the finished knife,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.980
now, we're going to make
the handle wrap for it.

00:08:14.992 --> 00:08:16.892
So what we're going
to do is just going

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.100
to take some paracord.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.160
We're going to loop it
around the top like that,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.200
and then make sure you've got
some extra line down here

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.680
so you can pull on that later.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.620
And then just start

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.020
wrapping wherever you want
the handle the start.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.480
You can do this pretty tightly.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.649
Just keep going up

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.140
until you want
the handle to stop.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.300
But make sure this loop
stays above the,

00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:46.452
where you want
the handle to stop.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:53.320
[Music]

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.700
So when you get to this point
where you want it to stop,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.680
just tuck that extra piece
of paracord right in,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.220
and then you just pull
on this back piece,

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.020
and that will cinch it down.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.500
It's not going to go anywhere.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.240
And then just cut
off this excess.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.820
And if you want,

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.260
you can take a lighter
and carefully melt this,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.782
and that will really keep it
from coming apart.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.440
We've got our finished handle.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.380
Booyah, we've got

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.940
a finished throwing knife made
out of a piece of an old car.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.599
And now of course,
we need to test this out.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.400
So let's--

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.100
Now, of course,
we need to test this out.

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.800
So let's grab
a scrap piece of wood,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.520
and see if we can throw this
and get it to stick.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.020
[Music]

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.980
So I had Clay here showing us
how to do this,

00:09:50.989 --> 00:09:53.050
because he has actually
done this before.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.825
You can see he has
his own knife,

00:09:54.825 --> 00:09:57.320
and I have the one
that we've made just today.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.480
And so now,

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.220
we can just both tell
them with the target.

00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:03.202
Oh.

00:10:05.802 --> 00:10:06.922
Yeah.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.280
It poked through the plywood.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.460
Yes, what?

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.360
3, 2, 1.

00:10:18.422 --> 00:10:19.712
Oh.

00:10:21.892 --> 00:10:24.312
Oh, nice.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.909
Yeah.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.220
We're Champion knife throwers.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.100
We don't show all the takes,
we just show the last one.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.680
That's how it's done.

00:10:41.132 --> 00:10:42.062
Guys, that's it for today,

00:10:42.062 --> 00:10:43.384
but that's not all
there is to see.

00:10:43.384 --> 00:10:45.254
That box at the top will take
you to our last video.

00:10:45.254 --> 00:10:46.366
You should go check that out.

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:47.303
The other box will show you

00:10:47.303 --> 00:10:49.046
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:49.046 --> 00:10:50.805
And if you haven't subscribed
to our channel yet,

00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:52.249
just hit this bomb
to get in the club.

00:10:52.249 --> 00:10:53.894
That way, you'll never miss
out on the fun.

00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:55.197
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.320
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.300
Talk to you then.
