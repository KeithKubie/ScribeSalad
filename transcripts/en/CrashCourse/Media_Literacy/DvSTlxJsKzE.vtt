00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.740
Hey, check it out.
I just got this new phone.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.040
Well, kind of – I’m renting it for a couple
bucks a month.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.320
But really that’s part of a bundle – you
know, I’ve got my cell phone, my internet,
my cable.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.140
All one bill, which is pretty convenient.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.880
The phone is made by another company of course,
but they have this exclusive deal with the bundle people.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.640
And the bundle people have thought a deal
with the streaming service people, so now I
can stream movies all the time.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
And the streaming service I use has a deal
with my favorite TV channel, so I can watch
all my shows.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.780
And the TV people just bought my favorite
comic book franchise, so soon I’ll be swimming
in new superhero movies.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.440
And the comic book people will be raking in
the cash.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.020
Kind of, uh, complicated, no?

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.720
So many deals and bundles and acquisitions
to watch for.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.180
It makes you wonder, who runs all this stuff?

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.840
Who owns the media?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.760
Sure, maybe you’ve been keeping track of
who owns your favorite media franchises like

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.900
Star Wars (that’s Disney) or Marvel (uh,
also Disney) or Harry Potter (Warner Brothers,
but also NBC).

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.880
That way you can judge who’s going to do a great
job with your favorite storylines or totally ruin them
with the worst casting ever oh my god why.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.780
The media at large, everything from newspapers
you read to the apps on your phone, are part of a
big web of deals and partnerships and mergers.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.800
A very tangled, kind of incestuous, web.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.400
Sometimes these complex relationships work
out well for the consumer.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.570
But sometimes this tangled web traps the
consumer like a juicy little fly just waiting to be eaten by
the big bad spider.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.760
That’s why today we’re talking all about
media ownership –

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:39.080
we’re going to figure out how ownership impacts your
everyday lives AND we’re gonna talk about the history
of media ownership AND...no, that’s it for today.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.640
But that’s plenty.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.880
[Theme Music]

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.400
Ready for your head to spin a bit? So.
Who really owns “the media”?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.080
If you look at things from the end of 2017,
the media ownership landscape looks like this:

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.740
Walt Disney Company owns ABC and the Disney
Channel of course.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:12.360
Plus EPSN, Miramax and Pixar, Marvel
Entertainment and Publishing, Buena Vista Records,
and over 270 radio stations.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.180
Plus their theme parks and tons of other related
companies.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.260
Comcast Corporation owns NBCUniversal – that
means CNBC, MSNBC, too – plus channels like
Telemundo, USA Network, Bravo and more.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.160
Plus Hulu and and the Universal Studios theme
parks.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.680
They even own the Philadelphia 76ers and the
Philadelphia Flyers.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.220
News Corp. owns FOX – including Fox News
and FX.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.920
They also own the Wall Street Journal, the
Daily News and the New York Post, HarperCollins,
and 20th Century Fox.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.460
Hearst Corporation owns 20 U.S. magazines
like Cosmopolitan and Esquire, plus 31 television
stations.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:55.400
Viacom owns MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy
Central, and BET among its 160 cable channels,
plus Paramount Pictures.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:03.410
CBS Corporation owns all the CBS-named
things, 29 TV channels and 130 radio stations,
plus three book publishers.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.680
And this is all just the tip of the iceberg.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.440
I guarantee that this ownership web is already
obsolete as new deals have gone through.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.420
In fact, as we were shooting this episode,
Comcast, Disney, and Fox had all been
discussing a possible merger.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.480
But don’t worry, we prepared for that:

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.880
There was a big merger!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.540
There wasn’t a big merger!

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.340
There was something like a merger, but it
was more complicated than we predicted!

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.540
But all this talk of mergers and ownership
begs the question: who cares?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.420
You do. Or, rather, you will.
After you hear the story of AT&amp;T.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.360
The year is 1877 and Alexander Graham Bell
and his father in law start the Bell Telephone
Company.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.680
Over time, Bell becomes the dominant telephone
provider and is the first to build a nationwide
long-distance telephone network.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.360
That’s when they’re renamed: the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:56.300
For almost 100 years, AT&amp;T owns every part
of the telephone system – from the wires
and lines to the actual phones.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.540
Yes, literally.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.740
Until the mid-1980s, if you had an AT&amp;T phone,
you had to rent it from the company.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.380
Kind of like you rent a modem for your internet
now.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.570
In the early 1900’s AT&amp;T established themselves
as a walled garden.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.010
That meant it was a closed system that was
not interoperable with other systems or companies.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.600
In fact, they refused to let rival companies work
with them – they’d just buy them out instead.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.420
In 1915, for instance, they bought Western
Electric, one of the providers of their phone
equipment.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.280
Once they owned them, they made it so that
only official Western Electric equipment could
connect to the AT&amp;T network..

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.180
Jump ahead to 1934.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.150
President Franklin D. Roosevelt establishes
the Federal Communications Commission.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.330
The FCC is meant to implement a national radio
and wire service in the U.S.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.140
But the FCC also has the authority to examine
AT&amp;T’s business.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:50.210
The question was whether AT&amp;T’s control
over every part of the phone system, or vertical
integration, was in violation of the law.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.900
But the FCC approves of AT&amp;T’s business – and
the company is free to dominate the market for
decades, becoming bigger, and bigger.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.720
Eventually, though, AT&amp;T becomes too big.
Like way too big.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.560
And the anti-trust lawsuits start.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.460
Anti-trust laws are what exist to try and
prevent monopolies – when a single company
dominates an entire market or industry.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.320
Monopolies are bad in a lot of ways.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.900
A company with a monopoly can overcharge
customers or under deliver services because
there’s simply no competition.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.760
Preventing monopolies, or if you have to,
breaking them up, protects consumers and
encourages competition.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.800
And by the 1980s, more than a century after the
founding of the Bell company, those anti-monopoly
efforts finally start to make a difference.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.960
In 1982 AT&amp;T starts letting people buy their
own phones, a good first step.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.940
But in 1984, the monopoly really breaks up,
and the company separates into 7 different,
smaller companies.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:48.980
At the time, some people thought the break up of the
AT&amp;T monopoly was bad – it seemed so convenient
to get all your phone maintenance in one place.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:57.500
When it did break up, though, we got cool new inventions
like answering machines, three-way calling, and caller ID
– all thanks to an outbreak of competition.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.620
Trust me, those things were really cool back then.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.700
Today, companies try to dominate markets through
new versions of vertical integration.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.879
Think: do you have one of those bundles?

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:10.229
You might get your TV service, internet, and
cell phone service from the same company.

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.830
These companies own the world’s fiber optic
cables, where the internet flows.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:21.020
In fact, where the last 100 years of anti-trust
media has largely been about phones, these days
it has way more to do with the internet.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.660
But that’s where it gets a bit dicey.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.160
Let’s head into the Thought Bubble:

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.980
In a world with net neutrality, a corporate
stronghold on the internet isn’t too bad.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.220
You pay for internet access and you use it
pretty much however you want.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.879
The net is neutrally accessible from different
internet service providers, or ISPs.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.160
If your ISP stinks or is too slow, you can
often pay for a different service if there
are options in your area.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.220
But the ISPs believe that, since they’re
delivering you a service, they should determine
how it’s delivered.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.580
They’d like to create tiered services, where
if you pay more you get faster internet.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.680
Basically, they want to use their vertical
integration to create more monopolies.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.940
Imagine the internet is a road and the content
you want is a car.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.080
ISPs would like to create a slow lane and
a fast lane.

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.460
Or maybe a slow, medium, and fast lane.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.210
Depending on what you want or can afford,
you’d pay for that speed.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:13.640
If ISPs could decide to create a slow lane
and a fast lane, you can see how they could
abuse that power pretty quickly.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.599
We wouldn’t get a fast lane and a faster
lane.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:23.980
We’d get a “so slow you want to smash your
computer on the ground” lane and a “probably the
speeds you have now but twice as expensive” lane.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:31.020
As we know, internet access is crucial to
thriving in the digital age, and hiking up prices
would box some people out entirely.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:38.400
Or, to put it more graphically, some people would be
in the lifeboats and some people would be Jack and
Rose, floating on a door in the middle of the ocean.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.900
Until Jack freezes to death even though he
TOTALLY could have fit on the door.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.900
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
I guess.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.020
There are more consequences to net neutrality
than consumer pricing.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:55.120
Without net neutrality, ISPs have the power to cut
off or speed up certain content – like, say, their
business partners or their sister companies.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.920
Certain cars wouldn’t even be allowed in
the slow lane – you’d have to pay extra.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:06.240
So if you have Comcast as your ISP, your Comcast,
NBC and Universal content might be fast but
other content might be slow.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:13.420
Comcast owns Hulu, and Netflix is a competitor
of Hulu, so who knows, maybe they’d slow down
your service to Netflix – the horror!

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:18.840
In some countries without net neutrality, ISPs
have already created walled gardens like this.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:26.680
You pay a base fee for internet service and then pay
additional fees for a “Social media” package to access
your apps or a “news package” to get your news.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
It’s not pretty.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.430
You can see why it’s so important to understand
how media companies are all connected.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.440
When they come together to form monopolies,
they can have a huge impact on how a society
communicates.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.040
We know that media companies like to band
together through mergers and acquisitions.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.380
Sometimes this forms healthy competition and
sometimes, like we said, it creates a monopoly.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.370
But telecommunications and media have been
regulated and studied for some time.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:54.020
You know what also like to band together through
mergers and acquisitions, sometimes for competition
and sometimes to form monopolies?

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.200
Tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.820
These monster corporations have their hands
on a ton of different projects.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.960
Alphabet is Google’s parent company.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.360
Google isn’t just a search engine; it’s
also an advertising platform.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.440
Alphabet owns YouTube and over 200 other companies.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.540
Plus they make products like Android phones
and Gmail and self-driving cars.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.260
And through search and Google News they’ve
become a major distributor of media.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:23.340
Amazon, in addition to being a dominant e-commerce
platform, provides the internet infrastructure for tons
of top companies.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.220
It also creates its own TV and movie programming
through Prime and owns The Washington Post.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.360
Similarly, Facebook owns over 50 companies
like Instagram and Whatsapp.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.820
It recently partnered with news outlets to help
with media distribution through its Journalism
Project and its Instant Articles product.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:42.340
They’re even dipping their toes in creating
original video programming.

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.380
Plus, 45% of US adults get their news from
Facebook. Forty. Five. Percent.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.580
And yet they don’t call themselves a media company.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.920
What’s the big deal?

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:56.960
Well: currently, Tech companies aren’t regulated
the same way that media companies are.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.160
Remember the FCC?

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:06.100
They regulate media companies not only to break
up monopolies – they also set rules for what kind of
content is allowed on TV, radio, and phones.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.240
Different rules for different technologies.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.860
This is why some songs have “radio edits” and
why you have to bleep out the live TV when the
Thanksgiving Parade hosts get too tipsy.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.840
But the FCC doesn't currently have the same
authority over companies like Facebook or
Google –

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.320
which means there is tons and tons
of debate over whether they should.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.660
Media ownership can be problematic enough.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.640
When one company dominates the means of
production and creation on one product, consumers
often get a lesser product.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.100
Without competition, innovation stagnates.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.140
And when companies have too much control,
they can wreak havoc on our communication
and culture.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:45.960
When tech companies that are also media
companies don’t act like it, they shirk the accountability
that other media organizations have.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.920
The accountability that we, as consumers rely
on.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.440
Anti-trust regulations have their drawbacks.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.120
People who prefer less government intervention
don’t like them.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.380
The Monopoly man certainly doesn’t like
them.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.260
But they’re often in the public’s best interest
to prevent exploitation and encourage creativity.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:07.260
To be a media literate citizen, it’s crucial to
keep an eye on how these businesses combine,
split up, and interact.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.140
Their relationships with each other affect
our relationships with media.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:17.400
Today we covered how huge corporations and
their regulations impact our media environment
– the macro stuff.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.660
Next time on Crash Course: Media Literacy,
we’re going micro.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:26.140
We’ll take a look at how government policies impact
how you, the consumer, absorb and create media.

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.600
Until then, I’m Jay Smooth.
See you next time!

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.720
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula, MT.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.600
It’s made with the help of all of these nice
people, and our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.520
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.870
