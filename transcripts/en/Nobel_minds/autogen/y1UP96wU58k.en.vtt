hello we're from st. Rose and I'm a
grandmother you know and Shannon you

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770
grandmother you know and Shannon you

and we have a question for you dr. John

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799
and we have a question for you dr. John
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.580
and we have a question for you dr. John
that day as an astrophysicist do you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
that day as an astrophysicist do you
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.259
that day as an astrophysicist do you
think of applying existence in the dark

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
think of applying existence in the dark
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.240
think of applying existence in the dark
regions of our solar system in a couple

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
regions of our solar system in a couple
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.910
regions of our solar system in a couple
of Oh hi Gregory and Shannon you're

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
of Oh hi Gregory and Shannon you're
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.470
of Oh hi Gregory and Shannon you're
asking about are there more planets out

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
asking about are there more planets out
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.349
asking about are there more planets out
there in the outer solar system I think

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359
there in the outer solar system I think
 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.900
there in the outer solar system I think
so of course people are looking we've

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
so of course people are looking we've
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.179
so of course people are looking we've
known about the classical planets for a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
known about the classical planets for a
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.970
known about the classical planets for a
long time we've demoted to Pluto from

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
long time we've demoted to Pluto from
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.669
long time we've demoted to Pluto from
Planet status to being a dwarf planet

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679
Planet status to being a dwarf planet
 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.290
Planet status to being a dwarf planet
but we've already discovered other dwarf

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
but we've already discovered other dwarf
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030
but we've already discovered other dwarf
planets farther out in the solar system

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
planets farther out in the solar system
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530
planets farther out in the solar system
that are even bigger than Pluto

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
that are even bigger than Pluto
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.229
that are even bigger than Pluto
so calculation says there are thousands

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
so calculation says there are thousands
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.450
so calculation says there are thousands
of them out there and possibly we'll

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
of them out there and possibly we'll
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.819
of them out there and possibly we'll
find them we're certainly turning them

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
find them we're certainly turning them
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.520
find them we're certainly turning them
up occasionally and bigger telescopes

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530
up occasionally and bigger telescopes
 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.729
up occasionally and bigger telescopes
that can observe the most distant stars

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739
that can observe the most distant stars
 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.220
that can observe the most distant stars
in the universe can also discover the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
in the universe can also discover the
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.660
in the universe can also discover the
most distant planets in the solar system

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
most distant planets in the solar system
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790
most distant planets in the solar system
we think they're going to be all dwarf

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
we think they're going to be all dwarf
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.250
we think they're going to be all dwarf
planets but I think maybe you're asking

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
planets but I think maybe you're asking
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020
planets but I think maybe you're asking
is there another big planet like Jupiter

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
is there another big planet like Jupiter
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.540
is there another big planet like Jupiter
or Saturn out there and chances are no

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
or Saturn out there and chances are no
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.579
or Saturn out there and chances are no
but we do have to go look and see

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
but we do have to go look and see
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.100
but we do have to go look and see
so there is a mission about to be

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
so there is a mission about to be
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800
so there is a mission about to be
launched called the wise mission and the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
launched called the wise mission and the
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.990
launched called the wise mission and the
wise mission is a wide field Infrared

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
wise mission is a wide field Infrared
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510
wise mission is a wide field Infrared
Survey Explorer satellite if there's a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
Survey Explorer satellite if there's a
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.130
Survey Explorer satellite if there's a
planet out there that's bright like

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
planet out there that's bright like
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050
planet out there that's bright like
Jupiter but we just never happen to have

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060
Jupiter but we just never happen to have
 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.359
Jupiter but we just never happen to have
turned it up this mission would probably

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
turned it up this mission would probably
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.880
turned it up this mission would probably
discover it
