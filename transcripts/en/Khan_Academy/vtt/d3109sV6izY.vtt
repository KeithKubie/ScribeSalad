00:00:00.412 --> 00:00:01.769
- [Voiceover] So I have two numbers here

00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:02.966
that I wanna add together.

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:05.983
The first number is 327,

00:00:05.983 --> 00:00:08.667
and that means three hundreds,

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.589
I have a three in the hundreds place.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.180
You see them right over here.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.629
You see the three hundreds,

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.283
each of these big squares have a hundred

00:00:20.283 --> 00:00:22.720
little squares in 'em, so three of them

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.930
is going to be three hundreds.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.704
And then I have two tens.

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:28.780
Two tens, the two is in the tens place,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.521
so this is the two tens right over here.

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:33.390
And then I have seven ones.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.385
The seven is in the ones place.

00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:39.890
Seven is in

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.644
the ones place, and you see the seven ones.

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.745
Seven ones, right over there.

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:45.650
Now, this is three hundreds, two tens,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.506
and seven ones, or 327.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.455
Now, to that, I wanna add 251,

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:53.940
or another way of thinking about it as

00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:56.692
I wanna add two hundreds, because the two

00:00:56.692 --> 00:01:00.462
is in the hundreds place, two hundreds.

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:02.185
Two hundreds.

00:01:02.185 --> 00:01:04.528
One hundred, two hundred.

00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:07.309
50 is the same thing as five tens,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.549
we see a five in the tens place.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.904
Five, let me do that same color.

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:16.354
Five tens, right over here.

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:17.950
One ten, two tens, three tens,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.672
four tens, five tens.

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:22.164
And then finally, I have a one in the ones place,

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:24.182
so that just means one one.

00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:26.433
You see that right over there.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.257
This is one.

00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:30.777
One one.

00:01:30.777 --> 00:01:32.733
Now, pause the video,

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:36.185
and see if you could add these two numbers together.

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:37.962
All right, now let's do it together.

00:01:37.962 --> 00:01:41.666
So we have seven ones, and to that we're going

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:46.176
to add one one, so how many ones is that going to be?

00:01:46.177 --> 00:01:48.929
Well, seven ones plus one one,

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:50.765
is going to be eight ones.

00:01:50.765 --> 00:01:53.270
You see here, seven, and then you have an eighth one.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.762
So eight ones, seven plus one is eight.

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:58.435
Now let's look at the tens.

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:00.753
I had two tens, and I'm gonna add

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.849
five more tens, you put 'em all together,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:07.252
you're going to have seven tens.

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.132
Two tens plus five tens, you're going

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:12.910
to have seven tens.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.669
And then, finally,

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.642
if you have three hundreds and you add two more hundreds,

00:02:16.642 --> 00:02:18.709
how many hundreds are you going to have?

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.671
Well, you're going to have five hundreds.

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.989
You see these five groups of a hundred right over here.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.882
So you're gonna put a five in the hundreds place.

00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:30.132
So 327 plus 251

00:02:30.132 --> 00:02:32.502
is 578.

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:35.720
Five hundreds, seven tens,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.522
and eight ones.
