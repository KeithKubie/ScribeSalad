00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.719
 urban beekeepers i'm the most 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.710
 happy men because my office 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.290
 it's a roof the sky of paris and 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.030

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.030
 [Music] 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.070
 I am a stressed anxious a 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.900
 hyperactive on a hive you can only 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.310
 not be anxious and stressed because 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.150
 what do you feel it makes you sting you 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.000
 does a bad job 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.190
 so in fact it's the best at 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.420
 relaxing I've never found it's from 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.630
 work the bees because that's me 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.920
 force to be focus focused and 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.920
 to forget the sweet sweet bise time 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.890
 I did not start only bees 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.170
 I am originally from Paris but my 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.340
 parents have a champagne house and 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.850
 and then I was every weekend I 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.440
 started planting radish salads 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.110
 tomatoes then I said to myself bah he 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.339
 need a hive what and then there it was 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.470
 more complicated because my father is 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:13.520
 allergic we are looking for roofs 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.869
 who take relatively the sun and 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.670
 then simply we are happy to 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.200
 produce honey for our guests 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.240
 I started in Paris to the disabled 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.060
 then was the military school the museum 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.630
 d'orsay then here the blue cordon etc 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.490
 etc. 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:31.010
 the story is written every day on 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.890
 works with bees according to their 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.939
 pace 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.149
 [Music] 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:44.670
 so I chnique dressed you congratulate 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:47.310
 80% of the plants on this planet depends 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.259
 for their survival their reproduction of 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 pollinators 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 it's bees doing this work 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.380
 almost free for a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.439
 thirty years one realizes that one loses 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 more and more our with the greens because 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.700
 that you have to know is that the town hall of 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.619
 Paris 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.500
 treats green spaces in organic since 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.759
 twenty years the goal is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.390
 really to have an ultra production 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.560
 local paris to these micro honey climate 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.790
 it is extraordinary to open a hive 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.739
 it's really exciting because 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.459
 you have some kind of comparing it's a 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.620
 mackerel organism that will act with a 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.349
 collective intelligence 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.870
 she will make decisions and what 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.239
 is great that we can compare the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 hive to a small business where every 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.250
 bee will make career 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.980
 throughout his life as needed 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.010
 of the common good is in fact a society 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.950
 perfect and I fell in love with 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.600
 my daughters 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:51.239
 this for the world I will do another 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.100
 profession like me I hope modestly I 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.600
 want to inspire people with beauty 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.940
 love of the beauty of monuments 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.590
 the love of the mom of paris but 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.359
 the love of taste transmitted by the palate 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.780
 I will talk about aesthetics of taste in 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.780
