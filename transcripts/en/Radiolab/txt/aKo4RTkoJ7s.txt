Speaker 1:          00:00          Talking about escape stories about people being trapped and them getting out, getting free. And in our last segment week met a guy for whom will the escape itself became a trap. But now we're going to take our escape Motif to a much bigger scale. Yet we're calling this, by the way, we are the limit because in this one we're going to the outer limits of the human imagination began for us when we spoke with this writer. Yes, I hear you. Boom. Here and Dole Nick is his name and he told us a story about, so this is Isaac Newton's story for the most part. And it's a story that involves the Earth, the heavens, God, humanity. And you might as well throw on the apple. Um, the one thing everybody knows about Newton is that an apple fell from a tree and bonked him on the head, which isn't true.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I was told, right, that isn't an apocryphal, it's probably not true. But, but it's a story that Newton himself told. Oh really? Cause Newton, according to Ed all his life had this notion that he was different from other people. Uh, not only different from but, but better. Uh, he had a pipeline to God. God was whispering secrets, the secrets of creation into his ear. Uh, no one else had been blessed in this way. Other people's role in life was simply to, uh, to bog him down. Not what I would call the modest guy. No, but identity rate, what our story begins around 1665, Newton is at Cambridge. She's a student in Cambridge, is hit by the plague. They send everybody home because although nobody understands how the disease works, they know that if people are crowded together, they tend to, uh, to all get it. So, so everybody go your separate ways.

Speaker 1:          01:33          This was a kind of an enforced summer vacation, right? And He's like 19 or 20 at this point. 2122. Okay. Newton goes home to his mother's farm. Mom's like, cool, now you can help me on the farm. But he says, no, because he has a plan. He'd brought some books home, a bunch of of textbooks and he locks himself in his room and sets himself not only to having mastered all the science that had ever been done, but two plunging on ahead of everyone else on his own, motivated by this religious faith that everything in the universe was set up by a god who wanted someone to crack the code. Newton believes he's the one in the same as he doing in his room. I mean, was he just sitting there and like with a thousand giant textbooks, all that's known is that he did this. He just went into his room and came out with what we're about. So he came out with, with the how gravity works, how light works, how rainbows work, how the tides work. And then having done all summer, he did all this. What did you do on your summer vacation jet? I know Mike, my summer I, um, I learned how to fold sheets like Marines do, which I thought was pretty good too.

Speaker 1:          02:40          So after having one flash of insight after another, Newton now sets his mind to one of the great problems of all time, which for our purposes we will call the problem of the moon. And just to set this up, what everybody before [inaudible] Galileo thought is there were a bunch of ordinary things here on earth like rocks and they behave in the ordinary way that we know, you know, pick up a rock, let go it faults, and there are a bunch of much more different mysterious, elegant, perfect things in the sky like the moon, which doesn't fall, it just flutes there. So one could conclude that the moon has its own separate set of laws. There are one set of laws that work here on earth and another set that work in the heavens. And there's no reason it should be the same set of laws any more than New York's laws should be the same as as Paris's laws. Can it make sense? Actually? Heavenly things float earthly things fall. But then here's where the problem begins. Newton and a bunch of people at that time had gotten a hold of this new fangled thing called telescope. And one of the things they saw was that the moon wasn't this mysterious, a heavenly body that they seem, it was a big rock, irregular, lumpy potato wish rock.

Speaker 2:          03:48          Oh. People were like, Huh,

Speaker 1:          03:53          but Newton being of course Newton. But now wait a second. If the job of a is to fall, and if the moon is just another rock, why doesn't it fall down? Exactly. So what's it doing sitting up there night after night?

Speaker 2:          04:07          Whoa.

Speaker 1:          04:09          And it's at this point that Newton sitting in his room or wherever he was, we can imagine, makes a crazy mental leap. He thought back to a little thought experiment that Galileo had come up with, which initially might not make much sense the connection, but it pays off. And here's the setup. You've got someone standing in a big field with a gun that he's about to shoot it, and next to that person with his gun is a person holding in his hand a bullet. So you've got a person holding a gun and a person holding just the bullet side by side and the bullet in the hand and the bullet in the gun are exactly the same height above the ground and now somebody says, ready, aim, fire. And at the instant he says fire the man with the gun, shoots that bullet horizontally. And at that same instant, the man next to him holding the bullet in his hand opens his hand and the bullet trucks. So there's one bullet zipping along, mn falling. And then there's another one that just falls, right? We shoot the bullet out of the horizontal gun and we dropped the bullet from right decks to the guy at the same time. Yes, both bullets will hit the ground eventually, but when they do, they'll be far apart. And Galileo's riddle was, which of those bullets hits the

Speaker 3:          05:18          ground first? Well, I mean everybody would know that the one that would hit the gun first and the one that you just dropped because the other one has to go all that. This is, this is, this is a hard drill. And the answer is why is it such a hard riddle? Because I would think that the bullet you drop is just gonna hit first. The gun's got to go all the way. No, those two bullets

Speaker 1:          05:39          both hit the ground at the exact same instant. Really that's, that's an experimental fact. The bullet from the gun and the bullet from things lands at the same time. Yes. This bullet that shot horizontally, it doesn't go like Wiley Coyote running off a cliff. It doesn't go straight through it. Straight, straight, and then fall. It's curving as it goes. And the thing that causes it to curve as it goes of course, is gravity. It's the same gravity that is pulling the bullet that you drop. Same gravity, same pole, same speed. So counterintuitively, when you drop a bullet and it falls for this long, when you fire the gun, it'll also fall for that long, even though ends up a mile away.

Speaker 1:          06:24          See that was Galloway was riddle and that's as far as Galileo took it. Yeah. Newton looked at that and he said something smart. First thing he said is, okay, this field, let's not pretend that this is some perfectly flat field that goes on forever. No, we're on the earth and the earth is round. And what roundness means is that the ground curves away below horizontal. So really what's happening is it has the bullet is shooting across the field and falling to the earth. The Earth at the same time is very gradually curving away from it. Now of course, most guns, you know, they don't shoot the bullet very far and at that short distance, the field is still pretty much flat. But here's what Newton thought. What if you could find just the right gun that could shoot that bullet, not just across the field but across like thousands of miles. And what if as it falls, that bullet curves down towards the earth in just the same way as the earth is curving away from it. In this scenario, the bullet that we've shot, we'll keep falling and falling and falling, but the earth keeps falling and falling and falling away from the bullet. So the bullet falls forever. The earth curves forever. The picture never changes. So the bullet then does what the pulpit, he's in orbit

Speaker 4:          07:45          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:45          hundreds of years before Sputnik and other satellites. Newton has invented the satellite. And on top of that he said when we see rocks like the moon that are not falling, the reason we think they're not falling is because we misunderstand really just as the gun launched a bullet on earth and it goes in never falls. God who was presumably a terrifically strong picture launched the moon around the earth at just such a rate that that would continue in its circle around us forever. This is a perpetual dance. The partners are bound together but they never come close and they never break up either. It's this endless round, round round

Speaker 3:          08:36          from which there is no the scheme. What this does, what Newton did is take the moon out of the domain of, of, of poets and, and, and, uh, musicians, the, the golden or in this kind of thing and last Sobek to the same that we use here on earth. In other words, what he showed is that in a very real way, there's no separation between the US and the heavens. The same set of laws does govern everything. It's one universe and I've explained it all.

Speaker 4:          09:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          09:15          once you figured out the laws of gravitation, then you can send spacecraft to Mars, Jupiter,

Speaker 6:          09:23          Saturn, anywhere out there.

Speaker 5:          09:29          If you're a radio lab listener from way back, you might recognize that voice that's an [inaudible]. Hi. One of the first stories we did actually I interviewed her about working on the famous uh, golden record. You remember this? Sure. So the idea at the time was to put this record on the voyager capsule, send it in the space, and on the record would be all of these sounds that represented, you know, us kiss a mother's first word.

Speaker 4:          09:53          It's your newborn baby. Come on. Now.

Speaker 5:          10:00          In any case, Ann was the one who was in charge of choosing all the sounds to put onto that record. She and Carl Sagan work together on that project. And here's the thing, we stopped our story as the rockets took off, but obviously that was just the beginning of the story and the voyager capsules right now

Speaker 6:          10:18          or about to make the kind of escape that Newton could have only dreamed of. Okay. It's the record thing. And, uh, our producer loom levy has been, sorry, I just turned my headphones up way too loud. I've been following this story. Ah, AH, oh yeah, yeah. Just turn it down. Yeah. Okay. So it can pick it up. Where we, uh, left. Okay. So like in the point of the mission wasn't really to deliver this record, it was to go out and look at all the planets in the outer solar system. So starting in 1977, these two little spaceships, two spacecraft, voyager one and two went racing away from Earth snapping pictures.

Speaker 5:          10:53          And so every time before [inaudible] would reach another planet, you know, all of the voyager people would get together, go into the imaging room

Speaker 6:          11:01          and see the pictures come from the outer solar system. Do you remember seeing them? I remember as a child saying life magazine, you know, I was seven when [inaudible] was launched. So this is [inaudible] professor at Boston University. As a grown up, she became part of the voyager team. All the pictures that, you know, as a kid, you look at the books and to see what, how Knapton look how Jupiter look.

Speaker 5:          11:26          No, just a complete revelations. Sat to the image of Saturn technique, color like pink and look, reddish, turquoise, color yellow. And those rings just spectacular. They could see active volcanoes on one of the moons of Jupiter. Finally, that vision of Neptune, this like blue jewel,

Speaker 6:          11:48          really blue, it's all came from voyager. We had no idea how they look like before wager. Neptune was the last big cool planet and it was the last thing they were supposed to photograph. After that the cameras were going to be shut off till save energy, but Kelsey and convinced them to turn voyager back to earth and take a final picture. So on Valentine's Day, 1990, uh, one of the ships slowly rotated so it was facing back to earth

Speaker 7:          12:19          and

Speaker 6:          12:23          it snapped a picture. One last picture. Describe it. So it's mostly empty. Um, it's, it's pretty dark. You can see sort of streaks of light coming from the sun

Speaker 5:          12:39          and then you honestly wouldn't notice it if it wasn't pointed out to you. But down in one corner, kind of a suspended in a Sunbeam, there is a very small dot. Blew a pale blue dot that with us in Carl sagans words, everyone you ever knew, everyone you ever loved, every superstar, every corrupt politician, just everyone in all of history, everything is some total op Rod. Think of the rivers of blind so that one indistinguishable group could have momentary domination over a fraction of that pixel. It was one of those really rare it images every single day. I hear from people who take that Pale blue.so deeply to heart and was it, it was a complete reframing after that because I was with tone-deaf,

Speaker 7:          13:38          but here's the thing.

Speaker 6:          13:40          The ships kept going, going, going, going, drifting through the darkness,

Speaker 5:          13:46          going, going, going, even though they weren't taking pictures anymore that they were using like their other senses, little instruments that detect like how many particles are around, what the temperature is. So they were hurdling through this empty space really fast, measuring, sending that data back and scientists like that off where they're listening and waiting for what was not clear, but they knew at some point these capsules would get to the edge, the edge of what? The solar system, the solar system has an edge. I thought it was just a big spiral. Has an edge. It's, it's like a bubble. C The Sun has a wind.

Speaker 5:          14:25          If we start has a wing, but the sun has its own wind, it blows out through the solar system. It's very fast. It can be between 400 to 800 kilometers per second anyway. It blows out from the sun past all the planets and uh, it keeps everything else out. Oh, so it's like blowing up a balloon. Yeah, exactly. The wind gives it a shape, right? So these little things are cruising out towards this edge, wherever it is. Scientists don't quite know where it is or what it is. The guys in the control room are like pinging the ships. Like, Hey, what's, what's up? What do you see in the ships are like nothing. How about now? Not much, no. Nothing. And how long before they actually see something? 14 years. Oh Man. It's like driving through Kansas but like a million times worse. But

Speaker 6:          15:12          there comes a day I end of 2004 where they stopped listening for a little while because the antenna, NASA only has so many antennas and they have to use them to listen to everything. So for a little while the voyager teams like, okay, you guys over there can use the antennas. We're going to lunch. Yeah. I mean it's not like anything's happened. Nothing's happening anyway. It's been 14 goddamn years. Yeah guys, it's cool. And they come back a few hours later, start listening again and it's happened. Very southern. Everything is totally changed. Really. All of a sudden, boom. The speed of the wind dropped from around three 80 kilometers per second to 100 instantly. Like just all in one sentence. And then everything out there started to get messy.

Speaker 4:          15:58          Top on [inaudible] much more top on land. And before particles are also, um, behaving a very different way. And the fields are very, um, we are

Speaker 5:          16:18          the fields, the magnetic field. So just like the sun has a wind, the sun has a magnetic field as well. The field starts at the sun and then curves out in this kind of graceful arc through the solar system in the how the subtle tates create what people call [inaudible] cart. You know how like a skirt will flair a few spin around real fast. [inaudible] that's apparently kind of what this field looks like. But way out there, it seemed like the skirt had started to fray, maybe tear a little threads, had broken off and seem to be floating around on their own. Not connected to anything. So what does this all mean? I mean, if the fields are breaking down and the wind is dying down and you said the wind is what actually creates the space of the solar system, does this mean we're out to know?

Speaker 6:          17:06          I kind of thought that was what was happening, but no, it's not out. And it's not quite in, it's in the edge of the bubble. It's in the air. Yeah. But it's not like, I'm not like a little thin edge. It's a, it's a thick, thick edge. So the edge isn't just a little line that you cross. It's a place.

Speaker 5:          17:25          Yeah. And while we listened the two voyager ships moved through this edge for several years. Then something very interesting happen, um, is that the wind on virtual one

Speaker 6:          17:42          stopped like completely stopped. Yeah. So now we're out. No, no. I mean this is what people thought, but there are other measurements like temperature and number of particles. The magnetic field doesn't tell us that we are out of the bubble. Nature surprised us again. So now we think there's a place at the edge of our solar system. Why didn't they edge the edge of the edge? That's utterly still no wind at all. A pause. People are Connie stagnation layer and there is a big discussion why this layer exist and how thick it is and by how thick it is, she means when will it end? Because once we get past this. So has anything ever crossed the boundary before? No. This would be the first man made object to live any star. And a voyager has like right there smelling, touching that boundary. You know, you only do those things first. Once like your first kiss, your first tasted alcohol, your first time driving a car, the first time you see the ocean

Speaker 8:          18:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          18:52          these things open up a whole new world. First time out of the solar system.

Speaker 8:          18:59          Aw.

Speaker 6:          18:59          So when is it going to freaking happen? It might have happened while we were talking. Yeah. We're thinking from now. Any moment now. Next couple of months or three years from now, four years from now. It's close. Everyday opened my Google alert for voyager and I look and see did it happen today? [inaudible] if it happens before the show goes out, I'm really pissed. Yeah. Every day. That's the first thing you do in the morning. Oh, alright. Like the third thing.
