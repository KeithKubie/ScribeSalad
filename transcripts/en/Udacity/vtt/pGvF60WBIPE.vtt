00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.930
So these x,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.020
y values retrieved put in your T
chart can be represented on a graph.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.890
And what I want you to do is tell me

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.970
which of the following
graphs is correct.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.560
Is it this or that one,
maybe it's that one or that.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.460
Choose the best answer.
