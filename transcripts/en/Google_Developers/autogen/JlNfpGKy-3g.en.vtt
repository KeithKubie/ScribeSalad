00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hmm 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:17.630
 Today I am google developer-rated Suzuki 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:21.080
 Today, we are having a visit to Mr. Keisuke Ohashi of humanity of gd google apps api 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:27.620
 I hope to talk to you in various ways. 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:29.590
 Even though I'm holding a chan, I'm introducing myself. 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.550
 Google Apps Script is 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:37.280
 Of course after 3 years and 4 years 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:42.800
 And because I touch the app in my company there 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.300
 Write a script to streamline your company's various tasks, and so on 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.350
 Oh 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.719
 8 I like that up split 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.579
 What to send updates to Japanese people as quickly as one second 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.730
 You're doing it on Google+ 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.479
 I think that it was the year that was started three years ago, but it is the way to start three years ago 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.159
 I wonder if 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:12.789
 The same google developer Expert Mr. Tatsumi 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:18.579
 I started study session of study session aps script just around that time and I was already full for the second time of the fifth time 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:20.300
 I have been participating since the second time, so it's amazing there 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.440
 I thought it could be used 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.970
 Did you continue doing it after that? 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.930
 When I thought that it was usable, I tried to make something first when I stab it 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.520
 Being 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:40.470
 Overwintering is what I try to make in company management 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.180
 This company emails state law to all employees once a week, so the company size is around 200 people 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 Because 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:53.730
 It's very difficult to figure out who's out and who's out 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.900
 So I have 20 people in my class that I have nobody out who is out 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.040
 About 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.460
 I would like to check very much who is out there on the scale 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.900
 I went to work every week, but it 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.929
 At first it was very exciting because it was excel at first. 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:15.230
 Turn it all into a spreadsheet 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.230
 Automatically collect emails using google apis tape 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 It is the first time that you write a script that automatically checks 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:30.500
 From then on, it is said that the person is a lot of continuous work and the public is a little depravity of that child 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.560
 It is almost already said that it is written by that up script 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.120
 Well 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.900
 If you do it in your own hands 10 minutes or more like 5 minutes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.230
 But I think it would be awful stress to do it every week 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.280
 Maybe a lot of people 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.930
 I do not feel even stress 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:55.380
 It's a tiny job, something like routine work 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.640
 If it is true if it can be zero 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:05.690
 In fact, you can make time to continue with other work 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.980
 I'm still thinking that there is a bus flip attraction so much over there 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.220
 Is 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.879
 Speaking of grandma, maybe the best in that community 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.230
 I think that one who is in line numbering immediately but 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:21.950
 It's pretty much right now that the benefits are so many various engines and sweet bites t 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.980
 I think that it will be posted or some question will come but what 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.280
 Hano 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.150
 Do you think that it is an app or something that can be used effectively effectively? 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.720
 Yes yes 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:38.980
 The part where Higashi Aso can be used seems like I entered earlier 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.040
 Really do 5 minutes or 1 minute every day 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.400
 I have to do it 100 times a day for 101 days 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.270
 I really do not feel as stress in myself 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:56.330
 It's kind of annoying, I think it's hard to do today 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:58.640
 Even small repetitive tasks are getting worse and worse 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.690
 That kind of thing is most suitable for you 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.940
 I think it is a part that is facing 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:11.980
 For example, though it is in the community's name list in the community 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:15.940
 Well, I have never actually attended a study session at that event 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.170
 I haven't posted a question yet, I saw some advice for those people 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.130
 Do you 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.709
 First of all, if it is Google Plus 8 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.720
 hashtag 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.350
 In sharp 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.200
 Gasman gaas ah 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.830
 I would like to go if you can post it to me 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.870
 Ah 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.960
 Gd's niece or something 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.160
 I'm looking to Meiji, so it's overwintering 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.660
 Oh dear 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.500
 Suddenly send e-mail to two people or 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.180
 I think it's a great pain to ask questions in the community, but when you're first 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.610
 I'm thrilled 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:58.720
 It seems like you can't cheat with a hash and you can't do this. 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:03.650
 I thought it would be good if I could start by saying something from the beginning 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:09.220
 How much it lowers the cost of dedicating the hard of that post so much 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:16.270
 That's right, so we can catch up with such things as much as possible 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:20.860
 I'm trying to look at it, so if it's cut off that's all connected from that place 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.540
 I think there are probably many things that I can not solve, but I bother together 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.860
 That's all right 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.910
 There's no way I can't do it like I'm troubled with that together 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:36.260
 It's not 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:43.220
 It's the best to connect and talk, it's great if it's your first day 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:44.540
 It may be possible to shorten the time to make it 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:49.100
 Use only or 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.850
 If it comes out that a bullet comes out and it should be said that I will throw it to of unity 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.840
 I think 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:56.280
 Case blue is really cool in the real car 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.970
 I think that the correspondence is properly and carefully 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.380
 I think that you have answered the earthquake-resistant diagnosis to Kita Petit and was there 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.280
 Good place 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:10.200
 Please do something with fill up script 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:17.130
 Is it difficult in the body or something that can be done or the connection between a real side man and a person there is one 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:19.670
 If you say that it is the connection of the people of another one, I try to sample script as possible 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:24.650
 I like to write 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:29.780
 Be sure to see if you ask questions so that you can see the other party 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.720
 I am conscious and I do not want to automate there in my alma mater 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:36.290
 It is overwintering what we had everyone give out by all means 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:42.500
 Well make a sample app within the range you can answer 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:45.240
 Well, if you can't do that, you'll get something that bothers you together 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.539
 To say that the trouble is solved 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:56.610
 I would like to do something in shape, not gas 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:07:01.560
 Also I think that you can do something like automatic response in the work of the second 2 with gas 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:06.030
 In the end, I am a person who studied gas from now 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.409
 If you just get a message from someone interested in just watching this broadcast 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.430
 I'm glad but how 

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:14.409
 It is me or some other people 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:19.499
 That kind of event that gd Nao-san or something is doing 

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:19.499
 I think it's one thing to have you come first 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:31.030
 Even if you just follow us on the gd site, that's almost daily 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:34.599
 As we are talking about Google Up Pretty Cure, look at such information 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:38.710
 First of all I know that I can do something like this that I'm interested in 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:43.450
 I think that it is the first step 1 of getting 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:46.080
 If you are interested and have time, of course you will come to the event 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:51.870
 Naa like writing a bowler 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:54.270
 The article called Grappl script which starts in 5 minutes is suitable, so please have a look 

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.790
 Do it 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:01.440
 Something deep now 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:04.980
 I think if you can put it in the direction of efficiency of your own work of grappl script 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:09.960
 Well then that's why everyone said that would start in that 5 minutes 

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:13.820
 I'm on a blog site like that in the Wing Perth community 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:19.430
 I think I can see it by all means because I am writing 

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:20.480
 Today, I would like to hear Mr. Keisuke Hashi, who is gd of Google Apps, listen to various stories 

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.550
 I have 

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.550
 Thank you very much thank you very much
