00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:01.490
- [Narrator] How have
congressional elections

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.650
changed over time?

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.730
- Congressional elections
used to be separate

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.140
from the presidential elections.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.640
One of the great examples is in 1938,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.750
FDR, who we all look back and think of

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.530
as a president who had
such extraordinary power

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.880
and who could do no wrong,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.000
well in 1938 he tried to see if he could

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.510
exercise that power.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.090
So he tried to kick some Democrats

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.030
out of the Democratic Party
who didn't agree with him

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.060
and he was spectacularly unsuccessful.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.470
Lots and lots of the Democrats

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.307
he put his finger on and
told his fellow Democrats,

00:00:33.307 --> 00:00:35.250
"You vote for my man,"

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.230
and they lost.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.550
Other Democrats won

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.800
and that gives you a sense
of how the president,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.550
even a popular and successful one,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.990
was very separate from his own party.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.840
Well, what's happened since then

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.990
is that presidents have started
to have much more control

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.520
over the members of their own party

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.700
and voters, who in 1938,
thought it was outrageous

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.960
that a president would force Democrats

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.760
of his own party to vote
the way he wanted them to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.810
because they saw such a separation between

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.490
the Presidency and the Congress.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.700
Those voters don't exist much any more.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.570
Voters now pay a, penalize,
a member of a party

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.650
who doesn't stick with their president

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.180
of that same party.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.690
So that connectedness
tends to create a situation

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.950
in which congressional
elections in the midterms

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.050
tend to be a referendum on the president

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.380
even though the president's
not on the ballot.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.980
What's also the other big
change in American politics

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.180
is the amount of money.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.770
In 2018 it's very likely that according to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.240
the Center for Responsive Politics

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.460
five billion dollars will
be spent on the election.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.435
10 years ago, in the election of 2008,

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:42.760
spending was half that.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.930
2.5 billion dollars and
that was a presidential year

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.610
in which there's more spending.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.610
The enormous amount of money
means you have more ads,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.040
you means you have a whole group of people

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.150
who's job it is to make decisions

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.710
that are subtle and
complicated and complex

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.710
seem easy and to intensify
the partisan battles

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.530
between each other.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.540
And that also creates a situation in which

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.660
candidates are always running for office

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.450
because they're always
having to raise the money

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.130
to pay for all of those ads,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.250
and all of those experts,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.360
and all of those social media campaigns.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.700
Speaking of social media,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.610
we now have an instance in which you have

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.202
real time up or down
votes from constituents

00:02:21.202 --> 00:02:23.000
and people on the sidelines

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.120
telling members of
Congress whether they're

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.100
doing the right thing or
doing the wrong thing,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.020
either in office or in elections,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.800
and that creates a real time
jitteriness to elections.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.700
It used to be you could have
a long time conversation.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.670
Heck when Abraham Lincoln
and Stephen Douglas

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.020
debated in those famous
Lincoln/Douglas debates

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.210
for a Senate seat,

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.190
those debates took place over three hours.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.580
Now we have situations
where people will flame up

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.100
for about 20 minutes on Twitter

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.470
and that's all the time you'll ever see

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.820
for something to get addressed

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.220
because 10 more issues have come along

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.720
in the next 20 minutes.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.460
So social media has
sped up and intensified

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.920
the nature of conflict in campaigns

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.210
and those are some of the
big things that have changed

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.510
in the way we run our
congressional campaigns.
