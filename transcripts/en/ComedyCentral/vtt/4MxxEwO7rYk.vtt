00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.157
I don't know what happened.

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.625
- Ahmed, I'm at work
right now I can't talk,

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:26.860
I'll have to, I'll

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.097
just tell us how to fix the TV.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.135

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.037
- Make sure it's on input four.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.540
- Fuckin' ask him
what set of inputs.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.009 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's about a hundred
inputs in the back.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.246 align:start size:94% position:6%
- There's about a hundred

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:47.714
- Put Jack on the phone.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:48.982
- Jack he wants to talk to you.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.250
- Does it look like I
wanna talk to somebody?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.251
- No, he's tied up,

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:52.819
he's got cord everywhere --

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.621
- He's fiddling with the cords.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.955
- Did you unplug the cords?

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:56.956
- Ahh, fuck.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.793
- Yeah, we did.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.860
- How, what did you do?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.795
How did you do this?

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.063
- We didn't want to call you

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.197
at work so we tried
to do it ourselves.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.765 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well you're bothering
me at work now.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.033
(laughter)

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.602
Nah, 'cause if you look
at NASDAQ it's way down,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:12.238 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, I'll be working
overtime tonight.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.441
(laughter)

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.275
- Wait.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:16.109
- Wait.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.444
- Wait, there we go.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.278
You see it?

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:19.612
- No.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:20.947
- Who's talking?

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:23.850
This guy.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.120
He doesn't know a
tax from his elbow.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.388
(laughter)

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:29.322
- Are you talking
to people at work?

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.890
- Hey, hey.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.594 align:start size:88% position:13%
Tell him to quit horsing
around at his job.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.795
- Jack said quit horsing around

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.464
and he said job in air quotes.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.399
- Tell Jack I'm gonna punch
him in the Goddamn mouth.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.667
- Wait I think --

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.202
- This is ridiculous,

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.803 align:start size:94% position:6%
what is this one here for,
why is this one even --

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:44.804
- Hello?

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:46.306
- Which remote is it?

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.041
There's like six remotes.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.876
- How fuckin' stupid are --

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:54.314 align:start position:0%
- I'm sorry to interrupt, I
have a 4:30 with United Button,

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.548
- With United Buttons.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.083
- I'm gonna need you
to stall Mr. Yoshitomi.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:59.853
- Stall Mr. Yoshitomi and
I'm gonna get on that --

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.254
- He says Yoshatoya.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.022
- No we have, it's a Toshiba.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.524
No, it's a Toshiba.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:05.692
- Toshiba?

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.360
- It's a Toshiba
not a Toshimoma.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.862
- No, Yoshimomi --

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.831 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Ask him if there's
a Blu-Ray input.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.665 align:start size:97% position:3%
- He wants to know a Blu-Ray
input 'cause we bought

00:02:12.665 --> 00:02:14.400
a Blu-Ray player today.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.702
- You bought a Blu-Ray player?

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:17.003
- Yeah, 'cause we
wanna watch Willow,

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.805
Willow came out on Blu-Ray.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.307
- You're gonna watch our movie,

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.010 align:start size:84% position:16%
our movie on a Blu-Ray
player without me?

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.181
- Willow man, we made guac,
we got pizza, chips, drinks.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.684 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You're a rat,
you're a rat bastard.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:34.354
- Well, we'll save some for you.

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:36.956
- I really don't have
time for this Ahmed.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.424
- No, no, no, no, no --

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:41.494 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Tell him to plug things back
in where they were before,

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.531
press input four and
the cable should work.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:45.765
If the cable...

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.704
Nah it's, yeah it's
probably broken.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:52.972
- He says it's broken.

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:55.675
- Yeah you guys probably
broke it, just idiots.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.210
It's broken, I'm so mad.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.878
I'm so mad you guys.
