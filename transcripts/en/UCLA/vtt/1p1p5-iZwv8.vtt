00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.500
Today was the culmination of a ton of work.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.280
Probably about five years of work leading up to this,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.120
from a ton of different students.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.560
It's really been I think a very emotional moment
for a lot of the students here.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.940
It gave me chills because it felt so unreal

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.680
that, you know, everything that we
worked for is going in space.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.740
And it only felt real when we saw that bright light,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.960
and it going up and it's just like oh my gosh.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.140
We see the bright flash and all sudden you realize

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.220
that all our hopes and dreams poured it into this project

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.500
are hurtling up into the atmosphere and it 
just really takes your breath away.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.360
It was a really cool launch.
I was not expecting the bright light.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.760
But it's over really fast.
It was very loud but still very exciting.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.920
I've seen a launch before, but watching a launch

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.119
that, you know, you have a stake in
and you're involved with

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.500
it's pretty amazing, truth be told.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.740
I just had a big stupid grin on my face the 
whole time I was looking out.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.720
And now the real work for Mission Operations begins.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.320
The first communications pass is coming up
so that's going to be...

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.350
The real sense of relief is gonna come after that.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.880
I'm actually a flight operator so I gotta 
head back down to UCLA

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.320
to listen for the first signals and operate it.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.440
Working with students has been one of the most

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.520
rewarding things I could ever have asked for,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.920
on top of building a satellite that goes on the space.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.860
Just being involved in such an 
amazing project with such

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.960
talented and really dedicated individuals 
just really really gets me right here.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.500
That, my friends, is that.
