00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.120
When you hear the words ‘blue supergiant’,
you’d be forgiven for thinking of a fairy

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.150
tale creature.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.650
But the reality is actually far more fantastical:
elusive astrophysical bodies that are notoriously

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.840
difficult to see and understand but which
hold the keys to the formation of stars and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.840
galaxies.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.640
And for the first time, we can now see what’s
inside them.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.289
In the classification of stars, temperature
is what determines color.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.440
Just like the hottest part of a flame is that
blue part at the bottom, the hottest stars

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.329
in the universe are blue.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.170
And blue supergiant stars—as their name
would suggest—are huge, with masses anywhere

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.730
upwards of 10 times that of our Sun.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.540
They’re also much brighter and much hotter
than mid-size stars like the Sun, making them

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.980
some of the most visible and recognizable
stars in the night sky even though they’re

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.470
actually quite rare.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.280
They burn hot and fast, only lasting, oh around
tens to hundreds of millions of years or so.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.090
And that’s compared to our Sun’s expected
lifetime of 10 billion years.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.980
Because they flame out so fast, relatively
speaking, that makes them difficult to study.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.420
With the advent of advanced telescopes both
on the ground and in space, we’ve been able

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.070
to observe their surfaces, but we still know
relatively little about what goes on inside

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.070
them.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.310
Something has to be happening to produce their
incredibly intense luminosity—their brightness—which

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.390
seems to shimmer and twinkle.

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
And new research has produced some of the
first models of the interior of these enigmatic

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840
stars, telling us a little more about how
all this showstopping behavior comes to be.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.060
A cooperative research effort between Newcastle
University in England and KU Leuven in Belgium

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.600
used existing photometric data gathered by
NASA’s Kepler/K2 satellite and the Transiting

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.240
Exoplanet Survey Satellite or TESS.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.130
These satellites’ original purpose was to
scour the galaxy for exoplanets, or planets

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.530
beyond our solar system.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.190
But to do that, they surveyed hundreds of
thousands of the brightest stars near our

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.790
sun, building a super handy data set for scientists
interested in looking at bright stars...data

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.809
that confirms their existing hypotheses—and
simulations—of how these stars behave.

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:14.609
Because the satellites, with their very sensitive
detectors, were looking out at the sky for

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:20.609
a long enough period of time, they let us
see what we’ve never seen before: the patterns

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.709
of shimmering and twinkling on blue supergiants.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.120
Or, to put it in a more ‘scientific’ way,
the coherent pulsations...indicating that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.379
the stars are being rippled by internal gravity
waves.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.499
These are not to be confused with gravitational
waves.

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:43.349
Gravity waves are disturbances in some substance
due to the restoring effect of gravity: Say

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.510
a substance was going in one direction because
of some other force like wind traveling across

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.489
the ocean, but the water is also being forced
down by gravity, which—in combination with

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.559
the water’s natural buoyancy and other physical
factors—results in disturbances of the water

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.790
that we know as waves.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.169
This happens in our oceans and our atmosphere
all the time…but it’s a very different

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:11.669
phenomenon from gravitational waves, which
are tiny perturbations in the fabric of spacetime

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.760
due to some huge cosmic collision.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.849
Different things, confusingly similar name,
and though they’re common in our own oceans,

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.169
gravity waves are also what’s happening
inside blue supergiant stars!

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.700
In analyzing their data set, the research
team observed the presence of an entire spectrum

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.269
of low-frequency gravity waves in blue supergiants.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.239
These flow through the star and break at the
surface, a lot like ocean waves breaking onto

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.329
a beach.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.219
These frequencies also include standing waves,
a type of wave that’s a lot like a seismic

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.139
wave from an earthquake.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:51.680
This revelation means that we can now delve
into blue supergiants using asteroseismology.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.949
Studying these frequencies allows astrophysicists
to work out the chemistry and physics that’s

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.849
likely going on inside these stars, including
at their core.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.619
These calculations can tell us how metal is
being produced in the stars and how it moves

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:11.189
around inside them... which is very important
because blue supergiants are like the metal

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:15.639
factories of the universe, producing most
of the chemical elements on the periodic table

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.959
past helium.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.319
But perhaps even more importantly, this new
information gives us insight we’ve never

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.449
had before into how the lives of these stars
might end.

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.419
When these incredibly energetic and short-lived
stars die, they explode into supernovae and

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.169
form a black hole or a neutron star.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.460
What’s ejected in that explosion and what’s
left over afterwards has a significant impact

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.580
on the formation of other stars and on the
evolution of the galaxy around it.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.470
As the researchers put it, massive stars like
blue supergiants, “determine the evolution

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.830
of the cosmos.”

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.610
The results of this research gives us new
ways to look at these potential supernovae,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.650
like using asteroseismology, to produce highly
accurate models of their ages, what’s going

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.729
on in their core, their rotation, angular
momentum transport, interior mixing—all

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.229
of which could tell us more about when and
how they’ll die, and what they’ll put

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:15.750
out into the universe when they do…which
could potentially inform our understanding

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.460
of how other galaxies and stars formed before
them, too.
