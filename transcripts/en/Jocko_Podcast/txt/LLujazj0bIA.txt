Speaker 1:          00:00          Feign madness, but keep your balance hide behind the mask of a fool, a drunk or a mad man to create confusion about your intentions and motivations. Lower your opponent into underestimating your ability until overcompensate overconfident. He drops his guard, then you may attack. Yeah, that like the movie white men can't jump your see that. So he did it. Woody. Oh, I mean he made it like he couldn't play ball. Like he was just this Dork, Jeet, what he call a chump, whatever. That's what they'd call him chump. Like he's Super Dorky. He goes and everyone else is just so cool and boom, flashy and all this stuff. He comes in, he said he's super nerdy and you know, boom. Of course they pay a Kim, you know, kind of thing. And then he beats him. Would he beat them with flashiness or would he beat them with, with traditional, let's call it just who's your style?

Speaker 1:          00:56          Hardworking. Yeah. Basket. Well, no, he had legitimate skill. He was like this. So yeah, he'd come in, he'd be Super Dorky. And then, um, he, at first he tricked them. So he came in the introduction to him, he was like the acting all Dorky. And then the guys, the Wesley snipes in them, they're all playing basketball in there, you know, get into a little arguments or whatever. One guy gets hurt where's Bunyan on and off something and they're like, hey, we need another guy. And then the guy who's like, you know, let's, you know, get him or whatever. So they're like, ha ha ha. You know? Yeah, you got him. Whatever they play, he ends up to be pretty good, doesn't show a lot, but he's like pretty solid. And then they're like, yeah, you guys lucked out. You had this Dorky guy, you guys kind of lucked out.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And he's like, Oh yeah, you know, maybe you did look up or maybe I'm just better than you. But they're already convinced he's the stork you got in there like cough, I'm better than you. He's like, all right, well let's bet kind of thing. They're already convinced. Pool sharks are scenario. Yeah, exactly right. Same exact thing. Yeah. Yup. That's pretty obvious one. And I think, I think one thing that again to take away from this is if you know these things, you're less likely to be suckered in by them. Yeah, that's, that's the most important thing. Yeah. That you see the pool shark thing, I saw a guy who really clumsily tried to do that. He'd worked in night club, we had a pool table in there and this guy came in and he like acts like he's like, he comes in and just a normal guy, he comes in with his own cue by the way, his own pool stick, which is an indicator like total giveaway.

Speaker 1:          02:32          And then he comes in and then immediately when like he kind of enters the little scene, you know, the little area where he acts like he's just kinda drunk and just real oblivious, you know, he just total just switches to a different guy. And here's the thing, we, you can't let drunk people walk around in the bar. So you know, when waitresses or other, or the manager would come by, they'd be like, Hey, is that guy that guy's do junk? Like, why are you kind of like, keep an eye him? And I'm like, he's not drunk. He's like acting drunk. I go talk to him just to sort of make sure, and he's just like all normal talking and then like, oh man. But yeah, he tried no one. I mean, it wasn't like normal to get money from he, he wouldn't get money from anyone. Well, here's the thing. No, because it was like a nightclub. It wasn't a competitive pool hall. No one cares. No one's going to take his, no one's even going to bet. They're like, Bro, we're just cruising. Like, why are you, you know, wanting to be that kind of thing. I'm not saying that happens, but I'm saying that's the attitude. In this day and age, you'd have to be pretty dumb to fall for this in a pool hall scenario. Beat this guy. You gotta really think you could beat him, right? Just be dumb. All right, next.
