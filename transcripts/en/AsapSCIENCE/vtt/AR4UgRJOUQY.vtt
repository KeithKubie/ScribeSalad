00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
- We all exaggerate and lie but alone on the Internet

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.805
our Google search history quickly reveals the truth.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.960
With over three billion searches per day,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.480
we can discover a lot about human desires and our secret insecurities.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.320
So, how do you relate to this data?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.660
First off, people are struggling to have sex.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.020
Searches for "sexless marriage" are 3.5 times more common than "unhappy marriage"

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.600
and 8 times more than loveless marriage.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.140
And, while the assumption may be that women have lower libido than men,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.960
women are actually twice as likely to search for"my boyfriend won't have sex with me"

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.080
compared to men searching "my girlfriend won't have sex with me".

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.400
And, if you're worried that you aren't having as much sex as others,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.480
just know they're exaggerating, too.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.580
In terms of heterosexual sex, a large survey found that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.200
women say they have sex 55 times each year, using a condom 16% of the time,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.960
meaning 1.1 billion condoms a year.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.140
Men claim to be using 1.6 billion condoms.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.360
But only 600 million condoms are sold in America each year.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.260
Perhaps this lack of sex is rooted in physical insecurities.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.660
Unsurprisingly, men Google about their penises

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.220
more than any other body part,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.100
in fact, more than lungs, liver, feet, ears, nose, throat and brain combined.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300
For every one search made by a woman about their partner's phallus,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200
there are roughly 170 searches men make about their own.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.600
But guys, don't fret too much about your size,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.580
as 40% of women are complaining that it's too big, causing pain.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.320
When women search about their vaginas,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.920
30% of questions are related to how others perceive them, particularly the smell.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.400
Women are also twice as likely to look up how to perform better oral sex compared to men.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.740
And when men do search about oral sex tips,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.680
they're just as likely to research how to perform it on a partner

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
as they are to Google how to perform it on themselves.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.360
When it comes to pornography, of the top 100 searches on Porn Hub,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
16 of them are incest themed for men and 9 for women,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.360
such as "brother and sister", "stepmom son", "father and daughter" and "real brother and sister".

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.420
Pornography searches can also help answer big questions about human sexuality.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.740
In America, 5% of all porn searches among men are for gay porn.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.900
But survey data and Facebook reports show that only 2 to 3% of men identify as gay.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.000
The population of self-identified, openly gay men

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.640
is twice as high in Rhode Island, the state with the highest support for gay marriage

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.420
compared to Mississippi, the state with the lowest support.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.540
One explanation is that those living in intolerant states move to more open states.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.840
But statistics show this only accounts for half the difference.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.020
Sadly, millions of Americans are living in the closet.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.420
Pair that with Google Autocomplete which calibrates based on the most popular searches,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.940
and you'll see that when you type in "Is my husband"

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.040
it Autocompletes to "gay"

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.860
Women are 10% more likely to type this in than "Is my husband cheating?"

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.940
which is the second most common option.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.160
In 21 of the 25 states where "Is my husband gay" is most frequently searched,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.020
Support for gay marriage is lower than the national average.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.060
The same can be said for causal encounters on Craigslist

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.480
where ads for men seeking men are larger in less tolerant states

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.100
with highest percentages in Kentucky, Louisiana and Alabama.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.360
Google Autocomplete won't suggest certain words it deems inappropriate

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.260
like "cock" or "porn", but if you type in "is it normal to want to",

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.740
Google used to suggest "kill".

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.360
Similarly, few would want to admit they regret having children,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.660
but adults with children are 3.6 times more likely

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.960
to tell Google they regret having them than adults without children

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.020
will say they regret not having kids.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.020
Google also reveals how racism is still alive and well.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.280
The n-word is searched with the same frequency as the "Lakers"

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940
and "migraine" with 20% of the searches including the term "jokes".

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.480
On Obama's first election night in 2008, when a lot of commentary focused on

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.300
praise over the historic night,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.480
1 in 100 searches that included the word "Obama"

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.400
also included KKK or the n-word.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.840
Stereotypically, many assume most racism exists in the southern states,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.400
but the highest racists search results were in upstate New York, western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.140
Statistician Nate Silver found that the greatest correlation for predicting the Trump primary support

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.120
wasn't unemployment, gun ownership, religion or rates of immigration

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.560
but Google searches for the n-word.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.020
Facebook data scientists have used status updates to measure the gross national happiness on each day,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.960
and Christmas appears to be the happiest day of the year.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.420
This is reflected in Gallup polls and Google searches as well,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.200
but it's also important to be skeptical of how people appear on social media.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.200
Respected magazine The Atlantic has 1.5 million followers on Twitter

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.520
while only 18 thousand follow the National Enquirer, a gossipy tabloid.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.960
But, both have around the same physical and online circulation.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.900
Or, consider the way a woman will describe her husband on Facebook versus Google searches.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.880
On Facebook, the top terms for a husband is

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.220
"the best", "my best friend", "amazing", "the greatest" and "so cute"

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.480
while the top searches on Google related to their husband is

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.420
"gay", "a jerk", "amazing", "annoying" and "mean".

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.400
We decided to take a look into each other's search history

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.060
and found out some pretty interesting things about one another.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340
You can watch that video by clicking here.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.480
The research for this episode came from the fascinating book Everybody Lies

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.720
by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.860
