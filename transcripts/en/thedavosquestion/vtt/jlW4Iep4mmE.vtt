Hi, my name is Fan Li. I'm from China. I'm
working for Global Links Initiative, promoting

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.930
social initiative. About the question. I think
now that economic crisis is a very important

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.870
issue because economy is a foundation of people
lives and helps ordinary people measure their

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:26.770
happiness. However, I do think political issue
would eventually be agenda. So I think both

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:33.879
issues need to be treated seriously. And everybody
in Asia should participate in the process

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:34.859
of solving the problem. Thank you.
