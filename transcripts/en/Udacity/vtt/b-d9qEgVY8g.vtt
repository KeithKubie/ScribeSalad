00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.260
What are angel investors and how can
they help you finance your business?

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.220
Angel investors are people who invest
their own money into a new business,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.090
offering capital for
startup or expansion.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.210
These investors usually aren't rich, but
like the idea of investing in startups

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.070
as an alternative to returns they could
be getting by investing in stocks.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.810
Considering these motivations is
important when understanding some of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.270
the benefits and
downsides of working with them.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.080
So let's look at some benefits
of working with angel investors.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.200
Here's three, investment amounts,
accessibility, and ease of engagement.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.400
First, investment amounts.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.240
Angels tend to be willing to invest
an amount of money that's great for

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.600
many startups.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.405
As an estimate, it's possible to get
from as little as $25,000 to as much as

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:46.620
1.5 million for your startup.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.960
Next, accessibility.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.850
Angels can really be anywhere.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.820
These are just people with some
extra money to invest looking for

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.590
the right startup to
get some good returns.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.880
They could be right down the street or
at local meet-ups.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.410
You'll find it much easier to get
in touch with angels than with

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.510
any other type of investor.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.910
And finally, ease of engagement.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.220
Once you've found an angel
who is interested,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.840
it's generally pretty easy to
get through the paperwork.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.820
You're also likely to get
paid in a single lump sum.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.240
This can speed up the time it takes for
you to get some money and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.299
start growing your business.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.070
So those are some of
the benefits of angel investors.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.530
Now, what are some of the downsides?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.830
Let's look at three, high rate of
return, risk aversion, and control.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.660
First, they'll want a pretty high rate
of return on their original investment.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.560
You're competing with their option
to invest in the stock market and

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.930
if you don't provide enough growth,
they're probably not interested.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.814
Next, risk aversion.

00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:45.600
Angels aren't using expendable
income that they can afford to lose.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.327
No one likes losing money, but the
financial situation of these investors

00:01:49.327 --> 00:01:52.358
makes them particularly cautious
with the way they invest.

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:55.985
You're less likely to get an angel
investment if you have any high risk,

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.134
high reward type of plan for
your startup.

00:01:58.134 --> 00:02:00.897
And finally,
because they want a high rate of return,

00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:02.893
they can try to be pretty controlling.

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:06.307
Angel investors may want to be involved
in more of the decisions you'll make and

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:09.310
could end up affecting
the direction of your business.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.320
They could be helpful, but be sure to
balance their advice with what you

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.120
believe is best for the company.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.550
Angel investors can provide
an excellent opportunity for

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.960
growth in the early
stages of your company.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.930
Take some time to consider the positives
and negatives of dealing with these

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500
investors, then decide if
this option is right for you
