00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's now elaborate on the goals of operating

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.850
systems structure. The first goal is protection. By

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.230
protection what we mean is protecting the user

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.070
from the system and the system from the user

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.600
and also users from one another. And also

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.162
protecting an individual user from his or her own

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:22.500
mistakes. That's what we mean by protection. And

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.370
this is an important goal of operating system structuring.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.770
An operating system, of course, provides services and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.351
one of the key determinants of a good

00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.480
operating system structure is how good is the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.960
performance of the operating system. That is, what is

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.270
the time taken to perform services on behalf

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.930
of the application. I have, you've heard me say

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.590
this even before in the previous lecture. A

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.830
good operating system is one that provides the service

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.980
that is needed by the application very quickly and gets out of the way. And

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.100
that's the key determinant of operating system

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.310
structure as well. Another goal, of operating system

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.100
structure, and in fact, one of the goals that we will be focusing a lot

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.850
on in this course module, is flexibility.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.180
Sometimes also called extensibility, meaning that a service

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.450
that is provided by the operating system is not one size fits all, but the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.140
service is something that is adaptable to the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.800
requirements of the application. Another important goal of

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.180
structuring an operating system is to ensure that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.460
the performance of the operating system goes up

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.250
as you add more hardware resources to the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.926
system. This is sort of an intuitive understanding,

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:44.890
but you want to make sure that

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.530
the operating system developers on this intuitive understanding

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.920
that when you increase the hardware resources,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.890
the performance also goes up, and that's what

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.240
is meant by scalability. It turns out that both the needs of the application may

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.680
change over the lifetime of an application

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.110
and also the resources that are available for

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.070
the operating system to manage and give to the application may change over time.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.200
Agility of the operating system refers to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.700
how quickly the operating system adapts itself

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.740
to changes either in the application needs

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.360
or the resource availability from the underlying

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.740
hardware. Another worthwhile goal of operating system

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.120
structure would be responsiveness. That is, how quickly

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.405
the operating system reacts to external events, and

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:42.110
this is particularly important for applications that are interactive

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.950
in nature. Imagine you are playing a video

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.040
game. In that case, what you want to see

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.320
is when you do something like clicking the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.110
mouse to shoot at a target, you want to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.220
see action immediately on the screen. So that

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.780
is responsiveness, how quickly the operating system is reacting

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.850
to external events.
