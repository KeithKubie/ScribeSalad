SPEAKER 1: "Ain't Too Proud"
follows the Temptations'

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.830
journey from the
streets of Detroit

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.780
to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.930
With their signature dance moves
and unmistakable harmonies,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.580
they rose to the
top of the charts,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.520
creating an amazing
42 top 10 hits,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.130
with 14 reaching number one.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.860
Through friendship and
betrayal, amid the civil unrest

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.460
that tore America apart, their
moving and personal story still

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.691
resonates five decades later.

Thank you so much
for joining us.

DERRICK BASKIN:
Thanks for having us.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.360
SPEAKER 1: No problem.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.630
DERRICK BASKIN: That's our
first time seeing that.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.758
SPEAKER 1: Oh, yeah?

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:26.300

JAMES HARKNESS: Hey,
I'm James Harkness.

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:34.703
I play Paul Williams.

00:02:34.703 --> 00:02:35.870
JEREMY POPE: Good afternoon.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.740
I'm Jeremy Pope.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.240
I play Eddie Kendricks.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.448
DERRICK BASKIN: Good morning.

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:40.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.210
My name is Derrick Baskin.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.112
I play Otis Williams.

00:02:42.112 --> 00:02:43.320
JAWAN M. JACKSON: Hey, y'all.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.070
I'm Jawan Jackson.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.310
I play Melvin Franklin.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.950
SPEAKER 1: So again, thank
you again for being here.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.430
I mean this trailer tells
the story of it all.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.290
The Temptations have
been successively

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.000
active since the 1960s.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.650
How important or
relevant is the show

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.720
for audience today, considering
the musical landscape?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.815
JAMES HARKNESS: I think it's
incredibly relevant today.

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:08.690
One of the things that
I love about-- there's

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.550
so many things that is
great about this story.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.585
One of the things is that
it took them a minute

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:15.710
before they hit number one.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.500
And right now, we're in a
time where social media plays

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.340
such a huge part of
everyone's lives,

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.420
and everything is
almost instantaneous.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.540
And you have these kids that
are coming out and they have,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.200
like, 13,000 followers
or more, and they

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.390
think that it's going
to happen right away.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.630
And it doesn't really
happen right away

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.252
to get something
that's really great

00:03:37.252 --> 00:03:38.710
and something that's
going to last.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.460
And as you know about
The Temptations,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.010
their music has lasted
all of these years

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.980
and it is still incredibly
relevant, and it is still--

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.200
it's timeless, but it took
them a second to get there.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.470
And I think that's something
very important for people

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.180
to understand about them.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.650
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.450
What about their
personas really drew you

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.630
into these individual roles?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.710
JEREMY POPE: I grew up
listening to The Temptations.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.890
My parents would always
play The Temptations album--

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.750
the Christmas
album, specifically,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.360
and that's how I knew that it
was time to trim the Christmas

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.440
tree and get it ready.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.770
Because Christmas
was now upon us.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.140
But I think what I've
learned through the show

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.829
and working on this piece
is just the struggles

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.753
and the sacrifices these men--

00:04:23.753 --> 00:04:25.170
the things they
had to go through.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.740
Their music was in
the middle-- smack dab

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.910
in the middle of the
Civil Rights movement,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.640
and it charged that movement.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.890
And what it must have felt
like to be wanted as an artist

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.600
but for who you are and
the color of your skin

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.730
to be denied of that.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.260
They were performing for
segregated audiences.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.240
And I can only imagine
what that felt like--

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.330
must have felt like, and
just the questions and things

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.500
they had to go through
as individuals.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.850
But to kind of see, on
the end, now we're able

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.485
to-- they've granted us
an opportunity to continue

00:04:58.485 --> 00:04:58.985
the legacy--

00:04:58.985 --> 00:04:59.693
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:04:59.693 --> 00:05:02.890
JEREMY POPE: --and to tell the
story of these incredible men.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.960
And we get to humanize them
and talk about the good times,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.782
but also their ugly truths.

00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:08.490
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.282
JEREMY POPE: And I
think that is beautiful.

00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:12.890
That is the beauty of what
it is that we're doing.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.550
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
I think that that

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.342
was something that
resonated with me when I

00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:18.140
saw the show, that ugly truth.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.640
It wasn't just all
stars and lights,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.950
but actual real life happening
during such a time of unrest.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.170
How did each of
you prep for taking

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.540
on your individual roles?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.270
JAWAN M. JACKSON: I
can start with that.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.020
I'm born and raised
in Detroit, so I think

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.325
this is a thing that's been--

00:05:34.325 --> 00:05:35.097
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:36.965
Yeah, give it up.

00:05:36.965 --> 00:05:38.640
313, through and through.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.150
And so growing up with
this music, I think, once--

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.900
once it came about,
I've always wanted

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.120
to play Melvin Franklin,
and just somebody that

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.920
is not highly represented in
my vocal category, you know?

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.740
And so I only had,
growing up, Michael McCary

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.610
from Boyz II Men.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.040
You had Lou Rawls,
Barry White, and then

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.020
Melvin Franklin, who's the
epitome of basses in R&amp;B.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.520
And so this is just a character
study, and I took my time

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.240
and did my research.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.320
And my cousin dated
Melvin when I was--

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.325
I have a story about that.

00:06:17.325 --> 00:06:18.950
DERRICK BASKIN: No,
I didn't know that.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:19.050
JAWAN M. JACKSON: No?

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.150
I've always told that story.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.260
I've always told that story.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.530
My cousin dated him when
they were in high school.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.405
DERRICK BASKIN: Really?

00:06:23.405 --> 00:06:24.380
JAWAN M. JACKSON: Yeah, they
went to the same high school

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.680
together.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.888
And she's like, you know,
I dated Melvin for a while.

00:06:26.888 --> 00:06:28.722
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.222 --> 00:06:30.110
He was always sweet.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.360
I could never keep him up
because everybody was always

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.860
over him.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.730
So I was like, OK.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:34.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.100
Melvin could have
been my cousin.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.935
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:39.935 --> 00:06:43.040
I think Melvin has been a part
of me in my life for so long,

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.732
so it was easy
once the role came.

00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:46.940
DERRICK BASKIN: But we also--

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.330
this show, for all of us,
it's a marathon, you know?

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.940
It really is a very taxing show
on your body, on your spirit,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.080
on your soul.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.770
So practically, we have to--

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.600
I have to go to
the gym every day.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.310
I have to work out.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.730
I have to stretch and warm up.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.790
But I also have to hydrate.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.250
This is my third or
fourth bottle of water

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.820
since I've woken up.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.260
And then I can't
just drink water.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.635
Now I have to
drink coconut water

00:07:14.635 --> 00:07:17.070
to make sure I have
electrolytes and all that stuff.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.070
And I have to prepare for
that now so that by 8 o'clock,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.180
I'll be ready to
actually do the show.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.380
And it just takes--
it's a lot of upkeep

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.820
to do this particular musical.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:32.940
But the subject matter that we--

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.730
every night that we visit,
it requires us to also

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.410
be very grounded spiritually.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.130
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.030
DERRICK BASKIN:
Because we are really,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.390
really good friends off stage.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.510
And on stage, we play
brothers, essentially.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.380
And a lot of times,
not so much with me

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.890
and Jawan, but sometimes
with me and Jeremy,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.662
we have to do some very
intense scene work.

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:56.370
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.787
DERRICK BASKIN: And we have
to make sure that we feel safe

00:07:58.787 --> 00:07:59.790
with each other.

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.880
And I can't take
it personally when

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.580
he is yelling at me because it's
actually not him yelling at me.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.620
It's Eddie yelling at Otis.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.328
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:08:07.328 --> 00:08:12.670
DERRICK BASKIN: But sometimes,
as an artist, we get really--

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.090
really entwined
with our characters.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.230
And you have to just really
be grounded, spiritually

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.350
and emotionally, to
play such an emotionally

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.300
and spiritually-charged show.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.890
So you have to make
sure, whatever--

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.910
I pray.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.530
I pray, I read the Bible.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.720
I think we all meditate.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.020
I got to take up yoga now.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.679
I just need to
breathe, you know?

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.679
It's just a lot to--

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:39.030
it's a lot to deal with.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.929
And it's a big responsibility
because you really want

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.410
to honor these guys, you know?

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.760
We stand on their shoulders.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.710
They've paved the way for us.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.740
So had Otis Williams not
done what he did, I--

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.090
who am playing him--

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.800
cannot do what I'm doing.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.648
And so it's a heavy
responsibility,

00:08:59.648 --> 00:09:00.690
but it's also a blessing.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.357
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:03.930
DERRICK BASKIN: So we have
to prepare in each way

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.880
that we can, in every
way that we can,

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.130
so that we can really honor
these guys every night.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.797
SPEAKER 1: Well,
speaking of physicality

00:09:09.797 --> 00:09:14.940
and just well-being,
Ephraim Sykes is not here.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.370
He's resting his voice.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.010
But what do each of you do?

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:23.070
What are your regimens to make
sure you stay in the best shape

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.880
possible?

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.115
Starting with you, Jeremy.

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:27.240
JEREMY POPE: Well, I have--

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.532
DERRICK BASKIN: [CLEARS THROAT]

00:09:28.532 --> 00:09:30.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.170
JEREMY POPE: --a lot of things.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.470
No, I give it up
to my vocal coach,

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.380
who I've been working with
intensely this season, Liz

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.420
Kaplan, who has just
helped me stay grounded.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.950
And I think my whole
big thing this season--

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.620
and I say the season, and us
joining and doing this marathon

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.192
of a show is just no stress.

00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:52.650
I feel like when
you stress, that's

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.192
when your body wants to break
down and your voice gets tight.

00:09:55.192 --> 00:09:59.340
And I'm only in control of
the things I can control.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.940
And I do hold the responsibility
of how important this show is,

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.600
and I know that I have to show
up for the show every night

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.460
because I know that
I'm being used.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.900
It feels like when
we're on stage,

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.970
it's not about Jeremy
Pope or Derrick Baskin.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.280
It feels like it's the higher
calling and I'm just a vessel.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.007
And people are seeing
Eddie Kendricks,

00:10:17.007 --> 00:10:18.340
or they're seeing Paul Williams.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:20.820
So it's kind of like you
just show up for that,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.310
and know that the greater good
is going to work itself out.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.312
So in that, it's just, like
Derrick said, going to the gym

00:10:26.312 --> 00:10:28.020
and making sure I'm
drinking enough water

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.760
and just staying
hydrated, and trying

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.490
not to stress about things
that I can't control.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.130
So that when we get to
the show, we huddle up.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.338
Every time before we go on
stage, we hold each other.

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:38.880
And we just tune in
and go, you good?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.212
And sometimes the answer is no.

00:10:40.212 --> 00:10:41.670
And we say, OK, I
got you because I

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.040
know that I can't do this
show without my brothers.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.660
I know that I'm not in it alone.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.220
Really, our whole cast.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.740
We have a prayer circle for
people that want to come in.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.050
Most of us get in that
circle and just breathe.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.550
That's what we start with.

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.092
Everyone, breathe
in and breathe out.

00:10:55.092 --> 00:10:56.140
Breathe out the negative.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.150
You know, anything negative.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.830
Anything that's just
not going to help

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.750
service you to do what
you're about to do.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.590
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.610
JEREMY POPE: So that we can
make it to the finish line,

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.540
and we do every night, you know?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.065
And I'm so grateful
for these guys.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.440
So I know that, in my prep,
it's stuff that I do at home,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.760
it's my vocal lessons,
it's my exercising,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.773
it's staying hydrated.

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:13.440
But it's also just
leaning on these guys

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.050
and being there
for them because I

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.800
know that's a part of
the process as well.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.675
JAMES HARKNESS: Yeah.

00:11:17.675 --> 00:11:19.440
SPEAKER 1: James, talk
to us a little bit

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.030
about the audition process.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.520
And I absolutely want to
hear from each of you.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.250
Talk to us about the
process, the research.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.870
But then also how
you got the call

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.102
and what happened after that.

00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:32.310
JAMES HARKNESS: Well, it
was a long audition process,

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.040
but it was one of the most fun
audition processes I've ever

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.610
been through.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.600
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.700
JAMES HARKNESS: Because
there was so much

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.070
love throughout
this whole process.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.150
And as far as
research is concerned,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.450
the initial call was for
"The Detroit Project."

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.310
And we knew it was
about The Temptations.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.170
So of course you're
going to go and listen

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.060
to whatever Temptations
music you can find,

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:57.150
or go surf YouTube
and find any videos.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.462
But you also have to
just open yourself

00:11:59.462 --> 00:12:01.170
up to whatever the
process is going to be

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.220
when you walk into the room.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.680
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.590
JAMES HARKNESS: So for
me, the first thing

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.400
was it was a dance audition.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.700
It was a huge dance audition.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.307
Now, mind you, I talked
my way into the audition.

00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:13.890
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.057
JAMES HARKNESS: I actually--

00:12:15.057 --> 00:12:15.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.620
I was never called
in for this process.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.440
A lot of people were
invited through their agents

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.180
or managers or whatnot.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.190
I was not.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.340
And the day before,
the show that I

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.030
was doing at the time, all
the other guys were going in

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.780
and one of them turned
to me and was like,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.240
are you going to this
audition tomorrow or not?

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.070
And so I went--

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.940
[SIGHS]

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.540
I picked up my phone.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.700
I sent a text message
to Sergio Trujillo, who

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.490
is our choreographer,
and I just said,

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.670
hey, it's been a minute
since we've spoken

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.090
and I know you're doing this
Temptations thing tomorrow.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:55.710
I would love to be in the room,
but I also understand if not.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.050
And a minute later, I got
a message back saying,

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.940
please come.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.320
So I came.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.400
And here I am sitting here.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.554
So it all worked out.

00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:08.436
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:08.436 --> 00:13:10.144
JEREMY POPE: Most
important text message.

00:13:10.144 --> 00:13:12.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.400
JAMES HARKNESS: But it was a
long, but incredible process.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.310
One of the things I loved about
auditioning for this show,

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.170
as I said earlier, was the love.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.080
A lot of times, you audition
for things and I don't know,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.080
it's not the same as
going in on an interview.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.440
In an audition room, everyone's
in the room and everyone

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.320
is doing it at the same time,
especially in a dance call.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.200
So every single person, we're
all learning the choreography

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.500
at the same time, and we're
either in groups of five

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.640
or more when we audition.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.832
Or, as what happened in this
one, Sergio was like, OK, guys.

00:13:46.832 --> 00:13:48.040
We're going to go one by one.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.510
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.343
JAMES HARKNESS: And
everyone was like, what?

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:51.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:51.810
You know?

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.650
So then you have everyone's
eyes on you watching.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.780
But what was beautiful
about this process

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.280
is everyone
supported each other.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.850
JAMES HARKNESS: And I have
been auditioning for a while,

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.570
and I have never felt
what I felt in the rooms

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.800
for these auditions.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200
Because everyone
was with each other,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.480
going, hey, giving
each other support

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.740
and cheering each other on.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.750
And if someone didn't
really know the step,

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.715
someone would help the other
person out with the step.

00:14:21.715 --> 00:14:22.840
That doesn't always happen.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.520
Because as you know,
a lot of times,

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.970
you're trying to get
what you need to get.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.620
And that's a lot of
things about this world.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.710
A lot of times, people
go through life going,

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.090
I need to get where
I need to get to.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.940
One of the things
that's been great also

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.970
about being in this show,
just as Jeremy was saying,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.755
people-- we're here
to support each other.

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:41.880
SPEAKER 1: As it should be.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.830
JAMES HARKNESS: Because you
need someone's hand on your back

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:45.660
sometimes.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.570
You need someone to
help guide you forward.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.300
And that support
system, feeling that

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:56.010
from the beginning of
this process, was amazing.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.090
The call.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:57.680
Oh, yeah.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.890
SPEAKER 1: Yes, let's jump--

00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.605
let's unpack it.

00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:01.230
JAMES HARKNESS: Well,
there's two calls

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.670
that are very important
through this process for me.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.930
So third audition, I had gone
in and finally auditioned

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:07.710
for Paul.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.500
Initially, I went into
dance, and then we sang.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.230
And then they gave
us sides to learn,

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.870
which were sides for some
of the secondary characters.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.540
I went and auditioned for
that, and then the director

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.730
looked at me and he
said, hold on a minute.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:21.930
He turned to his assistant.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.500
They were like (WHISPERING)
chirp, chirp chirp, chirp,

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.000
chirp.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.190
And then he rifled
through some papers

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.940
and then he held this out and
he said, here, go read for Paul

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.830
and come back in when
you're ready to do it.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.280
So I went out into the
hallway, learned the stuff,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.220
came back in and
auditioned for Paul.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.980
This is my third audition.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.180
I get back to work.

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:48.210
All the guys that had gotten
their callbacks already,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.470
so this is about
7 o'clock, 7:15.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:53.865
No, it was a half hour, 7:30.

00:15:53.865 --> 00:15:55.115
So sorry, this was about 7:45.

00:15:55.115 --> 00:15:57.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.810
And they're like
callbacks and they're

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:00.810
talking about the stuff.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.080
And I'm sitting there going, OK.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.630
Well, all right.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.740
I didn't get one.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.270
But I also went, but I'm
OK because the process has

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.270
been so good--

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:17.190
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.980
JAMES HARKNESS: --that if this
is where it ends for me, sucks,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.500
yes because I really,
really, really want this.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.230
But it's also OK because the
process has been so great.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.060
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.740
All these messages
come up on my phone

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.865
and then I see one from my
manager, so I was just like--

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:33.685
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:33.685 --> 00:16:37.050
And it said, hey, buddy.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:38.340
You got your callback.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.360
And I was sitting in my
chair and I was like, yes.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.370
And I started laughing, and then
I immediately started crying.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.690
And one of my castmates
looked at me and he was like,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.305
are you doing a scene right now?

00:16:51.305 --> 00:16:51.805
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:51.805 --> 00:16:55.320
And I was like, no.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.110
I'm kind of famous
for doing scenes.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.880
But then I realized,
at that moment,

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.770
how bad I really, really wanted
it because I sat and I cried.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.240
But I cried out of joy.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.970
And so that was one call.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.498
And then the call call was
after the last final audition,

00:17:13.498 --> 00:17:14.790
where everyone was in the room.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.770
Dominique was in the room, the
producers were in the room.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:17.869
Everyone was there.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:22.210
And did that whole audition,
was walking back to do my show.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.560
I was in "Beautiful the
Musical" at the time.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.980
I was walking with Clayton and
I found out that Clayton, who

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.100
plays one of the guys--

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.810
who plays one of the
guys in the show.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.930
He's one of our cast members.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.260
He was also up for Paul,
and I didn't know that

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.180
until that moment.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.690
And we're walking down the
street and I just went, huh.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:44.030
Clayton.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.730
And I was like, great
because Clayton is amazing.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:50.150
And I went, well, that's
where that role is going.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.160
And I made peace
with it the next day.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.790
Then I get a phone
call and my manager

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.320
was like, so how
was the audition?

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.560
And I was like, it was cool.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.390
He was like, so how
do you think you did?

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.730
And I was like, the director
said I did a good job.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.010
So I said, OK.

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:09.170
He fully set me up.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.253
SPEAKER 1: Setting you up.

00:18:10.253 --> 00:18:11.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:13.130
JAMES HARKNESS: And
he was like so well,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.020
I'm sorry to tell you--

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.110
and I was like, mmm, OK--

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.180
that you'll be doing double
duty for the next six weeks.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.600
And double duty means I was
going to be rehearsing all day

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.400
and then also doing
my shows at night.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.730
And I said-- well, I
can't say what I said--

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.030
--at that particular moment.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.300
And then I started crying.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.838
And-- surprise, surprise.

00:18:40.838 --> 00:18:42.130
DERRICK BASKIN: Weeping willow.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.452
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:47.452 --> 00:18:49.160
JAMES HARKNESS: So
that is what happened.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:53.480
Those were the two calls
that mean the most to me,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.423
and I get to be here.

00:18:55.423 --> 00:18:56.590
SPEAKER 1: That's wonderful.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.210
What have you all
learned about yourselves

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.420
throughout the process of
auditioning, of course, getting

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.510
the call, but then also
playing these larger-than-life

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.550
personas?

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.850
DERRICK BASKIN: Well, I honestly
didn't know if I was actually

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.410
capable of doing so much work.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:20.120
Before this show,
I'd play a sidekick

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.232
and I'd sing a really cool song.

00:19:22.232 --> 00:19:22.940
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.730
DERRICK BASKIN: And
then that'd be it.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.470
The show I did before
this show, I was a mute,

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.770
so I had no lines.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.360
Go from that to doing like
50 million monologues.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.520
I just wasn't sure I
was capable of carrying,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.800
I guess, so much weight.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.420
And this show showed
me how capable

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.312
I am of trying to
rise to a challenge.

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:51.020
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.645
DERRICK BASKIN: And
I think when you're

00:19:52.645 --> 00:19:55.130
presented with any
kind of obstacle

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.680
or any kind of challenge, to be
able to rise to that, for me,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.860
it was just kind
of life-affirming.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:06.087
To say I actually can be
stronger than I think I am.

00:20:06.087 --> 00:20:08.420
And I think a lot of times,
we have moments in our lives

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.087
where we're like, I
just don't think I'm

00:20:10.087 --> 00:20:12.740
capable of doing x, y, or z.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.400
And to be given an
opportunity to say,

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.980
actually, you're
actually stronger

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.030
than you think you are.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:17.990
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.865
DERRICK BASKIN: I think
it taught me that I'm

00:20:19.865 --> 00:20:21.890
stronger than I think I am.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.320
SPEAKER 1: Are there
parallels between each of you

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.262
individually and the
characters that--

00:20:26.262 --> 00:20:28.220
and the real-life personas
that you're playing?

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.290
Parallels in real life?

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.723
DERRICK BASKIN: Yes.

00:20:30.723 --> 00:20:31.640
I'm going to say this.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:39.210
So it's really weird and eerie
how each of us are very--

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.060
we're very close to the
personas that we play.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.280
And I don't think--

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.590
I'm certain casting
didn't really know it.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.330
The casting directors
didn't know it.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.940
But I think we just--

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.690
I think the reason why we
all booked these roles is we

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.660
all are very similar
to our characters.

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.805
And it's eerie.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:05.770
These two specifically.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:11.130
Jawan has just one of
the biggest hearts.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.950
He has just a great smile.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.980
He is kind of the
warmth of our show.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.430
And Jeremy, when I
first met Jeremy--

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.730
actually, we also
went on a vacation

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.170
together between one
of the two dates.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.810
We went all the way to Bali.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.372
And on the trip
to Bali, Jeremy is

00:21:39.372 --> 00:21:40.580
thinking about some business.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.775
He was like, all right, now what
can I do as an artist to make--

00:21:45.775 --> 00:21:48.920
what can I do to
help brand the show?

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.510
Can I do anything?

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.430
I wasn't thinking
about the show.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:57.530
But Jeremy, he's very
good at branding.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.790
He's very good at
the business side

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:04.040
of things, which I think
Eddie Kendricks was also

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.490
very interested in, in
making sure that artists

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:09.170
were taking care of themselves.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.260
That artists were taken care
of by the record companies.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:17.760
And Jeremy is kind of like our
ringleader when it comes to OK,

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.310
whoever we're talking to
or wherever we're doing it,

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.870
are you taking care
of us as artists?

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:22.230
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.355
DERRICK BASKIN: And that's
Jeremy's responsibility,

00:22:24.355 --> 00:22:28.240
which is pretty much what Eddie
did, I think, with our group.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.000
But it's the same with Ephraim.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.850
You know, Ephraim has
this fire inside of him.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.550
I don't think that he's as--

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.010
he's not actually
as dysfunctional

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.160
as David Ruffin was.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.500
SPEAKER 1: Right, right.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.917
DERRICK BASKIN:
He's actually not.

00:22:41.917 --> 00:22:48.750
But he does have this fire
that I actually admire.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.340
And then James, as well.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.820
James has told you about
he'll cry about three or four

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.290
times in this interview.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.630
But he is the heart and
the soul, he really is.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.450
He wears his heart
on his sleeves.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:06.390
And he has this sensitivity.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.160
And so it's just
really interesting

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.670
how just everything that
we've gone through in life,

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.500
before we even got
to these roles,

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.650
have prepared us for the
roles that we are playing.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.437
It's really cool the way that
life has paralleled that way.

00:23:19.437 --> 00:23:20.520
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:21.450
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:22.825
SPEAKER 1: Speaking
of chemistry,

00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:25.510
you had touched on it earlier.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.440
So the show works because you
all feed off of each other.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.235
What is your favorite
song to perform and why?

00:23:32.235 --> 00:23:33.360
JEREMY POPE: I'll go first.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.740
JAWAN M. JACKSON: OK.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.550
JEREMY POPE: My favorite
song that we do in the show,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.800
I think, is "My Girl."

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.770
I think-- well, I
know it's because it's

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.570
the first time that the
classic five were all on stage

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.070
together.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.820
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.920
JEREMY POPE: That
we kind of solidify,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.330
we're The Temptations.

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.240
And I think it's the
moment in the show where

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.827
you begin to really hear
those classic Temptations

00:23:56.827 --> 00:23:57.660
songs that you know.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.580
So as soon as you hear that
bass line on "My Girl,"

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.410
that's when we hear the
audience singing back at us.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:02.000
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.300
JEREMY POPE: And they're
ready because they

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.400
know we're about to get
into the good-- you know,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.440
their favorite, favorite,
favorite Temptations songs.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.940
JAWAN M. JACKSON:
We're in the show.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.790
JEREMY POPE: So that is a
moment that I love in the show

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.160
the most, and the song
that I love the most.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.960
SPEAKER 1: What about you?

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.880
JAMES HARKNESS: There's so many.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.517
It's been hard to
nail this one down.

00:24:19.517 --> 00:24:20.100
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.558
JAMES HARKNESS: It
really has been.

00:24:21.558 --> 00:24:24.150
But I will say that I
love doing "Get Ready."

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:25.880
SPEAKER 1: Oh, gosh.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.660
JAMES HARKNESS: Because it--

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.650
now we're in Temptations
world, and this is also

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:34.560
a big hit for The Temptations.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.350
But then there's also this
interview that happens right

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.470
in the middle of it.

00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:41.070
And we've been doing a lot of
these wonderful interviews.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.440
So there are times
when I'm also on stage,

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.360
and I'm looking at
us sitting on stage

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.760
in this onstage interview.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:52.814
But then I go, but we just
did this earlier today.

00:24:52.814 --> 00:24:55.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.210
And so it's a really,
really fascinating thing.

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:06.100
As Derrick was saying, we
really do bring these characters

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:06.600
to life.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.760
We kind of personify
these people.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.510
And there are so many times
when I'm looking at Eddie--

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.628
I mean--

00:25:13.628 --> 00:25:14.670
JAWAN M. JACKSON: Jeremy.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.260
DERRICK BASKIN: Jeremy.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.010
SPEAKER 1: Jeremy.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.970
JAMES HARKNESS: I'm
looking at Jeremy on stage,

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.090
but I'm seeing Eddie.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:24.120
But I'm seeing Jeremy.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.897
And it just kind of
starts to do this,

00:25:25.897 --> 00:25:27.730
and it's a really,
really fascinating thing.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.650
JEREMY POPE: It's
one of those things--

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.520
going back to the
last question, it's

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.440
just like you don't really want
to talk about it because you

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.670
don't really want to
get into-- you don't

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.890
want to figure out why that is.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:34.130
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.867
JEREMY POPE: It just kind
of is and it's scary.

00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:37.950
Like you said, it's eerie.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:40.350
Because there's times where
I'm looking at Ephraim, who's

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.433
playing David Ruffin, and
it's like you don't want

00:25:42.433 --> 00:25:44.190
to talk to him
because of the fire,

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.340
like how messed up
it seems, you know?

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.270
But there's still this love,
where you want to care for him.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:50.370
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.412
JEREMY POPE: And I feel
that way with each of us,

00:25:52.412 --> 00:25:53.760
that it's not us.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.110
It's just something else.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.780
And we kind of go, great,
you're acting real well today.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:58.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.440
You know?

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:03.600
And you kind of just
leave it at that.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.390
JAWAN M. JACKSON:
Oftentimes, too, we'll

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.140
get-- there's a
scene between Derrick

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:11.160
and I, which leads me into
my favorite song to hear

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.440
is "Just My Imagination"
right before that.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:19.080
And that's the first time Melvin
gets mad and upset in the show.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.740
And then sometimes,
he'll go off on me.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.630
And then right when we
walk into the thing,

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:25.530
he's like, I'm sorry.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.883
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:31.278 --> 00:26:33.948
And so I'm like, it's
OK, it's OK, it's OK.

00:26:33.948 --> 00:26:35.490
Or I roll my eyes,
like, do it again.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:36.392
Do it again.

00:26:36.392 --> 00:26:38.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:40.300
But then it leads into
"Just My Imagination,"

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.960
which is my favorite number
to listen to because Jeremy

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.610
Pope just steals the audience.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.380
And if you didn't know about
his vocal abilities or anything

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.420
as Eddie Kendricks,
or you had questions,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.690
they are debunked
there because that boy

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.825
sings the panties
and the drawers off

00:26:56.825 --> 00:26:57.990
of anybody listening.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:59.287
It's so great.

00:26:59.287 --> 00:27:00.370
DERRICK BASKIN: Literally.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.340
SPEAKER 1: Literally, yeah.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.660
JAWAN M. JACKSON: It's amazing
to hear just in the stillness.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.800
That's the first time,
I think, in the show

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.260
that we're actually, as
Temptations, just still

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:09.900
and you get to just
enjoy and listen

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.280
and be in the moment with
us and follow the journey.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.567
And so that's one of
my favorite numbers.

00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.650
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.030
Speaking of pulling the
spirit out of people,

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.400
I caught a few winks
during the show.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.713
There were some winks thrown
out during the show when

00:27:23.713 --> 00:27:25.580
I saw it on Tuesday.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:28.150
There was a come
hither gesture that

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.040
was really engulfing everyone.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.268
And then, of course,
at some point,

00:27:32.268 --> 00:27:33.310
I believe it was Ephraim.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.600
He threw a handkerchief out.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.620
And I'm like, oh, snap.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:36.120
Let me--

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:38.360
Let me grab--

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:38.980
DERRICK BASKIN: Did you get it?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.230
JAWAN M. JACKSON:
Did you get it?

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.480
SPEAKER 1: --the handkerchief.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.423
How important is
audience participation?

00:27:42.423 --> 00:27:43.840
JAMES HARKNESS:
It's so important.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:44.945
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah.

00:27:44.945 --> 00:27:47.112
JAWAN M. JACKSON: It
definitely makes the experience

00:27:47.112 --> 00:27:48.700
a lot better for us.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.450
JEREMY POPE: Yeah.

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:50.500
DERRICK BASKIN: Go ahead.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.375
JEREMY POPE: I'll go.

00:27:51.375 --> 00:27:53.843
We have the-- we
were very fortunate.

00:27:53.843 --> 00:27:56.260
It feels fortunate now because
we did make it to Broadway.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.090
But we had to go
out of town and we

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.180
went to a bunch of different
cities to just kind of mold

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.800
and figure out
what the show was.

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.810
So there was a
point in the process

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:10.330
where you had to go, OK,
how can I use these shows?

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.197
Because we're not in New York.

00:28:12.197 --> 00:28:13.030
We're not there yet.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.850
And we need to make sure
this show is the best

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.000
that it can be.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.260
So we are very aware of the
audience and we have to be.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.780
I feel like that is the
final character that

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.700
is added to your production.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.700
And it's sometimes the
most important character

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.700
to the production, just to
hear where they're listening

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.217
and allow them into your story.

00:28:33.217 --> 00:28:35.800
Because we're in the rehearsal
space doing our version of what

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.880
we think is the show.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.530
Hold for applause and continue.

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.290
But sometimes, the
spirit moves and people

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.820
respond and don't
know why or how.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.710
But we have to
leave room for that.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.150
So the cool thing
is every night,

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:54.080
we are open to whatever they're
ready to say or feel or be

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:54.580
a part of.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.890
Sometimes we have loud,
exuberant audiences

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.330
that are yelling at us.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.590
And we're looking at
each other, like, I wish

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.890
I could hear my line, you know?

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:01.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.980
And we love that, you know?

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.272
And then sometimes we have
quiet ones where we're like,

00:29:05.272 --> 00:29:06.800
do we need to check a pulse?

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.300
You know?

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.850
But we love them, as
well, because usually, we

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.450
get to the end of the show
and everyone is on their feet

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.460
and so excited.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.680
And some people can kind
of coddle that energy

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.210
till the end and
some people just

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:22.150
have to shout amen and be
reaching for the handkerchief.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:24.580
Because again, it's this
music that they've lived,

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.920
that they know.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.720
And I think there
is this element

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.460
that it is a concert for them.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.870
They get to relive these songs.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.060
And we have performances
like "Get Ready,"

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.710
which are big numbers,
where it feels

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.850
like a big concert, a
Temptations concert.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:42.880
But there's just so much
heart and so much story in it.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.980
So for the people that
knew The Temptations,

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.010
they get to know them in
a deeper, intimate way.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:49.450
And that's just
so, so incredibly

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.280
special to look
out in the audience

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.010
and see the older couple
with tears in their eyes.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.710
And you just know that they're
going through something totally

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.692
different than the
young black kid who's

00:29:58.692 --> 00:30:01.150
kind of on the edge of his seat
seeing himself represented.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:01.720
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.580
JEREMY POPE: And to
have those two stories

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.330
in the same room experiencing
this beautiful piece

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.690
is just really, really cool.

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.107
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
I definitely felt

00:30:10.107 --> 00:30:11.500
transported when I saw the show.

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.160
I was instantly drawn in
from the first number.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.460
I want to talk a little
bit about logistics, just

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.320
a small portion.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.980
The microphone situation.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.458
So at some point, or
throughout the show,

00:30:24.458 --> 00:30:26.500
there was a mini mic that
you guys would pull out

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.720
of your jacket pocket.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.560
And I was wondering to
myself, wow, is that part of--

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:34.780
was that something that
you all came up with

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.570
or was that something that
would happen in real life

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.500
during the performances?

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.030
JEREMY POPE: Yeah, our
director and our choreographer.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.150
One thing I will talk about,
and I know Ephraim would

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.605
talk about it here, is we had--

00:30:51.605 --> 00:30:53.230
we were blessed to
have Otis Williams--

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.860
the last original founding
member of The Temptations

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.430
with us on this journey.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.230
So he had seen a workshop and it
was our first day of rehearsal.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.808
We were all together
and he came back

00:31:03.808 --> 00:31:06.100
and he was talking to Ephraim,
who played David Ruffin.

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.392
He said, if you really
want to get David down,

00:31:09.392 --> 00:31:11.350
when he'd really want to
get the audience wound

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.300
up and on their feet,
he would take a mic,

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.620
throw it in the air, and
then drop in a split.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.370
SPEAKER 1: And there
were a lot of splits.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:19.620
JEREMY POPE: And there was a--

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.960
so that's kind of the
task that he gave Ephraim.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.670
But Ephraim is fearless and
was like, oh, yeah, I got you,

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.170
baby.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.110
You know what I mean?

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:30.610
Come back tomorrow,
you know what I mean?

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:31.610
SPEAKER 1: Right, right.

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:32.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.610
JEREMY POPE: And
that is something

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.940
that he does every night.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.650
He's talked about
it in interviews

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.657
of how he has to trust and
kind of surrender, you know?

00:31:41.657 --> 00:31:44.240
Because it's terrifying to just
throw something up and go, OK,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.600
gravity, have my back today.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.510
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.190
JEREMY POPE: And there's been
shows where he's dropped it

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:50.040
and he's got another one
right outside of his pocket,

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.457
and the audience
still goes crazy.

00:31:51.457 --> 00:31:52.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.340
But it's just so cool.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.100
So that is something that they
used to do that David would do.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.700
He would just take that mic up,
throw it up, drop into a split.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.980
But this idea in
the choreography

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.320
that we all kind of have
mics just everywhere, just

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.790
who's singing what and
how they're doing that

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.860
was our director and our
choreographer, Sergio.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.350
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.230
And Dez is really good--
and Sergio-- they're

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.132
very good at transitions.

00:32:13.132 --> 00:32:13.840
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.882
DERRICK BASKIN: And so to
make everything smooth,

00:32:15.882 --> 00:32:17.438
sometimes you have
to tuck things

00:32:17.438 --> 00:32:19.230
away so that you don't
have to say, OK, now

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.580
I need to go off and get a mic.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.288
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:32:21.288 --> 00:32:23.090
DERRICK BASKIN: If
it's just right here,

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:26.440
the moment is not-- the
energy isn't interrupted,

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.510
do you know what I mean?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:32.610
James wears a flask
in act two in his vest

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:34.050
that he has to pull out.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.860
And he's had that flask
at the top of the song,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.490
but we don't use the flask for
minutes and minutes and minutes

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.990
later.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:45.800
So there's nowhere he can
store it besides on his body

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.750
to keep the transition
going smoothly

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.610
so that the scenes
always go from moment

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:52.000
to moment to moment.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
And so he'll have a mic on him.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.915
He'll pass one to Ephraim,
or Ephraim will have one--

00:32:56.915 --> 00:32:58.040
JEREMY POPE: Pass it to me.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.165
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:59.165 --> 00:33:03.270
To make sure that
everything stays smooth.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.190
This show is like a memory
play, so a lot of times,

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.130
people are sliding
in and sliding out,

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.132
and there's always a
movement to our show.

00:33:10.132 --> 00:33:10.840
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.680
DERRICK BASKIN: And so in order
to keep that movement going,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.250
we have to store things.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:19.560
And extra ones, just in
case someone drops one,

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.252
there's one here
to keep it going.

00:33:21.252 --> 00:33:21.960
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.610
DERRICK BASKIN: And so
yeah, it's interesting.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:25.500
I don't have to hide
anything, thank god.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.625
JEREMY POPE: But you have--

00:33:26.625 --> 00:33:29.370
he has a lot of costume because
he doesn't leave the stage.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:29.680
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.780
JEREMY POPE: So Derrick,
he won't tell you,

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.070
he doesn't leave the stage.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.400
He is the last member, so
he is narrating this memory,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:36.900
if you will.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.320
So at the top of show,
he is a little thicker

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.640
because he's got--

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.350
JAMES HARKNESS: Eight costumes.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.100
JEREMY POPE: --three
scenes underneath him

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.060
that you will then see.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.210
So we have that on
top of hiding mics.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.800
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.728
SPEAKER 1: So speaking
of showmanship,

00:33:51.728 --> 00:33:53.520
obviously the timeline
of The Tempts career

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.200
overlaps with many
of the other groups

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.810
that we all should
be familiar with,

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.660
such as The Supremes, who were
also very much into putting

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.720
on a performance.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.810
So let's jump into a video here.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.064
Derrick?

00:34:11.064 --> 00:34:12.495
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.664
SPEAKER 2: And guess who had
to share the spotlight with us?

00:35:05.664 --> 00:35:06.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:34.384 --> 00:35:35.217
DERRICK BASKIN: Wow.

00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:36.455
JEREMY POPE: Yeah.

00:35:36.455 --> 00:35:37.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.338
That looked good.

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:41.880
DERRICK BASKIN: That
was pretty cool.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.060
JAWAN M. JACKSON: That was the
first time we saw that too.

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:44.810
JEREMY POPE: Yeah.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:45.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.744
JAMES HARKNESS: They
got music videos.

00:35:47.744 --> 00:35:49.612
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.040
Wow.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.343
That's really cool.

00:35:54.343 --> 00:35:56.195
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.800
SPEAKER 1: So let's
talk a little bit.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.822
This is what I like to
call the fun section.

00:36:01.822 --> 00:36:03.280
I mean, we were
already having fun,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.850
but now we're going to
unpack some personal stuff.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.170
JAMES HARKNESS: OK.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.280
SPEAKER 1: Not really.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.740
But what's your favorite
song to listen to when you're

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.810
kind of prepping for that day?

00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:17.670
JAMES HARKNESS: That's hard
because I think we all listen

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.450
to just different things.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.400
It's kind of whatever's
in the moment.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.012
Sometimes whatever's coming
up on your shuffle play.

00:36:24.012 --> 00:36:24.720
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.330
JAMES HARKNESS: I don't think
I listen to anything specific

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.800
to get me going.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.720
There's always a Janet
Jackson song running.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.040
SPEAKER 1: Of course.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.460
DERRICK BASKIN: I mean, always.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.418
JAMES HARKNESS: Always.

00:36:33.418 --> 00:36:34.226
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:34.226 --> 00:36:34.910
DERRICK BASKIN: Janet Jackson.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:35.470
JAMES HARKNESS: That's
my girl, that's my girl.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:36.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.765
DERRICK BASKIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:38.765 --> 00:36:40.140
JAMES HARKNESS:
But I don't know.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.660
DERRICK BASKIN: For
me, it's Stevie Wonder.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.330
He's my all-time
favorite artist.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:49.000
So I mean, his
catalog is ridiculous.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.512
And so I can always
turn to him if I

00:36:50.512 --> 00:36:51.720
need any kind of inspiration.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.470
If I need to get a little
bit more energy that day,

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.810
or if I need to calm down, it's
always a Stevie Wonder song

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:01.567
to get me in the mood, for sure.

00:37:01.567 --> 00:37:03.275
"Songs in the Key of
Life," specifically.

00:37:03.275 --> 00:37:04.360
SPEAKER 1: Oh, gosh.

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.870
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah,
that thing is major.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:07.930
It'll always be major.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.050
JAMES HARKNESS: Yeah.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.220
SPEAKER 1: What's your
dream show to book?

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.250
JEREMY POPE: Theater?

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:15.667
SPEAKER 1:
Theater-wise, for sure.

00:37:15.667 --> 00:37:17.430
DERRICK BASKIN: I
mean, I will not

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.860
get any better than this show.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:19.500
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.450
DERRICK BASKIN: There is--

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:25.230
I don't believe there will be a
show created after this that I

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.270
will be more excited to do.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:30.540
I've just never--
have never been

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.710
used to this extent
of my ability,

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:36.210
and I just don't
think any other show

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:38.790
that I do after this will
ask me to do as much as I'm

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.330
doing in this show.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.060
And so this is the
dream, you know?

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:46.550
I will, God willing,
have more theater.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:51.240
I would love to do a straight
play as opposed to musical

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.970
because it's so much easier.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:54.637
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:54.637 --> 00:37:56.220
JAWAN M. JACKSON:
It's so much easier.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.262
DERRICK BASKIN: I can't--

00:37:57.262 --> 00:37:59.490
I can't have any whiskey.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.270
I'm not drinking right now.

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:04.050
I got to really
watch what I eat,

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.940
except for I didn't
watch what I ate today.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.846
I ate in y'all cafeteria,
which is major.

00:38:07.846 --> 00:38:08.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.680
But I just don't--

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.320
I just don't think
there is another piece

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.120
of musical theater that will
top this, in terms of what

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.070
it's asking all of us to do.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.780
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.730
DERRICK BASKIN: So
yeah, this is my dream.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.063
JEREMY POPE: Yeah, I think that.

00:38:25.063 --> 00:38:26.200
Same, same, same.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.990
And also, just what this piece
is pouring into me for me,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.720
I just don't know--

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.550
I can't see anything
else because I'm just

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:39.090
so grateful to be with
these guys, with our cast.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:42.450
Because it's providing healing
and so much love to me,

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.220
and giving me so much--

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.858
I don't know, just so much
support that I feel like--

00:38:46.858 --> 00:38:47.400
I don't know.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.358
I just feel incredible.

00:38:48.358 --> 00:38:51.210
So I just don't know what other
project would give me that,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:52.120
grant me that.

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.720
And specifically
with this show, it's

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.283
not every day that you see this
many black brothers on stage.

00:38:57.283 --> 00:38:57.950
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.350
DERRICK BASKIN: Right.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.475
JEREMY POPE: So a lot of
the times, it's between me

00:39:00.475 --> 00:39:01.650
and him for a role.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:04.770
It's between me-- so the fact
that we can all be in the same

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.330
room--

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:05.580
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.413
JEREMY POPE: --and
that's fine, and everyone

00:39:07.413 --> 00:39:10.140
gets to just be great and
a star in their own way,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.440
I'm like, this is the dream.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.440
That I get to look to my
brothers and my sisters

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.300
and be like, oh, we've made it.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.060
We're doing something.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.227
You're great, I'm great,
she's great, they're great.

00:39:17.227 --> 00:39:19.540
We're great together
for the greater good,

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.745
for a greater calling.

00:39:20.745 --> 00:39:25.680
JAMES HARKNESS: I think as
a man in this business, this

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.670
is definitely the dream.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.472
They don't write roles
like this for men.

00:39:31.472 --> 00:39:32.180
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.480
JAMES HARKNESS: Period.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.580
In the musical,
especially, they do not

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.600
write roles like this for men.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.110
And then to add on top of
that to write roles like this

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.677
for black men in theater--

00:39:41.677 --> 00:39:42.510
SPEAKER 1: For sure.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.670
JAMES HARKNESS: --where
we're not playing a thug,

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.900
we're not playing a slave.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.640
We're not playing
things that people

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:50.650
look and are used to seeing.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:55.830
We're playing five
intelligent, strong,

00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:00.840
but also vulnerable men who've
lived an incredible life

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.950
and they've gone through things
that everyone understands.

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.580
There's nothing that
we're going through

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.390
that someone's going
to sit and go well,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.150
I don't understand that because
they're a different skin

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.272
color than I. That doesn't
happen like this in this show.

00:40:16.272 --> 00:40:16.980
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.810
JAMES HARKNESS: So to
have the opportunity

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:23.820
to play something like this,
it really is, as Derrick said--

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.050
I hope that this
is something that

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.570
shifts in theater, that
helps shift theater

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:33.490
and that helps writers
go, OK, we can do that.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:35.282
We can do that in a musical.

00:40:35.282 --> 00:40:35.990
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:37.532
JAMES HARKNESS: We
don't have to wait

00:40:37.532 --> 00:40:40.240
to do a play to bring this
type of stuff to the table.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.800
Because this is
what it feels like.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.590
I've come out of the stage
door and people have said,

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:47.090
that is one of the best
plays I've ever seen.

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:50.560
It's a musical, but the work
that Dominique Morisseau has

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:56.260
done in this show,
also with our director,

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.170
it feels like a play that just
so happens that we're singing

00:40:59.170 --> 00:40:59.930
and we're dancing.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:00.520
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.728
JAMES HARKNESS: So it is an
incredibly powerful thing

00:41:02.728 --> 00:41:04.620
that--

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:06.530
yeah, I hope in the
future that there

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.490
is something else that I
get to do that will bring me

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.080
to the level of this.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.390
And not just for myself,
for all of us sitting

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.550
here and for everyone
else out there

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:18.440
who wants to do
this for a living

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.403
and is doing this for a living.

00:41:20.403 --> 00:41:21.320
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:21.710
I think--

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.830
DERRICK BASKIN: To be able to
do that with people you like.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:24.230
SPEAKER 1: Oh, yeah.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.010
That's the other thing.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.432
DERRICK BASKIN:
That's the thing.

00:41:26.432 --> 00:41:28.640
Because you don't necessarily
have to like the people

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:29.223
you work with.

00:41:29.223 --> 00:41:31.370
You just have to work
with them, right?

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.540
And you just have
to get the job done.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.850
But to do it with--

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.168
I cut up with these guys
on the stage all the time.

00:41:37.168 --> 00:41:38.210
I'm the jokester of the--

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.640
JAMES HARKNESS: Constantly.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.640
DERRICK BASKIN: --group.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.683
And I try to break--

00:41:41.683 --> 00:41:43.850
I try to break their character
every once in a while

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:44.683
and make them laugh.

00:41:44.683 --> 00:41:46.778
And it never really
works, but I try.

00:41:46.778 --> 00:41:47.570
SPEAKER 1: You try.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:48.530
OK.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.470
DERRICK BASKIN: I do that
because I love them and--

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.550
not just I love them,
but I really like them.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:54.020
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:56.395
DERRICK BASKIN: And not just
these guys, the entire cast.

00:41:56.395 --> 00:41:58.360
The women in our
cast are so major.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:58.930
JAMES HARKNESS: Our women are--

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:00.090
DERRICK BASKIN: They
hold down the cast.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:00.977
They hold us down.

00:42:00.977 --> 00:42:01.810
SPEAKER 1: The band.

00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:03.400
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah,
the band is ridiculous.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.550
They're the top of the top.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:08.870
We recruited the top of the
top because this music is just

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:11.120
so iconic that you can't
have just a regular--

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.280
someone who just
learned to play violin.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:12.988
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:42:12.988 --> 00:42:13.678
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:13.678 --> 00:42:15.470
DERRICK BASKIN: I want
to play Temps music.

00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.365
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:18.365 --> 00:42:23.040
We got the best of the
best supporting us.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.990
But we just genuinely
like each other,

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.000
and that just makes it easy.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.820
JAMES HARKNESS: This isn't this
for now, for this interview.

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:32.250
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.875
JAMES HARKNESS: This
is what it's like.

00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:36.470
Before we go on stage
for our first number,

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.550
after we circle
up, the stupidity--

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.390
I often wonder how much
the audience can hear.

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:47.707
Because right before we go out,
sometimes we are the laughing--

00:42:47.707 --> 00:42:49.040
JEREMY POPE: We're still laugh--

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.950
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.950
JAMES HARKNESS: Until the
second of walking out,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.830
we are laughing because of
something that has happened.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.580
JEREMY POPE: Yeah.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.413
JAMES HARKNESS: And
it's an incredible thing

00:42:57.413 --> 00:42:59.800
to get to do that in a show.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.880
'Cause we spend--

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.770
I don't know how it
is for you guys here,

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:08.720
but we spend almost half
of our lives, if not more,

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.930
at the theater and
with these people.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:14.300
So to be able to
come into a place

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.920
where you look forward to seeing
the people that you work with,

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.870
and you look forward
to them every day

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.240
because you know,
if nothing else,

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.460
you're just going to get this.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.217
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:43:27.217 --> 00:43:29.300
JAMES HARKNESS: And then
to the other perspective,

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.220
you're going to get the--

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.070
I have-- my stomach has
hurt from laughing so much.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.320
SPEAKER 1: I know the feeling.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.200
JAMES HARKNESS: You
know what I mean?

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.242
Or you get-- and you also
get these conversations

00:43:39.242 --> 00:43:40.890
where we sit and we talk.

00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.050
DERRICK BASKIN: Yeah.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:43.880
JAMES HARKNESS:
We have real talk.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.940
And there's no-- it's
no uncomfortableness.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:51.832
We're able to actually talk
to each other about life.

00:43:51.832 --> 00:43:52.790
SPEAKER 1: I love that.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.810
I love that.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.610
Let's jump into some questions.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.610
But before we do, I
just wanted to make sure

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:00.620
that everyone had an
opportunity to throw

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.370
their name into the ticket
draw, as we're giving

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.920
away three tickets to the show.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.988
JAMES HARKNESS: And then you can
give me one of those tickets.

00:44:09.988 --> 00:44:11.738
SPEAKER 1: And maybe
I can go again, yeah?

00:44:11.738 --> 00:44:13.323
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:13.323 --> 00:44:15.740
If you have a question, there's
mics set up on both sides.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.250
Go ahead.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:22.985
AUDIENCE: So obviously, I think
The Temptations have appealed

00:44:22.985 --> 00:44:25.310
to generation after generation.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:28.100
Who do you feel like is the
craziest type of audience?

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.010
Is it the older folks, who
like, this was their music

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.700
of their youth?

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.440
Or is it people
our age, younger?

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.690
JAWAN M. JACKSON: Older folks.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:36.450
JAMES HARKNESS: The older folks.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.000
JAWAN M. JACKSON: Older folks.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.250
We've had--

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.250
JEREMY POPE: You have.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:41.417
JAWAN M. JACKSON: I've had--

00:44:41.417 --> 00:44:43.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:45.370
I come out the stage door
and they're screaming.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:48.190
And then one lady grabbed me
by-- she was an older lady.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.180
She grabbed me by my hoodie and
pulled me and was like, Melvin,

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:51.680
come here.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.923
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.590
And then she pulled
me and she was like,

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.100
say something in my
ear in your deep voice.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.098
Say it, say it, say it.

00:44:57.098 --> 00:44:57.598
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:57.598 --> 00:44:59.590
And I'm like, OK.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.703
I'm like, you know I play
the character, right?

00:45:01.703 --> 00:45:02.620
I'm not really Melvin.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.060
It's a testament to the people
that we're playing on stage.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.370
Anytime Eddie goes to
sing, women are screaming.

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:14.660
When David comes around,
his entrance, the audience

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.340
goes wild.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:19.520
And you can just hear they were
just living their teenage years

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.980
all over again
because of the bass

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.700
line and just the excitement
of David Ruffin coming back.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.130
And everything that's happened--

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:32.246
I think we had underwear thrown
on stage to us, you know?

00:45:32.246 --> 00:45:34.080
The experience, it's crazy.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.082
It's crazy.

00:45:36.082 --> 00:45:37.790
JAMES HARKNESS: And
it is the older crowd

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:39.650
because like-- was
it a couple of nights

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:43.240
ago, where we had this lady who
sounded like someone's auntie.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.513
And she was like, well?

00:45:45.513 --> 00:45:46.430
DERRICK BASKIN: Hello.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:47.347
JAMES HARKNESS: Hello.

00:45:47.347 --> 00:45:48.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:49.687
All right.

00:45:49.687 --> 00:45:50.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:50.225 --> 00:45:51.350
DERRICK BASKIN: It's crazy.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.725
JAMES HARKNESS:
We were like, OK.

00:45:52.725 --> 00:45:53.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.870
There you go.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:57.525
SPEAKER 1: Go ahead.

00:45:57.525 --> 00:45:59.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for coming.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.310
This was a really
great interview.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.030
My question is-- wait,
I forgot my question.

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.620
Oh, I got it.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.120
OK.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:05.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:07.815
So this came up a bunch of
times in various answers

00:46:07.815 --> 00:46:10.220
that the experience of doing
this show, the cast and crew

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.370
has been very supportive, and
a lot of warmth and stuff.

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:14.690
What do you all think--

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.220
even going back to auditions,
what do y'all think accounts

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:16.720
for that?

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:17.450
Why is that?

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:18.800
Why is it like that?

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.570
JAMES HARKNESS: I think
it starts from the top,

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:24.810
and that is with our producers.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.470
They have so much
love for this project.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:28.970
Tom Hulce and Ira Pittelman.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:29.555
DERRICK BASKIN: They're here.

00:46:29.555 --> 00:46:30.020
JAWAN M. JACKSON: They're here.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.270
JAMES HARKNESS: They are here.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:33.704
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.010
They have so much
love for this project.

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.900
They have been wanting
to put this together

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.250
for the longest time.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:46.450
When that love starts at
the top, it trickles down.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.790
All the people that have
been brought on board,

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.650
they all have this love.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:53.500
What I have said about-- when
people have asked me about what

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.220
the rehearsal process has been
like, I was like, we all have--

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.850
we've all done enough
stuff as performers,

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.930
as producers, as directors,
as choreographers, et cetera,

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.090
to have some sort of ego.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.580
And you need an ego to
survive in the world.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.260
You need an ego to
survive in this business.

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:14.320
But what I have loved
about this process

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.410
is that ego is put to the side.

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:24.230
Everyone's focus is on this show
and where it needs to get to.

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:27.850
So that's why the experience
has been so supportive.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:30.600
Everyone's heart is
in the same place.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.600
JAWAN M. JACKSON: We're
here to serve the piece.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.970
I think that's the common goal,
to tell this story truthfully.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.060
And that's with all
19 of us collectively

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.760
just coming and making sure
that we tell a story that's

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.910
authentic, that's
heartwarming, that gives

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.525
back as much as is given to us.

00:47:48.525 --> 00:47:49.400
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.190
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.790
SPEAKER 1: I think that is it.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.040
JAMES HARKNESS: Two questions?

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:54.760
We got two questions.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.660
SPEAKER 1: Maybe one more.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.260
JAMES HARKNESS: Come on now.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.030
SPEAKER 1: You want to go again?

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah, is that OK?

00:47:58.155 --> 00:47:59.020
SPEAKER 1: Go ahead.

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:03.292
AUDIENCE: So this show obviously
is using pre-existing music.

00:48:03.292 --> 00:48:04.750
Is it hard to make
these songs that

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:06.430
already exist tell
the story that you're

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.148
trying to tell with the show?

00:48:08.148 --> 00:48:09.440
JAMES HARKNESS: Absolutely not.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.898
JEREMY POPE: No,
I think what I did

00:48:10.898 --> 00:48:14.230
is when I first got the
script, when I was auditioning,

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:17.110
I sat down and I
just read the script

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:19.450
and played the songs
as it went along.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.090
I think we're fortunate that
we know some of these songs

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:25.670
and it's not music that we
have to introduce to you.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.310
So a lot of the times--

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.330
and I think Dominique did just
such a brilliant job of using

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:37.270
it to storytell the piece and
to push the piece forward,

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:42.980
and what she's trying to
get across to the audience.

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.800
So I think it hasn't been hard.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.570
And I also think there
was never pressure.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:48.640
People have asked me,
do you have pressure

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:53.650
to imitate the sound or these
icons that you're playing?

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:57.670
And I don't think any of us had
that pressure because we knew

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.340
that there was a piece of
Eddie, there was a piece of Paul

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.270
within us.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:04.180
And it was just us being
open to the process

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.160
to allow that to come out.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.080
And I don't think you,
at the time, knew.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.880
I didn't know how
similar my voice was

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:11.920
or my essence was to Eddie.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.780
I never was thinking that
is a person I want to play.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.920
But I'm so grateful that I'm
able to portray him and bring

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.460
him back for a night--
for the audiences.

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.000
So I think just we were--
in the rehearsal process,

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.910
it was kind of like bring
yourself to the piece.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.170
Be used in that way.

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:31.120
And then somehow,
the audience response

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.670
is you were just like Eddie
and you were just like Otis.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.350
And Derrick doesn't
necessarily look

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:38.200
like a carbon copy of
Otis, but his heart,

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:41.980
his intentions, they're so
grounded that they remind you,

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:43.930
they bring you back
to being in the room

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:45.430
or in the presence
of Otis Williams.

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:46.722
So that's just been really fun.

00:49:46.722 --> 00:49:49.780
JAMES HARKNESS: And the lyrical
components of their music--

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.180
again, their music is timeless.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.140
You know what I mean?

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:58.240
So a song, "segregation,
determination, demonstration,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.670
integration,
aggravation, humiliation,

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:03.280
obligation to our nation."

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:07.360
Someone could have written
those words today for a song,

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.705
but that's "Ball of Confusion,"
which was written in the '70s.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:17.230
It's not that difficult
with music, with a catalog

00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:18.430
like they have.

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:20.150
DERRICK BASKIN: I think they--

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.340
first, I'm putting words
into our playwright's mouth,

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:29.770
but you have to first figure
out what story you want to tell.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:33.880
So I think her and Dez,
and also Tom and Ira,

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.730
probably sat around a table
and said, OK, now, there's

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:40.030
a lot of stories you can
tell about The Temptations.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.400
How do we want to
tell it and what is it

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.040
that we actually want to tell?

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.020
And so once they
figured that out, OK,

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:52.510
now what songs are relevant
to those stories, and how can

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.500
we put them--

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.900
how can we sequence
them so that we

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:57.910
keep the story moving forward?

00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:03.370
And there was a time where
we had one song in the show.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:06.070
Right before the title song,
which is "Ain't Too Proud,"

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:10.150
we had another song and we
sang those songs back to back.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:12.738
And then we were like,
well, we don't necessarily

00:51:12.738 --> 00:51:14.530
need that song because
it's not necessarily

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.250
forwarding the story.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:17.650
So let's get rid of this song.

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:19.198
And that was my favorite song.

00:51:19.198 --> 00:51:21.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:25.840
But I think they figured out
the story they wanted to tell,

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:30.580
and then they picked the
songs based on the story.

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:34.690
We talk about "Papa
Was a Rolling Stone,"

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:39.670
and we use that phrase in
a couple of different ways.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:43.760
I have a son in the show.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.960
And so we use that to
reference, actually, my son,

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.650
you know what I mean?

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:51.010
And so they did a
really, really good job

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:58.650
of making the lyrics
literal to our story.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.070
First of all, thank you.

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:09.820
In this show, you
portray real people.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:13.270
For some of you, people
who you met in real life.

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.300
How is the process of
working on that role

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.980
different than
made-up characters?

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.070
Is there a difference?

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.570
DERRICK BASKIN: Well, my person
is the only one that's still

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.150
living, and we all met him.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:28.210
We call him Uncle
O. He's our uncle.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.130
Very affectionately,
we call him Uncle O.

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:34.930
And I think he was the window,
or the doorway, for all of us

00:52:34.930 --> 00:52:37.090
to get to know all of
our particular characters

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.230
because he knows
them intimately.

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:43.900
I got to know him specifically,
but there's no better person

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:48.175
to hear from than someone's best
friend or someone's brother.

00:52:48.175 --> 00:52:52.100
He can tell you stories
about Eddie, about Paul,

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.350
about Melvin, about
David that you

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:57.740
won't hear in an autobiography.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:02.342
And so I can't really
speak for them.

00:53:02.342 --> 00:53:07.280
Y'all can do that,
but talking with him,

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.853
there's just no greater source--

00:53:08.853 --> 00:53:10.520
there's no greater
wealth of information

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.470
than to actually speak to
the guy you're portraying.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.940
I can read a million
books and it still

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:20.600
won't be enough to having
one sit-down with him

00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.260
for five to 10 minutes.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:22.760
Yeah.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.877
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so
much for your question.

00:53:24.877 --> 00:53:26.210
Thank you guys again for coming.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:27.752
Let's give another
round of applause.

00:53:27.752 --> 00:53:30.700
[APPLAUSE]
