ANDREW BROGDON: Hey, everybody.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.890
Welcome back to another
episode of the Boring Show.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.970
Today we're mixing
things up a little bit.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.690
Normally it's a couple members
of the DevRel team for Flutter

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.210
or the Flutter Engineering
Team, but today

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.479
we actually have three different
Google Developer experts

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.770
that are in the studio with us.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.275
And you're going to get a
chance to hear from all of them.

00:00:25.275 --> 00:00:26.650
And then all four
of us are going

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.660
to take your
questions at the end.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.880
So we have a full house
here in the studio.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.970
And we're starting
with Iiro Krankka.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.160
Am I saying that correctly?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.535
IIRO KRANKKA:
That's pretty good.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.590
ANDREW BROGDON: Thank goodness.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.770
And so we're going to be talking
about his InKeno app, which

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.520
is one of the sample apps that
we reference in our samples

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.370
index about being as a
particularly good model for how

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.470
to develop something
that's really big.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.210
And in recent development,
it's now a multi-platform app.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.690
So you are sharing
code between Flutter

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.250
and a web app at the same time.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.439
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes, exactly.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:01.980
ANDREW BROGDON:
Which is pretty cool.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.563
And so we're going
to talk about that,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.510
and we're going to talk about
how Redux is working for you.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.480
And just sort of get our
hands dirty with this code

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.720
and take a look at it.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.210
So if you would like
to find this app,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.820
you can find it in
the curated samples

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.150
index that's part of the
Flutter/samples depot.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.060
The app is called InKeno,
and all the source

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.530
is available in
Iiro's GitHub account.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.510
And let's take a look.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.320
So I've got it right here.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.070
Let's take a look at
the web app itself.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.200
So this is your web app.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.700
And this is a recent
development, right?

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.070
This came out just recently.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.635
It lists-- actually,
why don't you

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:42.510
tell us a little bit
about what the app does.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.060
IIRO KRANKKA: Well,
basically I built up the app

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.310
to scratch my own
itch, because I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
live right next to [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.350
And the official app kind of--

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.090
there's a lot of improving that.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.420
It takes like five seconds to
even go and see the showtimes.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.430
I was like, well
I'm sitting here,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.180
so why don't I just take a look
and see if I can improve it.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.680
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah, be the change.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.138
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah, and then
I found out that they actually

00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:16.670
have this really
nice modern XMLAPI,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.570
it's not the fanciest
season, but it's still like--

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.030
ANDREW BROGDON:
Oh, that's right.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.660
That's another thing that your
app does that not everybody--

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.010
a lot of times you're
using JSON so much

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.730
and you're actually passing
XML, is really interesting.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.770
So it's a good example
for that reason, as well.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:30.596
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:02:30.596 --> 00:02:31.970
ANDREW BROGDON:
And so you have--

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:32.680
let me pull up.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.277
I've got it running in an
iOS simulator right here.

00:02:36.277 --> 00:02:38.360
And so this is just listing
what's in the theaters

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.860
right now?

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.752
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah, it's listing
what's in Helsinki [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:46.710
ANDREW BROGDON: If anyone
happens to be nearby.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.460
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.640
ANDREW BROGDON: And so you've
got a listing screen here.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.110
We can go into Spike
Lee's latest thing.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.539
We've got cast
photos and a gallery.

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.080
IIRO KRANKKA: Probably
what I usually

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.000
do with this app is that
if you go one screen back.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.210
And click on the showtimes
on the bottom navigation.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.630
So you can see what's
currently playing there,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.520
and all those show
times, and you can

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.420
see which movies are playing.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.940
And if you click
that yellow button

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.440
you can actually buy tickets.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.899
But it's redirecting.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.440
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so you're
doing the URL launcher probably

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.270
packaged to get out?

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.186
IIRO KRANKKA: Exactly.

00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:26.560
ANDREW BROGDON: Awesome.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.710
It looks like you've got a
sliver app bar at the top,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.580
I'm guessing?

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.010
IIRO KRANKKA: No that's
actually something--

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.560
I didn't know about
sliver app bars

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.640
back then when I first did this,
so this is something like--

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.430
ANDREW BROGDON: You
just custom wrote it.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.010
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.010
ANDREW BROGDON: Awesome.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.550
IIRO KRANKKA: Don't
look at the code.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.980
ANDREW BROGDON: I have
a lot of code that way.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:48.730
But this is great.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.240
OK, let's look at the code here.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.230
OK, so the main point here
is that like across those--

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.400
did you actually
show the web app?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.540
So that's for web as well.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.710
So when you can show the
sometimes on the web, as well.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.200
Click on the details page.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.610
IIRO KRANKKA: This is the
web version of the screen

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.151
that I was just
looking at basically.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.160
Yes, exactly.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.300
So it's on the web as well.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.810
It's responsive, so it's a
progressive web app, as well.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.561
So the web app works offline.

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.060
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh
wow, that's nice.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.610
IIRO KRANKKA: And It works
in a mobile device as well.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.540
And you can install that to
your home screens as well.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.260
And the main thing is that I'm
serving like 40 percent of code

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.212
between those two apps.

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:36.170
ANDREW BROGDON: So 40%.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.710
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.460
ANDREW BROGDON: That's
a nice time saving.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.670
OK.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.300
And so let's go back in here.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.280
This is the mobile--

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.970
this is the Flutter app itself.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.620
And then you have
core, which is--

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.010
IIRO KRANKKA:
[INAUDIBLE] Secrets.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.290
Is he blowing the screen?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.300
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, I
just leaked an API key.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.480
So that'll get blurred
in post-production.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.220
My bad on that one.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.300
You have a core
that's a shared code.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.800
Let's just close this file here.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.550
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.230
ANDREW BROGDON: This is
shared between the two, right?

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.220
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.430
ANDREW BROGDON: Then you
have a web project here

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.180
that has additional code
for the web presenentation.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.346
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah, this
is basically the main entry

00:05:16.346 --> 00:05:17.660
point for the web app.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.890
ANDREW BROGDON: And this
is written in Dart as well?

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.520
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.710
ANDREW BROGDON: OK,
do you love Dart?

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.769
I see an NG in here.

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:23.310
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah,
it's Anglo darts.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.430
It was actually pretty
cool to do that.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.370
ANDREW BROGDON: Nice.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.900
Well let's take a look real
quick at the mobile project.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.410
I'm curious.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.419
So you use Redux just as your
state management for this.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.210
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.530
ANDREW BROGDON: And I know we
get a lot of state management

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.920
questions.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.961
People are wondering about
the various approaches

00:05:38.961 --> 00:05:41.690
because Flutter isn't
opinionated in that way.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.500
You can sort of do
it however you want.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.090
Let's talk about
that real quick.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.580
So where is the Redux code.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.990
Is that in core?

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.930
IIRO KRANKKA: It's in the core.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.990
So basically what
we didn't discuss

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.910
is that I have three projects.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.870
So one is the core project,
which has all that business

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.180
logic, all the shared code.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.450
Then we have mobile project,
which is this other project,

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.017
and then we have web,
which is the Angular code.

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:10.100
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so you
would have Angular code

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.450
sort of managing presentation
of the core stuff for the web?

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.620
IIRO KRANKKA: Well, yeah.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.290
So the Angular
project imports core

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.900
in the web project and
the mobile project,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.105
which is Flutter,
imports also the code.

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:26.480
ANDREW BROGDON: And then sort
of makes widgets out of it,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.900
I imagine.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.649
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:30.830
So the goal is to keep
the UI layers as dumb

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.705
and lean as possible and have
all the logic in the core.

00:06:33.705 --> 00:06:34.580
ANDREW BROGDON: Cool.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.980
IIRO KRANKKA: So you
will probably have--

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.380
this is the core, this is
the [INAUDIBLE],, TMDB, API.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.960
This Is probably not the most
interesting process here.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.769
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:43.560
What can I pull up?

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.441
Where's something that's
making a reducer or somethign

00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:47.940
ike that?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.610
IIRO KRANKKA: Probably only
the theater, or actor or--

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.350
ANDREW BROGDON: Here?

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.060
IIRO KRANKKA: For
example, that one.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.730
ANDREW BROGDON: So this
is Middleware for Redux.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.387
IIRO KRANKKA: For the theater
listing, this is that one.

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:04.880
ANDREW BROGDON: So let's see.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.980
IIRO KRANKKA: So there's a
lot of career- related to--

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.390
for example, if you live
right next to Helsinki,

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.220
then it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.410
And you use that the first
time when you open the app.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.320
You don't want to do that
every time you open the app.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.170
So it's persisting
that to locally.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.920
ANDREW BROGDON: OK

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.770
IIRO KRANKKA: So that every
time you open the app,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.100
it remembers stuff.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.950
And that's actually
interesting part of this.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.890
So if you can go to
the [INAUDIBLE] point

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.700
of the Flutter or web app.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.610
The main file.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.070
Yeah, here.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:48.050
So basically here's
the function code--

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.150
like, on 17th line.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.471
If you come and click
on the Create Store.

00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:54.970
Oh.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.469
OK.

00:07:58.217 --> 00:08:00.050
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me
go to the mobile one.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.520
I'll probably have
an easier time

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.450
navigating through the code.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.033
IIRO KRANKKA: Well, but it might
be that it doesn't work here.

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:07.090
Like, I set up
something special for--

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.330
OK, awesome.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.980
So this is basically the code
that creates the Redux store.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.790
And it takes in the client
and key value store.

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.190
And this is the
thing that you will

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.080
encounter when you're sharing
code between web and mobile.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.610
So if you want to
purchase something,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.984
Android has shared preferences.

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:28.900
ANDREW BROGDON: Right.

00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:32.000
IIRO KRANKKA: IS has
NS user defaults.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.750
And web has local stores.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.627
And how do you--

00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:38.960
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, we've
sort of got that worked out.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.730
In the world of mobile,
we have the local storage,

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.324
which will handle the
details of mapping to IOS

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:45.490
storage and Android storage.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:46.870
IIRO KRANKKA: You mean serve
preference the blogging?

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.480
ANDREW BROGDON: There you go.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.280
IIRO KRANKKA: I'm
using that on mobile.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.540
ANDREW BROGDON: But that
doesn't help you on the web.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.680
You have to come up
with your own thing.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.470
IIRO KRANKKA: You cannot import
Flutter in the core module.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.310
And you cannot import
web into core module.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.330
So how do you do that?

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.910
Basically here-- this is the
way you create the Redux store.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:07.620
And it takes in the
key value store.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.030
And this is actually
packets that I made.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.590
So key value store
is an absolute class

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.720
that defines the interface for
storing key and value fares.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.960
And then on the web, I have
a web implementation of that.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.030
And on the mobile, we have a
mobile implementation of that.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.100
So if you go back to
the main dodge file

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.010
that you have open
there, it's in the--

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.510
other.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.380
ANDREW BROGDON: One up

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.217
IIRO KRANKKA: We inject
Flutter key value store here.

00:09:38.217 --> 00:09:40.050
ANDREW BROGDON: It fills
out this interface.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.980
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.310
ANDREW BROGDON: And it's
using shared prefs there.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.970
IIRO KRANKKA: So this is
the Flutter project and we--

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.430
in the main entry
point of that, we

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.400
insect Flutter key
value store, which

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.260
is basically delegating all the
calls to shared preferences.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.804
And on the web project we
have the same set up going on.

00:09:57.804 --> 00:09:58.970
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.050
IIRO KRANKKA: I made
a plug-in for this.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.092
I mean, the library.

00:10:02.092 --> 00:10:03.550
And it's published
on [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.954
I didn't advertise it just yet.

00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:07.120
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.909
So is it a Dart package
rather than a Flutter package?

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.700
IIRO KRANKKA: It's
actually three packages.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.783
ANDREW BROGDON: Of course.

00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:15.160
IIRO KRANKKA: So
one package just

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.580
for the app set class, and one
packet just for the Flutter

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.080
implementation, and
one for the web.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.621
ANDREW BROGDON: That's really
great that you open sourced it,

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.020
then somebody else can
come along and use it.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.710
I have a feeling
we're going to start

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.110
getting more questions
about reusing code

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.270
as Dart as a language,
I think, progresses

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.470
and gets more popular.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:33.460
I think we're going
to start seeing

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.600
more questions like this.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.560
Interesting.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.160
IIRO KRANKKA: Is
there anything else?

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.743
ANDREW BROGDON: That
what I was about.

00:10:42.743 --> 00:10:47.300
So we covered that.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.690
We talked about looking at a
reducer in core too, right?

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.740
So a fairly simple one.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.090
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.298
ANDREW BROGDON: So let's see.

00:10:57.298 --> 00:11:01.000
You've got-- Theater Reducer.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.829
So you're checking
the action type here.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:03.620
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.510
ANDREW BROGDON: And then are
your state objects immutable?

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:07.970
I see you're using Copy With.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.500
IIRO KRANKKA: That's
just a manual thing

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.470
that I did because I
didn't want to use field

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.170
value for this project
because this is supposed

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.000
to be a sample project.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.309
And I already have like
Redux, Flutter, Angukar, Dot.

00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:22.850
ANDREW BROGDON: You have a few
dependencies involved already?

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:23.841
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:26.450
So I wanted to--

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.910
so that people can
just clone it and just

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.640
start running it as
easy as possible.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.370
But basically,
what [INAUDIBLE] is

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.650
like-- it takes in current
state and an action,

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:41.060
and returns a new state.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.340
So if there's an action,
it knows to handle handler,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.120
it will update
the current state.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.670
Or otherwise it will
just return the kernel.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.289
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:11:55.289 --> 00:11:57.830
IIRO KRANKKA: What do you find
more most interesting in this?

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.190
Because, like, I've been looking
at this for a couple of months

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.592
now, so I'm kind
of deep into it--

00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:05.300
ANDREW BROGDON: I
think there are details

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.960
here that you would
have run into that I'm

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.110
curious how you solved.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.040
I assume you're
using Redux.dart.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.790
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.160
ANDREW BROGDON: The
sort of standard Redux

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.690
the implementation
that's out there.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.090
And I think Brain even works on,
along with some other people.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.820
What about something
like routing?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:28.290
How do you handle that
within Flutter, for example?

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.460
So say you're sitting on
this theater listening

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.770
that you have-- let me
pull it back up real quick.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.966
So you're sitting here--

00:12:34.966 --> 00:12:36.590
IIRO KRANKKA: The
listening is actually

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.810
on the main place marker.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.179
So that's on the other listing.

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:40.970
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.330
What about the movie listing
that you have to start?

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.597
Down here.

00:12:45.597 --> 00:12:47.180
So if I tap on one
of these, I'm going

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.260
to go to a separate screen.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:48.860
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.776
ANDREW BROGDON: Right.

00:12:49.776 --> 00:12:52.190
Have you already loaded all
of the data for that screen?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.180
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.230
So that's how the [INAUDIBLE]
nice XML [INAUDIBLE] works.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.870
It just throws all
the data that it has.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.500
There's no--

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.260
ANDREW BROGDON: Here's
a giant XML file.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.010
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.090
Good luck with that.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.250
So I already have
the event object.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.842
So just pass that
to the next route.

00:13:09.842 --> 00:13:11.300
ANDREW BROGDON:
That's interesting.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.757
So how do you pass
this giant XML file?

00:13:14.757 --> 00:13:17.090
Do you do that in another
isolate or anything like that?

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.500
Or do you do it asynchronously?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.570
IIRO KRANKKA: It has had
been working quite well

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.510
just doing it in the same
thread that I'm currently in.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.300
So I didn't have to use any
isolates or anything like that.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.369
it works quite fine without it.

00:13:29.369 --> 00:13:31.160
ANDREW BROGDON:
Interesting, because that's

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.892
in the Vox [INAUDIBLE]
that we've been working on,

00:13:33.892 --> 00:13:36.350
there are issues where I want
to go to a different screen--

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.900
so obviously Flutter
supports that very well.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.420
You have a navigator widget
that you can push routes to.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.900
But then how do you remember,
oh I'm on the details screen

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.390
now for this particular
session at a conference.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.350
I might need to refresh that
data and go make a JSON call.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.139
And that was something
that that app needed

00:13:54.139 --> 00:13:56.180
to do that it sounds like
you, because of the way

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.740
the back end was
designed, you just

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.490
didn't even have to worry
about it, which is nice.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.820
IIRO KRANKKA: There's no
way to me to do that even.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.000
Like, I cannot do it.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.600
It's a fun little API.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.759
For example, if you go
the event name cleaner.

00:14:13.759 --> 00:14:15.800
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, that's
a fun name for a file.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.070
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.403
ANDREW BROGDON: What do we have?

00:14:17.403 --> 00:14:18.110
I see rejects.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.026
IIRO KRANKKA: And the
best case for that, it's

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.670
in the test folder, so you can--

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.254
there's a lot of
funny stuff going on.

00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:25.420
ANDREW BROGDON: That's good.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.320
Yeah, how are you
testing this actually?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.820
IIRO KRANKKA: If you go to the
YouTube folder and see there.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.340
Yeah, that's one.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.590
ANDREW BROGDON: So many tests.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.339
You're so much more
disciplined than I am.

00:14:35.339 --> 00:14:38.590
IIRO KRANKKA: So, for
example, this one is like--

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.880
it's a finicky API returns.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.370
It thinks that like Avengers
Infinity War 2D, and 3D,

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.900
and 2D dub and 2D original
are different movies.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.440
Which means that if you go
to the movie poster create,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.750
you will get six same posters.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:59.930
So I had to do this.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.460
That cleans up all the noise,
and so it normalizes the names.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.720
And there's a lot of
these cases, because it--

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.580
ANDREW BROGDON: Always happens.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.330
IIRO KRANKKA: Yes.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.010
ANDREW BROGDON:
It's always happens.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.149
IIRO KRANKKA: I already
added a lot of cases there.

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:15.440
ANDREW BROGDON: They have
the sing along for Mamma Mia.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.245
IIRO KRANKKA: Yeah.

00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:17.120
ANDREW BROGDON: Nice.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.620
IIRO KRANKKA: And sing along
is different than the Mamma Mia

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:20.412
original, you know?

00:15:20.412 --> 00:15:21.911
ANDREW BROGDON:
That's the one where

00:15:21.911 --> 00:15:24.200
you go and the audience gets
to be loud and sing along

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.130
with the songs?

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:25.460
IIRO KRANKKA: I don't know.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.540
I never went there.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.590
ANDREW BROGDON: Maybe
somebody in the comments

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.390
can let us know, I think
that's how it works.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.056
IIRO KRANKKA: I don't
have a girlfriend,

00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:34.790
so nobody is making
me go into those.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.210
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.040
I think we're about
done with our segment.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.540
I really appreciate you spending
some time with us today.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.320
Is there anything else you think
other developers should know?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.532
Let's tell them.

00:15:45.532 --> 00:15:46.990
IIRO KRANKKA: I'm
going to just say

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.080
that it was a fun
experience to do that.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.680
We're doing that
as work, as well.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.740
It's open source,
so check it out.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.520
And I feel like it's actually
really, really good reference.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.317
And I'm going to do an
article series about it.

00:16:02.317 --> 00:16:03.400
ANDREW BROGDON: Excellent.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.870
IIRO KRANKKA: So I think you
can put the link somewhere

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.050
in the box down there
or something like that.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.320
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure, we will.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.070
Yeah, like I said,
this is a really good--

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.180
as you can see from the
size this code base,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.110
Iiro is doing some things
that are definitely

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.240
models for how other
app developers might

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.170
want to do them.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.628
So if you're using
Redux, if you're

00:16:24.628 --> 00:16:27.040
sharing code between
the web and mobile,

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.470
if you want to see some
very well-made tests,

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:33.190
by the looks of it, this
looks like a great sample.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:36.520
You can find it on GitHub
under Fluttersesh/samples.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.200
It's in our index, and thanks
for coming on the show.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.420
IIRO KRANKKA: Thanks for--

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.671
it's awesome to be
awesomely boring.

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:47.170
Thanks.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:48.253
ANDREW BROGDON: Yes it is.

00:16:48.253 --> 00:16:51.070
All right, so we're going
to take a real quick break.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.620
And we're going to bring in our
next expert in just a second.

00:16:56.347 --> 00:16:58.180
All right so we switched
up the seating now.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.240
I'm here with Pawan Kumar,
Google developer expert

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.119
in Flutter, whom you may
know from YouTube and GitHub.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.200
And our curated list of
samples on the samples

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.150
repo you make an appearance.

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.050
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.633
ANDREW BROGDON: You
have a whole bunch

00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:14.109
of Flutter example apps here.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.000
A lot of good UI stuff.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.442
There's a lot of UI layer--

00:17:18.442 --> 00:17:19.900
however you want
to present things,

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.720
you can probably find
an example in this repo.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.290
There's a ton of stuff.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:26.270
And, of course, you also
make your own videos.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.800
PAWAN KUMAR: Correct.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.550
ANDREW BROGDON: Under
the name Mtechviral.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.360
You have, I think, more videos
than I have made for Flutter.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.150
You have dozens?

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.470
PAWAN KUMAR: No, hundreds.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.080
ANDREW BROGDON: Hundreds.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.600
PAWAN KUMAR: We have
around 120 Flutter videos,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.540
and around more than
10 dot videos, then

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.192
10 plus fire based videos with
Flutter, so a lot of stuff.

00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:51.400
ANDREW BROGDON: That's a lot.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.210
You have almost 18,000
subscribers and so on.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.201
So much like--

00:17:56.201 --> 00:17:58.450
I would recommend taking a
look at his Github samples.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.550
Also Mtechviral on YouTube.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.700
Highly recommended.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.890
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah,
you should watch it.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:04.780
ANDREW BROGDON: And so
you've got something

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.760
that you coded up just
for us today, right?

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.880
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes, yes.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.290
So these are very small things,
which I wanted to just to color

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:15.370
because when we make any
project we miss some stuff.

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.650
And because of
these things we have

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:21.440
to use a lot of other
widgets to achieve this.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.490
But we can achieve it
in a very easy way.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.660
So that's what I
wanted to cover.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.010
So this is our menu page.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.100
So if you can just--

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:34.360
ANDREW BROGDON: Start on
commenting bodies here?

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.068
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:18:35.068 --> 00:18:37.210
ANDREW BROGDON: Which one
do you recommend first?

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.650
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.945
So you have to import it.

00:18:39.945 --> 00:18:41.320
ANDREW BROGDON:
Sure, no problem.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:49.200
PAWAN KUMAR: [INAUDIBLE]
Like this, maybe.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.560
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah I can.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.450
PAWAN KUMAR: So,
as you can see--

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.190
OK.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:58.210
So in a row, if we
have multiple widgets,

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.529
then you can see that
the overflow exception.

00:19:01.529 --> 00:19:03.070
ANDREW BROGDON: The
black and yellow,

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.900
yeah I'm angry l kind
of thing from Flutter.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.850
PAWAN KUMAR: So suppose we have
like four items in one row.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:12.010
And there can be
scenarios where we

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:17.170
don't want to make those
items appear in the next line

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.550
or maybe somewhere else.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.690
We just want them
in the single line.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.590
And in those items,
Flutter's box

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.560
is going to be a
very good widget.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.440
So if it just--

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.620
you sample and then
it's just put SOL--

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.799
S-O-L-- after this.

00:19:31.799 --> 00:19:33.340
ANDREW BROGDON: Let
me shrink this up

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.631
a little bit so we can see it--

00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:36.010
PAWAN KUMAR: Much better.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.920
So here you have to write SOL.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.147
Capital S and OL.

00:19:40.147 --> 00:19:41.230
ANDREW BROGDON: Like that?

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.980
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.810
And just import that.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.560
Yes.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.640
ANDREW BROGDON: So this
is the fixed version.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.750
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes, this
is the fixed version.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.080
ANDREW BROGDON: Well, hold on.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.760
Let's real quick,
let's go into this

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.560
and see the code that
we were using before.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.552
So there's a row up here.

00:19:52.552 --> 00:19:54.010
PAWAN KUMAR: There's
a row up here.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:55.780
ANDREW BROGDON: And
just raised button

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:57.885
sized box, just
like you would do

00:19:57.885 --> 00:19:59.260
if you were
confident you weren't

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.343
going to run out of space.

00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:01.300
PAWAN KUMAR: Correct.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.355
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:20:02.355 --> 00:20:04.300
PAWAN KUMAR: So, then
if you'll just show--

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.091
ANDREW BROGDON: This
is the solution, then.

00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:07.580
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.400
And now you can see,
everything is fixed,

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.750
and everything is one line.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:15.070
So I will add just to the
widgets inside it itself.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.410
So that can be pretty
handy because sometimes you

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.620
don't want to actually use
multiple lines for showing

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.640
those widgets maybe because
you have small phones and maybe

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.760
other stuff.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.270
ANDREW BROGDON: So you fix this
with one additional widget?

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.020
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah, just one.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.870
ANDREW BROGDON:
Just one fitted box.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.495
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah,
just one fitted box.

00:20:31.495 --> 00:20:33.605
And you can specify the
fit type as well here.

00:20:33.605 --> 00:20:34.980
ANDREW BROGDON:
Oh, that's right.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.710
There's a property here.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.810
PAWAN KUMAR: It has a property.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:38.268
ANDREW BROGDON:
And it's a box fit?

00:20:38.268 --> 00:20:41.440
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes, so
it can be very useful.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.470
I have used it a lot.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:43.261
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:45.760
I've definitely abuse fitted
box with images and icons

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.820
before, I have not tried using
it with a whole row of thing.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.540
PAWAN KUMAR: So there's a
repository for the Flutter UI

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.440
kit where there was a card
section-- credit card section--

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.760
and when you enter some
text into that text field,

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.150
that it gets populated
inside that credit card.

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.810
And that was working fine,
but for small devices,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.820
there were some issues, right?

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.920
And even if you are
using the media quality

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.140
to get the size,
then also you don't

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.350
want to actually have
those credit card

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.820
numbers in the next line.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.400
So in that scenario, fitted
box was very helpful for me.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.520
So desk size was
reduced a little bit,

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.002
but because the phone
size is also small,

00:21:27.002 --> 00:21:28.210
it kind of works pretty well.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:28.870
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, yeah.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.790
So I've yet to see a
credit card where it wraps

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.900
the number to the next line.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:32.790
PAWAN KUMAR: Correct.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.520
So the UI was not
looking good after that,

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.580
so it's much better to
use this fitted box.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.791
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:21:40.791 --> 00:21:41.290
Let's see.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:41.460
is.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.570
So there's a row sample?

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.597
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah,
so this row sample.

00:21:44.597 --> 00:21:46.430
If you just refresh it,
it's the same thing.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.554
ANDREW BROGDON: Same thing?

00:21:47.554 --> 00:21:51.310
PAWAN KUMAR: But the thing is,
we don't want to-- you can say

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.440
compress those things--

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.450
we want to show them
maybe in the next line,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.807
either vertically
or horizontally.

00:21:58.807 --> 00:21:59.390
So it depends.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.610
So you can just do that with
the wrap widget, which can be,

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.151
again, very useful.

00:22:05.151 --> 00:22:07.526
ANDREW BROGDON: Is there a
solution for this one as well?

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:08.450
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.450
ANDREW BROGDON: Not just
a hat rack, my friends.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.020
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.103
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:22:12.603 --> 00:22:15.080
PAWAN KUMAR: So you can
see, this looks really well.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.440
And it works also a la carte.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.240
You can use wrap for anything.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.950
And it has all the
same properties,

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.212
which our column has so.

00:22:23.212 --> 00:22:23.920
It kind of works.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.280
ANDREW BROGDON: That's right.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.980
You have alignment
properties as well?

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.520
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes, yes.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.960
It has the alignment.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.870
ANDREW BROGDON: Direction,
alignment spacing.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.710
PAWAN KUMAR: REM
spacing as well, so--

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.001
ANDREW BROGDON: So if I wanted
to come in here and say,

00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:37.900
does it take an inster?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.189
PAWAN KUMAR: It should
take a double, maybe?

00:22:40.189 --> 00:22:41.980
ANDREW BROGDON: So I
could come in and say,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.262
I want a whole bunch of
spacing between my widgets,

00:22:45.262 --> 00:22:46.720
and I can space
them out like that.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.100
PAWAN KUMAR: And it
looks kind of cool.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.990
And you don't have
to do anything right.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.250
You don't have to use some other
widgets for doing this task.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.580
You don't have to use expander
and flexible so that--

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.860
ANDREW BROGDON: Or inject
a bunch of padding.

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.960
PAWAN KUMAR: Padding is
also one thing I would

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.139
like people to avoid because--

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:06.430
ANDREW BROGDON: I see you're
using sized boxes to space

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:07.721
these out yourself like I used.

00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:10.770
PAWAN KUMAR: Size boxes are
always good because sometimes--

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.090
it also makes your code
cleaner so that's what I feel.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.717
So try to avoid padding
as much as you can, right?

00:23:18.717 --> 00:23:20.800
ANDREW BROGDON: Definitely
when spacing out things

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.860
within a single direction
list, I prefer size box.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.610
This has been a matter
of some discussion.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:26.390
PAWAN KUMAR: Correct.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.980
ANDREW BROGDON: Around
the Flutter team,

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:28.355
actually, because
a lot of people

00:23:28.355 --> 00:23:31.240
prefer using padding
whenever possible.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.360
PAWAN KUMAR: I don't
know, I prefer box a lot.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.460
Then we have this banner widget.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.230
I don't know of the user
fed, but we kind of fused it.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.100
So, as you can see,
there's no solution.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.120
That's just one sample.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.020
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh,
this is just a problem?

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.960
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.264
So you can see this can
be helpful like this.

00:23:49.264 --> 00:23:51.430
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, so is
this the banner down here?

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.104
PAWAN KUMAR: So there's
a widget for when if

00:23:53.104 --> 00:23:54.045
you go inside this--

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.810
but now you can.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.000
Ass this to location, as well.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.065
It kind of looks fancy, I guess.

00:24:03.065 --> 00:24:05.356
ANDREW BROGDON: This has got
to be the widget that they

00:24:05.356 --> 00:24:07.020
did the debug banner with.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.020
And they were just like,
if we had to make it,

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:09.890
we'll give it to everybody else.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.510
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah,
so actually one guy

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.340
asked me that there's a
debug ribbon on the top--

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.500
how to use that free one.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.840
I just sliced about it
and the repository itself,

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.230
and I got the banner widget.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.760
So I thought, maybe, it
can be useful for if you

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.280
are making a gift
application or something.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.488
ANDREW BROGDON: Can you put--

00:24:32.488 --> 00:24:35.022
I wonder-- can you
put a [INAUDIBLE] Do

00:24:35.022 --> 00:24:35.980
you know if that works?

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.637
I'm curious.

00:24:37.637 --> 00:24:38.720
PAWAN KUMAR: I believe so.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.640
It should work.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.339
Because, that's the beauty of--

00:24:41.339 --> 00:24:43.755
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, we're
supposed to compose things out

00:24:43.755 --> 00:24:44.470
of other things.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.820
PAWAN KUMAR: So let's
see if that works.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.620
ANDREW BROGDON: So it should
if I bring my log backup.

00:25:00.287 --> 00:25:01.620
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah, it's working.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.190
Awesome.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:03.970
ANDREW BROGDON:
And is it doing--

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.220
So I end up with--

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.039
I do end up it looks like
with some hit detection.

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:10.580
PAWAN KUMAR: And you can change
the location, as well, right?

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.090
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.870
So it's using a
container in the banner.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.000
PAWAN KUMAR: I mean,
you can use anything.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.110
I just use container.

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.780
Maybe people can
use anything else.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:26.200
So I just wanted to show that
we are in the Boring Development

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.700
show.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:29.370
So I just used this image.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:31.500
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.654
PAWAN KUMAR: So now we can
do the other one, maybe.

00:25:34.654 --> 00:25:36.570
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me
go ahead and hide this.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.950
PAWAN KUMAR: And then
we have this IOS sample,

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:42.000
which is kind of on another
widget which I use a lot

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.930
because sometimes you cannot
use a stack every day.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.220
So you can see.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.010
This overlay can be helpful
when you want to show something

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.600
on the top of everything.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:56.030
So there's a messenger
which shows the chat

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.080
head on the top of the screens.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.920
So similarly, this is an
in-app thing, but again,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.730
can be very useful
and you're onto--

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.890
some people does not like snap
bar a lot in their bottom,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.270
so if you want to show
something on the top

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.840
in the formal snap bar,
then also it's very useful.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.077
Maybe you want to show
some alert or something.

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:19.410
ANDREW BROGDON: Where does this?

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.520
So this is show overlay.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.060
There are a lot of show
something top level functions.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.380
Like, Show Search is one.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.547
PAWAN KUMAR: Is this the
name off still matter?

00:26:28.547 --> 00:26:29.880
ANDREW BROGDON: And so is this--

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.120
OK, so this is--

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.150
PAWAN KUMAR: So you
have some overlay state.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:36.720
And you have to
provide the context

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.630
to that particular
widget, and then it

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.560
takes on all the entries.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.680
You can have multiple
entries as well.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.850
I'm just doing one thing.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.600
I'm just using this future
to delay by two seconds,

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.930
and then I'm just removing
it from the state.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.110
So that's simple.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.680
And you don't have
to use stacks,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.660
otherwise it's kind
of very difficult

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.500
if you want to show some things.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.460
And here you can just
use a pollution widget

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.760
and you can maybe
add just a little bit

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.580
of that wherever you want to
show that particular banner

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.780
or something.

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.227
So I personally use it a
lot for one of my project.

00:27:13.227 --> 00:27:14.310
ANDREW BROGDON: I wonder--

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:20.280
so you're using an overlay.ov
to get the overlay.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.810
So there's an inherited overlay.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.290
PAWAN KUMAR: Correct.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.540
ANDREW BROGDON: It must
be provided as part--

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.731
provided as part
of material app.

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:30.606
PAWAN KUMAR: Correct.

00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:31.772
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:27:31.772 --> 00:27:36.660
PAWAN KUMAR: And we have one
more widget if we can use that,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.860
once I can't.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.990
So you can see the
last [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.290
ANDREW BROGDON: I think
we have a couple here.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:46.420
PAWAN KUMAR: First we will
see this spacer sample.

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.610
And that would be
much better because we

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.160
have to change the Cupertino.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.740
You can see we have just
the-- can you go back

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:55.120
and go to the code?

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.170
Yes.

00:27:56.170 --> 00:27:59.040
So here you can see we
have these two buttons,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.770
but now we want some
spacing between them, right?

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.650
We want one on the left and
second one one the right.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.300
So this can be a
little bit tricky

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.172
if you don't know about
the widgets, right?

00:28:09.172 --> 00:28:10.880
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah
I would come in here

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.749
and like do an expanded here.

00:28:12.749 --> 00:28:14.290
But I don't think
that would get me--

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:17.060
like I could do rapid new
widget and do expanded,

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.440
but I think that's just going
to make this an enormous button,

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.740
which I don't want, right?

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.280
PAWAN KUMAR: So you can just
add a spacer in between them.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.860
Just try to do that.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:32.800
And just let's see what
happens as it refreshed.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:34.020
It's not refreshed, I guess.

00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:36.860
ANDREW BROGDON: Bend to my will.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.970
I will relaunch you.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.210
Just in case.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.094
PAWAN KUMAR: So maybe it
will take a few minutes.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.770
Not an issue.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:57.770
ANDREW BROGDON: These
things happen all the time

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:58.270
on the show.

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.209
It's fine.

00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:02.375
Let's see, so that's spacer.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.920
PAWAN KUMAR: I guess
it just stopped.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.003
ANDREW BROGDON: I don't
know what the simulator is

00:29:10.003 --> 00:29:10.679
doing right now.

00:29:10.679 --> 00:29:12.470
PAWAN KUMAR: I guess
I should kill it once.

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:15.840
ANDREW BROGDON: Can we do that?

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.340
OK.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.060
PAWAN KUMAR: Lot of apps.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.768
ANDREW BROGDON: Various
things that we're

00:29:22.768 --> 00:29:24.180
running at one point.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.516
PAWAN KUMAR: It can
be an issue, right?

00:29:27.516 --> 00:29:28.890
ANDREW BROGDON:
In the meantime--

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.660
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah,
in the meantime.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.420
ANDREW BROGDON: So we have this.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.119
PAWAN KUMAR: It should work.

00:29:34.119 --> 00:29:36.660
ANDREW BROGDON: So I assume that
was the solution right there

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.690
just to put this
little thing in.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.815
PAWAN KUMAR: That's the
solution-- simple solution.

00:29:39.815 --> 00:29:40.790
Just use a spacer.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.540
And you can use multiple
spacers, as well.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.660
ANDREW BROGDON: So is it
just an expanded, basically,

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.280
with an empty container inside?

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.609
PAWAN KUMAR: And you can
maybe give a flex, as well.

00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:51.150
ANDREW BROGDON: You
can set the flex.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.030
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes,
as you can see.

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.680
So kind of thing
happened with me

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.860
where I wanted to
have two buttons--

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.060
one on the left,
one on the right.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.780
And I was figuring out what's
the easiest solution for that.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.370
The cleaner solution, maybe.

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.094
So it was--

00:30:06.094 --> 00:30:08.010
ANDREW BROGDON: One
widget with no properties.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:09.701
It's hard to get much
clearer than that.

00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:10.200
OK.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.574
PAWAN KUMAR: OK,
one more widget,

00:30:11.574 --> 00:30:14.850
which I selected a lot
of widgets, but let's

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.960
talk about because it's kind
of useful as super simple.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.236
And I just want you
to go in the top.

00:30:21.236 --> 00:30:22.110
ANDREW BROGDON: Here?

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.860
PAWAN KUMAR: On the top.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:23.520
On the top.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.261
And just change it to
material app to Cupertino app.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.160
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, of course.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.730
PAWAN KUMAR: And just change
the home as well to Cupertino

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.560
sample-- cupersample.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.000
And then I guess we can see--

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.011
ANDREW BROGDON: We're
going to have to.

00:30:41.011 --> 00:30:41.760
PAWAN KUMAR: Stop.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.560
You have to go to
this cupersample now.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.750
It's not that one.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.197
It's called cupersample soil.

00:30:49.197 --> 00:30:50.280
ANDREW BROGDON: That's OK.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.210
The one that works.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.810
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.670
So now I just want
to show this way.

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.740
Like, if you will
just try to scroll.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.200
And this kind of
things you can achieve.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.440
Someone asked me--
he was looking

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.250
at the App Store in the iPhone,
and it had this kind of effect.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.490
So he asked me, will
it take some time.

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:18.060
And he was trying to do it
without using any widget.

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:22.110
He was trying to actually make
all of these things by himself.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.390
He was giving the
font size, as well.

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.730
It was very hectic for him.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:31.440
So I introduced him with
this Cupertino widget.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.690
So there are a lot of widgets.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:35.280
If you go to cupersample sol.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.600
Then I guess there's
a lot of options here.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.220
I don't think that we have time
to actually color all of them.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.690
ANDREW BROGDON: No, not if we're
going to get to Observatory.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:46.314
PAWAN KUMAR: I'll
make a video on that.

00:31:46.314 --> 00:31:47.940
I already have two minutes.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.586
I guess we can also
take for Observatory.

00:31:51.586 --> 00:31:52.960
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah let's just--

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.380
PAWAN KUMAR: Let's
open Observatory.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.600
I guess that's the
symbol for that.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.100
Yes.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.977
So if you'll go do
this Isolate main dot.

00:32:04.977 --> 00:32:06.810
ANDREW BROGDON: Just
real quick, for anybody

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.778
who has never hit that button
or the link that gets spit out

00:32:09.778 --> 00:32:10.620
by Flutter.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.453
PAWAN KUMAR: It's kind
of very useful stuff.

00:32:12.453 --> 00:32:14.240
So you should at
least take a look.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.340
Just go to your main dot,
this isolated window dot.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.690
And in the bottom, if you'll
just scroll, you can see these.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.650
There are some indications
like green and red.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.910
So these green ones are those
which are actually executed.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.640
And these red ones are the
lines which are not executed,

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.170
so it can become kind of useful.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:41.310
So you can just go to
this cupersample sol.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:44.962
I guess, if we can find it.

00:32:44.962 --> 00:32:46.920
ANDREW BROGDON: Cupertino
solution right there.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.690
PAWAN KUMAR: So you
can just go there

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:51.780
and you can see these
lines were executed.

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:54.810
It is very useful
for me sometimes.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:56.700
And I don't know,
maybe it can be useful

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.010
for others as well
because by debugging

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.690
it kind of helps a lot.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.930
And there's hard restart
and all this stuff.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.930
I have covered it in
my video, so maybe.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.450
And one more thing I just
wanted to mention before you

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.560
end this--

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.839
So, can we go to that
[INAUDIBLE],, this one.

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:15.630
ANDREW BROGDON: It's
the Boring-- this one?

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.130
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes,
so Boring Show.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:21.100
OK, let's click on
that in the bottom.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:22.620
So these are some tools.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.610
JSON to dart.

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:26.010
I guess this is the
website where you can just

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:28.957
paste your JSON, and it will
create the mono pass for you.

00:33:28.957 --> 00:33:30.540
ANDREW BROGDON: I've
seen this before.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.956
PAWAN KUMAR: Because
not everybody

00:33:31.956 --> 00:33:35.830
wants to use those scripts
to generate those classes.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.000
So it works pretty well.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.820
ANDREW BROGDON: So you can do
something like this-- field.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.240
PAWAN KUMAR: So I have that
second link for this only.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.100
So if you want to
have something.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.690
OK it will work.

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.769
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, no.

00:33:46.769 --> 00:33:48.185
PAWAN KUMAR: There
was some issue.

00:33:48.185 --> 00:33:50.185
ANDREW BROGDON: Probably
doesn't like my quotes.

00:33:50.185 --> 00:33:53.120
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes,
can be one thing.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.679
ANDREW BROGDON: The
tyranny of double quotes.

00:33:55.679 --> 00:33:56.970
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes, it's working.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.530
It kind of works pretty well.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.510
I have used a lot.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.460
So these are some tools.

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:05.425
I know we have a lot to cover,
but we cannot cover it right

00:34:05.425 --> 00:34:05.926
now.

00:34:05.926 --> 00:34:07.591
ANDREW BROGDON: We're
about out of time.

00:34:07.591 --> 00:34:09.600
But thank you, especially
for putting together

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.449
such great code examples,
along with all the other things

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:14.292
you've done to help
the Flutter community.

00:34:14.292 --> 00:34:15.750
PAWAN KUMAR: And
it is open source,

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.800
so you can check it out.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.900
If there's some stuff, as well--

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.120
some other stuff,
like future as well.

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.290
How to use it.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.540
So they can take a
look at how to check

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.860
the connections if is waiting
and you have some data or not.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.287
So that's included in that
strip for Boring Show.

00:34:31.287 --> 00:34:32.370
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.120
PAWAN KUMAR: So maybe
that can be helpful.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.534
Thanks for having me here.

00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:39.409
ANDREW BROGDON: Sure.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:41.709
PAWAN KUMAR: A
pleasure to be here.

00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:44.000
ANDREW BROGDON: All right,
so does it with Pawan Kumar.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.590
Again, check out N Tech
Viral, check out his samples.

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.110
You can find them in
the Flutter/sample repo.

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:51.830
And we're going to move
on to our next GDE.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.080
PAWAN KUMAR: And please
subscribe to the channel, mine

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:54.580
as well.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.520
And this one, as well.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.250
Thank you.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:58.458
ANDREW BROGDON: There you go.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:01.230
Hey everybody.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:03.760
We're back with our
third expert today,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.094
Eugenio Marletti, which
is Italian I want to say?

00:35:08.094 --> 00:35:09.510
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Originally, yes.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:10.035
Excellent.

00:35:10.035 --> 00:35:11.910
ANDREW BROGDON: And you
have something pretty

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.560
unusual to show us today.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.290
You have a game that
you have written.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.050
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yes, I mean
no copyright infringement.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:20.340
ANDREW BROGDON: Of course.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.560
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
But there was a game

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.740
once that was a viral
success, Flappy Bird.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.207
ANDREW BROGDON: Of course.

00:35:27.207 --> 00:35:29.790
EUGENIO MARLETTI: And of course
it's sort of a rite of passage

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:32.380
to write that into
whatever framework it's in.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.380
ANDREW BROGDON: It's the
new Hello World, right?

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:35.220
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Pretty much.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.200
And so I thought it
would be fun to do it

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.454
in Flutter with a few twists.

00:35:39.454 --> 00:35:40.620
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.240
OK.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.200
EUGENIO MARLETTI: So
the very first twist

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.590
is that I remade the graphics
of the bird, which is Dart now.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.580
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh,
so you made a dash.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.040
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah, sorry.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.720
A dash.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.960
And the Dash version.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.850
It's modeled after
a Dash version.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:01.380
I use this really cool pixel
art editor called Ace Bright.

00:36:04.241 --> 00:36:04.990
And it does a gif.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.690
ANDREW BROGDON: Shams,
our tech writer,

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.404
who designed Dash
and the plushies.

00:36:11.404 --> 00:36:13.070
EUGENIO MARLETTI: You
can see the frames

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.949
if you go up and down.

00:36:14.949 --> 00:36:16.490
ANDREW BROGDON: So
it's the flapping.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.990
OK.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.520
Yeah.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:19.186
EUGENIO MARLETTI: And
then when he dies,

00:36:19.186 --> 00:36:21.170
he can also do the flapping.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:26.920
And the eye is the same
as the Chrome dinosaur.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.960
When he dies, you know,
has the eyes like that.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.170
So that's the first twist.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:34.080
The other is that I didn't use--

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.900
I didn't want to
use any game engine.

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.580
This is widgets.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:42.205
Not even render objects,
widgets all the way down.

00:36:42.205 --> 00:36:43.830
ANDREW BROGDON:
Interesting experiment.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.920
EUGENIO MARLETTI: So,
like if you imagine maybe

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.857
you can like--

00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:52.690
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me
go and run this once.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.280
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Perfect, yeah.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:53.760
ANDREW BROGDON:
And, of course, I'm

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.990
running this on a
simulator, so I'm not

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.250
going to get quite
the performance we

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.320
would on a real device.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.774
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Yeah, of course.

00:36:58.774 --> 00:37:01.065
ANDREW BROGDON: Which I'll
blame my my poor performance

00:37:01.065 --> 00:37:02.775
in the game on.

00:37:02.775 --> 00:37:03.900
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah, no.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.300
It's super smooth in release.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.970
But so essentially we have--

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:12.510
games normally have
this loop where

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.640
you have ticks and every step.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.160
Yeah.

00:37:21.522 --> 00:37:22.980
ANDREW BROGDON: I
think I hit the--

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.105
so I'm going through pipes.

00:37:24.105 --> 00:37:24.910
Is that by design?

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.190
EUGENIO MARLETTI: So
the collision detection

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.980
is not done yet.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.830
So I put like a
fixed cap, otherwise

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:33.360
it would skyrocket to infinity
because the acceleration is

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.364
really strong.

00:37:34.364 --> 00:37:35.155
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:37:35.155 --> 00:37:36.738
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Because it turns out

00:37:36.738 --> 00:37:38.910
it's not using
realistic gravity.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.530
I had to reverse engineer how
it is, but it's not realistic.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:43.260
It's way stronger
than you would think.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.057
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:37:45.057 --> 00:37:47.015
EUGENIO MARLETTI: And so
what you've seen-- can

00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:51.555
you hit play again so I can
show you the layout, generally.

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:55.830
ANDREW BROGDON: So you've got
some stream controllers in here

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.400
I can see.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.850
You've got sprites coming
from the widget up here.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.370
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Essentially,
I created a widget class that

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.900
holds an image that it
already carries along

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.660
information like this size
and other things like that.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.390
So even before
loading the image,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.370
you already know
that ratio, and it's

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:18.400
a lot easier for the
layout to work that way.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.740
Everything can be
automated real time.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.015
For now I wrote it by hand.

00:38:22.015 --> 00:38:23.890
That's whatever.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:30.360
And so what you see here
is one scrolling container.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.065
The bird is actually fixed.

00:38:33.065 --> 00:38:34.440
ANDREW BROGDON:
This is very much

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.479
in the don't try
this at home veins.

00:38:36.479 --> 00:38:37.520
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Try it.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.810
ANDREW BROGDON: Sort
of experimental.

00:38:39.810 --> 00:38:42.460
EUGENIO MARLETTI: But it's using
things that are very normal.

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.370
So instead of having
this classic ticking

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.955
loop of the game, we have a
ticker attached to the widget.

00:38:47.955 --> 00:38:49.830
ANDREW BROGDON: So like
the animation ticker?

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:50.913
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Exactly.

00:38:50.913 --> 00:38:52.730
So at every frame,
we essentially

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.650
calculate the next step.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:55.470
Not even by hand.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:57.050
The system does it for us.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.970
ANDREW BROGDON: That's what it's
normally doing for animations.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.719
EUGENIO MARLETTI: And
then the whole thing

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:04.370
is a scrolling container
and the scrolling is not

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:05.580
done by gestures.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.116
But it's done by the ticking.

00:39:07.116 --> 00:39:09.240
ANDREW BROGDON: Every tick
you scroll a little bit.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.050
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Literally.

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:10.841
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.360
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
The bird is falling

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.930
with the simulation of
course, because that's

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.630
the physics we use, which
is the internal simulation

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:22.160
class of Flutter.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.580
And I just wrote a different
gravity kind of simulation

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.450
to make it fall.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:27.824
ANDREW BROGDON:
Are you rotating?

00:39:27.824 --> 00:39:29.420
Do you have like a rotating box?

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.753
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:30.753 --> 00:39:34.080
It's rotating with a
rotation transformation.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.080
I think I'm going
to try another one.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:37.580
What else?

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.209
It's going up and
down in translation.

00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:41.750
ANDREW BROGDON: OK, so this is
your moving bird widget which,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.367
represents Dash on the screen.

00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:45.200
EUGENIO MARLETTI: So
also interesting there,

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.950
even there the bird is
composed by wrapping.

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.680
So there's like the static
bird, the flapping and then

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.850
the moving, essentially.

00:39:52.850 --> 00:39:55.780
And it's widgets nested
one into each other.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.570
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh my goodness.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.490
OK, so Moving Bird.

00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:00.867
Is that just the bird on screen?

00:40:00.867 --> 00:40:02.450
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
And it's literally--

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:03.260
it's fixed.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:05.780
If you really look at
it, the world is moving

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.900
and the bird is fixed.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.966
So it's all relative, right.

00:40:09.966 --> 00:40:12.340
ANDREW BROGDON: Bird offset
Y would be the height, right?

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.380
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Exactly, yes.

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.170
ANDREW BROGDON: Moving
Bird State is not

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:20.030
something I anticipated seeing.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.950
Yeah, this is very
similar to how you

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:26.720
would do any other animation.

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.450
You have Single Ticker
Provider, state mix in which

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:34.370
provides the frame signals.

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:35.890
If we're going 60
frames per second,

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:41.760
you'd get one of these
every 16,000ths of a second.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.800
And redraw.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.650
Flaps Subscription.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:47.260
Fall Velocity after.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.340
That.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.240
So this is pixels
per second squared.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.540
That's awesome.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.050
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Clearly.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.360
ANDREW BROGDON: And yet valid.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.714
And so where is your build?

00:40:58.714 --> 00:41:00.130
You've got this
state for widgets.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.730
You've got have a build in here.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.188
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah, so it
calculates just a few things,

00:41:04.188 --> 00:41:07.329
but then this is a
very simple widget.

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:09.870
ANDREW BROGDON: At the end of
the day, you're it's transform?

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.453
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
We start from center

00:41:11.453 --> 00:41:13.370
of this column, let's say.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.040
Right from the ground,
if I'm not mistaken

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:18.080
to the top of the screen.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.785
And then from there, we
just apply a translation

00:41:21.785 --> 00:41:23.930
and a rotation
based on the values

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.750
of the physics at that moment.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.900
ANDREW BROGDON: Oh, you've
got a custom paint in here.

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.970
EUGENIO MARLETTI: I do.

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:32.900
I don't remember why.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.840
ANDREW BROGDON: So it's
a custom paint of birds.

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.790
This is the bird.

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:38.640
EUGENIO MARLETTI: It
might have something

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.090
to do with refreshing.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.310
No, I think that was--
this is in progress thing

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:44.450
for making it flap.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.037
I believe, but I'm
not entirely sure.

00:41:47.037 --> 00:41:48.870
ANDREW BROGDON: Let me
close out some assets

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:49.828
that I had opened here.

00:41:49.828 --> 00:41:53.100
EUGENIO MARLETTI: It's
supposed to be right under.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.324
ANDREW BROGDON: So moving
bird back down here.

00:41:56.324 --> 00:41:58.240
EUGENIO MARLETTI: It
should repaint as always.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.420
ANDREW BROGDON: OK.

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.730
EUGENIO MARLETTI: I think
there was either a bug

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.490
or I wasn't using
something properly,

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.770
and it wasn't
repainting sometimes.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.550
ANDREW BROGDON: So this
moving bird accepts a bird.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.050
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Clearly.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.799
ANDREW BROGDON: You're
injecting the bird.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.640
And then this is--

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.100
if I go back to Main, I
guess, would I find something?

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.350
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Oh, this
is also an interesting one.

00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:24.320
Since the original
game is very much

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.690
fixed on one sided
dimensions, it

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.397
doesn't rescale on
tablets or anything.

00:42:30.397 --> 00:42:32.480
I kind of want to do the
same, so what we're doing

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.950
is we're drawing
this at size one.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:39.890
And then we're putting
it inside a fitted,

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.600
so that it just scales and
fills the screen by maintaining

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.440
the aspect ratio.

00:42:48.865 --> 00:42:50.240
ANDREW BROGDON:
The game widgets.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.360
EUGENIO MARLETTI: We
put the on the borders--

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.240
the red.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.970
Let's say in cuts by using
a decorator widget just

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.550
to change the background.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.949
And as a nice touch, we also
change the Chrome to be light.

00:43:02.949 --> 00:43:04.490
So on Android, for
example, you would

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.097
see that light icon and text
and stuff in the status bar.

00:43:08.097 --> 00:43:09.930
ANDREW BROGDON: So where
are you doing that?

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.630
Are you using System Chrome
to do that back in May?

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:13.940
EUGENIO MARLETTI: May, I think.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:14.450
ANDREW BROGDON: There it is.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.770
EUGENIO MARLETTI: There you go.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:16.760
ANDREW BROGDON: Yeah, I
always try to call those out.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.757
System Chrome-- a lot
of handy stuff in there

00:43:18.757 --> 00:43:20.090
for just a little bit of polish.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.700
When I did the
reverse Flutter flip,

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.980
I didn't want to
do a landscape UI,

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.197
and so I used System Chrome to
just say, you're in portrait.

00:43:31.197 --> 00:43:32.530
EUGENIO MARLETTI: That's a hack.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.540
ANDREW BROGDON: That's
where you will stay.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.340
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Oh
another cute thing--

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:40.940
I disabled the
Debug mode banner.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.330
And instead inserted my
own-- the game banner.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:47.789
So you know exactly.

00:43:47.789 --> 00:43:49.330
ANDREW BROGDON: So
the banner widget,

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.250
heretofore unused
on the Boring Show,

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:55.200
has now made two
appearances today.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.990
Interesting.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.500
Every time I see this I'm
reminded of the old fork

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.955
this on GitHub banners that
used to be on every web.

00:44:02.955 --> 00:44:04.580
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
It's absolutely that.

00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.996
ANDREW BROGDON: And have fallen
out of style a little bit,

00:44:06.996 --> 00:44:07.759
I guess.

00:44:07.759 --> 00:44:09.300
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
But I really wanted

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:15.220
this to feel sort of
looks like a hack project,

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.900
but it's actually an example
of how to be build apps.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:23.840
And so even the banner is like
just a joke on the whole topic.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:24.830
What else do we have?

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:28.082
Yeah, there's sounds by using--

00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:29.540
ANDREW BROGDON:
That's a good deal.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.581
How are you doing sounds?

00:44:30.581 --> 00:44:33.560
EUGENIO MARLETTI: This is the
only real dependency we have,

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.290
unfortunately, because there's
still nothing in the framework

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:37.370
directly.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:41.000
So there is one library
called Older Players,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.190
if I'm not mistaken.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:48.740
And so, again, here,
you need a bundle

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.880
to find the sounds anywhere.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:54.800
And so you inject that, but once
you do it, you can play a sound

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:59.570
and recreate it in that
justice to make it easier

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:00.699
to play the sounds.

00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:02.240
Right now they're
still not wired up,

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.151
but this is how you
would call them.

00:45:04.151 --> 00:45:05.650
You essentially
have a sounds object

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.520
and just say sound
play that, play that.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:11.040
And everything is
injected all the way down.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:16.340
So from the assets that you
could swap if you wanted to,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.225
you can inject--

00:45:17.225 --> 00:45:19.100
I mean, of course, the
sounds and everything.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.367
And it's super detectable.

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:21.950
ANDREW BROGDON: So
this is the package

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:23.065
that you're using, right?

00:45:23.065 --> 00:45:23.370
The audio package.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:25.280
EUGENIO MARLETTI: That
is the package, yes.

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.600
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.224
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Which funnily enough,

00:45:28.224 --> 00:45:32.286
I think was created for games.

00:45:32.286 --> 00:45:34.160
ANDREW BROGDON: It's a
general truth anything

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.006
that people develop for software
will be used for a game.

00:45:37.006 --> 00:45:38.630
You go back in the
'60s, you see people

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.862
that programmed their
Osciloscopes to play things.

00:45:41.862 --> 00:45:44.070
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Because
it's surprising how hard it

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.060
is to play sounds concurrently.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:49.140
Like having overlapping sounds,
and this is one of the few--

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:51.340
at least at the time
when I wrote this,

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.640
one of the few libraries
that allowed to actually do

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.460
overlapping sounds, which,
of course, is really much

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.615
needed in the game.

00:45:58.615 --> 00:45:59.490
What else do we have?

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.270
Yeah, another very interesting
aspect is the pipes

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.610
are random the way they
come into the screen.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.140
ANDREW BROGDON: So the
spacing between the pipes

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.150
is fixed, but where--

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.139
the break that you
have to flap through.

00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:15.930
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Exactly, and so what I do

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.720
is that I created a
random generator, which

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.490
allows you to inject
a seed, so you

00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.514
can have predictable results.

00:46:22.514 --> 00:46:24.430
ANDREW BROGDON: For tests
that would be handy.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.300
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah, if
you go to random dart I think.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:32.040
That should be here
in the utilities.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.030
If I'm not mistaken.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.863
Yeah, so essentially
we just wrap our random

00:46:34.863 --> 00:46:37.870
in an iterator with the seed.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.050
So if you use the same
seed, you will always

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:43.080
get the same random out
of it, which is very nice.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.250
And then we use the
iterator to actually--

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:51.830
like, we consume it one by
one to produce the pipes.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:54.110
So that's also very interesting.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.591
But from the outside, again,
you have no idea where

00:46:56.591 --> 00:46:57.840
these numbers are coming from.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.805
Maybe you designed
a specific layout,

00:46:59.805 --> 00:47:03.502
a specific level because you
want a challenge of some kind.

00:47:03.502 --> 00:47:05.460
ANDREW BROGDON: People
could share seeds online

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.960
like they do with
some other games.

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.418
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Yes, but even you

00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.140
could create a list yourself.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:14.220
It doesn't have to be random
because the iterable width

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.760
of the value is just injected.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.090
Yeah, what else do we have?

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:24.840
The spices are also
interesting because it's

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:30.030
a lot harder than one
would think to load images.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.220
In fact, there's an
image provider class,

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:36.690
which allows you-- oh
that's really not for my--

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:40.530
It allows you to
specify what image you

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:45.560
want to use without
actually loading it yet.

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.560
And so we do that.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.560
We have a function that
takes the name of the thing

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.620
and tries to create an image
provider for it automatically.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.520
ANDREW BROGDON: Using
this exact asset image?

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:55.478
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.850
Yeah, and so again,
you need to inject

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:02.970
where to find the assets,
but then once you have that,

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.680
the whole system
is just completely

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.989
hooked up to easily find.

00:48:05.989 --> 00:48:07.530
ANDREW BROGDON: So
I mean, you're not

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:11.400
doing anything like 1x, 2x,
3x image assets or anything

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.530
like that?

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:16.350
EUGENIO MARLETTI: No, because
since this is pixel art,

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:20.890
we are literally scaling
the pixels to like a x Is it

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.710
supposed to be a
little bit blocking.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:24.830
And so it works perfectly well.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.330
ANDREW BROGDON:
This is fascinating.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:28.039
So where can people
go look at this code?

00:48:28.039 --> 00:48:29.580
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Right now, nowhere.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.070
On my laptop.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:34.470
You have to know me.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:38.730
But I really hope to push
this soon and finish it up.

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.550
The collisions need to be
taken care of, et cetera,

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:47.070
and there's a bunch of just
like that tutorial display when

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.000
you start the game
there's a counter.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.500
ANDREW BROGDON: Of course.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.166
EUGENIO MARLETTI: The
assets are already

00:48:51.166 --> 00:48:54.730
done if you want to look at
them, and it's pretty cool.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.290
In the Assets Directory.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.290
ANDREW BROGDON: You have
a ton of stuff in here.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.081
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah
they're all changed.

00:49:00.081 --> 00:49:01.980
Like if you go to
tutorial, it should be--

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.822
for example.

00:49:04.822 --> 00:49:06.030
This is teaching you how to--

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.660
ANDREW BROGDON: Instruction.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.130
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Play the game.

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:10.950
Or if you make a
really good score,

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.385
then you get all the badges,
which look like coins.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.820
Medal-- bronze medal, gold.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.980
And this is, again,
dash titles, of course.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:26.720
So yeah, I need to wire
this up, and it's going

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.540
to be on GitHub at some point.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:29.790
ANDREW BROGDON: At some point.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:32.456
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Do you want to
look at the physics, last thing

00:49:32.456 --> 00:49:33.906
that I just remembered.

00:49:40.257 --> 00:49:41.590
ANDREW BROGDON: In physics.dart.

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:44.050
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Of course.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:49.377
Yeah, it's a flat gravity
simulation, obviously.

00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:50.710
ANDREW BROGDON: As one would do.

00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.626
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Yeah,
and if you look at it,

00:49:52.626 --> 00:49:54.520
it's really, really simple.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:59.170
Like, there's not much to it.

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.100
This is the classic
equation for motion

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.560
that you learn in high
school, that's right?

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.400
ANDREW BROGDON: In pixels
per second squared.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:12.170
So I think that's it
for our time with you.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.270
But thank you so much.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:14.380
This is a very unique app.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.870
And so I'm looking forward
to this being on GitHub

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.244
just so we can
show it to people.

00:50:17.244 --> 00:50:20.800
You're doing some things
here that not everyone

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.990
would have seen before,
including this guy.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.300
But thank you to
Eugenio Marletti

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.870
for coming on the show.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:33.760
We are going to get him and
our other two experts, and me,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.000
behind this desk all at
once, and we're going

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.010
to answer some questions next.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:40.510
So that's coming
up, but thank you.

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:41.850
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Thank you.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:42.350
Absolutely.

00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:43.544
My pleasure.

00:50:49.762 --> 00:50:50.970
ANDREW BROGDON: Are we ready?

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:55.200
All right, so in
this segment, we're

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.366
going to take some questions
that people have posted

00:50:57.366 --> 00:51:00.640
to YouTube and to Twitter
using the hashtag #BoringShow

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.510
hashtag, and we're
going to answer them

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.640
with a lot of expert
help in the room.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.990
All right, so first up coming
from Fishy Sushi, which

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:14.220
wins my personal award for
best Twitter handle of the day.

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.070
Am I mistaken, or this
is about our search

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:18.450
episode, which we just did.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.490
Am I mistaken, or
are the suggestions

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:22.500
supposed to be a
list of past searches

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.700
when query is empty and
keywords related to the query.

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.380
That on Click, a suggestion
should become the query

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:29.670
used for fetching the results.

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:32.667
That is absolutely true.

00:51:32.667 --> 00:51:34.500
In ours, because we
ended up because we only

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.990
had about 10 articles in
our list of search results--

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:38.710
if you've seen
that last episode--

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:41.160
we use the headlines
for the articles sort

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.790
of for both the listing of
results and suggestions.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:47.760
But in practice, you
use a lot of apps.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.269
They have a variety of
definitions for contextual help

00:51:51.269 --> 00:51:52.560
for when you're doing a search.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.000
For instance, maps.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.610
You type something into maps
and you get, what are you

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.290
near to at this point.

00:51:58.290 --> 00:51:59.700
Those might become
your keywords.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.100
Or in Chrome, you
put something in

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:04.980
and you get the little
magnifying glass icon

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.650
that you get for like-- you
searched for this in the past,

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:09.780
and then like the
person half a mile

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.300
from you is searching
for this right now,

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.270
or these are the kinds of things
that people might be searching

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:17.350
for based on what
you've typed in.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:21.720
So context depends a lot on
your app, and can be really--

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:25.440
it's up to you, really, what
you think the user might

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.900
want in that situation.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.024
Anybody have searching
in their apps right now?

00:52:30.024 --> 00:52:31.315
EUGENIO MARLETTI: No searching.

00:52:31.315 --> 00:52:32.440
PAWAN KUMAR: Yeah, I have one.

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:33.320
ANDREW BROGDON: You
have one with search?

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.945
PAWAN KUMAR: I'm
using in the same way.

00:52:34.945 --> 00:52:37.380
I have to show some
solutions as well.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.950
And when people such
about, so I have like I

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.880
kind of ecommerce app
where people actually

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.200
search for products.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.550
And then we show some bar
codes with their product name.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:53.560
So that is showing in
the search results,

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.200
as well as in the solutions.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.930
And then we bold
those connectors,

00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:03.060
depending on how the
person is searching.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.130
ANDREW BROGDON: So it
depends sort of on the user

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:06.820
and what they have
given you so far.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.616
It totally depends on
the use codes, I believe.

00:53:09.616 --> 00:53:11.490
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Don't
do what Twitter does,

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.670
which is you start typing,
something shows up.

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:18.240
You're about to click in
then it just goes away.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.091
ANDREW BROGDON: A lot of
details to get the UI right.

00:53:22.091 --> 00:53:22.590
All right.

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.750
So let's go on to
our second one.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.710
This is from Priyansh Parmar.

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:30.720
And it says, any tutorial on how
to use Google Maps in Flutter?

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.180
This is something we get a lot.

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:39.730
And so I'm going to go ahead and
pull up our plug-ins repo here.

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.150
So if you've never been
here, highly recommended it.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:43.080
Flutter/plugins.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.470
We've shown it a bunch of times
on the Boring Show before.

00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:48.720
And we go into packages.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.640
And where are we?

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.080
Google Maps Flutter.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:55.550
So I get that a lot.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:56.800
We're looking at this plug-in.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:59.400
So this is not yet
published to pub.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.310
It is not yet ready
for prime time,

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:04.870
but you can't go into this
package and take a look around.

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:05.370
If

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.630
Because we get this
question a lot.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.130
You know, what's
going on with maps?

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:09.870
How is it coming?

00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:12.780
This is a better answer to
that question than anything

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:16.000
I can tell you because
it's more up to date.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.720
You can actually see
the code, and see

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.010
what's been implemented.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:26.970
We also have-- if I go
in to Flutter/samples.

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:30.080
we also have a map sample that's
starting to land right now

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.980
called Place Tracker, which
the very talented Kenzie

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.990
Schmall up in
Portland is working on

00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:38.840
for the deverall team.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.300
And so this is
something that if you

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.605
want to see how the Google map
API is going to look in an app

00:54:44.605 --> 00:54:45.980
when it's finished
and how you're

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:48.620
going to code against it, this
is a great place to start.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.110
She's done some really,
really great work on this.

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:53.600
It involves placing markers
and things like that.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.930
Setting the map type from
terrain to roads and things

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:57.990
like that.

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:02.360
So yeah, if you have questions
about maps, don't mess around.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.844
Just go straight to the code.

00:55:04.844 --> 00:55:07.260
PAWAN KUMAR: I'm going to make
a YouTube tutorial on this.

00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.160
So don't worry.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.860
ANDREW BROGDON: You guys,
any experience using maps?

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:14.570
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Actually, no.

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:15.980
IIRO KRANKKA: Same for me.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:18.230
PAWAN KUMAR: I just used for
one of the tutorial only,

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:21.680
and that was a plugin which
was showing these static maps

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.524
rather than as a widget.

00:55:23.524 --> 00:55:25.440
ANDREW BROGDON: These
are not the static maps.

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.910
These are using the
platform widgets to--

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:31.407
you can manipulate the
map, you can tap on things.

00:55:31.407 --> 00:55:33.740
PAWAN KUMAR: I guess there
are many guys who are waiting

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:36.480
for like this particular--

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.564
EUGENIO MARLETTI: This is
really close to theater.

00:55:38.564 --> 00:55:41.063
ANDREW BROGDON: This is why we
get a lot of questions on it.

00:55:41.063 --> 00:55:42.920
So if you'd like to
know where things are,

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:44.720
the code is the
best place to go.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.390
That's true of a lot of
things in Flutter, actually.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:48.530
All right.

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:49.810
Let's see another question.

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:51.440
And this from Paul Shaw.

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:53.390
Question: can Block
be used together

00:55:53.390 --> 00:55:55.460
with scoped model in
Flutter, or are they

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.764
not meant to be used that way?

00:55:57.764 --> 00:55:58.930
PAWAN KUMAR: I have used it.

00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:01.265
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Absolutely illegal.

00:56:01.265 --> 00:56:02.390
ANDREW BROGDON: It's legal.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:03.960
We've determined it.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.360
So have you ever mixed the two?

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.917
EUGENIO MARLETTI: You can, sure.

00:56:09.917 --> 00:56:11.500
It depends how your
app is structured.

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.980
There might be
encapsulated parts

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.480
that you want to
handle differently.

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.640
And maybe you have
different teams

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:17.810
working in a different way.

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:20.290
Like I don't see why
not, if it works for you.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.710
IIRO KRANKKA: But I would say
that if you use a scope mode

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:27.770
and Blocks together, and you're
meaning to do a web app as

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.560
well, then you're going to--

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.160
because scope model is really
tightly tied to Flutter.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.590
That's not going to
work in web, as well.

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:39.410
But this actual issue
about splitting this scope

00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:42.790
model so that it would
work in web and Flutter,

00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:44.674
but that's not done right now.

00:56:44.674 --> 00:56:45.840
ANDREW BROGDON: Interesting.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.048
PAWAN KUMAR: I have mostly
used a block pattern only,

00:56:48.048 --> 00:56:51.860
but in some use cases, I have
used scope model as well,

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.124
for some of this.

00:56:53.124 --> 00:56:55.040
ANDREW BROGDON: Scope
model is just incredibly

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.960
handy for anything small.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.790
If you just need a
little bit of app state,

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.387
it is so easy to use.

00:57:00.387 --> 00:57:01.970
We use it in our
examples all the time

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:05.720
because it's just
very uncomplicated.

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:09.300
But yeah, I think we have a lot
of different state management

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.800
approaches.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.890
We got Redux back
here, Block over here.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:15.980
I have Free Block that
I wrote because I just

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.880
make mistakes like that.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.230
Probably all of us have used
scope model at some point.

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:22.160
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
Definitely a Redux fan,

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.910
but if you have UI State,
especially, and it's something

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:27.620
that you domain logic
doesn't really care about,

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.950
using the scope model is
actually a really good way

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:32.409
to propagate stuff.

00:57:32.409 --> 00:57:34.700
PAWAN KUMAR: And if you don't
have to do a lot of stuff

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.310
inside your application-- if
it's a very small application,

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.100
then you don't have
to use anything

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.420
like Redux, even Block.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.480
So scope model
works pretty well.

00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:45.980
IIRO KRANKKA: It's really
simple to get started with.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.563
PAWAN KUMAR: Another
widget we're just

00:57:47.563 --> 00:57:52.057
kind of just rapping with it
and it's working perfectly.

00:57:52.057 --> 00:57:53.140
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:57.470
Yeah, we can spend 20 minutes
talking about state management.

00:57:57.470 --> 00:58:01.010
So Paul Sean actually had
another question later on,

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.990
and it was, I heard
you guys mentioned

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:05.090
that in Dart explicitly
giving the type

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:09.350
of a variable like bool or
int is better for the IDE.

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.690
How does it affect the
performance of a Flutter app?

00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:13.040
When should I type stuff?

00:58:14.576 --> 00:58:15.950
There's the final
keyword there's

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:19.610
the viewer keyword you
can let the compiler,

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:22.190
the static analysis,
determine the type for you.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:24.830
EUGENIO MARLETTI: But the point
is that the type is always

00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:26.300
defined at compile time.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.970
So in the end,
performance wise it

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:31.555
doesn't matter, as long as
you resolve to the same type.

00:58:31.555 --> 00:58:32.930
ANDREW BROGDON:
As long as you do

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:34.914
have something that
gives the compiler,

00:58:34.914 --> 00:58:36.330
and you don't end
up with dynamic.

00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:36.890
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Because I
think you were mentioning this

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:37.390
before.

00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:39.495
If you end up being
dynamic all the time,

00:58:39.495 --> 00:58:42.854
then that could be a problem.

00:58:42.854 --> 00:58:45.020
ANDREW BROGDON: So if you're
using a stream builder,

00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:47.570
for example, there's a type
parameter that goes onto it.

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:52.370
Stream builder, bracket int
or string or list of string.

00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:54.770
Whatever the payload
is for your stream.

00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:57.620
If you don't give
that to Dart, it just

00:58:57.620 --> 00:58:59.150
goes OK, string builder dynamic.

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:01.670
This will take whatever
anybody gives it.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:03.800
But you also don't
get a typed builder,

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:05.219
so you run into
an issue when you

00:59:05.219 --> 00:59:07.760
go to build your widgets that
you don't know what data you're

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.718
going to get, because
the compiler doesn't know

00:59:09.718 --> 00:59:11.060
what data it's going to get.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.520
And so usually I
ended up catching it

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:15.080
if I've done something that way.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:17.870
Like if I've left
myself in a dynamic,

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:20.270
like I failed to give the
compiler enough information

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.040
to resolve the type.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.630
I run into a later inconvenience
and notice it right away.

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:25.100
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
It's like a virus.

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:26.240
It spreads.

00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.620
PAWAN KUMAR: If you're going
difficult to actually figuring

00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:28.710
it out at that time.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:32.480
And I personally feel that
for developer experience,

00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:37.000
it's kind of good practice to
actually specify those types.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.580
So you like generally
manually typing.

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.260
IIRO KRANKKA: I
would say it actually

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.200
helps pull request
reviews sometimes

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.059
if you're not inside of
your ID, you can see that,

00:59:48.059 --> 00:59:48.850
OK, this is going--

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:51.270
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Now we're
getting into the realm of--

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:52.520
PAWAN KUMAR: I say about that.

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.100
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
In other languages,

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:57.140
type inference works so well
that sometimes you really

00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:59.810
don't want to specify the
type because it almost

00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.310
doesn't matter.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:05.000
In the context of that piece
of code, if it compiles

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.110
it's fine, essentially.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.354
There is an analyzer flag
to disallow allow having

01:00:12.354 --> 01:00:13.520
the compiler automatically--

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.500
ANDREW BROGDON:
That's a good point.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.660
If any of you are
considering becoming

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:21.110
a contributor to the Flutter SDK
itself, or one of the packages,

01:00:21.110 --> 01:00:23.360
they actually have
that flag set.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.820
And so they prefer types
in pretty much anywhere

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:31.644
you can put one,
including in Landis.

01:00:31.644 --> 01:00:33.560
IIRO KRANKKA: I've been
doing a couple of PRs,

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:34.760
and they actually--

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.910
you guys actually
use unspecified types

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.600
manually for some reason.

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.390
I don't know why.

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.810
EUGENIO MARLETTI: It's analyzer
strong mode, implicit cuts,

01:00:44.810 --> 01:00:45.600
false.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.952
And implicit dynamic, false.

01:00:46.952 --> 01:00:48.410
ANDREW BROGDON:
Implicit dynamic is

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:50.576
that what I was thinking
of, but implicit cast, too.

01:00:50.576 --> 01:00:53.600
PAWAN KUMAR: I actually used in
one of the versions when there

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.750
was an issue with the
.organ or something.

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:58.227
I had to use it.

01:00:58.227 --> 01:01:00.310
EUGENIO MARLETTI: I like
being strict in my types.

01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:01.110
It helps.

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:02.000
ANDREW BROGDON: Yes.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.499
All right.

01:01:02.499 --> 01:01:03.510
So one last question.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:09.270
This is from QuEdAdZa,
judging by the capitalization.

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:11.810
I'm interested in two topics,
Flutter internationalizing

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:15.010
and map support for Flutter.

01:01:15.010 --> 01:01:17.930
And so map support, we kind of
covered already, but real quick

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:20.160
who's done anything with
internationalization?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.110
Because that's
not something I've

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.335
gotten into yet personally.

01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:24.410
PAWAN KUMAR: He's the guy.

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:27.380
IIRO KRANKKA: So I've done
that a couple of times,

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.520
and I keep notes for myself.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.660
So it's kind of an
involved process to do.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:37.090
And in my [INAUDIBLE]
app, in the core module,

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:38.760
that's actually a
sample to do that.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:44.610
But I would say that the docs
are kind of scattered around.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:45.750
PAWAN KUMAR: Yes, correct.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:47.160
IIRO KRANKKA: You've
probably actually--

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.630
PAWAN KUMAR: I have actually
used it just for one language

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:50.130
only.

01:01:50.130 --> 01:01:52.250
I actually can watch
it from English

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:55.160
to Hindi for Flutter UI kit.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.770
So I actually used it, but
it's maybe kind of maybe

01:01:57.770 --> 01:02:01.050
difficult from when you're
reading from the documentation,

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.140
it's kind of difficult
to understand.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.090
IIRO KRANKKA: It's kind
of similar to like how

01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:07.760
QT handles the internalization.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.600
So you basically like you
defer defined your mistakes,

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:17.240
and then you use a tool to
center right those ARB files.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.540
And then you upload those
somewhere and translate those

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.800
and then get those
back to your app.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.380
But I would definitely
want to have

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.050
some kind of hold your
hand guide around this,

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:30.670
because you don't
do that so often,

01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.930
so you kind of
forget it every time.

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:35.030
And then you have to relearn it.

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:37.040
PAWAN KUMAR: It takes some time.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.440
I could not give that
much time to that project.

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.660
I mean, this thing can
be improved, for sure.

01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.400
EUGENIO MARLETTI:
STID could help.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.440
IIRO KRANKKA: Dueling
would be awesome for you.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.080
ANDREW BROGDON:
Like I said, we're

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.120
going to run into this
with the Vox Day app

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.036
pretty soon because we're
going to want to add

01:02:55.036 --> 01:02:56.357
internationalization for that.

01:02:56.357 --> 01:02:58.190
And so that's something
the deverall team is

01:02:58.190 --> 01:02:59.814
going to run into,
and we will probably

01:02:59.814 --> 01:03:03.560
start making more cohesive
guides for it at that time.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.350
Because it's an important issue
if you're-- everybody wants

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.330
an international audience.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:11.270
All right, so that's
our questions.

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.350
And that's our show, actually.

01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:16.537
So thank you to everybody
for being on here.

01:03:16.537 --> 01:03:17.870
PAWAN KUMAR: Thanks to everyone.

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:19.370
ANDREW BROGDON:
Yeah, again, if you

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.310
would like to post questions
for us, please do that.

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:25.040
You can use the Boring
Show hashtag on Twitter.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.631
You can respond in the comments
to this video themselves.

01:03:28.631 --> 01:03:29.880
We look at those all the time.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.084
We try to answer them, both
in the comments and here.

01:03:34.084 --> 01:03:36.500
PAWAN KUMAR: Maybe we'll not
answer it together next time,

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.651
but separately we
can answer, right?

01:03:38.651 --> 01:03:40.900
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Ask for
us to come back to the show.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.792
It's very important.

01:03:41.792 --> 01:03:43.250
PAWAN KUMAR: That's
very important.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.970
ANDREW BROGDON: All right.

01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:45.210
So thanks to you guys.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.630
And thanks to all of you that
made it through the episode

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:48.510
with us.

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.500
We'll see you next time.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.050
EUGENIO MARLETTI: Bye.
