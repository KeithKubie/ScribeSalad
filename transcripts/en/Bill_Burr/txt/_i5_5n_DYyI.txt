Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, June 6th, 2016 this is like the fifth fucking time I've tried to start this thing because, uh, I dunno, I just had an aborted landing. Well, I didn't have one. The pilot had one and a, I was riding in the back and, you know, what are you going to do? What we landed safely, you know, some airplane didn't clear the runway. That was my fifth one that I've had. I've had five aborted landings and that was my second one at lax. Um, first one was vehicle on a runway and this next one, a guy didn't, a plane was still on the runway. It didn't clear it or whatever, but uh, it was a little less scary. Now that I've flown a little bit, you know, not a lot, but a little bit, but, uh, you're still in the back and you can't see what's going on.

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       So that's, that's always nice. Um, all right. So people have been asking me, they've been emailing me, they'd been twittering me, they'd been Facebooking me. Um, about what's going on with these Irish dates? Uh, Dublin July 31st Belfast August 1st and Galloway, Galway, modal Ireland on the 2nd of August. All right. I have the presale information, but for whatever reason I'm not allowed to announce it, but I'm going to, I'll tell you what, I'm going to announce it. I'm gonna announce it on six, nine, 16 at 4:00 PM GMT time, whatever that means. Gaelic Gaelic Mountain. [inaudible] Haiti tool time. All right.

I'm going to tell you everything now. All right. Six nine, 16 at 4:00 PM, uh, the presale will be announced. No, right. Just this is why I had to rerecord it. This is so fucking confusing. The presale for Dublin, Ireland is going to be June 10th. My birthday, 2016 at 9:00 AM Gaelic mountain time. All right. Um, and then the regular on sale is going to be June 13th, 9:00 AM GMT time, whatever the fuck that means. Alright. And, um, Belfast is going to be about five days later and so's Gallway a gay away modal Ireland. Um, we'll be like, that'll be June 15th.

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:02:28       so that's the deal. All right. And I'll let you guys know. I'll just, I'll tweet about it. I'll do all that shit so nobody gets fucked out of anything. Also, there's been a second show added in London, England,

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:41       for August six, 2016 a we'll have a link up there for that and I'll let shit, all right. There you go. I got all the business stuff out of the way and also go to all things, comedy.com be sick of listening to me. We got a bunch of other talented people out there that you can listen to. Um, and with that, let's get into the podcast. Oh, did I? Around SCIATICA. It's still acting up. I'm going to every fucking witch doctor out here at this point. I don't give a shit. You know, some woman was talking to me was saying how she got Sciatica when she was pregnant and it was just like, he called me fat and she, she laughed. She's like, no, she goes, I just, I just got it. And uh, she went someplace and she goes, they just kinda lightly just with on my backside.

Speaker 2:          00:03:25       I thought they were really gonna need in there. They just kinda lightly wants like what? That nobody's fucking putting leaves on my butt cheeks. I'm going to go to everybody else first before that. Um, but I gotta tell you like something happens with the air pressure when I'm on a plane, the back of my leg, it feels like my hamstrings gonna snap. Uh, so I got to keep standing up doing my Vietnamese gambler fucking squat and um, I dunno. I'm trying to stretch out the PSOAS muscle. I'm doing everything I can to try to keep this thing at bay cause I don't fucking have the time to take care of it. I just don't have to fucking busy here with, uh, writing this filthy wonderful cartoon, which I'm having a great time doing. I bopped episode six this week. People up to episode six writing as far, far as that aspect of it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:14       I literally signed to fucking Raymond. All right, let me take you through my trip here. All right. I had some fucking guy, he was like in his early sixties give me this fucking look like he was gonna Punch me in the face to the point I had to say something to him. And I know you guys are thinking like, Bill, what the fuck you're talking shit to a guy 63 well I'm going to be 48 this week. So you know when I was 15 he was 30 so it's not that bad. We're pretty close, right? When I was 10 he was 25 right. But you know, you think he wouldn't have picked on me back then is what happened. Right? So I went down, go around in the airport, right? I got bumped up the business. So I get to go first. I get to go into the lounge, right?

Speaker 2:          00:04:58       I get to go in and fucking pour myself some cornflakes or whatever. So I go into the lounge and there's this fucking guy, right. He just, I dunno, I just, I got on the elevator and he was there and he was kind of in my space, but he was a little oblivious or whatever. Right. Fucking horseshoe level bald and he dies the sides, which is always hysterical to me. Like, dude, what the why you still dying that you think that makes you look younger? Um, so anyways, it's like five in the fucking was before five in the morning. Cause that's what time my flight is. And you know, I go up to the lounge and I set my shit down. He goes his other way. I'm not even thinking about this guy. And then I'm walking over to where the cereal is and so is he all right? Like two planes about to land, you know, on the same runway. I'm in front of them, I have priority. So I walk over there and then he, I feel him standing way close to close to me.

Speaker 2:          00:05:51       And when I finished, you know, I just did a couple of turns, you know, the fucking Ciro thing. Couple turns of the KNOB, it goes into the bowl and then I pour some milk in it. It probably took me less than 15 seconds to do that. And when I turned around, cause I just felt him, I would have turned the other way. But I felt him on my left shoulder turn and looked at him and he was glaring at me showing me all of his bottom teeth. You know, he's like, Eh, except he wasn't making that noise. But you know the face you make when you eh, that's what he was looking at me just glaring at me. So what the fuck did I say to them?

Speaker 3:          00:06:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06:28       I just looked down, I was like, I am. I said, are you, I go, you are, you are right. That's why I said, are you all right? And then he didn't say anything.

Speaker 3:          00:06:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:39       And then I felt bad like, oh man was, was he like one of those old guys? Remember I did that bit. The old man face was that, is that the beginning of the old man face? You start glaring at first and then you gradually get more scared. I have no idea. Right. Um, it's like those old people know they're going to hell. They're thinking back on their life and they're trying to think, do they have enough time to say enough hair, Hail Mary's? And they just realized they can't. They're like, they probably saw ghosts and saw those creepy things coming up from hell. So anyways, he didn't say anything. So I walk away and I'm thinking that feeling bad. Like, aw man, I, I, I, uh, you know, I just fucking yelled at that old, I didn't yell at the old guy, but I kind of gave him shit, you know, so I felt bad then went over to sit down and then he gets his fucking cereal and at this point, you know, I'm like, I'm like fucking 20 yards away from this guy, sit down and he fucking turns around and as he's walking over to his wife, he looks at me and goes, hey man, shakes his fucking head up.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       She was glaring at me.

Speaker 3:          00:07:39       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       So later I go to get up to get a fucking apple and I knew where he was going to be looking at him. And I looked right over at him and I, I can't remember what the fuck I did. And then I was like, really, Bill, are you really doing this? Neither one of these is going to fight. You're both too fucking old to fight. And that's how my trip started. So I should have known that it was going to be a weird travel experience. Um, ended up getting into a Syracuse. That's what I was going the first night. And we played this minor league hockey arena and, uh, I didn't know at the time until I got there. They actually, uh, filmed, um, that's where they filmed slapshot a lot of it when they did all this stuff, you know, I'm listening to the fucking song when they were on the ice and everything, so that was cooly shit.

Speaker 2:          00:08:28       Um, the next night we did another one of those small hockey arenas and then that one they told me that was the place Elvis was supposed to perform at. Um, but he died the day before. That was his next concert. And so they still have all these Elvis tickets and they actually gave me this little frame thing of a couple of Elvis tickets and then a, the date that I played there was really fucking cool. Um, what the fuck did I go after that? Oh, then I went down to ball. I was driving from Portland back to fucking Albany. Who's kidding? Who I wasn't fucking [inaudible] was riding. We were in this SUV and I was laying down in the back seat because my fucking leg was killing me. Um, it's shit's really starting to scare me, man. Like how fucking long is this gonna take? I've been dealing with this shit since February. Every time I start to turn the corner, I got to get on a plane again. So people always stare at me too. When I stand up on the plane, I squat down. I don't even give a fuck. And they just looking at me. I told you in the last time this guy asked me if I was praying.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       So, um, anyways, in the final show last night was, was in Albany, but I actually, when we drove from Portland, which so many memories came back when we went over that bridge, when we went over this bridge and, uh, we go from New Hampshire to Maine and I remember I used to fucking, one of my first girlfriends used to live over there. Brandon, the other side of that, well, she didn't live there. She lived down in the Boston area, but she had like family up there. I remember going up on over that bridge. I always think of that shit. I always think about the ticket that I got on the fucking turnpike up there, driving my piece of shit truck back. Um, the comedy connection up there, all of that shit. And, um, I gotta tell you, man, just living out here in la, lay all people in New York for Mont New Hampshire, in Western mass in Maine.

Speaker 2:          00:10:22       I hope they realize how fucking lucky they are to live where it rains and there's all that lush land. I'm so fucking jealous of that shit. Like when I came back, um, we would, when we would drive in from Portland to, uh, Albany, I actually went down to the Boston area to visit some family and friends and stop off and one of my favorite pizza places and uh, I, we can't ended up coming down route one in them fucking memories that were coming back. There was this strip club up there that was the hilltop steakhouse would say now completely knocked down. I hope that signed cause it's still up that giant fucking cactus. I hope somehow like that thing is protected. You know what I mean? You know, it's funny. That's like one of those dumb things they'll sell on fucking Ebay for like 1 million bucks and it'll say like 15 people are watching this, you know, do you know like, like back in the day how they used to, they used to catch people with warrants.

Speaker 2:          00:11:23       They would just have a, like during like a fight or something, they would just advertise a, hey, you're the, you're the 20th person to order this. Come down here and claim your free gift. And they'd call these people up and they would all go down and claim the gifts and then I'll be all these people standing around down there and then the cops would just walk in and they'd fucking arrest everybody. Um, they should fucking do that with, with dumb shit like that on Ebay. Like the giant, the hilltop steakhouse, right? There's 15 people watching it. Those 15 people should immediately

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       be audited. Who would have, who do Fox got 1 million bucks to blow on a giant lit up cat. I mean, everybody wants it. Well, not everybody. I'd love to have that fucking thing. You know, get yourself to spread out in the middle of nowhere. You have a giant lit up cactus. Your friends come over, right? Just to make a right at the giant cactus. You know, you get a nickname out of it. Oh, cactus Chris, he's fucking crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:12:21       Um,

Speaker 4:          00:12:22       but nobody has the money to do that shit.

Speaker 2:          00:12:24       Right? Like I went on Ebay, right? And I was, uh, I don't, what the fuck I was looking, I was trying to, you know, kill the flight now. Now you can, you know, go online. So I was just looking up random shit like, uh, humidors even though I've gotten cigars mostly out of my life, I was just looking him up cause I think they're fucking cool. Right. Well I know what I was doing, I was looking at cigar aficionado and they had all these, you know, cool places where you can smoke a cigar. They let you know in different cities like places to smoke and shit. Right? Like I already find a cool place in London, um, possibly to smoke. We'll see. And uh, that is if I smoked there, I don't know, we'll figure it out anyways. Uh, and that just got me thinking about cigar smoking and all that type of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:13:07       So I went on Ebay and a lot of the shit that comes along with cigar smoke and it's pretty fucking cool. A lot of the lighters, a lot of the ash trays in the humidors and I like looking at that stuff, especially if they're vintage or old. So I look up vintage humidor. I'm sure it's still there. And this, this does this fucking, I think it's sitting bull. It's this bust of sitting bull. All right. That's what the fucking humidor is. It's a bust of sitting bull and what's really fucking, you know, weird is to to, you know, put your cigars in it. You basically take off the scalp, which I thought was a little fucking tacky, but granted it's old. That was considered a Mike. Totally fine back in the day. Right? Um, so anyways, this fucking thing is going for a million and a half dollars and it has, it says like there's like 20 people watching. I'm looking it up right now. ebay.com. All right. Okay. Vintage you mid door. Boom. All right. What do you got? What do you got? Oh fuck. Where the hell is it coming? Oh there it is. Right there sitting

Speaker 4:          00:14:15       both cigar store, Indian statue, Antique American folk art, vintage tobacco. You know what's funny from the side? It actually looks cool from straight on. It just looks like,

Speaker 2:          00:14:28       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:28       I Dunno. It's kind of looking off vague. He kind of looks sad and then they, I don't understand why.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:14:35       This thing is a million and a half bucks. This 61 people watching this 61 people have a million and a half dollars to spend on a fucking humidor. I Dunno. Like that's the type of shit right there. Like if I was dodging and taxes and all that type of shit, you know, go out and do this on the Internet. Right. I Dunno. That's like whenever you, you, we have watch shows, make them car auctions. You know, when somebody spends 500 grand on a fucking Mustang, I mean, you're either, you're either evading taxes or you're a wife beater, one or the other. Okay. You're either cheating the fucking system or your wife is scared to death is of you that she, she'll let you fucking do that. Blow a million and a half bucks on a humidor looking at Ani and a great setting. Paul, look at the top of his head, comes off like after a fucking autopsy.

Speaker 4:          00:15:34       Um, anyways, so I can't remember the hell I was talking about here. Oh. So we end up having to just having this great anytime I work with furry, we have a great fucking time. Um, when we were up in Portland after the show, we had a great time working the, the uh, the Elvis venue there and um, we ended up going up to this bar afterwards and game three of the Stanley Cup finals and uh, the UFC fights were both on it. Jesus Christ, Dan fucking Anderson. Do you guys see that knockout? That was like some Bourne identity shit. He threw a kick when passed the guy and then fucking threw an elbow like he was training in a phone booth. I've never seen anything like that in run. Long time ago I saw a few FC fighter basically throw a left hook, but he did it with his knee.

Speaker 4:          00:16:25       He fucking got rocked in their head. I think it was that guy that used to call the little bottle a little ball of hate. The hell is his name. One of my favorite fighters back then. Right. He had hair dyed, like bright red fire engine red and he got rocked and he started to go down and the other guy was so excited to jump on him, started hitting him that he kind of just went in with his hands down a little bit and the fucking guy was able to regroup and he just, I can't explain it. He threw it. He need the guy in their head, but he like came from the side. He threw a hook. This fucking guy went down, gave him the old right there. Fred with the left knee, Dan Anderson, the same fucking thing. This guy was just, he was getting punched in the head repeatedly and everybody in the bars got, oh right.

Speaker 4:          00:17:15       And I'm yelling and I actually for once, cause I don't know shit about fighting. I go, he's fucking eating those punches. I'll look at them. And uh, then next, you know, he kicks the guy in the fucking head. He kicked him in the head and then somehow he was like parallel to the guy's head and he gave me all that fucking there with the elbow. And the guy just went down. That was it over. And then the coolest thing ever was his family was there, you know, tell me, you don't have the coolest dad ever. Guy Goes shirtless in the ring, eats fucking 12 punches to the head and then knocked the other guy out. You know, you know, it's funny, he was in better shape than his kids. He's a 45 year old guy. You should have the dad bod. He's up there shredded. His kids are coming up, you know, he's making him look soft. Not saying they were soft. I'm just saying. Usually by the time you're 45, you have three, four kids. You just got that 600 yard stare. Like you don't give a fuck if you're eating a twinkie or a fucking tube sock. You know, and this guys up there just was shredded. So once again, once again, UFC

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       completely worth the fucking money. Um, the pay to get in. I missed all the other fee. Oh No, I saw the uh, the championship one with a guy there that I've been watching ever since he was on, um, the ultimate fighter. The guy from Manchester, England. Uh, fuck. I gotta get his name here. God dammit. Um, I, you know, I realized when he won, I had been saying his last name wrong forever. UFC Champ Manchester. Here we go. What's his name? Michael Bisbing. I was, I was Biz Bain. Michael Bisman. He fucking won. That was another great one. Um, what a night. And then as we end, as we're watching that simultaneously they watch and uh, well I guess I was probably the only one really watching it, but I was watching the uh, Penguins San Jose and I'm looking at this shit going like, holy fuck, it's two to one that carrying the play and all of a sudden they get a high stick. I think it was a four minute power play. They seem like they were on the power play for fucking ever long story short through up to two to one in the game. And it was like

Speaker 4:          00:19:20       they killed off like all, all fucking 20 minutes of this penalty. It seems like a 20 minute penalty. Right? They killed his fucking thing off. There's like two seconds left. And all I'm thinking in my head is if they kill off this penalty, they're going to win this game and they're going to win the cup. This is the fucking series and it's over three to score out of nowhere. I Dunno, I dunno if it was tipped or whatever after San Jose's goalie made this one of the sickest, he fucking like saved it with like the inside of his forearm,

Speaker 2:          00:19:51       you know, a few minutes earlier then did any let that one go in

Speaker 4:          00:19:55       little bit of a floater and now it's two games to one. Right. And I don't give a fuck either way. My team's out of it. And then my surrogate team is also a lot of it. All I know is that means that there's going to be at least one more game of hockey.

Speaker 2:          00:20:09       Right. As far as, rather than just going for games, that'll go five. Right. So we at least got two more games, which is good for me because, uh, when, when the NHL and the NBA seasons end, I have like a sort of sports panic attack because they haven't watched it been watching baseball. I don't know what the fuck's going on in baseball, but all I know it's like the middle of the season. You know Dahlia, here's the rubber game. Yes.

Speaker 4:          00:20:33       Wow. All out Sadie. He going to see that slat or a lot this afternoon. You know, after you just went from,

Speaker 2:          00:20:38       from like watching people win championships and playing at that level. Um, that's why the NFL is the shit as far as like, it actually compete with October baseball because you figured that the middle of the NFL season would be boring. Like most, most sports, the middle of this season is boring when you play in like 80 to 162 gangs. But NFL only plays 16 games. Every game means so fucking much, you know? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:21:06       Plus Tom Brady ought to be coming back from his nice rest, a nice rest, relaxed, pissed off. Tom Brady coming back to light she up again. You know, you guys can look under the rocks and try to figure out what he's doing some day, some day you will admit that he fucking was, you know, the guy was just a shit. Um, and then the saddest thing, obviously the weekend was a, was the death of Muhammad Ali. Man, that guy, if you've never watched when we were kings,

Speaker 1:          00:21:39       um,

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       I used to watch it. I used to own that thing and I used to, I wore it out. I had an a VHS then he had on a DVD. I just, I've watched it so many fucking times. I just, um, I don't even know how to put the guy into words. It was literally like one out of, I watched it, I was like, I have not done shit with my life. The guy was unbelievable. And when I, I tweeted, you know, greatest of all time, greatest athlete, ambassador, human being of all time and all these, you know, Twitter cons, come on bill. He just, he hit things in a ring. It's like, no, he didn't, he didn't, he did so much stuff beyond that. Like, you know, it says how great mom and I, Lee was

Speaker 1:          00:22:18       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:18       Like when I said greatest human ever, I said, really? They're like better than Gandhi. And it's like, exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 1:          00:22:27       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       If I said fucking Tom Brady, you know, greatest devil, you just going to bring up other quarterbacks. You had to bring up fucking Gandhi. This is a goddamn athlete. That's a good comparison. Cause he was doing Gandhi shit outside of the ring and he could knock out anybody in the world. The guy could hold court in the poorest of the poor, right up to the White House. When he walked in, he lit up the room, everybody shut up and you never forgot it. And uh, and on top of that, he was one of the greatest fighters of all time, if not the greatest,

Speaker 1:          00:23:01       um, [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:23:03       and I got so much out of when I used to watch that, you know, when he was talking all that shit,

Speaker 1:          00:23:09       um,

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       it was like he was almost, as much as he was talking shit, he was like, it was like self help. It's not the way it's done today where today it's just all like, it's all perverted. You know what I mean? It's like, you know what's going to happen if you say the crazy shit, you know that you're hype in the fight, you know that you're going to get a sneaker deal. You know all this money's coming. I'm not saying that he didn't know that on some level, but the shit that that guy went through,

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       um,

Speaker 2:          00:23:38       if you watch some of those early, especially the ones that are in black and white, the fucking white reporters are so God damn racist. It's like ridiculous. I remember he, he just going and going and going and this reporter's just white guys getting fucking mad. He just hates his confidence. This guy, like if this guy could've got sent into the future, he'd be a hater on Twitter. So he finally just goes, do, do you ever stop talking? And Ali said something like, now, cause I'm knocking out all bumps and if you keep talking, I'm knocking you out too. And he just, it was the greatest. He just fucking pissed the guy off and he knew what the guy was doing and he was able to navigate all that. I know everybody says all the terrible shit that he did to Joe Frazier, but nobody gets out of this life without some bad shit.

Speaker 2:          00:24:18       Everybody's done some bad shit. You know what I mean? But, um, I dunno man, he still had a good run though, 70, 74 years. Um, I used to watch them when I was a kid. Man, that's how fucking old I am. That's what's freaking me out now. It was all these people that were like in their twenties and thirties when I was a kid are now dying of like fucking old age and shit. David Bowie, Muhammad Ali, that's fucking freaking me out. You know what I mean? Maybe that's why that guy at the, uh, at the little cereal thing in the fucking at the airport was giving me that look. Cause he knows he's going. So you know, everybody he knew is probably all dead right. And He's thinking Alan got so much time left to get cereal. You know, I was also thinking the fact that he felt so fucking like he, the little like the complete lack of patients that he had and I don't have patients, the fact that that he couldn't wait two seconds for me to get some fucking cheerio's I was also thinking like that's probably why he's in this lounge.

Speaker 2:          00:25:24       This guy just fucking take it doesn't take no for an answer. He's a lunatic. Um, I don't know. That's kind of fucking depressing shit that'd be talking about death. Cause I gotta tell you though, man, like the amount of fucking people that have died in the last God damn year, that I am old enough to have been a teenager and seeing them in their fucking prime. Um, how about that print shit? Huh? A person lost to the opiates and stuff. I just can't put my like, I can't believe it, but the fact that they actually come at him and they come at fame and celebrity and all that type of shit. Like people are fucking dying. Regular people are dying because of their drug. However the fuck you say, fentanyl or whatever the hell it is, they get it. Then the prescription runs out, they're addicted to opiates and then they get on heroin.

Speaker 2:          00:26:15       And the fact that they don't talk about the pharmaceutical companies at all is because that's like 150 fucking zillion dollar business and they give money to the politicians and the advertise on TV. So they make like prints out to be like this. Um, this famous guy that P, you know, nobody could say no to. I mean, I might be wrong in this, but I know he had at least one hip if not two. And if you ever watched the guy, the guy never took a show off. He was all over the fucking stage. I imagine he was in pain and that's how that shit started was basically him pouring his heart out on stage, giving everybody 100%. He wore out his fucking hips. What's this? James Brown did the same thing. He had to get new hips. Um, fortunately by the time prince got the operation, hopefully they were further along and, uh, but I, I imagine he still had all kinds of pain.

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       And then I, I that's, that's my guess, but for the fact that people came at him, some people, the way that they came at him was, uh, I don't know, considering the shows and, and the music that he left us. I thought it was really fucking, ah, it's a little below the belt though. When you say I, I think that's a little below the belt. Have you guys seen this youtube video? My name is John Dacre. You gotta Watch this thing. I apologize cause it's going to be in your fucking head for the rest of time. I'll, I'll, I'll post the, um, the video, um, to, um, my, my Twitter account. He's singing, he's singing a moray and he can't remember how to say

Speaker 3:          00:27:55       [inaudible]. Those will ring the bell more rarely.

Speaker 2:          00:28:10       I can't stop watching this guy, this guy, I swear to God, I think it's his first TV Gig. Somebody was sick. I think they said at the beginning, this guy fills in and if you look at him, he's literally having an outer body experience. So it's so funny to me because I can relate to this person because the first time I did stand up I felt like I was watching myself. I've fucked everything up and this guy, just the way he says his name, it's almost the just, he says like, my name is John Dacre.

Speaker 5:          00:28:43       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:28:44       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:46       It's like, it's like he was outsets. I think that might be my favorite part of the video is the when this fucking guy, just the way he says his own name, he didn't say, my name's John Dacre. He goes, my name's John Dagger. I did it right the first time. I just fucked it up. Hey, you got to hear this. You hear this fucking guy. He says he's singing all these Jesus songs. Hang on, hang on.

Speaker 5:          00:29:14       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:29:16       My name is John Dacre.

Speaker 6:          00:29:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:22       That's the funniest shit ever. My name's John Taker. It's like he's watching his life, like he already died and then he came back and he just got to like, he first time you ever realized my name. My name is John Dager. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:29:42       That's my fucking name. And this is my life and I'm on TV and I'm going to sing this song. This is what I did with my life. And these, you look at the guy fucking poor bastard.

Speaker 2:          00:29:53       Um, anyways,

Um, all right, let's read some of the letters for this week. We're going to lead some of the rent.

Speaker 4:          00:37:49       Oh, before, before I do though, the uh, Jesus Christ, poor Jason Law head man after game one. He's a Cleveland Guy after game one and I can't even say game on. After the first fucking quarter, this guy was sending me texts. He had his like his head in the oven. I'm like, Jesus Christ, Dude. Nobody fucking throws in the towel the way you did. I remember back to back years, I think in 84 the Lakers came out and blew out the Celtics in game one and we came back and beat him and then the very next year we blew them out and game one one by like 1520 fucking points. And then the Lakers won. So I was like, for fuck sakes. The Bruins were down out to the Vancouver. We ended up winning for the next five and we raised, we fucking hoisted up the cup. Stop being such a negative Nelly.

Speaker 4:          00:38:36       And then after the game too, when they lost by like fucking 30 or 35, I wrote back to him, I maybe you've got a point. Yeah. Um, I never say this after two games, but this series is fucking over. It's over man. Just go, go down. If you live in Oakland, just go fucking find a, uh, you know, find a good spot for the championship parade. This, this is a, I don't know, maybe they go back to Cleveland and then, you know, all the positivity from their fans seeps into, I'm kidding. Um, here's a question I got. If you guys, I didn't get why Trump got into so much fucking trouble. You know, I, we, you know what I know, cause he's a dope, but like this stuff that they were saying that he said something racist, right about the uh, the judge Mexican American judge, right?

Speaker 4:          00:39:28       Something about the fucking wall. This is what I like to do. And on a hot button issue like this, I just gonna Wade right in with barely ever even knowing the facts. It says Donald Trump's attacks on the judge, uh, are racist. He's quite literally saying the judge can't do his job because of his ethnicity. This is the definition of racism. I guess. He was doing some debate going on about that wall that he wants to build and this judge who's Mexican American was going to rule on it. And I think Trump said that he didn't want him to because he was Mexican. He was going to be biased. So everybody said that that was racist. So here's my question. As a Joe 12 pack, I'm not Joe six pack Joe 12 pack. Um, basically what he did there is far as I could tell is how they picked juries.

Speaker 4:          00:40:20       Isn't that how they always pick a jury? You know what I mean? Like if you go down for jury duty and the defendant is black as a white dude, yet the, I'm not, I'm not going to get picked for this jury or the, the, the defending defendant, uh, attorney doesn't want me on there. Right? Isn't that how they picked the whole old jets? How they always do it? If it's a domestic violence case, let's try to get as many women there as possible. You know, I think they hide it by go because I think that they can understand women also now they're hoping to win the fucking case. So what they do is they stack the deck with enough people of the same ilk as the defendant right now. Don't they do that? Yeah. My nuts here, I believe that that's what they do. So I thought it was kind of ironic that they within the court system that if Trump is saying that, it's like Trump's picking his Gerry to try to get the fucking wall and what he wants is he wants a bunch of fucking white people who like a white guy goes, oh, we'll [inaudible] you. You, you, you watch how great it's going to be. He wants

Speaker 4:          00:41:35       the mouth breathing morons that like him on his jury. That's all he was saying as far as I could tell. Right. Not saying the guy's not racist, but I thought that that one, they were stretching the bounds a little bit. Now I'm just asking a fucking question before you fucking edit this thing and make me look like the next Hitler. But I was watching that story. I was just going like, yeah, that's kind of how courts work. It's kind of exactly how it works. And not to mention when the OJ verdict came in, white people like what the fuck and black people were freaking out having a parade. That's why they do it. Right? Everybody watches it and you put yourself in the position of whatever's there. I watched the OJ trial, I'm fucking, I got my throat slashed. Right? Black people watch it and they go, yeah, I got off. That's how I look at it. I Dunno. And I don't think that's wrong either. It's like watching sports except it's people's freedom. Um, Eddie.

Speaker 4:          00:42:36       Alright. Scandinavia. Hey Billy Burger balls. Uh, is it true that you're not going to come to Scandinavia? Me and my lady are huge fans and was really hoping for you to come to Sweden this summer. Slash. Fall. I just need to know if I need to book some plane tickets to the Netherlands, then this is going to cost me like one grand for us to see your shit. But I'll bet it's worth it. A, but I just need to know if you're planning to come to Scandinavia some point in the future. Otherwise love your shit and looking forward to F is for family season to, well thank you very much. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:43:10       F is for family season two is the reason why on this trip I'm not going to a Scandinavia. So like there's like three chunks. Okay. There's the my pasty people, which is coming in first. You know, just like the jury

Speaker 4:          00:43:29       does this mean I'm a, I'm a, I'm a racist the way I'm touring against other white people. Um, no, it's just how it worked up. And then I probably would do the Scandinavian thing next and then

Speaker 2:          00:43:39       hopefully eastern Europe. That's what I am hoping to do. Um, the show takes up way more time than I thought it would, but like they, I had a list of 29 cities that wanted to bring me over there and I could have gone on a month long fucking crazy ass tour. Um, uh, broken it up into two. But I think the way my workload is now, I have to break it into three, but like I am absolutely coming back there again. It's a beautiful country. Um, I love it. You know, the fuck doesn't want to go that I've been in like two or three times and uh, I'll definitely come back. I just don't know when, um, I can't promise you as to when, but I am definitely going to come back and, uh, I don't know. Other than that, I don't have any more information. So save you money, dude. Don't blow a grant. Don't blow grant coming to see me with Shit and Dick Jokes.

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       I'll, I'll, I'll come your way. All right. Don't worry about it. Okay. Ex men billboard. Hey billion. Um, this is fucking nerd shit. A nerd shit. So please bear with me. There's a new x man movie and Rose McGowan, the chick who used to date Marilyn Manson has their tits in an uproar over this billboard because between mystique a woman and apocalypse, that dude, if you don't want to click on the link from some Weirdo, you don't, don't know a no problem. Just to picture just picture of blue dude holding up a naked blue woman by the throat to the point or feet aren't on the ground. Context. Apocalypse. The dude is a bad ass villain in the movie and Mystique. The woman is the leading lady and Badass heroin in the movie. Um, here's the problem. Rose McGowan says, this is promoting violence against women, which I feel is horse shit.

Speaker 4:          00:45:27       Here's why. If it was Hugh Jackman Slash Wolverine being choked out and held up, no problem. The point of the post is to show how dangerous slash how much of a threat the villain, how much of a threat the villain is. It's not a political statement. Here's my issue with this though. How does this studio slash movie maker when Suppose Wolverine was the leading hero? It was a one, women would be con women would be complaining that it's always a man as the hero and women are more like backup or support roles. I mean, Ms Mystique is bad ass. She's leading the fight against this guy. To me that's empowering to women. Uh, she is in a sex symbol. In the movie though, Jennifer Lawrence, who plays her is really attractive. She's just strong and a leader. All I can think is that they wanted her standing all, all I can think is that they want her standing on the neck of the villain.

Speaker 4:          00:46:24       But this, but that's fucking stupid. For promotional posters. You couldn't have her be the villain and holding up a man hero because that would be some kind of anti woman. All women are evil campaign instead. Right. Where you lost me here, you couldn't have her be the villain and holding up a man hero. Oh, I see. If she, if, if the female character was evil and there was holding up the guy character, they couldn't do that because then they would be saying, oh, if we antique be considered anti-women all women are evil. Um, I guess what bothers me is that it just seems like there's no way to please any non white male. Lately, uh, women wanted a strong female hero that got one, but she's in danger of the villain. A man, somehow that equals violence on women when it's really just about violence in general or war or conflict or whatever. I mean, the dude isn't slapping her for over cooking his steak. He's trying to conquer the world. She's trying to stop, stop him and he's choking her ass. How, how is that a gender issue? Um, all right. Uh, let me see. Let me see. If I can find the picture this year, I did look at it, uh, [inaudible] library. No, that's not the f I always click on the wrong one.

Speaker 1:          00:47:44       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:47:45       Yeah. I actually, you know, when I heard it, I thought it was bull shit, but then I saw the poster, the, the movie clip that I saw. I don't see your feet dangling off of it. Um, I, I see why they did that. I understand why that they did it that way. What happens is when you're writing, what I'm learning is when you're writing something you're so fucking focused on is the story tracking from point a to point B to point c and we land this thing without crashing into the fucking ocean. Um, that they wouldn't think that anybody, you know, might have a problem with that. Um, I understand, I understand. I, this is actually one of those ones I get why they don't want to see that, but in defensive view, if, how about this? If the guy character, the, the fucking Apollo Guy, whatever his fucking name is, was a apocalypse, such dumb names, apocalypse mystique, this all sound like bad cologne. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       okay.

Speaker 4:          00:48:47       Um, anyways, if, if apocalypse was holding a, the Wolverine Hugh Jackman by the throat, now, would that be promoting male on male violence? Would that be more a barroom brawls because of that? I honestly don't think it promotes violence. I think, um, like the levels stupid that you'd have to be to look at apocalypse holding up, pulled in a woman by her throat and to say like, oh, I guess it's okay to hit women. Now I'm going to start hitting women. If you were that fucking stupid, by the time you got to you, unless she was riding in the car, let's see, you're driving home and now you're going to fucking choker because you saw this apocalypse guy choking a fucking, um, mystique, right? You'd also see another thousand signs on the way home and next thing you know, I dunno, you'd be in a car dealership buying something or, uh, getting a fucking McDonald's sandwich.

Speaker 4:          00:49:48       I think you would forget you with that. Like, if your brain was like that, uh, influenced, but having said that, I looking at the, um, the poster and I don't, I understand why they would just like, you know, that's not the, uh, greatest image. You could have another image up there. Yeah. I don't have a problem with them changing it, but I definitely understand your, um, your points on that thing. But, uh, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't fucking know. It's, it's just the time that we're living in. Everybody gets offended. Everybody doesn't get offended. A small group of people gets offended. And, um, the news covers,

Speaker 2:          00:50:27       you know, because what are they gonna talk about the fucking, now the drug companies in a roundabout way killed prince, you know, I mean, what are they gonna talk about it again? Talk about fracking and people than fucking up the water supply. Then there's too much money involved in that. Okay. But you know, if you've got a group of fucking soccer moms upset about a fucking blue woman getting held up by a guy who appears to be made out of stone, I'm in a movie, you know, that's gonna make it. It's gonna make it, you do a Caitlin Jenner joke in a fucking strip mall. Yeah, that's going to get on the fucking news. But real shit that matters. Nah, that's not gonna happen. You know, that's not going to fall. Why? Why now? Why would you do that? That's just another one of those backburner stories that they just stick on the front burner all the fucking time. Like they, I mean, I'm not saying like, you know, violence against women isn't a major issue, but I'm just saying like, people aren't as simplistic as that. Like they don't fucking look at something and like,

Speaker 1:          00:51:27       um,

Speaker 2:          00:51:28       I dunno as a kid, like the amount of violence that I watched when I was growing up, you know what I mean? All the fucking shows that I've watched, I've yet to chase somebody down an alley, pull them off a fence, chain link, fence, beat them up. Or even slide over the hood of a car. I saw all those images when I was growing up. I used to pretend and play war and all that shit. I never fucking killed anybody. I've never hit a woman. I never did any of that. I think what, you know, what it is, is what really makes you do shit like that is his horrific fucking parents. I think that that's what it is. And now they're trying to blame the signs, the sign that's going to be up for all of fucking two weeks when this movie's out, as opposed to your dad and mom and their relationship that you grow up for the first 18 years of your life.

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       Fucking watch it. But you know, you can't blame those people because those people buy things on the channel. You know what I mean? So you always give them a pass and then you rub their balls and you call them Joe six back in fucking, uh, the true heroes. You know, they're always rubbing their balls like they give a fuck about them. They don't, they just want their money. You know what I mean? That's why corporations act like all of these non crisis is our absolute crisis crisis disease, because they don't want to lose a fucking dime. So if anybody bitches, anybody mounds, anybody complains, they fucking cave in. And then a lot of these groups are aware of that. And when they get to a, to get a corporation to cave, it gives them like it, it's almost like a video game. It gives them more life and a, they're taken more seriously. So it's a giant, it's a giant fucking game. You know, at the end of the day it's, it's, it's two people that don't fucking exist. But

Speaker 1:          00:53:06       um,

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       I dunno, there's something, there's a look on her face. She doesn't look bad ass there. It makes me feel bad for her and I want to help her. So maybe what they should have done, she should've had a more fucking Rhonda Rousey look on her face and maybe it was pulling backs on his fucking, are those cornrows?

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       What the fuck does he have? Or is that wavy hair? I can't, I don't know what this guy made out of his fucking claymation hair. She should have. She should be like, you know, maybe gouge in his eyes a little bit. I don't know. I was kidding who. They'd still fucking complain.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       Um,

Speaker 4:          00:53:42       if you really want to get them going, just

Speaker 4:          00:53:46       have that picture right there. That image. Nah, I'm not going to tell you to do that because there's no sense of humor anymore. I was gonna I was going to say that maybe you could take that image and say like, um, no, don't built down it's, it's don't ask me in a show. I'll tell you what I was going to say. All right. Hey, Billy dope, Philly, the fucking dope. Can't can women forget Mr. Nice Guy Persona. Uh, Hey, I'm really having a difficult reading today. All right, big fan from Lithuania. That's another one on the list that I gotta get to. Uh, you're a great comedian. It would be great if he ever decided to do your stand up here in the Baltics. Um, that will happen at some point in my career. Hopefully sooner rather than later. All right. The guy says, I got at this dilemma. Can a woman forget your past as a nice guy? One of my former classmates is coming back to my hometown on summer vacation for a few weeks and let's say I'd like to get intimate with her while she's here. Now the thing is, when we were still in school, I had a mad crush on this girl for years. However, Shit didn't work out because I didn't know how the life works, how the females work. And also I was a little bitch, Mister Nice guy.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Uh,

Speaker 4:          00:55:02       I beat my younger self. That was possible. All right. [inaudible] you're doing some good therapy here. Uh, but for over the years, uh, but over the years that I've spent in our capital city city, I can safely say that my view and attitude towards females and masculinity, Lee masculinity has changed significantly. What do you think? Can a woman brush off the image of a nice guy or are you forever marked with the certain character traits in her eyes? Um, yeah, I think you're, you're kind of fucked. Just put it this way. Like take like the actor that played like Urkel or something like that. It's like you're typecast, you know, and Urkel could literally become an army fucking ranger and then leave the military. And when he went to go do a fucking action movie, they allow fucking article. Give me a fucking break. Right. It's just the problem is what you got to do.

Speaker 4:          00:56:02       Look, you always got to take you go, he's gotta take it. Bet what you're going to have to do when you get up there. He says, you're going to have to crowd the plate. No Kid, which I would just be, you're gonna have to be significantly different to raise any sort of intrigue in her. You know what I mean? Cause probably just wants to meet up with you, you know, have a couple of ciders or whatever that, whatever those drinks women have, when they know that they're not going to fuck you. You know, one of those fucking, I want to feel warm. You know, they have that stupid sweater that covers their hands too and they drink it with both hands out of a Mug, you know? And it's just fucking over, right. They're like, you know, hitting more on the waiter than the, I don't, I mean listen to you.

Speaker 4:          00:56:45       You're going to have to lie. I Dunno. I don't know what you gotta do. Go Buy yourself a Raiders of the lost Ark Leather jacket. You got to try to come in and act like you've been fucking doing this. This is the thing. This is what's gonna fuck you is you want this woman to bad. All right? You got to not give a fuck. Don't be, don't be a deck. But just go in there and just, hey, what's going on? What? Even up to now and then talk up some of the shit you're doing. You know? I don't know. Look at your phone out his bride. She's driving me crazy. I got the ladies all over me. I don't know. I don't know dude. I don't know what to tell you on this one. Once you're typecast, it's fucking over, dude. You got to go behind the camera here.

Speaker 4:          00:57:30       You got to start directing or some shit cause I don't know what to tell you. Your, um, this is what I would do. Just know this going into it, you're fucked. All right. So there's no pressure. Who gives a shit? And uh, I don't know. Make her laugh and just tell her, you know, I always had a crush on you, but I used to be a bitch, but I'm not a bitch anymore. So what do you say? What do you say? You come over here and uh, jump on my fucking enough. He can't go that way, but I, yeah, I would, I'm man, man, that's a tough one. That's a tough one. I, I, you know, maybe that's it. Just trash your former self. Yeah. Used to be. It used to be a pitch, you know, I don't know how to do it, dude. You know what?

Speaker 4:          00:58:10       You'd get stumped me somewhere in there, I think. I think the whole not giving a fuck and then trashing your former self and then just telling her that you had a crush on her. Who knows? Dude, maybe. Uh, I dunno. There's a chance. Maybe she likes you back then or, I dunno. Women got that thing though, Dude. Once you're the fucking friend, it, you're, you're, you're, it's over. Dude. So you're fucking, um, oh, the lovely Nia Nia. You know, we need you, me and this guy from Lithuania. I'll tell you really quickly, grab up, grab one of those chords. All right. Jesus. All right. As you're plugging in, I'll tell you this guy basically in Lithuania, he, uh, he used to be a bitch when it used to be Mr. Nice guy. So he, he didn't get any of any of the nice, nicest Tracy Morgan would say. Right. So he, um, whatever he had a crush on this chicken she got put in. The friend zone is Chris Rock would say, I'm just going to quote every black comedian here and um, you plugged in. There we go. And

Speaker 9:          00:59:22       you're putting the windscreen on eh,

Speaker 4:          00:59:26       really loud and annoying to the listeners. There we go. The lovely Nia. Everybody. Hi. Yeah. So basically he had a crush on this girl. He was a nice guy. He got put in the friend zone and now she's coming back to town. He's now lived in the city. He understands the male female dynamic better. Okay. And, um, the way he's wearing this, he's been doing all right for himself, but he still wants to bang this woman. He's, he, his question is once you're in the friend zone like that [inaudible] okay. Is it possible to get out of it? Absolutely. It is. Oh Wow. Okay. Cause I was going like, I don't know, I was saying to you like, type, you're like Urkel and now you want to be the star of an action movie,

Speaker 9:          01:00:07       you know? But yeah, no, I think you can, but it's all, it's all predicated on your behavior. Like you don't want gotta all of a sudden start at

Speaker 4:          01:00:15       do you like an aloof, a jerk or anything like that. So I told them by a rate as a lost dark waste link, leather jacket, maybe get it hat and a whip. Oh yeah. Is that bad? Uh, I just,

Speaker 9:          01:00:29       I think maybe you're a little less available perhaps. You know, you know, it can be a thing where she'll come to town and be like, oh my God, I guess let's go here and Dah, Dah, Dah, and I want to do this. And then, you know. Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. Well, we'll, we'll let me know when you're around. Yeah. Maybe we can grab a drink or something. Gave a cash and um, don't go in there like, so I've been fucking a lot of broads. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:00:54       It's not like that, but just as she's talking about her life, you talk about your life. Yeah. I've been seeing

Speaker 9:          01:01:01       girls here and there. I don't know nothing too serious, but I've been having my fun. But anyway, what's going on with you? You look good like that. Like

Speaker 4:          01:01:10       Nia, Bam. That was good. Oh, were you, were you, were you enjoying that just then that little ah, interact. I am joining the, the the advice. Yeah, that was good. That was usually, I was stammering. I was like, uh, maybe I have to just fuck it. I said, your best thing you got going is, you know you've got no shot, so just don't give a fuck it, just go in there and just be like, I sold shoes.

Speaker 9:          01:01:34       You have to not get, you can't go into it with expectations of anything. Yeah. I think you just be normal. Be a friend like you have been, but I think I have a friend who often gets friends zoned it, and I'm always telling him that he needs to make himself less available because he always makes himself available

Speaker 4:          01:01:56       psychologically to women when the less available as I have a theory and I know it'll be considered sexist, so I'll listen to you. Or just

Speaker 9:          01:02:03       the same with men and women. If you're less available, like the PE people want you more. And I think that's just how life is. People like the hunt. I think men like the hunt a little more. So I think you should remember like the hunt

Speaker 4:          01:02:17       really. If someone's like a pain, be like, oh hey. And I'd be like, yeah, I'm not a hunter. I have four of it. Gather. No, I was just more like, I hate, hated when women played hard to get. It was so funny. It just, it got so boring, so fucking fast. I was just like, Hey, I can fucking, I'll just go rub one out and then I'll go watch a game and then you know something. Then I act. It's, you're not worth the fucking trouble. Right. You know what I mean? I just always found that like, um, cause I remember when I would just start to walk away and let these girls would be like, no, you're supposed to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, oh, I didn't, I didn't get the script to where my in like some fucking awful play right now.

Speaker 4:          01:03:02       Right. I walked away from a lot by my number could have been so much higher. I should've chased. I didn't chase, I just tapped out. I'd be like, ah, yeah. You know, if you don't want to, I understand. You know, I wouldn't fuck me either. Oh, all right. Oh No, don't say that about yourself. People like you. All right. A bill dill pickle. Um, I love a good sandwich. My question to you is, if you are a sandwich, what type of sandwich would you be? I think you already answered this one. If you could eat only one sandwich for the rest of your life, what would you be? All right, Nia. Remind the listeners what kind of sandwich you think I am. I once compared you to a grilled cheese sandwich. But the thing about it said you were about as exotic is a grilled cheese sandwich. I was talking about that. If, if I ever went to prison, yes. The fact that I was a red head on for the first time in my life, I might be considered exotic. Yeah. And I thought you were grossly overestimating. I was joking about the fact that quickly I would be sexually assaulted in there. And you had to remind me that I'm a plain Jane. There wasn't even tomatoes on that fucking grilled cheese sandwich. You think what? The hair? I would got something. Fuck.

Speaker 4:          01:04:22       Alright, so sandwich. Would you like to eat for the rest of the, I know the sandwich that I could. This sounded like this question came out of cosmo. He went to Tham, which were kind of thing. Which would you be, and if you could only eat one sandwich for the rest of your life, what would it be? We would never ask each other what kind of sandwich we'd want to be. Maybe like what kind of dress are you? A classic little black dress. The cocktail dress. Oh, for the Oscars like that. But what about for the bigger girls? Well, for the bigger girls where they see the bigger girls, or you were car cover with Spaghetti straps stop. Why didn't they call? They're just feeding your fucking egos. Like you're all these PR. Oh yeah. When I want, I get what they're doing. They're trying to sell magazines anyway. What kind of sandwich would you be? Velveeta. If I was a pair of pants, I'd be clam diggers.

Speaker 4:          01:05:19       I saw like four or five guys wearing those fucking things. Oh, this weekend? Yeah. Like those guys. We have the Hitler youth haircuts and then they just walk around with the cubes up the fucking airport. It's the funniest thing ever. I don't know why it's not so CIF sackful just pointed their legs and start laughing. It's just me. All right. I love a good sandwich too. Okay. Um, oh. And I be, uh, I don't know. My freckles and all that. I'd probably be a lobster roll. Lobster or crab roll? No, you're looking all fucking white with red blotches in a day old bun. That'd be my sciatic nerve problem. I'm a mess. It's too like there are certain white people, they definitely take on the hue of a boiled lobster when they had to my son. And that would be me. Um, if you, okay. Turkey sandwich cause you like Turkey sandwiches.

Speaker 4:          01:06:17       Yeah. But that's not me. You're not no Turkey sandwich. You know, people get excited and happy when Turkey comes around. You know what I mean? I think you're a Turkey sandwich cause you're like, what? You don't ever say that again? I think you're a Turkey citizen. You're reliable. You're satisfied. And when I talk I make it go to sleep. When consumed, I make you sleepy. All right. If you could only eat one sandwich, Nia, for the rest of your life, what would it be? This feels like a lifetime movie. Is a Philly cheese day considered a sandwich? Cause you know, that's my all time favorite of all time. Well I mean it's not considered breakfast. No, it's considered a cereal. All right. So yeah, I feel like a cheese stick. I don't remember. Yeah, hero is a sandwich. Right? Or whatever the fuck they call a hero sandwich.

Speaker 4:          01:07:03       So yeah. One Sandwich. Rest of my life, I'd eat a peanut butter sandwich with butter. PBB and Jay. Yeah, that's what I would have with a glass of fucking milk weight. You'd have jelly on it though. What do you know? I don't wanna get fat. You put Jelly on your fucking with you. If I could have one once, just one for the rest of my fucking life. I don't have to eat it every day. Well, no, not every day, but the only sandwich when you're in the mood for a sandwich, you can only eat this particular sandwich.

Speaker 4:          01:07:35       I Dunno. An Italian sub. You like Italian sandwiches. Then they put the oil all over and it feels like the bread sweaty. You don't always have to get the oil. I don't know what I'd have. I don't, I don't know what I would fucking have. It is just to my not, I guess if I wouldn't die of a heart attack, I'd have a roast beef sandwich. Here you go. There you go, Bill. You're exciting. All right, lady likes the belly. Uh, Billy, you bastard, love the podcast. It's just funny you passed it. Love the podcast mate. Um, have been following your shenanigans for nearly eight years, hustling for tickets when you get here to London. I got my birthday on the 3rd of August and we'll be cruising through to your gig on the fifth. Caught you a couple of years ago and gave you a cigar after the show with the roundhouse in Camden.

Speaker 4:          01:08:26       Who knows, maybe you smoked it. Of course I did. Okay, so help me with this kind of weird dilemma of mine. Here's the deal. I'm six, two, six, three. On a good day, if he's feeling good about himself, he stands up straight and I'm fairly trim. However, due to my love of cake pie and all the things donut I've packed, I've packed on a mass in one specific area. My belly. Oh God. That's the classic European fucking body, you know? Yeah. They got those seventh grader arms and then they just got the fucking fish and chips belly. Like they're generally a thinner people, but they like their pubs and they like, yeah, thin or cause I think their food is higher quality, but they just don't go to the gym over there. They walk around a lot though. All right. My brother loves it. Um, they've nicknamed me big belly Bigsby a callback to Chappelle's, Clayton Bigsby and I've become used to, used to giving it a good old fashioned slap from time to time. My lady loves it too. She rubs it, wants to fill up with her rabbit food, a, she's Vegan, whatever, et Cetera, et cetera. It's a mind fuck subverts. The whole guy's got to have a pack vibe. You're losing me here anyways, I'm gonna keep on going Michelangelo on this bitch and getting into shape at the risk of losing the fail safe laughter of the day. What do you think? Yeah, dude, you don't want to be the fat guy who slaps his belly like a fucking walrus looking for a mate.

Speaker 9:          01:09:54       And if you don't get it under control, it's going to get bigger and bigger and it's going to be bad for your health. So trust me, your girlfriend might love the belly right now, but she's going to really love that six back.

Speaker 4:          01:10:06       Oh, really? What if she's insecure? She's worried that he's going to go out and fucking start, do the full Monty someplace,

Speaker 9:          01:10:12       both work and get the six back together. Although she might already have it since she's a Vegan and obviously [inaudible] happens and to keep what couples could never work out. I don't like, yeah, I'm not into it. But remember when we tried to work out and I was just yelling, you push it out, you know? No, we never worked out together like that. We would go to the gym together. Then we separate your thing. And I would always, do we go do a party? What do we do? We go in different graphs. Words. Yeah. Yeah. I came here to have a good time. Not to be, got to be with the person I live with. [inaudible] I came here. I live with you. I don't need to hang out with you at this part. So what's going on with you in this new environment? Um, all right. I got to know your girlfriend's gonna love the six bag, so keep at it and like to keep a belly just so people can slap it around so you can be that guy at the party after a while. Yeah, that's pathetic. It's better to get shredded and be, you know, real Michelangelo.

Speaker 4:          01:11:09       Yeah. And then you get to walk around being a Dick, being aloof, you know, you just, every time people talk to you, you pretend you're looking at something down the street with your fucking eyebrows up. Sorry man. I just gotta keep on moving. You know, I'm like a shark. Did you talk about that poster? Ah, yeah. Yeah, I missed it. Yeah. The guy actually brought up a bunch of great points, which is, oh, I don't know if you want to go back and read it. Um, I can't, I don't remember. He was just saying like, well no and 50 was like, Whoa, here's one that I made it. If he was holding up Hugh Jackman, would that increase the chances of guys fighting other guys? I don't think it's about like increasing like influencing people to do what? It's just like, it's just not against. It isn't a great look.

Speaker 4:          01:11:58       I actually, I don't think that it's a good poster, but I would say that I don't think it promotes violence against women. I don't, I wouldn't think so either. But although I'm not trying to speak for blue women though. That's right. They can speak for themselves. No, I don't know. I saw that poster and I first of all couldn't tell it was a woman, but if I was like well versed in that whole thing, I would be like, oh that's such and such character. Uh, yeah, I don't, I dunno. But I think it's probably best that they, they're all in the, all the different poster I was saying. They're all named after like discontinued. Um, colognes. I'm like, what mystique apocalypse just sounds like. It's like whoever came up with Zima than tried to get into Cologne and it all fucking bombed. Right. Listen, I unfortunately got to stop the podcast cause I got to go to work. Boom, boom Boba [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          01:12:55       All right. Thank you guys for listening. And, um, I'll let you guys know about those Presales, um, for the upcoming dates in Ireland and, uh, thank you to everybody that's been buying tickets in Scotland, in Amsterdam and London, and a second show in London, Nini. That's so great. Yeah. But I found this a Gaba where I can fucking smoke a stick after. I love that nice big picture of fucking, I don't know, Winston Churchill or some shit would be wonderful. Right? I don't know, Nan, we have, I don't ever say we never shout out. Is that Winston Churchill? It's already made. All right. With Winston Churchill in front, I think ace is high. I believe that was all right. Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on your Thursday.
