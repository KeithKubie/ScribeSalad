00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.059
We have just created a graphic using DimpleJS around the World Cup

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.170
attendance throughout it's history.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.900
We have learned about how to best choose a chart given our data and

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.130
its structure, and some of the theory and formalism around this

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.310
process both from Edward Tufte, and LuAnn Wilkinson's Grammar of Graphics.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.330
&gt;&gt; You also saw many examples of data visualization.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.630
In particular, you saw how the design choices that you didn't make can either

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.820
enhance or hinder you ability to communicate effectively with an audience.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.840
&gt;&gt; Next we'll be going over a few ways that you can effectively tell your

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.800
data story.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.480
Also, different narrative structures that you can use when

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.630
creating complex interactive visualizations.
