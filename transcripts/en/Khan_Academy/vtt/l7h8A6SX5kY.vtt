00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.050
Mark pedals his bike
70 times in a minute.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.920
Which of these are
reasonable estimates

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.280
about Mark's peddling?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.330
Mark all that applies.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.230
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.610
70 times in a minute.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.440
So there are 60
seconds in a minute.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.100
So if he's doing 70
times in a minute,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.810
if he was doing 60
times in a minute,

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.830
then he would be
peddling once per second.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800
Since he's doing 70
times in a minute,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.030
he's doing a little bit
more than once per second.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.099
So maybe that'll help
us right over here.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.890
So here it says Mark
peddles his bike what?

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.081
4,000 times every second.

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:33.830
Well, that's nuts.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.260
If he peddled his bike
4,000 times every second,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.270
you'd have a way huger
number right over here.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.010
You'd have 4,000
times per second times

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.410
60 seconds per minute.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.490
You would have a huge
number right over here.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.230
If it's 70 times in
a minute, we just

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.730
reasoned that he
peddles a little

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.980
over one time in a second.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.260
So this is definitely not right.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.200
Mark pedals his bike
about once every hour.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.230
Well, an hour is 60 minutes.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.720
So if he does 70
times in a minute,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.166
he's going to do 60
times 70 in an hour.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.540
So this is also crazy, that
he only does once in an hour.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.710
This is unbelievably slow.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.610
Mark pedals his bike
about once every second.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.920
Well, we've already
reasoned that there's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.950
60 seconds in a minute, and
he does 70 times in a minute.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.550
So he does a little over--
if you divide 70 by 60,

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.530
so you could divide
70 by 60, and you're

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.180
going to get a number
that's a little bit over 1

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.782
time per second.

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:31.490
So this is right.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.300
We're estimating.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.810
We don't get exact numbers.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.720
It's about once every second.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.520
So that seems legitimate.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.667
Mark pedals his bike about
4,000 times every hour.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.750
So let's think about that.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.540
If he pedals 70
times in a minute,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.130
and then there are 60
minutes in an hour,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.680
this is going to be
equal to 70 times 60.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.140
Well, we can multiply
the 7 times the 6,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.000
and we get 7 times 6 is 42.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.830
And we have two zeroes here.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.200
So we have exactly
4,200 times every hour.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.160
So as an estimate,
this is pretty close.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.650
So I would go with that as well.
