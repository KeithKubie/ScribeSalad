00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Do you ever do this?

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.220
Be hella excited that all episodes of your show 'Youth and Consequences' come out on YouTube Red on March 7th?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.240
Well yes, obviously, thank you.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.840
But until March 7th when you can binge all episodes of Youth and Consequences on YouTube Red,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.040
I'm talking about when a friend discusses their problems with you. Do you immediately say:

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.500
"Oh, you know what you should do?"

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.520
I've noticed recently that I have a pattern. I offer unsolicited advice all the time

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.960
when my friends have problems.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.600
And I know the intentions are good,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.140
because when we see someone we care about suffering,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.180
our impulse is to, like, help and to fix them and to give them anything that they need.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.340
But the more that I do this, the more withdrawn my friends become.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.060
Their eyes glaze over, they sort of nod automatically, there's this wall put up between us.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.060
So I decided to try not giving any advice unless it was specifically asked of me.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.340
And it made me realize just how much I wanna do that all the time,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.060
even in really little ways.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.000
"Have you tried yoga?"

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.760
"Ooh, I just saw a great TED talk on that, I'll send it to you."

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.100
"I had the same exact problem, let me tell you what I did."

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.100
"You know, you should really try yoga."

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.660
But I resisted the temptation to solve all of my friends' problems and instead would try to really explore their feelings

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.400
by asking them questions like:

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.460
"How does that make you feel?"

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.900
"Wow that sounds really hard. How are you handling it?"

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.040
"I totally understand why you're upset. What do you think you're gonna do?"

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.140
And something happened.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.920
My conversations became so much more engaging and deep and fulfilling.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.520
Instead of feeling like I had to fix everything,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.960
I just let myself be a sounding board for whatever someone was feeling.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060
And really tried to explore that.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.700
And my friendships changed dramatically.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.080
They felt more loving, more personal, and more open.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.840
Now, I have this one friend who's a conversational narcissist.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.460
It's like, no matter what you say, he will bring the conversation back to himself.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.680
And I used to harbour a lot of resentment for it, but it's y'know,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.540
it's one of those annoying quirks and flaws about a person that you love

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.220
that you just sort of put up with because you love them.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.500
So I thought implementing this with him was going to be particularly interesting.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.800
And I found that we would dive so deeply into his problems,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.000
and I would let him express everything he was feeling about every single thing that he had to say

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.760
and would just keep the spotlight on him to the point that he sort of like,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.980
ran out of stuff to say about himself, and then would turn the conversation to me.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.100
And be fully present with me, and let me talk out my problems because

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.460
he's been sorta spent.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.940
Now, maybe you're not like me and you're not a person who offers unsolicited advice all the time

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.340
But let me advise you to try this out with your next conversation

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.360
Maybe in the next couple of conversations

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.460
See how it goes.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.800
Be fully present, be really engaged with the person and not thinking about how you're going to respond.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.180
I learned many a fascinating things and a lot of my relationships became deeper,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.640
and more amazing because of it.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.180

I read roughly 70 books a year, and at least 10 of these are audiobooks that I listen to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.020
while I'm driving, doing laundry or stretching.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.280
I'm currently listening to Tiffany Haddish's The Last Black Unicorn

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.540
and I am so freakin' proud of her.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.460
We did a comedy sketch show together back in the day

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.940
And it's been amazing to hear about her journey and how far she's come.
