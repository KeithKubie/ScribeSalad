00:00:00.434 --> 00:00:01.850
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.690
think about the
origins of algebra.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.390
The origins of
algebra, and the word,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.640
especially in association
with the ideas

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.617
that algebra now represents,
comes from this book,

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:17.950
or actually this is a page
of the book right over there.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.430
The English translation
for the title of this book

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.050
is the "Compendious
Book on Calculation

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.280
by Completion and Balancing."

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.120
And it was written by a
Persian mathematician who

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.052
lived in Baghdad
in, I believe, it

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:33.510
was in the eighth
or ninth century.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.740
I believe it was actually 820
AD when he wrote this book.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.620
AD.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.730
And algebra is the Arabic word,
that here is the actual title

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.070
that he gave to it, which
is the Arabic title.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.456
Algebra means restoration
or completion.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.110
Restoration or completion.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.380
And he associated it in his book
with a very specific operation,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.490
really taking something
from one side of an equation

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.659
to another side of an equation.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.450
But we can actually
see it right over here,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.075
and I don't know
Arabic, but I actually

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:08.550
do know some
languages that seems

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.330
to have borrowed a
little bit from Arabic,

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.310
or maybe it went the
other way around.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.770
But this says Al-kitab,
and I know just enough

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.350
Urdu and Hindi to understand
a good India movie,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.170
but Al-kitab, kitab means book.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.550
So this part is book.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.170
Book.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.816
Al-mukhtasar, well, I think
that means compendious,

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:28.690
because I don't know
the word for compendious

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.930
and that seems like that.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.170
Fihisab, hisab means
calculation in Hindi or Urdu,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.210
so this is calculation.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.300
Calculation.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.500
Al-gabr, this is the root.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.110
This is the famous algebra,
this is where it shows up.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.520
So this is for completion, you
could view that as completion.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.450
Completion.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.050
And then wa'l-muqabala, and that
means essentially balancing.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.660
Balancing.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.305
Completion and balancing.

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:56.680
So if we wanted
to translate it--

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.890
I know this isn't a video
on translating Arabic,

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.100
but the book, I guess
this is saying compendious

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.720
on calculation by
completion and balancing

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.580
is the rough translation
right over there.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.470
But that is the source
of the word algebra,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.940
and this is a very, very,
very important book.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.700
Not just because it was the
first use of the word algebra,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.720
but many people viewed
this book as the first time

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.800
that algebra took a
lot of its modern--

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.940
took on many of
its modern ideas.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.240
Ideas of balancing an equation.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.320
The abstract problem
itself, not trying

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.540
to do one off problems
here or there.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.160
But al-Khwarizmi was
not the first person,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.640
and just to get an idea of
where all this is happening.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.122
So he was hanging
out in Baghdad,

00:02:47.122 --> 00:02:48.580
and this part of
the world shows up

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.130
a lot in the history of algebra.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.650
But he was hanging
out right there

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.050
in around the eighth
or ninth century.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.150
So let me draw a
time line here, just

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.230
so we can appreciate everything.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.590
So that is timeline,
and then whether or not

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.710
you are religious, most
of our modern dates

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.720
are dependent on the birth of
Jesus, so that is right there.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.905
Maybe I'll put a cross
over there to signify that.

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:15.280
When we want to
be non-religious,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.110
we say the common era.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.750
Before the common era, when
we want to be religious

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.530
we say AD, which means
in the year of our lord.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.120
I don't know the Latin,
Anno Domini, I believe,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.220
year of our lord.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.970
And then when we want--
in the religious context,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.180
instead of saying before common
era, we say before Christ, BC.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.790
But either way, so this
is 1000 in the common era.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.656
This is 2000 in the common era.

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:41.530
And obviously, we are
sitting-- at least when

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.400
I'm making this video, I'm
sitting right about there.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.560
And then this is 1000
before the common era,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.210
and this is 2000
before the common era.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.565
So the first traces--
and I'm skipping out,

00:03:54.565 --> 00:03:56.190
and really, it's just
what we can find.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.420
I'm sure if we were
able to dig more,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.044
we might be able to
find other evidence

00:03:59.044 --> 00:04:02.080
of different civilizations
and different people stumbling

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.720
on many of the ideas in algebra.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.430
But our first records of
people really exploring

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.690
the ideas that are
hit upon in algebra

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.590
come from ancient
Babylon around 2000 years

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.160
before the common
era, before Christ.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.562
So right around there
there are stone tablets

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.270
where it looks like
people were exploring

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.080
some of the fundamental
ideas of algebra.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.880
They weren't using
the same symbols.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.780
They weren't using the same ways
of representing the numbers,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.090
but it was algebra that
they were working on.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.430
And that was, once again,
in this part of the world.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.760
Babylon was right about there.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.720
And Babylon, it's kind of
kept the tradition of Sumeria.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.920
This whole region was
called Mesopotamia,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.290
Greek for between two rivers.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.230
But that's the first
traces of people

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.270
that we know of that
where people were starting

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.550
to do what we would
call real, real algebra.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:55.892
And then you fast forward.

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:57.600
And I'm sure we're
missing-- and I'm sure

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.960
even our historians don't know
all of the different instances

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.300
of people using algebra, but the
major contributions to algebra,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.450
we saw it here in
Babylon 2000 years ago.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.990
And then if we fast
forward to about 200 to 300

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.310
AD, so right over there,
you have a Greek gentleman

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.870
who lived in Alexandria.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.020
So this is Greece
right over here,

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.210
but he lived in Alexandria,
which at the time

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.240
was part of the Roman Empire.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.890
So Alexandria is
right over here,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.630
and he was a gentleman by
the name of Diophantus,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.890
or Diophantus.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.300
I don't know how to
pronounce it, Diophantus.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.550
And he is sometimes
credited with being

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.330
the father of algebra,
and it's debatable

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.200
whether it's Diophantus
or al-Khwarizmi.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.770
al-Khwarizmi, who
kind of started

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.320
using these terms of
balancing equations

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.050
and talking about
math in a purer way,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.370
while Diophantus was more
focused on particular problems.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.840
And both of them were
kind of beat to the punch

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.780
by the Babylonians,
although they all

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.170
did contribute in their own way.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.140
It's not like they
were just copying

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.370
what the Babylonians did.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.230
They had their own
unique contributions

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.360
to what we now consider algebra.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.170
But many, especially
Western historians,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.480
associate Diophantus as
the father of algebra.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.580
And now, al-Khwarizmi
is sometimes

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.390
what other people would argue
as the father of algebra,

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.290
so he made significant
contributions.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.200
And if you go to 600 AD-- so
if you go to about 600 AD,

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.140
another famous mathematician
in the history of algebra

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.200
was Brahmagupta, in India.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.580
Brahmagupta, in India.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.180
So obviously, and
actually, I don't

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.490
know where in India he lived.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.900
I should look that
up, but roughly

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.440
in that part of the world.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.665
And he also made
significant contributions.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.790
And then you have
al-Khwarizmi, who

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.530
shows up right
there, al-Khwarizmi.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.560
And he is the gentleman
that definitely

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.810
we credit with the name
algebra, comes from Arabic

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.080
for restoration, and some
people also consider him to be,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.170
if not the father of
algebra, although some people

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.370
say he is the father, he is
one of the fathers of algebra

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.340
because he really started
to think about algebra

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.410
in the abstract sense, devoid
of some specific problems

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.440
and a lot of the way
a modern mathematician

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.110
would start to think
about the field.
