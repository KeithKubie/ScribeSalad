00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.650
Last time, we asked some big questions about
the future of computing and artificial intelligence.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.110
Today, we’re going to ask about the life
sciences, medicine, and the brain.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.950
Like what happens when medicine shifts from
treating illness to preventing it, and then

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.730
to a whole new terrain: enhancing life and
longevity?

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.179
What happens when life itself becomes a technology?

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.490
Something increasingly cheap and fast to redesign?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.760
And why has mapping DNA been easier than mapping
our brains?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:42.160
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.190
When we last left medicine, giant companies
had commercialized pills that targeted specific

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.770
physiological systems.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.969
And the human genome was decoded!

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.789
But the links between particular alleles,
or versions of genes, and specific diseases—like

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.579
cancers, immune diseases, or psychiatric disorders—remained
to be proven.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.180
So in the 1990s, scientists began developing
cheaper, faster, more robust genetic tests

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.850
for well-known genes linked to disease.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.840
This has given rise to a new way of associating
with each other, based on shared molecules—biosociality.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.110
Nowadays, for example, many women with a family
history of breast cancer get tested to see

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.340
what version they have of two genes called
BRCA1 and BRCA2.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.740
Communities have formed around people who
have the versions of these genes that make

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.810
someone much more likely

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.509
to develop breast or ovarian cancer later
in life.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.579
There was a big fight over whether a private
company called Myriad Genetics

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.920
could patent the natural DNA tied to these
genes.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.079
But the Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that they
couldn’t patent the natural DNA,

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.369
or anything invented by evolution.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.479
Genetic testing has helped with the early
diagnosis of thousands of cases of cancer.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.869
Some medical researchers have experimented
with genetic therapies.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.200
These would involve replacing a region of
DNA giving rise to a disease with a doctor-designed

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.460
“therapeutic gene.”

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.299
Basically, patients’ genes get taken out,
changed, and put back in.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.730
In 1990, the first genetic therapy temporarily
corrected an immune system disorder.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.940
Other trials followed.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.250
But in 1999, Jesse Gelsinger, a young man
with a rare genetic liver disease, died four

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.050
days after receiving a genetic therapy.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.329
This had a chilling effect on the field for
years, although research continues.

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.600
Genetic therapies points toward an even bigger
promise—of personalized medicine.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.800
We don’t have it yet, but many companies
are winning investors on the promise that

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.800
we will soon.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.470
In this new regime, each patient will have
care tailored to her individual genome, and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.470
more.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.900
First, we need more basic science in human
genomics and several other fields—including

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.060
transcriptomics,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.510
or how regions of DNA are copied into little
strands of RNA, and what effects those have.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.610
Then there’s proteomics, or how proteins
fold together, which affects how they work.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.980
Then there’s metabolomics, or how energy
moves around inside and outside of cells,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.800
through fats, sugars, and acids.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.109
Collectively, these are called - wait for
it - … omics—the total study of life at

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:08.180
the scale smaller than the cell.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.810
But even with more information, engineering
life using twentieth-century technology

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.880
still meant painstakingly creating new synthetic
DNA parts and proteins by hand,

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.470
and testing over and over again to find the
rare successful result.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.949
Plus, the vast majority of diseases are linked
to many genes—so changing anything means

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.910
making not one, but several stable edits.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.630
And every edit increases the chances that
something is changed elsewhere—an off-target

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.630
effect.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.230
Which is potentially really bad.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.881
What was needed was a way to edit not single
regions of a genome, but many regions, with

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:46.740
less likelihood of off-target effects.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.730
Enter the “technology of the century”
and one of the most valuable suites of patents

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.709
on the planet: clustered regularly interspaced
palindromic repeats.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.970
Which just… rolls right off the tongue.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.070
Hence why everyone calls this system CRISPR.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.360
CRISPR isn’t free or one-hundred-percent
perfect.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.100
But it’s the most efficient way to edit
genes right now, and it may revolutionize

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.900
medicine and agriculture.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.550
Who “invented” CRISPR?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.750
Our little buddies, bacteria!

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.799
And archaea, bacteria’s weird uncle.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.840
Many microbes use CRISPR to keep a list of
viruses that can kill them by putting the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.680
bad DNA in between repeated palindromes.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.660
It’s sort of like a police directory of
prior arrests: when a virus enters the microbe’s

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.660
cell,

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.370
if it’s recognized as being on the list,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.780
a CRISPR-associated protein cuts up the virus.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.620
And the system is a good editor: it reads
for specific DNA sequences and only cuts these.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.920
ThoughtBubble, show us more:

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.320
Spanish microbiologist Francisco Mojica first
published about this system in 1993.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.100
But back then, he saw a bunch of repeated
segments of DNA with weird other DNA in between.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.510
He didn’t know what it meant, and it wasn’t
major news.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.250
But Mojica didn’t give up.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.070
In 2003, after a long decade of clever bioinformatic
work,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.940
Mojica realized that CRISPR must be an adaptive
immune system—

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.350
a way for microbes to protect themselves against
viruses.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.340
But on its own, in nature, CRISPR didn’t
help humans.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.260
In fact, when Mojica submitted his discovery
to the scientific journal, Nature, they rejected

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.260
it!

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.040
CRISPR had to be transformed into a tool.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.610
There were lots of steps and scientists involved.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.480
First, scientists had to move beyond finding
the palindromic repeats in different microbes

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.810
to understanding how the whole system worked:

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.740
what told the cutting protein where to cut?

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.120
How could the system be reprogrammed?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.200
Swiss microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier
and German microbiologist Jörg Vogel

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.780
figured out that a special piece of nucleic
acid called a guide RNA tells the cutting

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.960
Cas9 protein to cut DNA at the right place.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.620
Other scientists worked out how to move a
whole system that evolved in microbes into

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.560
the cells of mice and humans—

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.030
a whole system of genes, tracer RNAs, and
proteins.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.030
In 2011,

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.920
Charpentier met American structural biologist
Jennifer Doudna,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.110
and they decided to collaborate on studying
synthetic CRISPR systems, outside of microbes.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.230
Meanwhile, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Chinese-American
molecular biologist Feng Zhang

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.150
and synthetic biologist George Church worked
on putting CRISPR systems into mammalian cells.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.660
For example, Zhang made mouse models of human
disease using CRISPR.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.620
Within fewer than ten years, CRISPR had gone
from a cool immune system for microbes to

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.250
the hot new tool in biology.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.250
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.280
In the wake of transforming CRISPR from a
microbial trick into a tool for the future

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.310
of biology,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.900
Doudna and Charpentier filed patents through
their universities, to work with their companies…

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.980
and so did Zhang and Church, for their companies.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.400
These biologists are academics, but they are
also entrepreneurs.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.830
So, why is CRISPR such a big deal?

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.550
Instead of part-by-part steps, each likely
to fail, CRISPR enables a whole solution to

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.410
be programmed at once.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.160
It’s not super simple, but it’s simpler
than what came before.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.040
Proposed applications include precision medicine
as well as a new Green Revolution:

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.080
imagine staple crops edited to put their own
nitrogen into the ground.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.690
Or to breathe out less water, requiring less
irrigation.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.800
Or to photosynthesize more efficiently.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.300
Or make more of the nutrients humans want.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.440
And if you can engineer an apple, you can
engineer a human!

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:38.570
This is reprogenetics, or engineering babies—both
to make them healthier and to make “designer”

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.670
babies with specific traits like eye color
or height.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.880
Which—yeah—eugenics never dies.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.420
But CRISPR isn’t the only promising development
in medicine.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.190
Other researchers are working to understand
how environmental stimuli like the foods we

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.100
eat interact with genes via epigenetics,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.990
or the regulation of which genes can be expressed.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.419
Historian of science Hannah Landecker calls
to rethink human health as existing in a “metabolic

00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:05.419
landscape.”

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:09.760
Another important area of research is microbiomics,
or the genomics of microbes.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.080
The human gut only works because of the trillions
of bacteria that live inside it.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.840
But, just as we don’t know everything about
the human genome,

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.050
we also don’t know everything about how
these microbes function, interact with each

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.090
other, and interact with different foods.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.919
If scientists could understand these complex
relationships better, maybe technologists

00:08:27.919 --> 00:08:30.979
could make foods that were also therapies.

00:08:30.979 --> 00:08:31.979
…

00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:34.139
Or maybe they could just remind us to eat
healthy foods!

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:38.640
With more genetic therapies and a better grasp
of epigenetics and microbiomics,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.020
some scientists hope that humans will live
much longer.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:45.140
In fact, longevity itself is a hot topic.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.810
Finally, many life scientists are turning
to one of those epistemic objects the proved

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:53.120
remarkably stubborn for a long time: the brain.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.839
Alongside mid-twentieth century work on DNA
and drugs, other researchers figured out a

00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.529
lot about brain surgery…

00:08:59.529 --> 00:09:02.840
But, at a basic level, the brain remained
mysterious.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.390
It’s a collection of neurons, joined by
little gaps called synapses.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.210
Brain signals cross the synapses through a
mixture of electricity and chemicals.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:17.480
Thought, memory, and self are in there somewhere,
and we mostly know the physical regions of

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.950
the brain where they are.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.300
Although… neuroscientist and tireless brain-mapper
George Paxinos confirmed a whole new brain

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.300
region,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.850
the endorestiform nucleus, only in 2018!

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.520
Clearly, there’s room for ongoing research.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.820
Technologies let scientists see the brain
in new ways.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:40.040
Invented in the 1970s, magnetic resonance
imaging or MRI creates a non-invasive map

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.110
of the brain.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:47.390
And functional MRI, or fMRI, first used in
1990, lets scientists see the blood moving

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.510
around inside.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:54.200
But the dream for many researchers is a database:
the connectome, or total map of how neurons

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.180
are linked in the brain, a “wiring diagram”
for a brain.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.810
The NIH, for example, launched Human Connectome
Project in 2009.

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:07.500
To date, scientists have mapped the connectome
of one animal, a worm, and are working on

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.779
the mouse retina.

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:12.460
Maybe brains are so complex that we still
don’t understand much about them.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.560
But we can control them!

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.970
Think about neuroenhancement: what if there
was a drug that targeted specific brain regions

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.060
linked to logic problems, memory, or creativity?

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.320
In fact, what if there was a drug that affected
the very genes that code your brain?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.450
What if the whole world was, say, on average,
five percent smarter?

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.550
Finally, what if the true power of the brain
came from being allowed to escape the limits

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.760
of the body?

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.670
A technology developed in the late 1990s called
a brain–computer interface or BCI enables

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.310
human brains to interact directly with computers.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.560
BCIs can transform the lives of people suffering
from paralysis, for one.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.730
What else might humans enable themselves to
do by directly connecting their brains and

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.960
computer systems?

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.370
To conclude, let’s come back to basics.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.590
Regardless of how immediately revolutionary
or still-science-fictional the various life-control

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:08.140
technologies we’ve covered in this episode
are,

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.190
they have one thing in common: rich people
will get them way before poor people.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.810
And old technologies won’t go away due to
new ones.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:21.580
Science, in the sense of a set of methods
for understanding the natural world, doesn’t

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.920
tell us which technologies we should deploy,
where, or when.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.420
This is the realm of ethics.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:32.200
So even as some lucky consumers will begin
to enjoy medical regimes personalized to their

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.200
genomes,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.620
many people don’t have access to healthcare
at all.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.660
While access remains uneven, or stratified,
new groups may arise based on healthcare—

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.600
not genetics or other forms of biosociality.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.320
As some epidemiologists have said: “zip
code is a better predictor of health than

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.540
genetic code.”

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.240
Next time—we’ll talk about the future
of the planet.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.320
It’s time to tackle climate disruption,
the Anthropocene, and some deep questions

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.480
about what knowledge scientists should make.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.060
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.940
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.940
Thought Cafe.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.760
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.330
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.160
channels like Healthcare Triage, Animal Wonders, and Scishow Psych.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.700
And, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.870
the series at Patreon;

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.880
a crowdfunding platform that allows you to
support the content you love.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.240
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.400
support.
