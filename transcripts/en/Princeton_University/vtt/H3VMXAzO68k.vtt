PETER GIOVINE: Hi. I am Peter, and I am a
senior and English major, and Great Expectations

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.490
is my senior thesis.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:36.300
KANOA MULLING: I'm playing the 
characters of Joe, who's a blacksmith, lower
class, and Mr. Jaggers, who is a lawyer from

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.640
London. And it's really fun playing two completely
different characters, being lovable and detestable,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.519
going left and right.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.820
EVELYN GIOVINE: I'm playing Miss Havisham,
and in preparation for the play, I read the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.820
novel Great Expectations. And there was this
really cool quote that informed my character,

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.710
and the quote was "dropped within, without,
body and soul as if under a crushing blow."

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.710
CAROLINE SLUTSKY: We see a younger version
of Estella in the Bartlett version; she's

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.840
Pip's love interest in the play and she, um,
lacks feelings and she's kind of a cold person.

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:31.530
JOHN FAIRCHILD: Hello, I'm John, and one of
the characters I play in Great Expectations

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.530
is Mr. Wopsle, who is a churchman/wannabe
actor. And in one scene, I have to burp, but

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.659
I don't know how to burp, so we do a little
something like this. [Jake Tempchin burps.]

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.909
Amen!

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.749
PETER: It's all as if we're seeing things
through Pip's perspective, and it's not really

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.299
what's actually happening, right; it's like
an artistic perspective, um, that makes the

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.740
world more beautiful and more magical.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.369
CAMERON PLATT: Unexpected.

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.759
NATHALIE ELLIS-EINHORN: Crazy.
CAROLINE: Orchestral.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.520
EVELYN: Haunting.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.270
KANOA: Smashing.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.030
PETER: Great.
