For some of us, LinkedIn is a new and
unfamiliar platform.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.760
For others,
you might know it and love it.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.610
Our goal is to make you know and
appreciate the power of LinkedIn.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.490
When I move to the U.S.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.640
from Germany, I did not know what to
put in my English LinkedIn version.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.000
As Germans are generally more private,
I saw filling up my LinkedIn

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.110
as a horrible pointless hurdle
that really stretched my limits.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.090
However, after doing some research and

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.220
getting more familiar with
the customization options of LinkedIn,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.648
I started to realize that
LinkedIn had a lot of potential.

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:35.250
If used skilfully,
it could give me a lot of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.970
agency in creating my personal brand,
an ideal professional identity.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.850
A LinkedIn profile contains
multiple customizable sections.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.590
You can change the order of those
sections depending on your background

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.100
and better convey your
goals to recruiters.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.380
For example,
if you're switching careers completely,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.740
you can make your project section
proceed your work experience.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.720
You could also create your
own professional headline.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.830
This means you can define what you are,
not your current job title.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.530
You can select a professional image of
yourself, allowing you to make a great

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.510
professional first impression
before the interview.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.190
You can also

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.200
present a compelling summary
statement that frames your story.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.850
This is extremely helpful if you're
changing careers, are new to the field,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.320
or simply have an eclectic background,
like me.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.230
LinkedIn invites you to present a
comprehensive list of your professional

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.800
experience with detailed bullets
about what you did at each place.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.750
Finally, with LinkedIn, you can present
information about your passions,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.860
hobbies, causes, and interests
that may not fit on your resume.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.320
If you have a LinkedIn profile,
what parts do you have currently?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.630
Feel free to respond in our forum.
