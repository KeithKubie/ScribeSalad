00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.420
Now after all the setup for

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.240
these few lines of code in Dimple, to make our bar chart, we can

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.010
start having some fun with different chart types with very minimal changes.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.320
And experiment with different types of charts, and different layouts.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.090
To change which chart type we're using to represent our data,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.600
we simply need to pass a different chart object, to the addSeries method.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.160
In this case we're passing dimple.plot.bar.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.360
But let's try and look at what a scatter plot looks like.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.471
We simply have to change dimple.plot.bar to dimple.plot.scatter, save our file,

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:36.940
and reload the page.
