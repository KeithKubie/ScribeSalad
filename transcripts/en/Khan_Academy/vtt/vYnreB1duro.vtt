00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.350
I think most of us know what the heart does in our body.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.790
It pumps the blood and in particular it takes in the blood from the rest of the body.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.800
That is blue over here in this diagram, because that blood does not have carried oxygen

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.030
And it pumps that blood to the lungs where the blood gets oxygenated.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:27.420
And then it comes back from the lungs, depicted as red blood, now that it has oxygen in it.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.040
And then that oxygenated blood is pumped to the rest of the body.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.140
And I think also, most of us have the general idea that when people talk about heart disease or heart attacks,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.490
which we learn, are two different things, related but different things, that has something to do with the clogging of arteries.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.280
so when I was a kid and I first learnt about the clogging of arteries.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.550
and I knew enough that the heart is all about pumping blood to the body.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.340
I assumed the artery that people were talking about these big arteries that were coming away from the heart

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.560
to the rest of the body that somehow these things got clogged up.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.160
so let me draw that, different colour you can see

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740
so this was my ....this is what I thought

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.620
people were talking about when they were saying clogging of the arteries

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.050
and maybe when they got clogged enough, the stopped blood flow to the rest of the body somehow

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.870
and that would actually kill the person. I want to make it very clear right now.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.350
Those are not the arteries that people are talking about getting clogged,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.360
when people talk about heart disease or heart attacks.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.370
The arteries that they are talking about are the arteries that actually provide blood to the heart.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.930
Remember the heart itself is a muscle. It itself needs oxygen.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.170
So you have these arteries right over here, the red tubes. Those are arteries.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.880
and then the blue ones are veins.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.300
They're taking the de-oxygenated blood away from the tissue of the heart.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.390
And these are called coronary arteries.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.700
And this one over here at least from the point of view of me or you looks like it's on the right.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.670
Or from the point of view of the person whose heart it is, it's on the left.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.320
This right over here is called the left coronary artery or LCA.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.310
And this right over here in red is called the right coronary arteries or the RCA.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.310
And so when people talk about arteries getting blocked or getting clogged,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.930
they're talking about the coronary arteries.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.380
They're talking about the things that supply blood to the heart.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:40.320
So let's zoom in on one of them....Maybe we can zoom in right over here, that part of the artery.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:49.240
That's the tube....clear where I am zooming in. I am zooming in right over here.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.550
So over time, I am not going into the details how this happened. It is subject for another video.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.150
You can have these plaques build up along the walls of the artery.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.770
So over time if a person doesn't have the right diet, or maybe they just have a predisposition to it,

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.350
you can have these things called plaques form on the walls of the arteries.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.760
And the plaques, the material inside of them are lipids, so things like

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.150
fat, cholesterol and also dead white blood cells,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:28.730
which is this kind of messy substance right over here. This is what we call a plaque.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.190
And the formation of these plaques that obstruct the actual blood vessel, that actually obstruct the artery.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:44.070
We call it.....make it clear you see that. This is kind of tube over here. Let me draw the blood

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:59.180
So this formation of these plaques we call atherosclerosis.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.860
So you can imagine if you have these things build up,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.810
it's narrowing the actual vessel that's supplying blood downstream from that obstruction.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:16.570
So it would be destructing the blood flow downstream right over there.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.000
In that general process we talk about the restriction of blood flow, that is ischemia that's happening.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.430
So ischemia is deprivation of blood flow and oxygen downstream from this right over there.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:39.400
That's what we call coronary artery disease, or heart disease.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:52.380
So this causes coronary artery disease, which is sometimes called heart disease.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.570
Coronary heart disease would be redundant, because coronary is already referring to the heart.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:07.170
This is also sometimes called heart disease. And so you can imagine if downstream the muscle tissue is

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.970
not getting all the oxygen it needs, especially maybe when this person, whoever's heart this is,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:17.380
when they are exerting themselves, they need more oxygen. The heart needs to pump a little harder.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.960
If downstream the cells are not getting all of the oxygen they need,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.500
you can imagine that the heart maybe not able to provide all of the functions,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.340
whoever's heart this is, that they needed to do.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.770
And when that happens that's called heart failure.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.350
So heart disease is one of the causes of heart failure.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.460
Now I want to be clear, heart failure does not mean that the heart is stopping.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.710
That the heart is stopped and the person is dead, it literally just means

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.550
that the heart is failing to do what it should be doing. It's failing to provide the needs of that person.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:01.280
So it's not pumping hard enough or well enough to provide adequate function for that person.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.670
The other symptom that actually might occur when someone has coronary heart disease,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.000
where they have obstruction or this ischemia

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.700
or this deprivation of oxygen downstream from this obstruction, is that they might experience this kind of strangling chest pain

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.260
That's called angina pectoris or sometimes angina.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:33.330
Very few people say the pectoris part. Sometimes you hear people say oh angina.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:40.260
Angina pectoris, which is really chest pain, angina literally comes from meaning this kind of strangling feeling,

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.920
and pectoris is in the chest. This is strangling feeling in the chest.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:53.120
This is a symptom of heart disease. Now this is already not a situation you want to get into

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.300
because already your body is not able to function as well as it maybe could be, as maybe it could.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.140
Sometimes as I might describe here is a plaque.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.910
Some plaques are actually unstable. These plaques just grow and grow and grow.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.250
It makes probably heart disease worse and worse, heart failure worse, and angina pectoris worse.

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.740
These plaques are unstable. It can actually rupture.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:25.720
You can imagine all these blood flows, as plaque grows, the blood flows become a little turbulent around these plaques.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.130
It has to go really fast through this narrow section. It comes out turbulent on the inside and

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:35.290
creates these friction and all the rest. At some point, you can imagine this plaque is unstable.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:45.590
It could actually rupture. Let me draw ruptured plaque over here....let me draw the same one....I am gonna draw the ruptured.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:54.700
Now this plaque has rupture. It got so big. Maybe the turbulent blood flow helped stimulate this and whatever else.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:59.520
For whatever reason, it ruptures.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:05.100
When it ruptures, now it sudden i am doing a simplification of the process right over here.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:13.510
Now the content of this plaque: the lipid, the cholesterol, the fat, the dead white blood cell.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:19.450
Now it sudden is exposed to the blood flow. in particular to the clotting factor in the blood.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.450
This is highly thrombogenic material. Thrombogenic, very fancy word.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:31.440
That just means, that tends to cause blood clot. Thrombosis is a blood clot.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.130
What happened is, as soon as this type of things happened, it can literally happen in seconds or in minutes.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.840
All the sudden you could have these clotting factors form a clot right over here right at the actual plaque.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:50.910
As this happens, it starts to really really really obstruct the blood vessel.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.730
Sometimes it can even completely obstruct the blood vessel.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:09:01.720
When it happens, you are significantly depleting the blood flow going downstream from there.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:12.790
You might even be shutting it off. When you do that, the cells downstream will no longer get oxygen.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:27.020
They will die. This right over here, is called an infarction. an infarct is actually a dead heart tissue.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:37.200
You can imagine when heart tissue begins to die, this is even worse than what we were describing with coronary heart disease.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.770
Not only coronary heart disease just is not getting enough oxygen, now they are actually dead.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:55.740
They are turning into dead tissue. This process of completely or almost completely depriving cells of oxygen so that they die, this is a heart attack.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:05.050
Let me completely obstruct this artery to make the point clear. this right over here is a heart attack.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.210
This is the primary cause of heart attack.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:16.200
It's less likely but sometimes a plaque could also go downstream, kind of form a thromboembolism.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:22.060
It would be this thrombogenic material, the clots around it.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:27.980
It would actually go and block the artery further downstream and be embolism.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:34.240
That can also block the artery and cause tissue to die. But the main cause is this intense clotting that can

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:41.260
occur pretty quickly and completely obstruct the artery. There is one last word i want to touch

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:52.220
sometimes mixed in with all the other words, that is cardiac arrest. That's because sometimes we use them in the same context.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:11:03.130
one thing can lead to another. Heart attack is not cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is the actual dying of the heart.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:12.915
What I just described in a heart attack, people can have a heart attack. They will have some part of their muscle tissue die.

00:11:12.915 --> 00:11:22.260
Some part infarct, that's what they called myocardial infarction. Myocardial means the tissue of heart or the muscle of the heart that's dying.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:27.370
Sometimes it is called myocardial infarction. That is not cardiac arrest.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.950
Cause you can have some of your heart tissue die and you can survive. Your heart would be impaired.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:37.660
But you will continue to live. Cardiac arrest is literally your heart stopping.

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:41.830
This would obviously cause someone to die. If you have a bad enough heart attack,

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:53.362
if you have enough of the tissue get starved of oxygen so that it dies, infarction occurs.

00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:57.980
Then it could lead to cardiac arrest. It always won't lead to cardiac arrest.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.810
Frankly, heart attack is not the only thing that can cause cardiac arrest.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:11.160
I also want to once again differentiate cardiac arrest from heart failure, because they sound the same, sound like heart is failing.

00:12:11.170 --> 99:59:59.999
Cardiac arrest is heart stopping. Heart failure is essentially just saying that heart can not provide all of the needs for the body.
