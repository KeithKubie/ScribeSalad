This episode is sponsored by Bill and Melinda Gates.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.270
I have some bad news for you. We're all going to die.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.840
In fact, 1.8 people die every second.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.199
The main way of knowing how you're gonna die is based on your age.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.100
So here are the statistics of how you're likely going to die.

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.179
Let's move in reverse and begin with those who are 70+ years old.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.720
This is the age bracket accounting for nearly half of all deaths worldwide

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.280
and the leading cause of death in this age group is overwhelmingly heart disease.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.360
If you're between the ages of 45 to 64 in the US, cancer is the leading cause of death.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.500
In 2016, globally, 8.9 million deaths were attributed to cancers which is 5.7 million more than in 1990.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.940
Wait, why has cancer increased so much?

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.860
It's because as our population grows and lifespans increase, so do the cancer rates.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.730
If you die between the age of 25 and 44,

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.240
the most common cause of death in America is from unintentional poisoning.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.780
This may sound strange,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.429
but it's because unintentional poisoning as a term includes deaths related to overdosing on drugs.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.320
Dying due to drug use in the US has tripled since 1999 to 2016,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.860
largely due to the opioid crisis.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.440
The data now coming in from 2017 indicates that it is the worst year in US history for overdose fatalities.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.360
In fact, in 2017, the death toll from drugs is higher than US military casualties

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.930
in the Vietnam and Iraq war combined.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.160
But this is not the case around the world.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.240
In South Africa, the number one killer for this age group is HIV/AIDS

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.180
and in Brazil, it's homicide.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.110
Between 15 to 24 years old in the US, the leading cause of death is motor vehicle accident.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.840
Crash risk is particularly high within the first few months of obtaining a license.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.600
Also, 53% of these fatalities occur on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.700
with male driver death rates being twice as high as their female counterparts.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.920
Teens also have the lowest incidence of wearing a seatbelt,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.420
are more likely to speed,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.000
and leave a smaller space between drivers.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.669
For ages 5 to 14, the leading cause of death is malaria.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.432
Malaria is the result of single-celled parasitic microorganisms called plasmodia

00:02:18.432 --> 00:02:20.960
that are transmitted via mosquitoes.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.200
The complexity of the malaria parasite makes developing a vaccine very difficult,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.840
but a recent trial is showing promising results.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.940
5.4 million children under the age of 5 died in 2017.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.900
The leading cause of death was a variety of neonatal disorders.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.759
Though tragic, the death rate among children has dropped dramatically.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.460
In 1990, 1 in 11 children under five passed away

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.180
but in 2017, the number was 1 in 26.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.400
So how you will die greatly depends on when you will die.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.600
If you make it to old age, heart disease will likely do you in.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.500
That being said, 100 years ago influenza was the leading cause of death.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.600
So who knows how we will die in the future?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.960
But we can do better, and science can help.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.240
By reviewing over 40,000 DNA samples voluntarily submitted,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.160
geneticists have discovered a link between

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.580
premature births and the genes that process the mineral selenium.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.940
The study found that expectant mothers who carry the gene were more likely to give birth early.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.780
15 million babies are born premature every year

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.600
and understanding what causes prematurity is hugely important

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.900
as these babies in the low-income countries are at much higher risk of death.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.379
This issue and potential solution is one of the fascinating and surprising issues

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.080
you can read about in Bill and Melinda Gates' Annual Letter at GatesLetter.com.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.860
This year, they're sharing the surprises they've encountered in their work,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.240
including the fact that toilets haven't changed in a century

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.720
and that textbooks are becoming obsolete,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.899
and the surprising reasons these two pieces of information are actually really important.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.040
You're gonna want to learn about how

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.500
these surprising moments are prodding them to help make the world a better place,
