00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.040
[James]: Not just regular permutations, super-permutations, “can leap tall buildings in a single bound” permutations.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.600
What is a super-permutation? First of all let’s talk about an ordinary permutation.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.580
A permutation is just like a shuffle, so imagine I had three cards: 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.260
How many ways can I shuffle those three cards, so let’s do that?

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.740
These are the permutations: 1,2,3,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.000
and we could have 1,3,2, 2,1,3, 2,3,1,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.880
and we could have 3,1,2 &amp; 3,2,1. There are six permutations that use the numbers 1 to 3,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.480
and that is three factorial (“3!”).

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.460
Just to remind people, 3 factorial means 3×2×1,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.200
and that’s because we've got three choices for the first one,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.180
two choices for the second one,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.820
and one choice for the last one.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600
And you multiply those choices together, that’s 3 factorial.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.660
That’s 6. There are 6 ways to do it.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.700
Now, a super-permutation is a string of numbers that contains all the permutations,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.400
so the super permutation of 1, 2, &amp; 3 would have

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.320
all the permutations of 1, 2, &amp; 3 contained within it, so we could just string these together.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.800
Now, that’s simple right?

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.940
1,2,3, 1,3,2, 2,1,3, 2,3,1, 3,1,2, 3,2,1

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.060
So, that’s a super-permutation; it has length 18. You don’t seem that impressed with that super-permutation.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.060
It doesn’t deserve its name as being super? Okay, we can do better.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.700
What is the smallest string of numbers that we can write that contains all of the permutations?

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.600
Well, how about this one: 1,2,3, 
 1,2,1, 3,2,1.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.460
Alright this has length 9,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.300
but it is a super permutation, and it’s the shortest super-permutation using 1,2,3.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.620
Let’s check, so it has—

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.800
[Brady]: So, you’ve used overlaps, basically?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.360
[James]: I have used overlaps. Let’s check.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.180
1,2,3, that’s in there.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.080
1,3,2, I’ve got it here.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.500
2,1,3, where is it? There it is.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.640
2,3,1, right there near the beginning.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.240
3,1,2, I bet that is here.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.400
And, 3,2,1 is right at the end.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.940
Yes it contains all the permutations, but it is the shortest string that contains all the permutations, and it has length 9.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.440
So let’s have a look at the shortest super-permutations for all the values: 1–3, 1–4…

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.450
Let’s have a look! So they start with 1.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.880
Okay.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.140
The super-permutation containing all the permutations of 1 is…

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.480
1.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.900
And let me just check.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.300
Yes, that contains all the permutations; it has length 1.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.399
Great well what is the super permutation for…

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.160
1 and 2?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.500
It is 1,2,1.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.110
So it has 1 &amp; 2, and it has 2 &amp; 1. That’s all you need, and that has length 3, as you can see.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.079
Now for 3, we’ve done that one, and we have a super permutation of length 9.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.560
Now 4. I’m gonna tell you, 4 has length 33, so let’s have a look at what that looks like.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.020
1,2,3,4...2,1,3,2...1,4,3,2,1. There we go.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.740
So that has length 33, and it contains all the permutations.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.500
So, 5. What is the super permutation of 5? It has length 153.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.840
Should I write that one out?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.100
[Brady]: No, it’s escalating.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.760
[James]: It is escalating, and then for 6…

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.620
don’t know.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.660
[Brady]: No!

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.580
[James]: We don’t know!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.740
What is the super-permutation, or the minimum super-permutation, using 1–6?

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.940
We have a guess.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.480
Okay, so there is a pattern of maybe this guess is right.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.959
Have a look, this first number.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.640
It was 1. That is 1 factorial.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.380
The second number is 3. Actually that turns out to be 1!&nbsp;+&nbsp;2!.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.540
9: 1!&nbsp;+&nbsp;2!&nbsp;+&nbsp;3!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.800
You might notice a pattern.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:19.020
4: 33. Well that is 1!&nbsp;+&nbsp;2!&nbsp;+&nbsp;3!&nbsp;+&nbsp;4!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.480
What do you guess 5 is going to be?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.940
[Brady]: Hmm, 1–5, all factorials.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.500
[James]: Yeah.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.000
1!&nbsp;+&nbsp;2!&nbsp;+&nbsp;3!&nbsp;+&nbsp;4!&nbsp;+&nbsp;5! is 153.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.580
So, six…

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.420
What do you guess six is going to be, adding up the factorials?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:47.180
Let’s do it. 1!&nbsp;+&nbsp;2!&nbsp;+&nbsp;3!&nbsp;+&nbsp;4!&nbsp;+&nbsp;5!&nbsp;+&nbsp;6! = 873

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.220
I think that’s a pretty good guess for the minimum length of the super-permutation using 1–6.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.080
Unfortunately, recently,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.640
someone found a super-permutation that is shorter.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.020
In fact, they found a super-permutation that had length 872.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.560
1 shorter! The pattern did not hold! It was 1 shorter!

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.980
And I can show you what that looks like!

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.320
This is it on the screen.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.620
[Brady]: No way!

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.920
[James]: And we still don’t know if that’s the shortest one.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.880
We still don’t know if the answer is 872.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.480
It’s possible there is a shorter one out there.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.100
It was a little bit of a shock.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.720
Well, you can see this pattern,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.960
and there’s a reason why you would think this pattern would hold.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.160
There is a way to construct the next super-permutation from the previous one,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.640
and if you construct it in that way, then absolutely the super permutation will have that length.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.540
And,

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.360
so they were just thinking well that must be the minimum length.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.960
This shows they were wrong. It isn’t the minimum length.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.800
It is not necessary for it to be the minimum thing.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.660
Now, you can see that this might become harder, the larger these numbers become.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.300
It’s actually computationally hard.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.580
So, maybe we’ll find what the minimum length is for 6,

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.609
but then, we’ll have to work out 7 and so on, and this is going to get harder and harder,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.419
unless…

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.920
we find some clever construction of the minimum super-permutations

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.460
that tells us what the minimum length is.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.200
This is worth comparing to something called De Bruijn sequences,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.120
and De Bruijn sequences are a similar idea, but they contain all the sequences.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:44.340
Using – let’s say – one to three, you would contain all the sequences. It would look like this.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.560
So here’s a De Bruijn sequence.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:07:02.760
Similar idea: 1,1,1, 2,1,1, 3,1,2, 2,1,2, 3,1,3, 2,1,3, 3,2,2, 2,3,2, 3,3,3,1,1.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.880
So here we have a sequence and it contains all sequences of length three using the numbers 1–3.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.560
So, 1,1,1 is in there.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.360
1,1,2 is in there.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.280
3,3,3 is in there.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.960
3,1,3 is in there.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.759
So De Bruijn sequences are a lot like super-permutations,

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.860
but the sequences inside are allowed to contain duplicates,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.220
but we have a way to construct De Bruijn sequences,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.100
and it constructs the minimum-length De Bruijn sequence as well.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:40.380
And they have practical applications in robotics and in actually lots of other areas as well.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.740
DNA sequencing and all lots of unexpected applications.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:51.960
So, De Bruijn sequences, although I think should be harder really, are completely understood,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.100
but super permutations are still a little bit mysterious.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:03.860

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.540
They’ve got an extensive library of 8,000 videos,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.760
covering pretty much anything that might take your fancy, from playing chess to the geography of Antarctica

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:21.620
I’m actually heading to Antarctica myself in the next few weeks, so I’ve been paying particularly close attention to those lessons.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.460
[embedded video]: It’s about 50% larger than the United States including, Alaska

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.580
[Brady]: They’re really good, really in-depth stuff.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:35.420
[embedded video]: If all of this ice melted, the global sea level would rise about 60m. That’s 200ft.
