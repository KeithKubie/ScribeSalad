00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:07.570
SARAH THOMSON:
Thanks for coming.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.080
Really excited to
have you all here.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.600
And I'm super stoked to have
this awesome panel here.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.660
We have a fantastic
cross-section,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.400
a really diverse
collection of indies

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.690
up here on the stage today.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.710
First of all, my name is
Sarah, and I head up the Indies

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.330
Community for Google Play.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.590
Really happy to be here
with Google this year.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.560
And let's start off
with some intros.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.412
Let's start here, Petr.

00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:34.660
PETR VODAK: Hello.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.220
My name is Petr Vodak.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.470
I'm from Czech Republic, Prague.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.800
I'm CEO and co-founder of
company called About Fun.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.040
And we are mobile
game developers.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.530
Right now 22 people.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.910
And I'll be talking more
about our experience

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.732
with the publishers, LXS,
and some more crazy things.

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:57.190
JESSE SCHELL: Hi,
I'm Jesse Schell,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.020
the CEO of Schell Games.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.460
We've got a largish studio in
Pittsburgh, about 100 people,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.590
doing everything from mobile
to interactive installations

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.269
and doing a lot of
VR and AR right now.

00:01:12.269 --> 00:01:13.560
RICARDO FISCHER: Hi, everybody.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.740
I'm Ricardo Fischer.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.410
I'm director of
development at 505 Games.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.580
We're a global
publisher really focused

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.295
on helping indies
bring games to market.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.670
WILL TURNBULL: I'm Will Turnbull
from Klei Entertainment.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.045
Klei Entertainment is a studio
of 60 people in Vancouver.

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:32.890
We do four indie games right
now, the most popular of which

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.030
is "Don't Starve."

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.150
And we focus on premium games.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.240
PETE ARDEN: And I'm Pete
Arden from Disruptor Beam.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.200
I'm the CMO there.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.250
We're a Boston-based
publisher and developer

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.180
of licensed games, so games like
"Game of Thrones Ascent," "Star

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.460
Trek Timelines."

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.610
I'm responsible for the
publishing operations,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.120
everything from acquiring users
through community to player

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.255
support.

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:00.130
SARAH THOMSON: Great.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.180
Thanks, guys.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.490
So how many of you are currently
developing for Android?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.180
Great.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.380
And how many are on the
fence thinking about it?

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.070
Considering it?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.510
OK, great.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.420
So let's maybe talk about
the fact that many of you,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.110
if not all of you here,
have been developing games

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.520
for a number of years.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.680
You've been in the industry
for quite some time.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.570
You've kind of seen it all.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:31.117
So what does mobile look
like these days for an indie?

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:32.450
Whoever wants to start that off.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.028
JESSE SCHELL: It's
so hard, oh my god.

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:39.360
[CHUCKLING]

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.130
It is not an easy thing, right?

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.730
There was a time when mobile
was this exploding phenomenon.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.520
And there was just rapid growth.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.830
And people were spending crazy
amounts of money on apps.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.260
And that time is not
happening right now, right?

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.380
So it means that if--

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.540
I guess from what I'm
seeing as an indie--

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.620
if you are doing
traditional things--

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.680
and by traditional things, I
mean ideas that are like two

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.810
years old or older--

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.290
then you have to have
something pretty clever.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.431
And you have to have a nice
hook to your community.

00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:15.680
Or you need to just be doing
something very different.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.510
That's part of the reason
we're doing a lot of VR and AR

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.436
and Tango and things is because
we see that as a growth area.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:27.840
RICARDO FISCHER: Yeah, I'd
have to agree that it's changed

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.310
a lot in the last 17 years.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.900
I started.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.510
I worked with
[? Autumn ?] for a while.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.510
And there was a very different
landscape at the time.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.910
Right now, it's
ultra competitive.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.190
It is hard to get visibility.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.130
And I think if you're
depending on getting featured,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.460
you may end up
being disappointed.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.120
I think Google makes a great
effort to feature great games.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.620
But the case is,
is not everybody

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.810
is going to land there.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.967
So you're going to have
to find your own way.

00:04:03.967 --> 00:04:05.550
And I think one of
the other panelists

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.090
said it in building for a
business, kind of, you know.

00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:16.060
WILL TURNBULL: Games are a
crowded space on every platform

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.560
right now.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.860
But to the previous panel, if
you build a good community,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.200
and you really work on your IP,
one thing that we find at Klei

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.380
is you can succeed anywhere.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.939
And so the success
on one platform

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.230
can parlay over to another one.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.021
And that's been a lot
of how "Don't Starve"

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.022
has succeeded on Google Play.

00:04:34.022 --> 00:04:35.230
PETE ARDEN: Yeah, it's tough.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.932
We started out with
the mission of creating

00:04:37.932 --> 00:04:39.640
really immersive games,
the kind of games

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.450
that you would see on PC,
but on the mobile platform

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.740
six years ago.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.580
And we were able to do that
with our first couple of games.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.900
It's just becoming
increasingly hard.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.600
Even though we
license games, it's

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.000
still very, very
competitive out there.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.140
We're trying to solve that
problem a little bit by paying

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.130
for licenses to reach
these big communities that

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.140
are interested in
authentic immersive games.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.990
But it's tough for us as well.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.490
And yeah, you're right,
you can't count on--

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.110
nobody can count on featuring
anymore, I don't think.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.650
PETR VODAK: And for us, a small
indie studio that started like,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.450
five years ago.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.000
And we are four.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.210
So throughout the time, we
were focusing on innovation,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.580
I mean, trying to come
up with something new

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.520
because it's a hard
thing, of course.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.260
And you can sometimes
go to the dead end,

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.710
and go back, and try again.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.380
But for us, it really worked.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.790
I mean, the unique concepts--

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.820
we can undertake
the risks because we

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.470
don't have the costs.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.530
So we are able to try
to focus on new things,

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.710
trying to find some new
concepts, something fresh.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.385
That's what works for us.

00:05:55.385 --> 00:05:56.260
SARAH THOMSON: Great.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.360
And I think also,
too, all of you

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.580
have worked across
multiple platforms.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.740
So what's that like, working
in a space that maybe you

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.100
developed some kind of success
story or track record on

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.350
and coming to new platforms,
whether that be mobile,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.470
or VR, or any other platform?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.176
Were there things that
transferred over for you?

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:18.550
Or were there
things that you had

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.930
to totally relearn or look--

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.000
have that paradigm shift?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.060
Can you talk about that?

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.120
PETE ARDEN: It's interesting.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.970
Some of our competitors
don't talk about their games

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.890
until they're ready
to release them.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.120
They keep them in
a stealth mode.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.880
And having come from PC
games and console games,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.770
I was, as a
marketer, always very

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.655
used to doing long lead
build-up to a game launch,

00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:48.280
not necessarily
spending a lot of money

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.042
but really developing
a community,

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.000
reaching out to people
who might be predisposed

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.520
to the kinds of games
that you're making.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.640
We've taken the same
approach at Disruptor Beam.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.650
We're not trying to
stay in stealth mode.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.490
Even though we may soft launch
or do an early access program,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.210
we really are trying to reach
out to the people who are,

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.580
we think, are going to
be inclined to our game.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.150
And we were able to reach
hundreds of thousands

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.560
of those Star Trek
fans out there

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.020
when we launched "Star
Trek Timelines" last year

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.130
by going to events and
doing player gatherings,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.750
community-driven events, really
connecting with users even

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.676
before the game was
out, and providing them

00:07:27.676 --> 00:07:29.800
with a lot of content about
what we were up to, how

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.280
we were developing the game.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.410
And that level of honesty and
authenticity with the players

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.620
has really paid off in
terms of their retention

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.702
and their spending.

00:07:40.702 --> 00:07:42.160
RICARDO FISCHER:
I think part of it

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.740
is also build for the audience.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.810
Know the audience.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.730
When we started working on
"Terraria," one of the things

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.236
that we did is look at the
play patterns on mobile.

00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:55.030
And they're very, very
different than PC.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.670
People sit down at
PC to play for hours.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.370
Mobile players are playing
online at a Starbucks.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.950
So we decided to make
some things happen faster,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.290
get players to the
core of the fun,

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.570
the crafting, the
discovery that happens

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.010
in the game at a much faster
pace to engage them sooner.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.740
I think you need to
understand the audience.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.440
And know that if you're
moving from another platform,

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.960
it is not the exact
same play patterns.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.270
And while you don't have
to compromise your game,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.720
you do have to address
it for the new audience.

00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:33.280
WILL TURNBULL: Our games have
been on a lot of platforms.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.390
"Don't Starve" started as
a browser game in 2012.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.570
And one of the things that
we've used to great success

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.520
is early access.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.640
And part of that is
slowly building community

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.310
and taking a lot of
feedback, both from analytics

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.520
and from the community,
to build better games.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.957
And then when it comes
to new platforms,

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:55.540
initially, we were
pretty intimidated,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.825
especially with mobile
because it was such a PC game.

00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:01.531
And once we dove in, we found
that the experience really

00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.030
worked.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.065
And so my suggestion,
especially if you're

00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:06.190
starting on another platform,
is the switching cost

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.750
isn't as big as you think it is.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.582
And the game, especially if
it's fun on one platform,

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:12.290
will probably be fun
on another platform.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.780
Clearly, there are differences
in how players play.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.677
Like "Don't Starve," the day
cycles are eight minutes long.

00:09:17.677 --> 00:09:19.760
Mobile play sessions should
be three minutes long.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.460
And so how do you
make "Don't Starve"

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.654
a experience that a mobile
user can play comfortably?

00:09:26.654 --> 00:09:28.070
That takes some
time and patience.

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.110
But the game itself
transfers over really

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.735
well from PC to mobile.

00:09:31.735 --> 00:09:33.110
SARAH THOMSON:
Petr, did you want

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.316
to add more about your
experience with early access?

00:09:37.316 --> 00:09:39.920
PETR VODAK: Well, yeah, I
mean, we offer early access.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.470
Definitely, it's something
you should all do.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:48.590
I mean, for us, we are
only creating mobile games,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.060
so I can't compare.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.960
But what we gained
through the early access

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.480
was for a real-time
of our game, one

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.860
of the things that
will help us a lot

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.070
was that we are able to
raise the game globally.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.620
At the same time, all the
feedback we get wasn't public--

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.710
or weren't public.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:13.940
So we were able to really
focus on all the stuff that

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.500
were given to us, all
the great feedback.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.370
And we could test our
matchmaking real well.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.020
We did load balancing
because we were

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.436
lucky to get a really good
position and a lot of downloads

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:28.790
through the early access.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.500
So I mean, was one of the parts.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.110
Of course, it helped us with
the cheating and hacking.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.540
We were able to find out a
lot of issues with the game.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.150
So we had this advantage, so
we can cope with that in time.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.470
I mean, of course,
[? Boxx ?] as well.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.820
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.000
SARAH THOMSON: Cool.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.120
And actually, Jesse, I'd
love to hear your perspective

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.720
on what it's like being an
indie getting into VR and AR.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.450
JESSE SCHELL: Yeah,
part of what's

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.080
really hard about being
indie going into VR

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.500
and AR is that it's really
tough making money in that space

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:12.020
right now because the number of
people using the system, buying

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.970
games is small.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.780
It's bigger on mobile than it
is on the high-end platforms.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.850
But on the flip side,
the folks on mobile

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:23.240
don't really want to
pay for very much.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.899
So we're all waiting
for it to get big.

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:28.190
So I guess if you're indie,
thinking about going there,

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.564
I think it is a
good place to go.

00:11:29.564 --> 00:11:32.750
But you've got to look at
it as a long-term investment

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.750
and think about the fact
that, yeah, in the beginning,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.880
you might not be
making very much.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.490
So like an example
of a game that we

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.420
did was our first VR
game that we put out

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.780
is this game called
"I Expect You to Die."

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.720
Now, we've been working
on it for three years.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.110
And we started out just
putting a free level of it

00:11:54.110 --> 00:12:00.350
up for free in the Oculus Share
store was the way we started.

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.534
And that got a lot of
really great feedback

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:03.950
and gave us the
confidence that we

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.783
could turn it into a
real game that we would

00:12:05.783 --> 00:12:08.050
bring to multiple platforms.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.540
But we had to really
take the long view on it.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.950
And even now, I mean, like
that game is doing very well.

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.740
And it's very highly rated,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.920
I'm not sure it's going to
pay for itself until maybe

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.940
the end of this year.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.000
So you have to take a little
bit of a long view with that.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.330
So you want to look for
ways to be economical.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.911
If you've got maybe some
mobile game that you think,

00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:34.160
you know what, there's a
clever way I could bring this

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.940
to Tango, or a clever way I
could bring this to Daydream,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.520
I think these are good
things to think about.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.110
I mean, not everything
wants to port.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.350
But some things actually
will port to VR pretty well.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.260
And you can start to test
the waters with that,

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:52.937
and learn the medium, and
start to see if it's for you.

00:12:52.937 --> 00:12:55.520
SARAH THOMSON: I think you bring
up a really interesting topic

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.370
that can apply across
the board for indies,

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:01.820
which is how do you have
long-term vision as an indie?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.370
I think many indies are
just trying to figure out

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.710
how to keep the lights
on from month to month

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.210
or pay maybe their
5 to 10 employees.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:16.910
So how do you have that
immediate first step in mind,

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.200
but also what's coming 5,
10 steps ahead as an indie,

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.860
especially as these
smaller bootstrap studios?

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.560
What's your advice there?

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.435
Anyone.

00:13:28.435 --> 00:13:30.710
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.560
RICARDO FISCHER: I would say
weigh your choices carefully.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.480
Rely on your
community and the data

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:40.010
that you're receiving from your
game to inform your decisions.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.820
I think as game developers, we
tend to want to do what's cool.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.620
But that doesn't always
resonate with the audience.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.050
But there's a lot of avenues.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.830
You can get Google
Analytics and early access

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.130
and all these great programs
that will inform your decisions

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:59.780
and help you make choices that
will return on the investment

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.110
that you're making.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.180
I think that's a
great place to start.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.540
JESSE SCHELL: And I guess one
thing I'll put out there--

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.000
not everybody always
talks about-- but the idea

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.030
of doing work-for-hire
projects as an indie

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.810
and making that part
of your ecosystem

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.570
and part of your business
model can work very well.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.970
Not everybody chooses to do it.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.710
It's how I've always
run my studio.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.010
I've had 15 years of that,
where generally we're

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.310
doing somewhere
around 60% to 80%

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.340
of what we do is work-for-hire
projects with partners.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.770
And then we try and
make those profitable,

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.980
and then try and do our
own IP along with that.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.286
And if you don't
like work-for-hire,

00:14:38.286 --> 00:14:39.910
well then you probably
shouldn't do it.

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.040
But it can be really nice.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.380
You get to work with
some great people

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.840
and often work with
some great IPs.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.530
And you get to sleep at
night because you know,

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.250
you know, just to be frank, even
if the game doesn't make money,

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.390
you get paid, right?

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.210
And everybody gets their salary
for working on that game.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.840
So that can be a
thing to consider

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.636
if it works for your studio.

00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.260
PETR VODAK: And you
learn a lot, right?

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.930
SARAH THOMSON: Mm.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.300
PETE ARDEN: Yeah, this is
going to sound strange,

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.240
coming from a marketer speaking
to a room of developers.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.940
But building in a certain
amount of modularity

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.950
into what you develop is
really important because what

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.400
we're finding, when we launched
"Star Trek Timelines," we aimed

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.200
squarely at Star Trek fans.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.150
We got a lot of them early on.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.830
The new-player
experience that we had

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.960
was really geared
toward someone who

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.030
was a true fan of Star Trek.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.870
As time went on, costs started
to increase on the acquisition

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.030
side because we had run through
a lot of those initial users.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.880
Now we're retooling our
new-player experience

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.900
to appeal more to a
gamer or someone looking

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.525
for some kind of
branded entertainment,

00:15:48.525 --> 00:15:52.860
but maybe who has less intimate
knowledge of the Star Trek

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.680
lore-- is just looking
for a fun game.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.690
And so we're doing
some experiments

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.800
now where we're able
to try different things

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.750
for the new audience
that's coming in.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.130
So give yourself optionality.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.271
Give yourself options.

00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.020
There's a school of
thought where you just

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.810
go all in on one idea, and
you dedicate yourself to that,

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.100
and find an audience.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.740
And that's absolutely
a great way to go.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.560
There's an alternate way
of thinking-- or maybe side

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.440
by side in parallel-- where
you think about the options

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:26.200
that you give yourself
so that, as time goes on,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.560
you can react to
market conditions

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.387
and a changing player base even.

00:16:30.387 --> 00:16:32.220
JESSE SCHELL: Let me
just tell a quick story

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.550
about turning a
client relationship

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.320
into a piece of IP.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.620
We'd been working with PBS
and the Fred Rogers Company

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.170
to make these "Daniel Tiger's
Neighborhood" games for really

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.480
little kids on websites.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.910
And we'd done about
15 of these, but we

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.260
hadn't done any apps for them.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.840
We'd just been doing
the website games.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.014
And we had an idea for an app
that we thought would be--

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:56.430
an app you could
charge money for.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.980
And we went to them and said,
this is a good idea for an app.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.970
You should do this.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.364
You should pay us to do this.

00:17:01.364 --> 00:17:03.530
And they looked at it, and
they were like, mm, yeah,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.440
it's not a bad idea.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.314
But we don't really want
to pay you to do it.

00:17:06.314 --> 00:17:08.149
We don't really have
an app budget for that.

00:17:08.149 --> 00:17:09.690
And we looked at
each other and said,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:13.230
well, what if we did
the investment on it?

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.119
And we'll pay for
the development.

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:17.430
But you guys put in the
license, and you guys

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.329
put in the marketing.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.640
And then we'll split
the money on it.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.121
And they were like,
well, actually,

00:17:22.121 --> 00:17:24.329
that sounds pretty good
because we do like this idea.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.010
But we just don't have a
budget for it right now.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:26.339
SARAH THOMSON: That's cool.

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:27.660
JESSE SCHELL: And so
suddenly we turned a thing

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.060
where it had been totally
work-for-hire into a situation

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.240
where suddenly we're getting
a piece of the back end,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.460
and we're driving the
relationship a little bit.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.450
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah,
definitely the power

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.940
of relationship-building as an
indie with a larger partner.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.930
And I think there's
stories across the board

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:43.974
here around that, too.

00:17:43.974 --> 00:17:45.140
I mean, you guys work with--

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.350
PETR VODAK: Yeah.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.766
SARAH THOMSON:
--Chillingo, right?

00:17:46.766 --> 00:17:48.190
PETR VODAK: One more from me.

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.650
It was a super hard
decision for us.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.020
We had decided to start
working on two games.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:56.820
One we had decided
to self-publish.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.370
One we had decided
to go with Chillingo.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.420
And we had a previous experience
working with Chillingo,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.810
and it was real well.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.450
So we decided to
go again with them.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:12.420
But with the self-published
game, we were like,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.790
we need to make this
earlier because we

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.630
knew that the second
game is real big.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.169
I mean, it was for
this small team.

00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:22.710
At the time, there
was like 10 people

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:26.490
only on the team and working
on two games at the same time,

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.500
two free-to-play games with
all the full-scale features.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.520
And so like, we had decided to
go with one of the games that

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.400
will self-publish.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.310
It will help us to finance the
second game, and it worked out.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.440
I mean, it was a small game.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.580
It really was released like half
a year before the second one.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.980
And it help us to overtake the
difficult times we had before

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.330
releasing the second game.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.200
If we wouldn't do that, we
had to release the second game

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.460
much earlier.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.970
And there wouldn't be really
at that quality and the state

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.177
we wanted to have it.

00:19:04.177 --> 00:19:05.010
So it's a real help.

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.470
And regarding Chillingo,
it's something,

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.520
I mean, it's something
that you need to decide.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.520
If you want to focus on
the game, for example,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.530
or really on the development
of the game, and for example,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.780
the marketing PR, some
QA stuff, utilization,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.130
go-to-market stuff--

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.040
all these things if you are
something that you don't like,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.180
and you don't want to do,
then go with a publisher.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.511
I mean, we had experience with
some bad publishers, of course.

00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:37.260
In case of Chillingo,
we were super happy.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.010
And we are super happy
to work with them.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.420
So--

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:39.720
SARAH THOMSON: Cool.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.740
PETR VODAK: Yeah.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.500
SARAH THOMSON: And I
think another challenging

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.730
point of being in indie, one
of the many things, is deciding

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.460
are you going to go
down the route of a paid

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.980
game versus free to play?

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.340
I think we all understand
how challenging paid content

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.140
is on mobile.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.300
But there's a couple
of you here who

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.830
have had success around that.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.470
So can you speak
to that success,

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.900
how that worked for you, and
what that looks like in terms

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.310
of long tail as well on mobile?

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.390
RICARDO FISCHER: So I
can speak to "Terraria."

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.020
"Terraria" is ongoing for
now three years on mobile.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.690
And it's tremendously
successful.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.960
I think a big credit
to the game goes

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:26.850
to having built a vibrant
community that is nurtured

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.750
on an ongoing basis.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.830
Another aspect of it was
that we looked at "Terraria,"

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.220
and while it was a paid game,
we treated it as a game,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:35.850
as a service.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.280
We did continuous updates.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.530
We introduced timed
content that would

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.620
allow us to do larger updates.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.200
So we have a lot
of seasonal events.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.995
And those are preset
into the game.

00:20:48.995 --> 00:20:52.620
And that bought us time
to do longer updates that

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.890
required more effort on
the development side.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:00.240
And the community still got
new stuff to play around with.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.730
We got the time we needed to
give them the larger content

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:03.730
updates.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:08.980
So I think you can still
have success in those games.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.080
You do have to kind of treat
them as, in a lot of ways,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.470
like free-to-play plays.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:18.454
And you have to be super
careful with the community.

00:21:18.454 --> 00:21:20.120
WILL TURNBULL: Yeah,
for "Don't Starve,"

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.480
it's a $4.99 app,
which is pretty

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.730
expensive in the mobile world.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:25.470
But we also run
it like a service.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.059
And we're both constantly
monitoring all our views

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:30.600
and seeing if we can find trends
in terms of what players are

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.433
looking for, whether
it be different control

00:21:32.433 --> 00:21:34.770
schemes or different
language support,

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.860
and then also just perennially
adding content to the game

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.640
and feeding the fiction, both
on mobile and also on PC.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.770
And having that community
play into each other

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:45.930
has been really successful
in building long tail.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:47.931
Also, just knowing your
game is super important.

00:21:47.931 --> 00:21:50.513
Do you have a game that people
are going to come back and play

00:21:50.513 --> 00:21:52.260
day after day, or
a game where you

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.780
have to do something super
splashy to bring them back in?

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.670
Knowing your game and
understanding your game

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:58.860
can help you feel build,
like, a long tail.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.360
SARAH THOMSON: And
actually, Will, I

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.810
want to quickly touch on a
really interesting comment

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.820
that you made when we
were talking leading up

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:10.440
to this panel about your
unique perspective on piracy

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.520
because as we all know,
that is an ongoing issue

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.271
for content on Android.

00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.520
WILL TURNBULL: We love piracy.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.020
[CHUCKLES] Piracy is great.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.810
Piracy basically proves out that
there's demand for your game.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.467
And the way that
we look at pirates

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:25.050
is those are just
customers that we're

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.134
going to bring in someday.

00:22:26.134 --> 00:22:28.550
We're either going to make the
game more convenient to buy

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.660
in a region, or we're
going to bring in something

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.229
that they need or
want and they're

00:22:33.229 --> 00:22:34.270
going to come in and buy.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.800
So one of the things that we
saw in PC and we see on Android

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.270
is our piracy rates are high.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.630
We have hundreds of thousands of
daily active users of pirates.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.450
But the beauty of it is
that those players convert,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:47.370
and we can see them
convert in our analytics.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.420
And so our goal as a
studio is to grow our IP.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.410
And that means people
playing our games.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.610
We'll make money eventually
from those users,

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.160
whether it be on "Don't Starve,"
or it'd be on the next game.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.270
Trying to seal off your game
and keep people from playing it

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.147
isn't going to be a strategy
that wins in the long term.

00:23:05.147 --> 00:23:06.480
SARAH THOMSON: Great, thank you.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.790
And on the flip side,
let's talk about being

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.130
an indie in the
free-to-play space, which

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.470
I think in some ways can
be even more challenging

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.450
because then you're
really coming up

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.760
against the big titans, right,
you have astronomical UA

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.020
budgets and big teams fueling
the community side of things

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.290
and the social side of things.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.330
So those who are doing
the free-to-play side

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.210
of the business, what's
that been like for you?

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.924
And how have you managed
to be successful there?

00:23:35.924 --> 00:23:36.840
PETE ARDEN: It's hard.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.800
It's really hard.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.150
It's a lot of content.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.310
We do a lot of content
updates in the game.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:47.250
That's what drives the community
to participate, ultimately

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:47.820
to spend.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.950
But we don't just do
it inside the game.

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.840
The previous panel, they
talked a lot about community,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.770
about servicing the
community on social channels,

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.540
giving them updates
about what's going on,

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:02.250
bringing them back in.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.100
Maybe this week you're not
interested in the event

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.880
that's going on.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.160
But next week on
Facebook we'll post

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.660
about the next one
with maybe some

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.630
of your favorite characters
that you'll come back in on.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.480
But yeah, there's a lot of
pressure from all sides on free

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.230
to play.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:21.520
It's about really having a very
robust content plan and then

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.310
a very active dialogue with
your players about what

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.360
features do they want to see and
what you're capable of doing.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.440
We only have a fairly small
team on "Star Trek Timelines"

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:38.100
relative to the size of the
game in terms of players.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.210
And it's because we do as
much as we can to introduce

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:43.780
new features all the time.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.570
And sometimes you have
to sit back and go,

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:48.930
I guess we're not going to
do an actual visible feature

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.240
release for four
months because we

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.170
have to plan and build up to it
with underlying features that

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.780
get us there.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.450
So sometimes we don't
have big feature updates,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:00.840
which is not great.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.707
But we keep the content
coming constantly.

00:25:04.707 --> 00:25:07.040
SARAH THOMSON: Petr, did you
have anything to add there?

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.860
PETR VODAK: Well, I already
said is that in our case,

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.780
it's really trying to come
up with something unique.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.150
So basic thing is the
fun of the game itself.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.410
Then, for example, in
case of "WarFriends,"

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.380
it's [INAUDIBLE] real-time
[INAUDIBLE] game.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:31.590
And it's also game that you want
to watch and don't always play.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.820
So there is tons of content
being shared every day.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.810
And the game is really--
it's physical based.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:40.560
So there is a lot of
fun things happening.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.260
Sometimes it's not that
fun for us, you know?

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:50.155
But yeah, so this will help us
to build a community, to build

00:25:50.155 --> 00:25:52.500
a [INAUDIBLE] about a game.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.394
So that works for us.

00:25:54.394 --> 00:25:56.310
JESSE SCHELL: I know one
of our rules of thumb

00:25:56.310 --> 00:26:00.180
with free to play is if
you can't look at the game

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.030
and say, oh, I can imagine us
getting a million downloads,

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.380
like even considering
free to play

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.060
is just crazy because
you just-- you

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:13.130
need so many players in order
to make the thing profitable.

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.749
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah,
community is key.

00:26:14.749 --> 00:26:16.290
And I think, Pete,
you guys have done

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.950
a really great job of really
staying true to the brand

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.900
with Star Trek.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.110
And talk about how that sort
of resonates for your game.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.210
PETE ARDEN: Sure, yeah.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.280
It's one of our cores, one
of our values for the company

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.730
is authenticity in how we deal
with each other internally,

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:36.900
but also how we deal with our
IP holders, our licensors,

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.050
and the community
itself, the fans.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.430
And by showing that we are
real fans of these IPs,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:49.770
too, we're able to connect the
real Star Trek fans on a level

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.500
that they haven't seen
on mobile and they really

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.050
haven't seen very
often on PC, either.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:27:01.380
So people who are looking for
the best Star Trek video game

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.150
are often coming
to our game and not

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.780
going to some of the PC games
or the other mobile games

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.982
because we have the
richness of content.

00:27:08.982 --> 00:27:10.440
I will say, though,
that "Star Trek

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.350
Timelines" was designed in some
sense as a single-player game.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.630
That content furnace
that we have is--

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.090
we have to spend a lot of
time and energy on that.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:20.160
Our next game is based
on "The Walking Dead."

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.530
And that one is a
much more social game.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.380
That one is where to take
the pressure off of us,

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.040
we want to have the players
generate a lot of the content.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.140
The intrigue, the meta
game-- all of that

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.420
is, when you're
designing a game,

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.135
if you can get players to
generate the content for you,

00:27:36.135 --> 00:27:37.677
you're saving a lot
of money on that.

00:27:37.677 --> 00:27:39.926
SARAH THOMSON: OK, I'm going
to ask one more question.

00:27:39.926 --> 00:27:41.820
And then if anyone has
any questions, please

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.430
feel free to line up at
the microphones there.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.910
So what's kept you
in the indie space?

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.490
I mean, you're all
really talented.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.120
I'm sure you could get
a job anywhere you like.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.490
What keeps you indie?

00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:01.590
Why, despite all of the
challenges and how hard it is?

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.866
JESSE SCHELL: It's super fun.

00:28:02.866 --> 00:28:03.610
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:04.110
Right?

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.107
You can do things the way you
want when you want to do it.

00:28:07.107 --> 00:28:08.940
And, like, there's
nothing better than that.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.690
That's super fun.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.680
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.210
PETR VODAK: Yeah, that's right.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.330
PETE ARDEN: I mean, one of
our strategies at Disruptor--

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.240
being another one of them-- is
that we're tightly integrated

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.030
between development
and publishing.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.740
We don't have
third-party studios.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.050
We do it all in-house
in the same building.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.790
That cuts down on
communication time.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.420
It increases the understanding
between development

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.190
and publishing.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.040
It really helps us.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.120
And that is why
although we're growing,

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.086
it's always going to have that
sort of speed and agility.

00:28:42.086 --> 00:28:43.710
And that's what I
like about indie-- is

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.410
no one's off somewhere a
couple thousand miles away

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.210
making decisions about
what we're doing.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.440
We're doing it collectively
together, ourselves.

00:28:53.214 --> 00:28:54.380
WILL TURNBULL: The freedom--

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.296
the freedom's awesome.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:57.530
We have the ability to
course-correct dramatically

00:28:57.530 --> 00:28:59.785
on a week-to-week
basis and do what

00:28:59.785 --> 00:29:01.730
we see best for the
company at the moment,

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.507
rather than be beholden
to some other stakeholder.

00:29:05.507 --> 00:29:08.090
JESSE SCHELL: Yeah, I've started
working on toy robots lately.

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.470
And you know who can say no?

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.230
Nobody.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.455
[LAUGHING]

00:29:13.454 --> 00:29:14.870
SARAH THOMSON:
Well, there you go.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.650
What more do you need?

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.730
Yep.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:18.230
Great.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.920
Thanks, guys.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.344
OK, let's take the
first question here.

00:29:21.344 --> 00:29:22.010
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:23.970
I have a question
for the guys that

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.330
said they do work for hire.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.950
I'd like to know how do you
kick start a work-for-hire team?

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:35.330
How do you build your first
portfolio of clients on so on?

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.610
JESSE SCHELL: Yeah, it
comes through networking,

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:39.410
for the most part.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:43.070
For me, in the beginning, I
used to work at The Walt Disney

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.640
Company.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.430
And I had left, and
I was off teaching.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.290
And then I ended up
starting my own studio.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.650
And my initial
work-for-hire projects

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.530
were all from people that I
used to know through The Disney

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.370
Company.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.680
And but then gradually, I
got to know other people.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.130
So it really is, so much
of it is just about people

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.370
knowing you and
getting to trust you.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.990
And it can happen a lot of ways.

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:10.400
It's part of the reason
why I speak publicly a lot.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.161
One of the biggest
projects we ever got

00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:14.660
was someone called me up and
said, I saw this talk you gave.

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.755
I thought it was great.

00:30:15.755 --> 00:30:17.880
How'd you like to do this
multimillion-dollar deal?

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.236
And I'm like, oh, I guess I'm
glad I did that talk, you know?

00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:22.860
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.010
SARAH THOMSON: No, I'm too
busy building toy robots.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.134
JESSE SCHELL: That's right.

00:30:26.134 --> 00:30:27.812
[CHUCKLING]

00:30:27.812 --> 00:30:29.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.310
AUDIENCE: This question
mainly for Will but also

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:32.550
for anyone else.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.820
So as an indie, you've got
more constrained resources.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:39.150
And mobile people are kind of
expecting constant updates.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:41.240
But if you're making
premium games,

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.360
you've got to stop that and
move on to your next project.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.190
So how do you balance the two?

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:49.310
And have you got
any tricks for that?

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.340
WILL TURNBULL: Yeah.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:57.050
So one of things is with
Klei and with our games,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.067
they continue to sell.

00:30:58.067 --> 00:30:59.900
And the more that we
fuel those communities,

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:01.520
we can keep on
working on those games

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.520
because we keep on finding
more customers to buy.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:08.490
So "Don't Starve" is a game
that's four and a half years

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.220
in, and we're still
working on DLCs

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.170
and adding content and
adding free updates.

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.560
So there's an important
moment with a game

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.730
and watching a game that's
the game has run its course,

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.850
and you need to move on.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.970
But as long as you see
that people are still

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.481
resonating and still purchasing,
it's fine to stay in there

00:31:25.481 --> 00:31:27.230
and keep on building
out a content for it.

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.230
RICARDO FISCHER: Adding on
to what Will said, I agree.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.320
On "Terraria," you would
think that every time you

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.310
do a content update, you're
doing it for existing users.

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.270
But every time we did that,
we saw spikes on downloads

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.310
on a consistent basis.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.210
It was like clockwork.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.340
So if your game is working and
you continue to support it,

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:55.160
you're going to see continued
success, especially if you're

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.710
building that community
because those people who

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:00.320
love the game evangelize
it to other people

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.580
or buy it on new platforms.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:06.356
So you don't necessarily have
to move on to the next game.

00:32:06.356 --> 00:32:07.730
There's obviously
a point in time

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.250
at which you reduce
the team size

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.200
and start working
on your next thing.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.530
But it's not a firearm
for good business.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.854
It's nurture it and
carry it forward.

00:32:18.854 --> 00:32:20.270
WILL TURNBULL:
Another thing, too,

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.177
is those users that do stay in
the game and see those updates

00:32:23.177 --> 00:32:25.010
or remember that you
kept on adding content,

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.020
and when you come to
making your next game,

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:28.760
they'll be more excited about
buying it because they're like,

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.200
oh man, I bought
this game for $2.99,

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.400
and it kept on adding stuff.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.070
So not only are you servicing
your current customers,

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.615
but you're setting the
table for whatever's next.

00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:38.906
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:38.906 --> 00:32:39.780
SARAH THOMSON: Great.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.450
AUDIENCE: Well, first of all,
I wanted to say, thank you,

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.950
Jesse Schell, for that book
that you wrote about game design

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.684
because when you said, how do
you become a game designer?

00:32:46.684 --> 00:32:48.350
You just gotta say,
I'm a game designer,

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.308
and start making games.

00:32:49.308 --> 00:32:50.060
So thanks.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.260
I wouldn't have done
that without you.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.260
JESSE SCHELL: All right.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.985
AUDIENCE: And (CHUCKLING) then
the question that I have is now

00:32:55.985 --> 00:32:58.610
in mobile markets, I mean, we've
seen the growth that it's had.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.080
It's immense.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.080
It still makes more money
than consoles and PC combined,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.260
from the research
that I've done.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.460
But when you're seeing
big players like EA,

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.710
like Nintendo getting
into the mobile market--

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.910
and you guys are not,
like, brand-new in these.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.380
You guys have had some success.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.140
But for, like, people
that are trying

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.600
to break into the
mobile market, like,

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.670
what would you say is
good advice for somebody

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.920
who doesn't have the
recognition or the connections

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.630
even to, like, be able to work
with other studios and stuff

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.130
like that?

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.200
JESSE SCHELL: I'd say you better
do something really different.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:32.750
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.940
JESSE SCHELL: Really different.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.430
So different that people are
going to want to talk about it

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:40.730
and write about it and share
about it and all of that

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.770
because if you're
not doing that,

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.070
it's buying a lottery ticket.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.860
You might win.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.120
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.620
JESSE SCHELL: But there's not
a lot of strategy for winning.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.087
AUDIENCE: Right, right.

00:33:50.087 --> 00:33:51.670
WILL TURNBULL: One
of the big benefits

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:53.800
of being an indie
studio that starts on PC

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.320
is that we end up
being some of the best

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.800
products on mobile
because the AAA games--

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.570
a PC can't make the same leap.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.640
So one of the big
benefits that we've seen

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.260
is the types of
experiences that we've

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.240
been able to build
on PC translate

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.540
into being some of the most
interesting and deep pieces

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.500
of content on mobile.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.290
So I'm not saying
necessarily start on PC.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:17.320
But that can be a big advantage,
and especially if you build--

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.380
for us, our story was we built
a big followership there,

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.850
and it followed us onto mobile.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:24.310
And we saw a lot of players
come and buy the game again

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.620
because they liked it so
much that they wanted to have

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.064
the same experience on the go.

00:34:28.064 --> 00:34:30.063
And I think the same's
true for "Terraria," too.

00:34:30.063 --> 00:34:30.889
RICARDO FISCHER:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:31.719
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.927
SARAH THOMSON: I think from
the platform perspective,

00:34:33.927 --> 00:34:36.370
when we're looking
at new games that

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.790
are launching from developers
that are fairly obscure,

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:41.739
I think quality is
always number one.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:43.960
And it feels like an
obvious thing to say.

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.550
And it doesn't
mean that your game

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:49.150
has to be super
complex or super deep.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:50.800
It can be a very
simple experience.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.810
But if you've really
gone that extra mile

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.780
to make sure that your
art is super polished,

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.570
and your UI is very clean,
and it's very intuitive,

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:02.770
I think really sticking to
those kind of basic principles

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.720
will get you off
on the right foot.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:07.250
And then I think being
at events like this,

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:10.690
where the indie community
is quite tightly knit.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:14.020
And if you're able to go
to a few of the parties,

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.390
and introduce yourself
to other indies,

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.930
and share your game with
them, usually other indies

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.690
love to see indie games.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:22.360
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.250
SARAH THOMSON: And so
if you create a buzz

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.280
within that community, that
does tend to trickle up

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.380
to us more often than not.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.900
You'd be surprised
because indies

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.592
love to support each other.

00:35:33.592 --> 00:35:35.550
So I would definitely
encourage you to do that.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.440
And I think you're on
the right foot being here

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.120
and asking the right questions.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much, everybody.

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:41.660
Oh, sorry.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.900
PETR VODAK: I have
one more thing to add.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.180
For us, what would work
is to release the game

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.300
as soon as possible.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:47.990
Don't wait.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.040
Don't try to over-polish.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.910
Just go for it.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.490
Don't be afraid to fail.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.420
And release and go
for another game.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.587
And you will learn a lot.

00:35:57.587 --> 00:35:59.920
So every other game will be
much better and much better.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.550
Do it.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:03.910
JESSE SCHELL: And a thing
that a lot of new indies

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:09.460
don't think about is if you
come out with a bad game,

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:11.250
no one will know.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:12.880
[CHUCKLING]

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.460
Right, that's your whole
problem is that no one knows.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.100
You can come out with a good
game, and no one will know.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.680
But if you come out
with a bad game,

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.450
definitely no one
will know, right?

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.370
So, like, I talked
about the success

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:26.620
we had with "I Expect You
to Die" in the Oculus share

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.340
market.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.930
That was the second one.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:29.890
AUDIENCE: Oh, wow.

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.710
JESSE SCHELL: The first one
we did was a lot rougher.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.580
And we put it out.

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.430
And everyone was like,
meh, who cares, right?

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.760
And no one even knows
that that happened.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.970
But we still believed in it.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.160
And so we, like, made a more
polished and better version.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.451
And then it was over threshold.

00:36:43.451 --> 00:36:45.550
And then everybody
talked about it.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.280
So you shouldn't
be shy about when

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.650
you've got a new
thing you want to try,

00:36:50.650 --> 00:36:52.330
put out early versions of it.

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.780
And then just keep spinning
it up until it's good.

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.365
It's a weird way
to have to think.

00:36:57.365 --> 00:36:58.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:00.970
I was kind of afraid of that,
actually, because I was like,

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:02.050
it's my first impression.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.660
I don't want to come out and
have this game that's like, oh,

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.802
everybody's like, well,
this sucks, you know?

00:37:06.802 --> 00:37:08.760
Or whoever plays it,
like, the 5 or 10 people--

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.850
JESSE SCHELL: No,
like four dudes.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:10.810
Well, who cares, right?

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:11.310
[CHUCKLING]

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:12.490
Like, who cares?

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.334
You can find five other people
who don't like your game.

00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:16.000
It's no problem.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.431
[LAUGHING]

00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:19.180
PETR VODAK: Actually,
we spent three years

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.280
with a game that sucks.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.730
PETR VODAK: That's why
you have to spend, like,

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.994
three months with such game.

00:37:23.994 --> 00:37:24.494
So--

00:37:24.494 --> 00:37:24.988
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:24.988 --> 00:37:25.152
SARAH THOMSON: Yeah.

00:37:25.152 --> 00:37:25.976
PETR VODAK: --no worries.

00:37:25.976 --> 00:37:26.470
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.220
Thank you guys so much.

00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:27.720
Appreciate it.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.615
SARAH THOMSON: OK, let's have
one more question over here.

00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:30.250
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:35.880
So for indie gamers,
developers, the user positioning

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.150
is super important.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.820
So do you think
the China market is

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.110
another channel for you guys?

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:43.760
And do you have any
intention and plan for it

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:44.760
for China markets?

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.510
WILL TURNBULL: China
is our biggest market

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.580
worldwide for "Don't Starve."

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.260
And you would
think, hey, this is

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.320
a game that was designed
for a Western audience.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:56.555
And what ended up happening,
especially went to mobile,

00:37:56.555 --> 00:38:00.010
is we find an avenue where
Chinese players could

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:01.300
legitimately buy the game.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.970
And then through
tracking our data, which

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.700
I can't stress enough, we
noticed that suddenly there was

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.260
a surge in Chinese purchasers.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.290
And then we went and
positioned it last year such

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:13.240
that it could grow
rapidly in China.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.860
So Chinese players
are definitely

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.320
really interested
in indie games.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.750
And so doing proper
localization,

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:24.430
but once you see a signal in a
market like that, jump on it.

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.830
[CHUCKLES]

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.635
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:38:29.635 --> 00:38:30.510
SARAH THOMSON: Great.

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.870
OK, thank you, guys.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.708
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:36.363 --> 00:38:40.980
And that actually wraps
our day, our Developer Day

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.780
here for Google.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:43.890
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:46.230
And hopefully you
all are walking away

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:48.810
with a little gem of wisdom.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.190
And enjoy the rest of your week.

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.970
Enjoy GDC.
