Estie indeed I'll describe observations

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
Estie indeed I'll describe observations
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.200
Estie indeed I'll describe observations
but I'll also describe a theory

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
but I'll also describe a theory
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.470
but I'll also describe a theory
astrophysics theory which mathematicians

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
astrophysics theory which mathematicians
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.050
astrophysics theory which mathematicians
may regard is close to observations but

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
may regard is close to observations but
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.040
may regard is close to observations but
we think of it as theory and I wanted to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050
we think of it as theory and I wanted to
 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040
we think of it as theory and I wanted to
start with this slide since today is the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
start with this slide since today is the
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.770
start with this slide since today is the
evening of the Chinese New Year and so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
evening of the Chinese New Year and so
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200
evening of the Chinese New Year and so
on the left you see a depiction of PHA a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
on the left you see a depiction of PHA a
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.160
on the left you see a depiction of PHA a
goat I mean it does look like a goat and

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
goat I mean it does look like a goat and
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.549
goat I mean it does look like a goat and
that's the symbol for the new year

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559
that's the symbol for the new year
 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.369
that's the symbol for the new year
on the right side you see actually what

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
on the right side you see actually what
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.840
on the right side you see actually what
nature produces which looks pretty

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
nature produces which looks pretty
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.770
nature produces which looks pretty
similar to that except that it's on the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
similar to that except that it's on the
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.380
similar to that except that it's on the
scale of a hundred thousand light years

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390
scale of a hundred thousand light years
 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.369
scale of a hundred thousand light years
and what you see here is a jet ejected

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
and what you see here is a jet ejected
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860
and what you see here is a jet ejected
by a central black hole that we can't

well look on this side and that will be
the side that I'll focus on in this talk

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750
 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.390
so the topics that I'll this discuss

so the topics that I'll this discuss
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.749
so the topics that I'll this discuss
today are several I'll start with

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
today are several I'll start with
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.810
today are several I'll start with
imaging black holes silhouettes the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
imaging black holes silhouettes the
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.990
imaging black holes silhouettes the
black hole itself is a dark region it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
black hole itself is a dark region it
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179
black hole itself is a dark region it
doesn't emit any light but material

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
doesn't emit any light but material
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.980
doesn't emit any light but material
around it emits light and it that the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
around it emits light and it that the
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870
around it emits light and it that the
black hole casts a shadow and I'll

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
black hole casts a shadow and I'll
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.300
black hole casts a shadow and I'll
discuss it we have the technology

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
discuss it we have the technology
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.050
discuss it we have the technology
actually to image that shadow and then

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
actually to image that shadow and then
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.050
actually to image that shadow and then
talk about pairs of black holes black

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
talk about pairs of black holes black
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.020
talk about pairs of black holes black
hole binaries just like with humans when

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
hole binaries just like with humans when
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999
hole binaries just like with humans when
you put two black holes together they

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
you put two black holes together they
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.600
you put two black holes together they
form a binary system that is stable if

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
form a binary system that is stable if
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520
form a binary system that is stable if
you put a third one it's unstable

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
you put a third one it's unstable
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.240
you put a third one it's unstable
just like with humans again and then

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
just like with humans again and then
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.880
just like with humans again and then
I'll discuss the recoil of black holes

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
I'll discuss the recoil of black holes
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.059
I'll discuss the recoil of black holes
as a result of either a merger of a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
as a result of either a merger of a
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.820
as a result of either a merger of a
binary or a triple systems

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
binary or a triple systems

black holes kicking one of them at large
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.720
black holes kicking one of them at large
speeds then I'll discuss the fate of

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
speeds then I'll discuss the fate of
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.710
speeds then I'll discuss the fate of
stars near black holes in particular we

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
stars near black holes in particular we
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.330

wrote a couple of papers over the past

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
wrote a couple of papers over the past
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.440
wrote a couple of papers over the past
few months with a postdoc James will

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
few months with a postdoc James will
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.730
few months with a postdoc James will
adjourn about the possibility of

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
adjourn about the possibility of
 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.580
adjourn about the possibility of
accelerating stars like the Sun close to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590
accelerating stars like the Sun close to
 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.380
accelerating stars like the Sun close to
the speed of light which is quite

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390
the speed of light which is quite
 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.960
the speed of light which is quite
remarkable if you think about it and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
remarkable if you think about it and
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
remarkable if you think about it and
near black holes and the near a pair of

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
near black holes and the near a pair of
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.350
near black holes and the near a pair of
black holes and the pair of black holes

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360
black holes and the pair of black holes
 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.460
black holes and the pair of black holes
acts as a slingshot that ejects a star

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470
acts as a slingshot that ejects a star
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.170
acts as a slingshot that ejects a star
if a star gets too close to a black hole

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
if a star gets too close to a black hole
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.650
if a star gets too close to a black hole
it can be disrupted by the tide that is

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
it can be disrupted by the tide that is
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.170
it can be disrupted by the tide that is
raised on the star just like tides

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
raised on the star just like tides
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.310
raised on the star just like tides
raised raised by the moon are observed

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320
raised raised by the moon are observed
 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.980
raised raised by the moon are observed
in the oceans on earth when you get

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990
in the oceans on earth when you get
 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.199
in the oceans on earth when you get
close to a black hole the tide is so

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209
close to a black hole the tide is so
 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.300
close to a black hole the tide is so
strong that a star can be ripped apart

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310
strong that a star can be ripped apart
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.710
strong that a star can be ripped apart
and finally I'll discuss the possibility

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
and finally I'll discuss the possibility
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.600
and finally I'll discuss the possibility
that very small black holes may have

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610
that very small black holes may have
 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.150
that very small black holes may have
been produced in the Big Bang and in

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
been produced in the Big Bang and in
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.890
been produced in the Big Bang and in
principle they can account for the dark

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
principle they can account for the dark
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.320
principle they can account for the dark
matter in the universe whose nature we

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330
matter in the universe whose nature we
 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.190

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.080
years ago this is a special year during
which there are lots of conferences

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090
which there are lots of conferences
 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.550
which there are lots of conferences
celebrating the general theory of

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.160

do not have significant charges because

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.170
do not have significant charges because
 

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.430
do not have significant charges because
if it had a charge opposite charges will

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440
if it had a charge opposite charges will
 

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.810
if it had a charge opposite charges will
be immediately accrete onto it and

cancel each charge make make it neutral

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:57.100
cancel each charge make make it neutral
 

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.389
cancel each charge make make it neutral
so we actually have only two numbers and

00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399
so we actually have only two numbers and
 

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:01.350
so we actually have only two numbers and
the question is where does this

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360
the question is where does this
 

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.710
the question is where does this
information go and of course there is

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720
information go and of course there is
 

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.139
information go and of course there is
the process of Hawking evaporation where

00:12:07.139 --> 00:12:07.149
the process of Hawking evaporation where
 

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:09.449
the process of Hawking evaporation where
radiation is emitted from the black hole

00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:09.459
radiation is emitted from the black hole
 

00:12:09.459 --> 00:12:11.759
radiation is emitted from the black hole
so perhaps that carries some of the

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:11.769
so perhaps that carries some of the
 

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:14.660
so perhaps that carries some of the
information but recent studies of that

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:14.670
information but recent studies of that
 

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.120
information but recent studies of that
process say that no it's actually not

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:18.130
process say that no it's actually not
 

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.990
process say that no it's actually not
there so this is an unresolved the

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000
there so this is an unresolved the
 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.139
there so this is an unresolved the
puzzle in fundamental physics the

00:12:25.139 --> 00:12:25.149
puzzle in fundamental physics the
 

00:12:25.149 --> 00:12:28.110
puzzle in fundamental physics the
information paradox there is also the

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120
information paradox there is also the
 

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.120
information paradox there is also the
breakdown of general relativity at the

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.130
breakdown of general relativity at the
 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.180
breakdown of general relativity at the
singularity that I spoke about before so

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:32.190
singularity that I spoke about before so
 

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.019
singularity that I spoke about before so
clearly black holes are good

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:34.029

that has nothing to do with the first

that has nothing to do with the first
 

00:29:29.399 --> 00:29:32.629
that has nothing to do with the first
one is that when you look at Sagittarius

00:29:32.629 --> 00:29:32.639

which is blurring the image scattering

which is blurring the image scattering
 

00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:44.779
which is blurring the image scattering
the radio waves and it turns out that

this blurring becomes insignificant

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:49.460
this blurring becomes insignificant

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:11.730
wrote with John Wheeler
 

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.960
wrote with John Wheeler
on imaging black holes and the student

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:14.970
on imaging black holes and the student
 

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.610
on imaging black holes and the student
concluded that it's not feasible and

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:16.620
concluded that it's not feasible and
 

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.040
concluded that it's not feasible and
then moved to work in a different sub on

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:19.050
then moved to work in a different sub on
 

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.040
then moved to work in a different sub on
a different field he is now a professor

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:22.050
a different field he is now a professor
 

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.040
a different field he is now a professor
at UC Davis and I actually contacted him

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.050
at UC Davis and I actually contacted him
 

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.780
at UC Davis and I actually contacted him
and I said said to him that it was the

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:26.790
and I said said to him that it was the
 

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.520
and I said said to him that it was the
wrong move because we can actually do it

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:28.530
wrong move because we can actually do it
 

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:35.590
wrong move because we can actually do it
now but it's too late I guess and so

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600
now but it's too late I guess and so
 

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.060
now but it's too late I guess and so
these are images of the shadow of

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:38.070
these are images of the shadow of
 

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.670
these are images of the shadow of
Sagittarius a star at different

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:40.680
Sagittarius a star at different
 

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.220
Sagittarius a star at different
frequencies of radiation the higher the

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:43.230
frequencies of radiation the higher the
 

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.920
frequencies of radiation the higher the
frequency or the shorter the wavelength

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:44.930
frequency or the shorter the wavelength
 

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.330
frequency or the shorter the wavelength
the less blaring you get by the

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340
the less blaring you get by the
 

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.420
the less blaring you get by the
interstellar medium and also the less

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:50.430
interstellar medium and also the less
 

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:53.030
interstellar medium and also the less
absorption you get by the material next

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:53.040
absorption you get by the material next
 

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.010
absorption you get by the material next
to the black holes you get sharper

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020
to the black holes you get sharper
 

00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:01.370
to the black holes you get sharper
images and the way to construct a

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380
images and the way to construct a
 

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.560
images and the way to construct a
telescope as big as the earth is to have

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:03.570
telescope as big as the earth is to have
 

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.810
telescope as big as the earth is to have
stations distributed around the earth

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820
stations distributed around the earth
 

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.720
stations distributed around the earth
and here you see the view of the earth

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:08.730
and here you see the view of the earth
 

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:10.760
and here you see the view of the earth
from the direction of Sagittarius a star

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:10.770
from the direction of Sagittarius a star
 

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.250
from the direction of Sagittarius a star
so if you were to sit on such a star and

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260
so if you were to sit on such a star and
 

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.520
so if you were to sit on such a star and
look at the earth this is what we would

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:16.530
look at the earth this is what we would
 

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:19.700
look at the earth this is what we would
see and you see here a number of

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:19.710
see and you see here a number of
 

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:23.620
see and you see here a number of
millimeter observatories that can detect

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:23.630
millimeter observatories that can detect
 

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.550

radiation at a wavelength of one

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:25.560
radiation at a wavelength of one
 

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.460
radiation at a wavelength of one
millimeter and if you were to measure

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:28.470
millimeter and if you were to measure
 

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.400
millimeter and if you were to measure
not just the amplitude of the

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.410
not just the amplitude of the
 

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.110
not just the amplitude of the
electromagnetic wave that arrives at

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120
electromagnetic wave that arrives at
 

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.940
electromagnetic wave that arrives at
these stations but also the phase you

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:34.950
these stations but also the phase you
 

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.180
these stations but also the phase you
can correlate the arrival phase of the

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:38.190
can correlate the arrival phase of the
 

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.360
can correlate the arrival phase of the
wave and in principle if you have a

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:41.370
wave and in principle if you have a
 

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.130

large enough number of stations you can

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:43.140
large enough number of stations you can
 

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.370
large enough number of stations you can
produce an image with a resolution on

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:06.390
the two cores but we believe that such
cores of galaxies spiral

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400
cores of galaxies spiral
 

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.980
cores of galaxies spiral
towards each other because of friction

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:07.990
towards each other because of friction
 

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.569
towards each other because of friction
gravitational friction dynamical

00:40:09.569 --> 00:40:09.579
gravitational friction dynamical
 

00:40:09.579 --> 00:40:10.940
gravitational friction dynamical
friction on the background matter

00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:10.950
friction on the background matter
 

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.920
friction on the background matter
background stars and gas and eventually

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:13.930
background stars and gas and eventually
 

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.140
background stars and gas and eventually
the black hole themselves get very close

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:16.150
the black hole themselves get very close
 

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:19.559
the black hole themselves get very close
to each other after the stars

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:19.569
to each other after the stars
 

00:40:19.569 --> 00:40:22.410
to each other after the stars
surrounding them gets stripped and then

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:22.420
surrounding them gets stripped and then
 

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.359
surrounding them gets stripped and then
eventually they come together due to the

00:40:24.359 --> 00:40:24.369
eventually they come together due to the
 

00:40:24.369 --> 00:40:28.140
eventually they come together due to the
emission of gravitational radiation so

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:28.150
emission of gravitational radiation so
 

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.410
emission of gravitational radiation so
here you see two black holes close to

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:31.420
here you see two black holes close to
 

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.589
here you see two black holes close to
each other in x-rays so this is a galaxy

00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599
each other in x-rays so this is a galaxy
 

00:40:34.599 --> 00:40:36.240
each other in x-rays so this is a galaxy
that has a lot of dust you can't see

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:36.250
that has a lot of dust you can't see
 

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.690
that has a lot of dust you can't see
much through the dust but in x-rays just

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:39.700
much through the dust but in x-rays just
 

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.720
much through the dust but in x-rays just
like in the airport you can actually

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:42.730
like in the airport you can actually
 

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.569
like in the airport you can actually
image the center of this galaxy and tell

00:40:45.569 --> 00:40:45.579
image the center of this galaxy and tell
 

00:40:45.579 --> 00:40:47.700
image the center of this galaxy and tell
that there are two centers of light and

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:47.710
that there are two centers of light and
 

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:51.089
that there are two centers of light and
here you see a double black hole system

00:40:51.089 --> 00:40:51.099
here you see a double black hole system
 

00:40:51.099 --> 00:40:54.870
here you see a double black hole system
in the radio and these black holes emit

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880
in the radio and these black holes emit
 

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:59.630
in the radio and these black holes emit
jets so you can see two jets coming off

00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640
jets so you can see two jets coming off
 

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.849
jets so you can see two jets coming off
here is another example there are plenty

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:02.859
here is another example there are plenty
 

00:41:02.859 --> 00:41:06.269
here is another example there are plenty
of examples this is the tightest black

00:41:06.269 --> 00:41:06.279
of examples this is the tightest black
 

00:41:06.279 --> 00:41:07.769
of examples this is the tightest black
hole observed in the radio the

00:41:07.769 --> 00:41:07.779

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.059
separation is around 20 light-years and
the total mass is estimated of the two

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:15.069
the total mass is estimated of the two
 

00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:16.589
the total mass is estimated of the two
black holes is estimated to be about a

00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599
black holes is estimated to be about a
 

00:41:16.599 --> 00:41:18.690
black holes is estimated to be about a
billion times bigger than the mass of

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:18.700
billion times bigger than the mass of
 

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:25.740
billion times bigger than the mass of
the Sun so one way to tell that the

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:25.750
the Sun so one way to tell that the
 

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.760

where I argued that in principle you can

00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359
where I argued that in principle you can
 

00:41:40.359 --> 00:41:42.289
where I argued that in principle you can
find these binaries by looking for

find these binaries by looking for
 

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:45.690
find these binaries by looking for
periodic modulation of the light and if

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:45.700
periodic modulation of the light and if
 

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.819
periodic modulation of the light and if
you ask what would be the characteristic

00:41:47.819 --> 00:41:47.829
you ask what would be the characteristic
 

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:49.950
you ask what would be the characteristic
period when for example gravitational

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960

bringing these two black holes together

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:55.950
bringing these two black holes together
 

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.470

compared for example to the friction on
 

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.200
compared for example to the friction on
the surrounding gas then you find that

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.210
the surrounding gas then you find that
 

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.390
the surrounding gas then you find that

but it's indicative when more data is

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.050
but it's indicative when more data is
 

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.960
but it's indicative when more data is
needed to figure out if indeed this is a

you don't have to stop at two black

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:07.840
you don't have to stop at two black
 

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.960
you don't have to stop at two black
holes as I mentioned even among humans

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:09.970
holes as I mentioned even among humans
 

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:14.130
holes as I mentioned even among humans
there are triple systems and that can

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:14.140
there are triple systems and that can
 

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:15.630
there are triple systems and that can
happen for example if two black holes

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:15.640
happen for example if two black holes
 

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.970
happen for example if two black holes
are in the process of coming together

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:17.980
are in the process of coming together
 

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:21.630
are in the process of coming together
and then another galaxy comes in and

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640
and then another galaxy comes in and
 

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:25.050
and then another galaxy comes in and
joins the party and then you can get

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:25.060
joins the party and then you can get
 

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:29.970
joins the party and then you can get
three black hole systems and we

00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:29.980
three black hole systems and we
 

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:36.030
three black hole systems and we
calculated in some papers with Jewish

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.040
calculated in some papers with Jewish
 

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.720
calculated in some papers with Jewish
Kulkarni and Loren Hoffman the

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:39.730
Kulkarni and Loren Hoffman the
 

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.240
Kulkarni and Loren Hoffman the
likelihood of getting such triple

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:42.250
likelihood of getting such triple
 

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:45.740
likelihood of getting such triple
systems and we figured that in fact

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:45.750
systems and we figured that in fact
 

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.480
systems and we figured that in fact
these are unstable and and one of the

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:48.490
these are unstable and and one of the
 

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:51.240
these are unstable and and one of the
black holes gets gets ejected with

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:51.250
black holes gets gets ejected with
 

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:53.820
black holes gets gets ejected with
speeds that can exceed a few thousand

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:53.830
speeds that can exceed a few thousand
 

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:55.490
speeds that can exceed a few thousand
kilometers per second

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500
kilometers per second
 

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:01.260
kilometers per second
so in principle such a speed would imply

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.270
so in principle such a speed would imply
 

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:03.330
so in principle such a speed would imply
that the black hole crosses the diameter

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:03.340
that the black hole crosses the diameter
 

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.790
that the black hole crosses the diameter
of the earth in a few seconds okay so

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800
of the earth in a few seconds okay so
 

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.710
of the earth in a few seconds okay so
these are very high speeds and such

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720
these are very high speeds and such
 

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.220
these are very high speeds and such

black holes with escape from their host
 

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:18.240
black holes with escape from their host
galaxies so you can find these ejected

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.250
galaxies so you can find these ejected
 

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.760
galaxies so you can find these ejected
black holes in the intergalactic medium

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:22.770
 

00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:26.640
no in fact the most common cases are

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:26.650
no in fact the most common cases are
 

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.980
no in fact the most common cases are
once in which you have the third body

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:28.990
once in which you have the third body
 

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:32.040
once in which you have the third body
being less massive because or two of

more of those than massive black holes

more of those than massive black holes
 

00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:40.609
more of those than massive black holes
here we see a pair of black holes coming

00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619
here we see a pair of black holes coming
 

00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:41.719
here we see a pair of black holes coming
together by the emission of

00:44:44.189 --> 00:44:47.499
gravitational radiation and this problem
was very challenging to solve

00:44:47.499 --> 00:44:47.509
was very challenging to solve
 

00:44:47.509 --> 00:44:50.739
was very challenging to solve
numerically with computer codes until

00:44:50.739 --> 00:44:50.749
numerically with computer codes until
 

00:44:50.749 --> 00:44:54.049

about five years ago where a

in full and calculate the emission of
 

00:45:08.849 --> 00:45:10.759
in full and calculate the emission of
gravitational waves and that's what you

00:45:10.759 --> 00:45:10.769

00:45:10.769 --> 00:45:13.069

saw here now it turns out that when the

00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079
saw here now it turns out that when the
 

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:14.870

they get to the east core the inner most

00:45:17.509 --> 00:45:17.519
they get to the east core the inner most
 

00:45:17.519 --> 00:45:20.150
they get to the east core the inner most
stable circular orbit and then the small

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160
stable circular orbit and then the small
 

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.239

black hole plunges into the big black

00:45:23.239 --> 00:45:23.249
black hole plunges into the big black
 

00:45:23.249 --> 00:45:23.660

so the gravitation waves are emitted in

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:25.650
so the gravitation waves are emitted in
 

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.769
so the gravitation waves are emitted in
a preferred direction and by

00:45:27.769 --> 00:45:27.779
a preferred direction and by
 

00:45:27.779 --> 00:45:30.140
a preferred direction and by
conservation of momentum there is a

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:30.150

direction and what you saw on the right

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.289

hand side is that the kicked black hole

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:42.299

the recoiled black hole could in

00:45:44.179 --> 00:45:44.189
the recoiled black hole could in
 

00:45:44.189 --> 00:45:46.579
the recoiled black hole could in
principle escape from the host galaxies

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:46.589
principle escape from the host galaxies
 

00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:48.650

and so these numerical simulations were

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:48.660
and so these numerical simulations were
 

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.209
and so these numerical simulations were
able to calculate what is the recoil

00:45:50.209 --> 00:45:50.219
able to calculate what is the recoil
 

00:45:50.219 --> 00:45:53.259
able to calculate what is the recoil
speed and we incorporated that into

00:45:53.259 --> 00:45:53.269

00:45:53.269 --> 00:45:56.029

could find recoil black holes moving out

00:46:02.929 --> 00:46:02.939
could find recoil black holes moving out
 

00:46:02.939 --> 00:46:04.549
could find recoil black holes moving out
of galaxies just due to the

so that's the convenient coincidence
that the orbital rise of the earth

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:53.230
binary system in fact will coalesce
 

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.490
binary system in fact will coalesce
within 10 wave period so if you catch it

00:52:56.490 --> 00:52:56.500
within 10 wave period so if you catch it
 

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:59.190
within 10 wave period so if you catch it
it's very close to coalescing in and the

00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200
it's very close to coalescing in and the
 

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.170
it's very close to coalescing in and the
period the wave period will change with

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:01.180
period the wave period will change with
 

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.930
period the wave period will change with
time there is this chirp that makes the

time there is this chirp that makes the
 

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.720
time there is this chirp that makes the

period get shorter and shorter as the
 

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.720
period get shorter and shorter as the
two black holes get closer and closer so

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:09.730
two black holes get closer and closer so
 

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.970
two black holes get closer and closer so
you can actually not only infer the mass

you can actually not only infer the mass
 

00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.859
you can actually not only infer the mass
of the system but also the distance

00:53:13.859 --> 00:53:13.869
of the system but also the distance
 

00:53:13.869 --> 00:53:16.319
of the system but also the distance
because you have two equations one

telling you how to hear the wave period
or the wave frequency changes with time

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:21.430
or the wave frequency changes with time
 

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.099
or the wave frequency changes with time
and the other one telling you what the

and the other one telling you what the

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:27.340
wave amplitude is and you can constrain
 

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:33.510
wave amplitude is and you can constrain
the mass and the distance from this now

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520
the mass and the distance from this now
 

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.820
the mass and the distance from this now
when two black holes come together and

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:35.830
when two black holes come together and
 

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:39.510
when two black holes come together and
one of them gets recoiled that means

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520
one of them gets recoiled that means
 

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.700
one of them gets recoiled that means
that black hole can get ejected from the

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:41.710
that black hole can get ejected from the
 

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:44.160
that black hole can get ejected from the
host galaxy so there is actually an

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.170
host galaxy so there is actually an
 

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:46.350
host galaxy so there is actually an
interesting prediction that one can make

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:46.360
interesting prediction that one can make
 

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:49.890
interesting prediction that one can make
the Milky Way galaxy was made out of

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:49.900
the Milky Way galaxy was made out of
 

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:52.260
the Milky Way galaxy was made out of
building blocks early on in the universe

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:52.270
building blocks early on in the universe
 

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:54.630
building blocks early on in the universe
there were smaller galaxies dwarf

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640
there were smaller galaxies dwarf
 

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.570
there were smaller galaxies dwarf
galaxies that came together to make the

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:57.580
galaxies that came together to make the
 

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.990
galaxies that came together to make the
Milky Way galaxy so the earlier

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000
Milky Way galaxy so the earlier
 

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:02.880
Milky Way galaxy so the earlier
generations of galaxies were smaller

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:02.890
generations of galaxies were smaller
 

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:05.490
generations of galaxies were smaller
than the present-day galaxies that we

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:05.500
than the present-day galaxies that we
 

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.220
than the present-day galaxies that we
have and so you can imagine that

00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:08.230
have and so you can imagine that
 

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:10.290
have and so you can imagine that
whenever two dwarf galaxies came

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:10.300
whenever two dwarf galaxies came
 

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.780
whenever two dwarf galaxies came
together the two black holes at their

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:12.790
together the two black holes at their
 

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:16.910
together the two black holes at their
centers joined and due to a

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920
centers joined and due to a
 

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.450
centers joined and due to a
gravitational wave emission the merger

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:21.460
gravitational wave emission the merger
 

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.850
gravitational wave emission the merger
remnant got recoiled now the

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:23.860
remnant got recoiled now the

dwarf galaxies is relatively shallow

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:28.750
dwarf galaxies is relatively shallow
 

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.260
dwarf galaxies is relatively shallow
much shallower than that of the Milky

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:31.270
much shallower than that of the Milky
 

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:33.300
much shallower than that of the Milky
Way it's usually it corresponds to

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:33.310
Way it's usually it corresponds to
 

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.210
Way it's usually it corresponds to
speeds of all the 10 km/s whereas the

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:36.220
speeds of all the 10 km/s whereas the
 

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:40.290
speeds of all the 10 km/s whereas the
Milky Way has a potential well of 200

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:40.300
Milky Way has a potential well of 200
 

00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:43.080
Milky Way has a potential well of 200
kilometers per second so the black holes

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:43.090
kilometers per second so the black holes
 

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.390
kilometers per second so the black holes
typically get ejected with the speed of

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:45.400
typically get ejected with the speed of
 

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:47.460
typically get ejected with the speed of
order a few hundred kilometers per

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:47.470
order a few hundred kilometers per
 

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:50.910
order a few hundred kilometers per
second or less and so such black holes

00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920
second or less and so such black holes
 

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.430
second or less and so such black holes
would get expelled from the host warf

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440
would get expelled from the host warf
 

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.530
would get expelled from the host warf
galaxies but they would still remain

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:55.540
galaxies but they would still remain
 

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.630
galaxies but they would still remain
bound to the region that eventually

bound to the region that eventually
 

00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:00.330
bound to the region that eventually
makes the Milky Way and so what you

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:00.340
makes the Milky Way and so what you
 

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:02.460
makes the Milky Way and so what you
would end up with are floating black

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:02.470
would end up with are floating black
 

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:04.950
would end up with are floating black

these compact star clusters and we
 

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:28.890
these compact star clusters and we
looked at the survey of the sky called

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:28.900
looked at the survey of the sky called
 

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:31.470
looked at the survey of the sky called
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and found

the secondary black hole for example
 

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.370
the secondary black hole for example
gets very close to the primary black

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:03.380
gets very close to the primary black
 

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.609

slingshots and they eject the star
 

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:20.410
slingshots and they eject the star
gravitationally then you can end up with

then their velocity would be degraded or

think of it is that in quantum mechanics

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:35.800
think of it is that in quantum mechanics
 

00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:38.580
think of it is that in quantum mechanics
every particle has a debroglie

00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:38.590
every particle has a debroglie
 

00:59:38.590 --> 00:59:42.660
every particle has a debroglie
wavelength and the de Broglie wavelength

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:42.670
wavelength and the de Broglie wavelength
 

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:43.890
wavelength and the de Broglie wavelength
of a particle is just like the

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:43.900
of a particle is just like the
 

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.700

a massive particle could be a star or

00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:52.810
a massive particle could be a star or

a massive particle could be a star or
anything that the broadly wavelength

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:56.140
anything that the broadly wavelength

anything that the broadly wavelength
scales like one over the momentum or one

00:59:58.740 --> 00:59:58.750
scales like one over the momentum or one
 

00:59:58.750 --> 01:00:00.870
scales like one over the momentum or one
over the velocity and it's being

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880
over the velocity and it's being
 

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.640
over the velocity and it's being
stretched like the scale factor so

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:02.650
stretched like the scale factor so
 

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.810
stretched like the scale factor so
therefore the velocity is reduced

01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:05.820
therefore the velocity is reduced
 

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.270
therefore the velocity is reduced

inversely with
 

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.650
inversely with
scale factor and that's indifference

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:11.660
scale factor and that's indifference
 

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.720

from photons where the velocity speed of

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:13.730
from photons where the velocity speed of
 

01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:16.390
from photons where the velocity speed of
light is constant so you get a different

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400
light is constant so you get a different
 

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.580
light is constant so you get a different
relation between distance and travel

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:18.590
relation between distance and travel
 

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.580
relation between distance and travel
time then you get four photons and and

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:21.590
time then you get four photons and and
 

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:24.940
time then you get four photons and and
you get a change also in the brightness

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:24.950
you get a change also in the brightness
 

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:28.410
you get a change also in the brightness
of the star due to relativistic beaming

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:28.420
of the star due to relativistic beaming
 

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:32.320
of the star due to relativistic beaming
and a star could get deflected by an

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:32.330
and a star could get deflected by an
 

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.030
and a star could get deflected by an
intervening galaxy due to the

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:34.040
intervening galaxy due to the
 

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:37.690
intervening galaxy due to the
gravitational effect of that galaxy the

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:37.700
gravitational effect of that galaxy the
 

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.100
gravitational effect of that galaxy the
effect is similar to gravitational

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:39.110
effect is similar to gravitational
 

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:42.280

lensing and so we calculated those

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:42.290
lensing and so we calculated those
 

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:44.860
lensing and so we calculated those
effects and you can find them in our

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:44.870

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.430
chance of the of the stream intersecting
itself is actually larger than if the

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440
itself is actually larger than if the
 

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.820
itself is actually larger than if the
string the stream was pro-grade moving

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:12.830
string the stream was pro-grade moving
 

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.320

in the same direction as the spin of the

in the same direction as the spin of the
 

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:16.900
in the same direction as the spin of the
black hole and so you see the stream

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:16.910
black hole and so you see the stream
 

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:19.120

intersecting the stream of gas this is

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:19.130
intersecting the stream of gas this is
 

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:21.190
intersecting the stream of gas this is
the XY projection this is the

the XY projection this is the
y'see projection of the same process and

y'see projection of the same process and
 

01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:25.810
y'see projection of the same process and
eventually the material intersects

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:25.820
eventually the material intersects
 

01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:28.420
eventually the material intersects
itself and makes an accretion disk

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:28.430
itself and makes an accretion disk
 

01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:31.120
itself and makes an accretion disk
around the black hole now this is the

around the black hole now this is the
 

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:33.400

case where the gas is cooling very
 

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.319
case where the gas is cooling very
efficiently so the stream becomes very

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:35.329

of this process if you allow the gas to

of this process if you allow the gas to
cool very efficiently the situation is

the stream becomes very thick because it

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:56.210
the stream becomes very thick because it
 

01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:57.819
the stream becomes very thick because it
heats up due to the stream stream

01:02:57.819 --> 01:02:57.829
heats up due to the stream stream
 

01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:00.460

collisions and then you make a torus of

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:00.470
collisions and then you make a torus of
 

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.680

disruption rate could be enhanced if the
 

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.300

black hole has a recoil for example when

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:16.310
black hole has a recoil for example when
 

01:03:16.310 --> 01:03:18.790
black hole has a recoil for example when
two black holes come together the would

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:18.800
two black holes come together the would
 

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.530
two black holes come together the would
be gravitational wave emission and after

that the black hole will be kicked and
then it will see fresh material that it

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:26.150
then it will see fresh material that it
 

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:27.849
then it will see fresh material that it
can eat along the line of sight so it

01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:27.859
can eat along the line of sight so it
 

01:03:27.859 --> 01:03:30.880
can eat along the line of sight so it
can actually capture stars along the

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.849
can actually capture stars along the
path of the recoil and produce many more

hundred years in such a case you can get
 

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:43.059
hundred years in such a case you can get
a disruption of a star so there is a

01:03:43.059 --> 01:03:43.069
a disruption of a star so there is a
 

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.579

about the jet is whether the jet will be

about the jet is whether the jet will be

then the question is where will the jet

we can rule out the possibility that

01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.150
we can rule out the possibility that

there is precession of a jet around the

there is precession of a jet around the

there is precession of a jet around the
black hole spin axis and the most likely

01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:03.349
black hole spin axis and the most likely
 

01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:05.440
black hole spin axis and the most likely
situation is that in fact the jet was

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:05.450
situation is that in fact the jet was
 

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:10.420
situation is that in fact the jet was
aligned with a black hole spin so that's

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:10.430
aligned with a black hole spin so that's
 

01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.969

all the black holes with masses less
 

01:06:03.979 --> 01:06:06.789
all the black holes with masses less
than an asteroid mass but black holes

01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799
than an asteroid mass but black holes
 

01:06:06.799 --> 01:06:09.309
than an asteroid mass but black holes
with masses more than 10 to the 15 grams

01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319
with masses more than 10 to the 15 grams
 

01:06:09.319 --> 01:06:11.559
with masses more than 10 to the 15 grams
more than the size of an asteroid and

01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:11.569
more than the size of an asteroid and
 

01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:14.589
more than the size of an asteroid and
the mass of an asteroid have an

01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599
the mass of an asteroid have an
 

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:16.299
the mass of an asteroid have an
evaporation time that is longer than the

01:06:16.299 --> 01:06:16.309
evaporation time that is longer than the
 

01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:18.609
evaporation time that is longer than the
age of the universe so they should still

01:06:18.609 --> 01:06:18.619
age of the universe so they should still
 

01:06:18.619 --> 01:06:21.609
age of the universe so they should still
be around if they existed and

01:06:21.609 --> 01:06:21.619
be around if they existed and
 

01:06:21.619 --> 01:06:23.739
be around if they existed and
interestingly enough such a black hole

01:06:23.739 --> 01:06:23.749
interestingly enough such a black hole
 

01:06:23.749 --> 01:06:26.079
interestingly enough such a black hole
that has an asteroid mass has the size

01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:26.089
that has an asteroid mass has the size
 

01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:28.749
that has an asteroid mass has the size
the Schwarzschild radius of the size of

the Schwarzschild radius of the size of
 

01:06:28.759 --> 01:06:31.599
the Schwarzschild radius of the size of
a proton ten to the minus thirteen

a proton ten to the minus thirteen
 

01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:34.120
a proton ten to the minus thirteen
centimeters so if such a black hole

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:34.130
centimeters so if such a black hole
 

01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:37.239
centimeters so if such a black hole
passes through a proton it will

01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:37.249
passes through a proton it will
 

01:06:37.249 --> 01:06:41.019
passes through a proton it will
disintegrate the proton into quarks just

01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:41.029
disintegrate the proton into quarks just
 

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:44.609
disintegrate the proton into quarks just
due to gravity that's quite remarkable

01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:44.619
due to gravity that's quite remarkable
 

01:06:44.619 --> 01:06:46.959
due to gravity that's quite remarkable
so just like I was talking before about

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:46.969
so just like I was talking before about
 

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:48.440
so just like I was talking before about
destroying star

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:48.450
destroying star
 

01:06:48.450 --> 01:06:50.510
destroying star
here we are talking about destroying a

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520
here we are talking about destroying a
 

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.750
here we are talking about destroying a
proton with a black hole passing through

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760
proton with a black hole passing through
 

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.470
proton with a black hole passing through
it due to the gravitational tide and a

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480
it due to the gravitational tide and a
 

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.630
it due to the gravitational tide and a
surgical passage of such low mass

01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640
surgical passage of such low mass
 

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.599
surgical passage of such low mass
primordial black holes through the earth

01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:01.609
primordial black holes through the earth
 

01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:05.089
primordial black holes through the earth
is difficult to detect because the only

01:07:05.089 --> 01:07:05.099
is difficult to detect because the only
 

01:07:05.099 --> 01:07:10.370
is difficult to detect because the only
thing it does is excite seismic waves so

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380
thing it does is excite seismic waves so
 

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.020
thing it does is excite seismic waves so
the question is is the dark matter made

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:12.030
the question is is the dark matter made
 

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.150
the question is is the dark matter made
of such black holes could it be

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160
of such black holes could it be
 

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.370
of such black holes could it be
primordial black holes and we wrote a

01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380
primordial black holes and we wrote a
 

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.800
primordial black holes and we wrote a
couple of papers with a postdoc that

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:18.810
couple of papers with a postdoc that
 

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.470
couple of papers with a postdoc that
worked with me Paula pani were ruled out

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480
worked with me Paula pani were ruled out
 

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.870
worked with me Paula pani were ruled out
the possibility that the dark matter is

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880
the possibility that the dark matter is
 

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.210
the possibility that the dark matter is
made of such black holes and the first

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:26.220
made of such black holes and the first
 

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:29.030
made of such black holes and the first
part of the argument had to do with

01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:29.040
part of the argument had to do with
 

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.890
part of the argument had to do with
black holes with a mass between the mass

01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900
black holes with a mass between the mass
 

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.380
black holes with a mass between the mass
of the moon and the mass of the Sun okay

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:33.390
of the moon and the mass of the Sun okay
 

01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:36.380
of the moon and the mass of the Sun okay
and it turns out that if you take a

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:36.390
and it turns out that if you take a
 

01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:39.380
and it turns out that if you take a
black hole and surround it with a mirror

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:39.390
black hole and surround it with a mirror
 

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.870
black hole and surround it with a mirror
and this was argued back in the 70s you

01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880
and this was argued back in the 70s you
 

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.900
and this was argued back in the 70s you
take a black hole put a mirror around it

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:44.910
take a black hole put a mirror around it
 

01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:48.530
take a black hole put a mirror around it
a reflecting mirror and let radiation

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:48.540
a reflecting mirror and let radiation
 

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.569
a reflecting mirror and let radiation
bounce back and forth if the black hole

01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579
bounce back and forth if the black hole
 

01:07:50.579 --> 01:07:55.309
bounce back and forth if the black hole
has spin it will turn it turns out that

01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319
has spin it will turn it turns out that
 

01:07:55.319 --> 01:07:58.010
has spin it will turn it turns out that
the spin energy of the black hole can be

01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:58.020
the spin energy of the black hole can be
 

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.890
the spin energy of the black hole can be
converted into low-frequency

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900
converted into low-frequency
 

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.450
converted into low-frequency
electromagnetic radiation with a

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460

frequency comparable or lower than the
 

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.710
frequency comparable or lower than the
spin frequency of the black hole and you

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720
spin frequency of the black hole and you
 

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.710
spin frequency of the black hole and you
get a black hole bomb because the the

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720
get a black hole bomb because the the
 

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:15.740
get a black hole bomb because the the
black hole radiates these waves they

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:15.750
black hole radiates these waves they
 

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.120
black hole radiates these waves they
bounce off the mirror

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:17.130
bounce off the mirror
 

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.430
bounce off the mirror
come back just like in a laser they

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440
come back just like in a laser they
 

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.709
come back just like in a laser they
bounce back and forth between the mirror

01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719
bounce back and forth between the mirror
 

01:08:21.719 --> 01:08:23.059
bounce back and forth between the mirror
and the black hole and they get

01:08:23.059 --> 01:08:23.069
and the black hole and they get
 

01:08:23.069 --> 01:08:25.880
and the black hole and they get
amplified every time and so you build up

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:25.890
amplified every time and so you build up
 

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:29.140
amplified every time and so you build up
an energy density inside this cavity

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:29.150
an energy density inside this cavity
 

01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:31.910
an energy density inside this cavity
spherical cavity such that eventually

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920
spherical cavity such that eventually
 

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:34.220
spherical cavity such that eventually
you'll get an explosion all you need to

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:34.230
you'll get an explosion all you need to
 

01:08:34.230 --> 01:08:37.990
you'll get an explosion all you need to
do is surround a black hole with mirrors

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:38.000
do is surround a black hole with mirrors
 

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.019
do is surround a black hole with mirrors
so is that at all just an academic

01:08:42.019 --> 01:08:42.029
so is that at all just an academic
 

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:44.090
so is that at all just an academic
exercise well for decades people thought

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:44.100
exercise well for decades people thought
 

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.979
exercise well for decades people thought
but but then it occurred to me that in

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:45.989
but but then it occurred to me that in
 

01:08:45.989 --> 01:08:48.050
but but then it occurred to me that in
fact in the early universe you know if

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060
fact in the early universe you know if
 

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.459
fact in the early universe you know if
you look at these primordial black holes

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:49.469
you look at these primordial black holes
 

01:08:49.469 --> 01:08:51.490
you look at these primordial black holes
they were so much surrounded by a mirror

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:51.500
they were so much surrounded by a mirror
 

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:56.450
they were so much surrounded by a mirror
it's called plasma or ionized gas and it

01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:56.460
it's called plasma or ionized gas and it
 

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:58.099
it's called plasma or ionized gas and it
turns out that when you write the

01:08:58.099 --> 01:08:58.109
turns out that when you write the
 

01:08:58.109 --> 01:09:00.320
turns out that when you write the
dispersion relation for a photon in an

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:00.330
dispersion relation for a photon in an
 

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:02.269
dispersion relation for a photon in an
ionized gas in a plasma

01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279
ionized gas in a plasma
 

01:09:02.279 --> 01:09:04.579

you can think of it as a massive

01:09:04.579 --> 01:09:04.589
you can think of it as a massive
 

01:09:04.589 --> 01:09:08.359
you can think of it as a massive
particle the frequency squared is equal

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:08.369

01:09:08.369 --> 01:09:10.579
particle the frequency squared is equal
to the plasma frequency squared plus the

01:09:10.579 --> 01:09:10.589

the energy squared of a massive particle
 

01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:19.490
the energy squared of a massive particle
equal to its mass squared times the

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500

squared so in fact it's as if the photon

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:24.630
squared so in fact it's as if the photon
 

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:27.200

acquires a mass and if you think about

it how does the mirror operate when you
 

01:09:29.969 --> 01:09:31.669
it how does the mirror operate when you
look at the mirror you see your

reflection the reason you see a
 

01:09:32.909 --> 01:09:34.160
reflection the reason you see a
reflection is because the plasma

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:34.170
reflection is because the plasma
 

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.549

01:09:59.419 --> 01:09:59.429
smaller than the plasma frequency and
 

01:09:59.429 --> 01:10:00.410
smaller than the plasma frequency and
therefore the light gets reflected

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:00.420
therefore the light gets reflected
 

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.439
therefore the light gets reflected
that's what the mirror is so if you look

01:10:03.439 --> 01:10:03.449
that's what the mirror is so if you look
 

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:05.180
that's what the mirror is so if you look
at this primordial black holes and they

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:05.190
at this primordial black holes and they
 

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:07.040
at this primordial black holes and they
are surrounded by a dense enough plasma

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:07.050
are surrounded by a dense enough plasma
 

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:10.640
are surrounded by a dense enough plasma
in the early universe they will act that

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:10.650
in the early universe they will act that
 

01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:12.529
in the early universe they will act that
the plasma will act as a mirror and you

01:10:12.529 --> 01:10:12.539
the plasma will act as a mirror and you
 

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:14.810
the plasma will act as a mirror and you
can extract the spin energy of these

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820
can extract the spin energy of these
 

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:16.339
can extract the spin energy of these
primordial black holes it's very

01:10:16.339 --> 01:10:16.349
primordial black holes it's very
 

01:10:16.349 --> 01:10:18.379
primordial black holes it's very
difficult to imagine them being formed

01:10:18.379 --> 01:10:18.389
difficult to imagine them being formed
 

01:10:18.389 --> 01:10:20.149
difficult to imagine them being formed
without any spin they would likely be

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159
without any spin they would likely be
 

01:10:20.159 --> 01:10:21.919
without any spin they would likely be
formed with spin and you can extract

01:10:21.919 --> 01:10:21.929
formed with spin and you can extract
 

01:10:21.929 --> 01:10:25.910
formed with spin and you can extract
this energy and now as time goes on this

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920
this energy and now as time goes on this
 

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:28.819
this energy and now as time goes on this
mirror will eventually disappear because

01:10:28.819 --> 01:10:28.829
mirror will eventually disappear because
 

01:10:28.829 --> 01:10:31.040
mirror will eventually disappear because
the universe is expanding and the plasma

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:31.050
the universe is expanding and the plasma
 

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:32.450
the universe is expanding and the plasma
frequency will go down the density of

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460
frequency will go down the density of
 

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:35.510
frequency will go down the density of
matter would go down and so you will end

01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520
matter would go down and so you will end
 

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:37.580
matter would go down and so you will end
up with the energy that was stored

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:37.590
up with the energy that was stored
 

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:40.760
up with the energy that was stored
inside this cavity being dissipated into

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:40.770
inside this cavity being dissipated into
 

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:43.189
inside this cavity being dissipated into
the radiation field in the universe and

01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199
the radiation field in the universe and
 

01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:45.049
the radiation field in the universe and
so you can end up with the energy

01:10:45.049 --> 01:10:45.059
so you can end up with the energy
 

01:10:45.059 --> 01:10:46.520
so you can end up with the energy
distorting the Cosmic Microwave

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:46.530
distorting the Cosmic Microwave
 

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:49.939
distorting the Cosmic Microwave

Background and we have limits on that so
 

01:10:49.949 --> 01:10:51.979

by using those limits you can actually

01:10:51.979 --> 01:10:51.989
by using those limits you can actually
 

01:10:51.989 --> 01:10:54.470
by using those limits you can actually
rule out the possibility this is the

01:11:02.099 --> 01:11:03.979

the way up to the mass of the Sun or we
 

01:11:07.079 --> 01:11:09.680
the way up to the mass of the Sun or we
can rule out the possibility that

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:09.690

based on the fact that we haven't seen

argument then for lower mass black holes

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080

very dense star then it turns out that

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:45.550
very dense star then it turns out that
 

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:48.120
very dense star then it turns out that
it will excite modes inside the star and

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:48.130
it will excite modes inside the star and
 

01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:51.150
it will excite modes inside the star and
eventually get trapped and sink to the

eating up the neutron star so turns out

01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:56.860
eating up the neutron star so turns out
 

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.830

and so you can look for offset black

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080
and so you can look for offset black
 

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.410
