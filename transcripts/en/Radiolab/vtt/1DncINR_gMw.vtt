1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.790
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab tele opening little, hey,

2
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.130
there we go again. Oh, was it a little, no, it was fine. It was good.

3
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:09.440
It was good. It was good. I like that. I could bring it down. No, no, no, no.

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.970
We keep going. So we're talking about sports and games and emotions and uh,

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.140
we just did a thing on rules and creativity and now it's time to add yet another

6
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:19.070
element to the mix.

7
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.770
Cause what do you get if you put all those three things together, you get hurt.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.120
You get it. It, you do it. Say it. You're linearized here,

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.130
you'll get a story. Exactly.

10
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:32.330
Really Good Games are sort of story generating machines. For example,

11
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:33.710
here's Alison Gopnik again,

12
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:37.850
talking about a little teeny story that happens dozens of times a game in her

13
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:38.450
favorite sport.

14
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.130
One of the great moments in baseball is always that that ball is going out there

15
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:48.131
and the guys going out there with the glove and it might end up in the glove and

16
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:52.760
it might not, and he backs up against the stadium wall and

17
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.010
he gets it already doesn't. Um,

18
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.900
that wouldn't be nearly as much fun if he was just playing catch. Right.

19
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.130
That's a fantastic human drama.

20
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:09.020
So the question we want to explore now is what kind of drama do you want?

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.660
What kind of drama to you is most fantastic? Yeah. You want the, uh,

22
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.050
I think you want the headphones the other way around.

23
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.960
That's our producers siren. Wheeler has that. Yeah, something like that.

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.240
Who is out of the bathroom and it seems to have made a new friend.

25
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.090
So set that up. Who's that guy?

26
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.390
So that's a Dan Engber senior editor at slate magazine.

27
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.180
And I brought him into the studio because he told me about this thing that had

28
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:34.770
happened to them when I was watching the, um, NCAA tournament, the, the, uh,

29
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.400
the basketball men's college basketball tournament. This was just last year.

30
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.500
I don't know anything about college basketball. It said, you know, I,

31
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.480
I have two or three sports that I can pay attention to them.

32
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.330
People have one or two or zero, but college basketball isn't one of them,

33
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.080
but there's this tournament on every year. It's kind of exciting. So he watches.

34
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.810
Yeah. And what he does, since he doesn't really doesn't have any loyalties,

35
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.910
he doesn't know who to root for. Right. For me, he just kind of, by default,

36
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.550
I just pick whichever team has the lower seat

37
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.260
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

38
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.010
<v 0>whichever is the worst team. Why do you do that? I have no idea. And it,</v>

39
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.610
it came to a head when I showed up at a friend's house and they had the game

40
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:13.860
between Butler and Michigan State on,

41
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.740
it was a semi-finals and they were both seated number five.

42
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.270
So it's like you're a little system is right. I've,

43
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.080
I have no idea which team to root for it. So I just was,

44
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.490
I started rooting for whichever team was losing and it was a close game so

45
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.720
butler would make a run.

46
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.520
<v 3>Wow. Then Michigan comes back</v>

47
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220
nicer

48
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.220
<v 0>feeling sorry for butts.</v>

49
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.400
<v 3>Literally every time one would go up,</v>

50
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.050
he switched to the other,

51
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.770
<v 0>the certain point he's like, wait a second.</v>

52
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.880
This strategy guarantees that at the end of the game when the Buzzer goes,

53
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.650
I'll have been rooting for the team that lost. Right.

54
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.770
It actually created a situation where I'm guaranteed to be disappointed,

55
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.450
guaranteed to be disappointed.

56
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.840
So Dan decided to figure out like what the Hell is going on? Why?

57
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.870
Why would anyone do this to themselves? Is that,

58
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.210
is that something that's actually been studied? So there's,

59
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.620
there's a small group of psychologists that would be me and me who are

60
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.980
interested in this question. Underdogs tracked a couple of them down.

61
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.910
My name is Scott Alison and the Dove Goldschmidt to University of Richmond,

62
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.470
University of San Diego currently.

63
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.220
So they're these studies that are just sort of hilariously simple where you take

64
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:34.000
a bunch of undergrads and you put them in a room and we give them scenarios to

65
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.800
read like a paragraph of involving say two competing teams. Here's a, and it's,

66
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.310
there's almost no information. The teams don't even have names, they're just,

67
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:46.540
it's team a and team B. Team a is playing team B in a game.

68
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.370
You don't even have to tell them what sport team a is considered the better team

69
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.680
and it's more likely to win who you gonna root for them.

70
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.630
80% of the students choose the underdog team 80 yup. In fact,

71
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.300
a lot of times it comes out 90%. No, not a 10 yes.

72
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.910
In the absence of any reason to choose one or the other,

73
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.290
that's almost universal.

74
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.880
And you can do this study in all different ways and the answer always comes out

75
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:13.240
the same. You can describe it as two political figures, you know,

76
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:17.110
running for election. Or you can talk about two businesses, mom and pops,

77
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.180
electronic store against Walmart where you can talk about to landscape painters

78
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.880
who've painted pictures and are now trended landscape painters. Yes.

79
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.520
We gave participants a painting and half the participants were told this

80
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:33.610
painting was done by a successful established artists. You know,

81
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:38.380
so though who has a gallery show downtown and the other half of the participants

82
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:41.430
were told the same painting with done by a starving artist,

83
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.120
first-year arts student who's trying to make it in the art world who only has

84
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:46.860
one arm and yeah, exactly.

85
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.090
And people have this very strong bias in favor of the underdog painter.

86
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.650
So what else do we have? We got landscape painters, unnamed sports teams,

87
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:59.790
businesses, politics, politics, and my favorite shapes.

88
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.500
Shapes. Yeah. Um, what would an underdog shape be?

89
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.610
It's just a circle about an inch in diameter moving left to right across the

90
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:12.690
computer screen, moving up what could be a hill exactly.

91
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.090
As the circle moves up,

92
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.260
the circle slows down as it goes up the hill nudging up and then dropping back a

93
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.870
little bit and then nudging up and dropping back a little bit quivering. Yeah,

94
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.560
yeah, yeah.

95
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.560
And then along comes the second circle that has no trouble getting up that hill

96
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.750
cruises past this low poke circles zooms right past it. Sure enough,

97
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:39.930
people have a real preference in some way or another.

98
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.150
They're really rooting for circle B.

99
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.270
The struggler we get people emotionally reacting to a geometric shape when

100
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:51.660
they're sitting there. Are they like, come on, come on. You can do it. Yes.

101
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:53.920
Pulling forward, it's going to be like Rudy, you know, let's,

102
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:58.370
this is how deeply ingrained the underdog phenomenon in is in us at this point.

103
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:03.200
Like, my question is why, why, why on here? Exactly. Why do we do this? Well.

104
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.680
Um, well I, well, well I, I think that there,

105
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.650
there are two different approaches to, to, to that,

106
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.060
to that why question one of them is this kind of what they call an emotional

107
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:15.980
economics argument. And it goes like this.

108
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.430
If you know that you have an underdog and you have a top dog,

109
00:06:18.431 --> 00:06:21.730
so the top dog is expected to win, right?

110
00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:24.250
If you think of this like the way a gambler would think of it,

111
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.980
like if you go with the top dog, they're expected to win.

112
00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:29.290
So you're not going to get a big payout if they do win.

113
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:31.000
Minimal emotional payoff,

114
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.170
but you'll lose a lot if they lose meaning you won't feel too good if they win,

115
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.800
but you'll feel really bad if they lose. Yes. But if you go with the underdog,

116
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.670
it's the reverse, right? They're expected to lose. So if they do lose,

117
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:43.900
it's not that big a deal.

118
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.190
Cause you've kind of figured that was how it was going to go. But if they win,

119
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.800
you feel great so you can difficult in the emotional payoff.

120
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.160
So it's like betting on a long shot horse. You can put in five bucks,

121
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.360
you're probably going to lose it,

122
00:06:55.361 --> 00:06:59.590
but if you win you might get back like a hundred. Exactly. Hmm. I,

123
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.200
I don't s that just does not feel at all like how I watched sports.

124
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.063
Well there's,

125
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.640
there's another argument which is these guys say that maybe it's something about

126
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.240
fairness.

127
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.200
Deep down we want to live in a fair society where there's an even playing field

128
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.850
and there's research that shows that fairness is a pretty deep instinct in us.

129
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:18.620
But I don't know. I mean like none of that seems to,

130
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.510
I guess the thing is that this whole thing feels like a lot more basic.

131
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.570
If you look back at like the stories we tell this underdog story is ancient,

132
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.010
the Iliad, the Odyssey, a great epics from Asia,

133
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.400
Africa, that's all the same story then. And so Scott says, you know,

134
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.330
maybe we love the underdog because we feel like we are the underdog. Yeah.

135
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.400
I mean, in some sense just to be a living thing is to fight against the odd,

136
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:47.360
think about newborns.

137
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.433
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

138
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.200
<v 0>you can't be any more weak and helpless and small,</v>

139
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.390
you know, I mean the baby, I guess that's true. Um,

140
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.920
but I don't know. I mean, I don't remember being a baby and feeling it,

141
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.890
but I do remember junior high, you know,

142
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:12.500
and I do remember feeling like I would never get a job.

143
00:08:12.501 --> 00:08:15.500
And I do remember feeling like there's no way that girls ever gonna like me.

144
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.890
Yeah. You know, we need these stories just to make it through.

145
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.270
They're part of who we are as human beings. There's actually a very interesting,

146
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.890
uh, story about, uh, Haruki Murakami,

147
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.750
the famous Japanese novelist.

148
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.340
He was awarded the Jerusalem literature

149
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:40.300
<v 4>and this was in the meat store immediately after Israel invaded Gaza and there</v>

150
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:47.411
were more than one than Palestinian dead in his delivery speech.

151
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:52.510
He said the following between a high solid wall and an egg that breaks against

152
00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:56.520
it, I would always on the side of the egg,

153
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.420
no matter how right the wall may be and how wrong the egg,

154
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.010
I would stand with the egg.

155
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.240
Someone else will have to decide what is right and what is wrong.

156
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.160
Perhaps time or history would do it,

157
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.570
but if there were a novelist who for whatever reason wrote works,

158
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.800
standing with the wall of what value would such works be?

159
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.870
<v 0>Huh? Value with these works be an interesting word.</v>

160
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.860
It's almost like he's saying like a story's job is,

161
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.380
it's beyond morality. It's beyond truth.

162
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:33.381
Like it's job is somehow to to tell you that the world could be a way that we

163
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:36.360
know inherently it never will be. I think that's what he's saying.

164
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:41.390
Or maybe he's really saying that I stand with the powerless and the powerful can

165
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:43.410
take care of themselves.

166
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.970
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna a little wait to people who have no muscles of

167
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:49.770
their own. I'm going to put a little pebble on the scale.

168
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.760
That's the job of story.

169
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.520
And I guess if the scale is always weighted in the wrong direction,

170
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.370
then that's why we love this story because we need more pebbles. Well yeah,

171
00:09:56.371 --> 00:10:00.280
but there's a question we haven't asked here, which is what, well,

172
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.000
four out of five of us root for the underdog or the struggling circle,

173
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.100
but that's not everyone.

174
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.660
One out of five people are like, screw that circle.

175
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.190
I'm excited about the circle.

176
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.400
They could probably do some interesting follow up studies on like who are those

177
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.840
psychopaths? Yeah. And so you assume they're psychopaths. I do.

178
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.480
Actually. Oddly we ended up bumping into a guy who falls into this group. Yeah,

179
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.940
it's Malcolm. Yeah. Hi. His name is Malcolm Gladwell.

180
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:30.500
He's a writer for the New Yorker magazine.

181
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.320
He's also written a bunch of bestselling books and in the middle of a

182
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:37.670
conversation unbidden by the way, he suddenly says, Oh, I'm,

183
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.900
I never ever cheer for the underdog.

184
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:45.590
<v 5>You don't know why, why not? Cause I'm distressed by the,</v>

185
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.250
the injustice of the person who should win,

186
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:52.650
not winning the injustice of the fee.

187
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.480
What losing for the favorite is that is the most, um,

188
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.680
exquisitely painful situation to be in. So I remember as a kid,

189
00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:05.210
the first time I ran, I was huge track and field fan. 76 Olympics.

190
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.070
Dwight stones lost the high jump even though he was so far in a way the greatest

191
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:12.560
high jumper in the world because it rained.

192
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:18.230
His technique required absolutely perfect footwork and he's would slip on the

193
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:19.010
tarmac.

194
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.970
And I just remember sitting there as a kid and I was just devastated cause I

195
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.060
could feel his pain right and his pain was so much greater than anybody else's.

196
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.110
What's wrong with you?

197
00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.360
It's too painful if they lose when Dwight stones loses the highjump,

198
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.170
it is literally one of the most painful experiences of my young life. I can't,

199
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.600
I thought about it from weeks afterwards.

200
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.690
I just couldn't wrap my mind around how he must've felt going home.

201
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.310
And ever since then I was like,

202
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.930
there's no way you could not cheer for the overnight because they will suffer.

203
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.340
Like [inaudible] is the only humane position because you are trying to end human

204
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:56.500
suffering this as tortured and twisted the logic as I've ever heard. I mean I,

205
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.930
I always thought this was um, you know, rare evidence of my empathy that I,

206
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:06.120
I felt jaded. I've, oh, so sorry to brought you the news. It's also,

207
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:06.880
you know, it is,

208
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.880
there's another part of this too and that is that it is that I have a deep

209
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.740
distrust and unhappiness with luck.

210
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.390
So I do not like it when the outcome turns on and an unrepeatable sequence.

211
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.130
So Georgetown losing the Villanova in,

212
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:27.730
is it the 82 NCAA college basketball championships,

213
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.030
there is no way you could play that game hundred thousand times and Villanova

214
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:37.750
would still only win that one time. That just, that game,

215
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.490
it did more than upset me. It outraged me. I mean, I just thought this is not,

216
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.090
it's just not right. It is like, it is a violation of everything.

217
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:50.000
You shouldn't be able to shoot 78% from the floor or whatever the,

218
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:54.310
I forgot what the number was, the preposterous number. They, and I just,

219
00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.760
you know, if I had been on Georgetown, I would to this,

220
00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.070
I would wake up every night in a cold sweat to this day,

221
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:04.750
just thinking this is outrageous. How did this happen?

222
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.780
So weird. You're a storyteller by trade.

223
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.200
What are the clunks Christian Anderson had woken up every morning and said,

224
00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:12.580
here I have a great story.

225
00:13:12.581 --> 00:13:15.660
There's an ugly duckling and it just stays ugly because, you know,

226
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.820
why should it get lucky and be a swat? It's just an ugly duckling rubber.

227
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.630
We're not talking about stories. I understand stories. To me,

228
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.780
a game is not a story to me, a game,

229
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.580
it is a contest between two parties according to certain rules. And when the,

230
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.170
when expectations and rules are violated, some part of me takes offense. Well,

231
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.850
I'm curious, how do you feel about the,

232
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:40.810
the people who always root for the underdog, which happens to be most people.

233
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.990
Do you feel like that's the weaker position morally?

234
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:49.690
Is it weak or morally? Um, I mean there's a, there's a,

235
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:54.691
there's a very unflattering interpretation of this and that is that on some deep

236
00:13:54.971 --> 00:13:58.510
level, I think of myself as a favorite, not an underdog. Right. You know,

237
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.120
that's, like I say, that's an unflattering way of interpreting my motives.

238
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:06.220
But you know, unlike many of my peers, I grew up in a tiny,

239
00:14:06.221 --> 00:14:11.080
tiny town and went to a kind of unexceptional high school where everyone left at

240
00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:12.460
16 to go home and milk the cows.

241
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.190
And so it was like situation where I did sort of grow up as the,

242
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:17.290
if you had parents who had gone to college,

243
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:21.580
you were the overdog in my universe growing up. So I, you know,

244
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:22.414
I do sort of,

245
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.400
when I was in seventh grade and someone got a better grade than me,

246
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:32.050
it was outrageous to me, right. Because no one should get her.

247
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.560
Only my friend Bruce should get a better grade than me. You know,

248
00:14:35.561 --> 00:14:40.030
he's the only the other person in the class whose parents went beyond the ninth

249
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.500
grader who had books at home or who had left the province of Ontario.

250
00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.920
So maybe there's something physically in that that if you grow up in these

251
00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:52.490
impoverished environments where you, you're forced into a particular

252
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.280
<v 6>dominant role, right. You just,</v>

253
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:59.090
you come back to it again and again long after those circumstances have changed.

254
00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:03.790
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

255
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.270
<v 7>that's Malcolm Gladwell, defender of winners everywhere. I do, I do hate when,</v>

256
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.470
when it's loose. It is true

257
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.670
<v 6>now. He may hate it when winter's lose,</v>

258
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.280
but we have one that will tempt them to go the other way. I mean,

259
00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.830
it's certainly caught our attention. Yes.

260
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:30.510
This is a fantastic story about losers who win.

261
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.570
This is actually one of the best stories of that kind that, uh,

262
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.540
at least I've ever heard of except for chariots of fire when it comes to us from

263
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:40.780
our producer Pat Walters. Uh, yeah. [inaudible] he took a trip,

264
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.800
sort of set it up for her. Where did you go? I went to Stevenson, Alabama.

265
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.370
It's this tiny town in northeastern Alabama. Tiny like,

266
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.630
isn't like one convenience store tiny or maybe two, maybe two. Yeah.

267
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.900
Really small. Anyway,

268
00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:01.170
my first stop in this town was this high school walking up now to North Jackson

269
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:02.284
high school.

270
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.940
Because I had heard this story about a basketball game that happened in this

271
00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:10.840
school, in the gym here. People concluded I'd be 1500

272
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.770
that is like a miracle.

273
00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:18.890
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

274
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:23.240
<v 6>one in a million nat. This is David Smith. He's an ag teacher at this school.</v>

275
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:27.200
Been here since we started the place and he says that even now he has kids who

276
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.610
don't believe it happened. These kids come in every year and they'll say,

277
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.790
Mary Smith to dive to really beat five. I said, yes, I did.

278
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.340
<v 8>Do you want me go in there and lay the hand on the Bible? I will</v>

279
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.830
<v 6>and I'll bring them in here and show him that picture on the wall there that you</v>

280
00:16:41.831 --> 00:16:43.150
just seen behind him,

281
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:47.740
there's this little newspaper clipping from 1992 and it shows he's three

282
00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:48.670
basketball players.

283
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.480
The one in the middle is this tiny white kid who actually doesn't really have

284
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.920
too much to do with our story,

285
00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.820
but on either side of him are the two guys that did this amazing thing.

286
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.950
Those two Gash could've said, well, you know,

287
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:04.060
it's all over with and dropped the ball out of bounds or, and the left,

288
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.400
my name is Robert Lewis. Cargo Jr is this huge guy or I was fat,

289
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.960
the fat and on the other side is like his exact opposite.

290
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:18.360
<v 7>So I'll check a tiny little guy. I was about five, six,</v>

291
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.750
seven and you can dunk if so, pitched stuff. Yeah. Like somebody,

292
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:27.070
you know because I don't ball for us. You jump off. Yeah. At five six, five,

293
00:17:27.071 --> 00:17:29.680
six, five, seven. I'm like, yeah. Well that was real small,

294
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.760
but I could jump real good.

295
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.580
<v 6>Yeah. How did you, or how did you work on your, so what happened? Okay,</v>

296
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.480
let me set it up.

297
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.380
<v 8>Okay. It's February 14th,</v>

298
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.460
1982 5:00 PM Tom game. The gym is completely packed.

299
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:46.940
It was pee everywhere, about a thousand people in the stands who was sleepwear.

300
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.010
And we had a good crowd at that game. That's Vic Greg's,

301
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:51.870
he's the assistant coach. How's the rivalry?

302
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.280
The game that night was against the Fort Payne wildcats and Fort Payne has been

303
00:17:56.281 --> 00:18:00.960
a huge rivalry from the very get go. They were the enemy, book ball, basketball,

304
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.630
baseball, it don't matter which for pain we do,

305
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.480
we go at it for pain team had more resources,

306
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.670
even had more players in that year.

307
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.580
Everyone agreed that they were just plain better. Yeah.

308
00:18:11.581 --> 00:18:15.600
I think we would have been considered another dog that everyone pretty much

309
00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:18.330
thought the chiefs were going to lose chiefs. Our team go chiefs.

310
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
But the game is really close and in fact the eight 55 in the second,

311
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.463
<v 3>Huh?</v>

312
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.350
<v 8>The chiefs took the lead</v>

313
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:33.170
those days day and it just going back and forth and back and forth.

314
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.400
It was a close game other than like the rest

315
00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:37.810
<v 3>off.</v>

316
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.450
<v 8>Well it was called with some unbelievable stuff and that's the thing that</v>

317
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:45.451
ultimately would make this game so dramatic is that there was just a crazy

318
00:18:45.821 --> 00:18:47.890
number of files. Calls. How many,

319
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:51.070
like how many are usually called in like your typical NBA game?

320
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.100
They might be 50,000 but in this game with three minutes [inaudible]

321
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.230
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

322
00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:00.560
<v 8>71 five oh, it was like, man. Yeah. I was gonna ask,</v>

323
00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:05.510
was it a rough game or was it that these guys were just like calling a ton of

324
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:05.930
files?

325
00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.960
<v 6>Yeah, they, I think that was a little bit of both. They would,</v>

326
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.370
they would let us play for real. Just redaction. Play bar.

327
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.200
<v 8>Yeah, because according to Robert, how they used to play,</v>

328
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.570
it was like anything goes. When did you,

329
00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.970
do you remember like the first time that you played basketball,

330
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:19.200
do you remember how you learned to play?

331
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:25.500
<v 6>My cousin now? Uh, my aunt used to have a, uh, my great aunt, she used, we,</v>

332
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.500
we used to have like a, we call it dust bowl. You know what I'm saying?

333
00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:31.770
Back then it went no gravel. I mean, no concrete, it just does,

334
00:19:31.771 --> 00:19:33.900
does coming up here, my cousin don't play.

335
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:37.380
I had a basketball goal right down the street. Everybody in front of projects,

336
00:19:37.381 --> 00:19:39.330
they come down and play grownups. Mostly.

337
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.430
Not like everybody's watched my uncle Jim go out there and play like they get a

338
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.770
church and playing every day.

339
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:45.630
The only way for Chad and Robert's get on the court,

340
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.580
we know who played with the older guys. You know what I mean?

341
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:52.530
We'll go at it hard. We will turn them up because you know,

342
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:56.520
maybe deep down they may be believed that the game wasn't just a game. No.

343
00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.860
We'll go out there and we somebody else. What I mean, like what,

344
00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.410
who would you imagine you were? Oh, back then, uh, doctor [inaudible]

345
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:09.850
<v 8>the as in Dr j</v>

346
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.710
<v 6>and my dream was that maybe he could also be a professional athlete and get my</v>

347
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.300
dad out of prison. Get mom on a big old house. What I'm saying,

348
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:18.630
take her and my family and everything

349
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.180
<v 8>back in the game. Two seconds left in the clock about James.</v>

350
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.070
We have the ball in this scrawny little guy named Travis Smith from the end of

351
00:20:27.071 --> 00:20:30.340
the bench is on the free throw line and he's gonna shoot the thousand shots.

352
00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.430
Yeah. Here's, here's what's important though. Yeah. We're down by two points.

353
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.630
[inaudible] Travis has three shots now.

354
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.530
He got fouled shooting a three point exactly. Which means

355
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.370
<v 3>Travis Mackerel break though, right?</v>

356
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.290
<v 8>He could win the game right now. Do it Travis.</v>

357
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.313
First one,

358
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.910
<v 3>the second one. [inaudible]</v>

359
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.663
<v 8>what's up the,</v>

360
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.240
<v 3>he might get no</v>

361
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.633
<v 8>boxes with her dog.</v>

362
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.780
<v 6>Shall we lose tie game? Oh,</v>

363
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.500
the tie game ties the game and sends it into overtime. Who's that?

364
00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:06.560
That's my friend Tom Lake. He's a writer for sports illustrated.

365
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.440
He told me about the game right here. Um,

366
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.240
this is where things just get totally out of hand, right?

367
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.690
The chiefs take the court. Everybody's in foul trouble.

368
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:18.850
What does that mean in basketball?

369
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:22.160
You get 5,000 you get thrown out of the game and these guys have like close to

370
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.720
50

371
00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.700
<v 8>yeah. And the first thing that happens,</v>

372
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.130
<v 3>yeah. Wait here with just blow another one.</v>

373
00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.870
<v 8>Travis Smith, the guy who put us into overtime. Okay.</v>

374
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.610
<v 3>Can I have it again?</v>

375
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.990
<v 8>That was out of the game. When Travis bowels out 59 seconds into overtime,</v>

376
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.470
the chiefs have only five players left. Just means no sets.

377
00:21:39.471 --> 00:21:42.680
The game keeps going with a minute.

378
00:21:42.681 --> 00:21:45.740
41 11 it leaves another guy,

379
00:21:45.741 --> 00:21:50.150
another guy fouls out there now for house fliers. Now four against five.

380
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.910
14 Scott, two seconds later. [inaudible] got it though.

381
00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:54.520
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

382
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.780
<v 8>Another guy falls out. So there's three now. There's just through a kidding me.</v>

383
00:21:58.781 --> 00:22:01.960
Yeah. Is that real? Can that happen? There's no rule against that.

384
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.030
Why would you make a rule against something like this?

385
00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.440
What are the odds it's ever going to happen?

386
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.340
So minute 39 39 to go air three cheater down to gray again.

387
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.080
Chad Cobb, Robert, Paul, your hand, Chris Shelby.

388
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:18.030
So with 59 seconds left in the game, four pains are here by

389
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.580
<v 3>67 to 64</v>

390
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.410
<v 8>14 gets the ball, tries to drive it down. The court. North Jackson steals it,</v>

391
00:22:24.411 --> 00:22:27.800
passes it to Chad Cobb. Remember that name? Chad Cobb takes it down.

392
00:22:27.801 --> 00:22:30.020
The court pulls up at the three point line. Yup.

393
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.530
<v 3>The [inaudible]</v>

394
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.970
<v 8>Ben with 17 seconds on the clock. Does it? Listen, I don't know.</v>

395
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.980
And Chris Shelby, one of the last three remain chiefs in [inaudible].

396
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.830
<v 3>Was He always out of the game? And now it's five</v>

397
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:49.690
<v 6>North Jackson only has two players left on the court to two against five.</v>

398
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.750
No,

399
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.210
<v 3>Robert [inaudible],</v>

400
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:56.260
<v 8>James Todd, 60 70</v>

401
00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.240
<v 6>67 and by this time, you know you're thinking, well, it's all over.</v>

402
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:03.120
It's all over. And the next play,

403
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.410
the next play just baffles mate with 17 seconds left on the clock.

404
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.410
North Jackson ends up with the ball. There was a time out called,

405
00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:15.630
this is Jay Sanders, the head coach and I came to the side and you know,

406
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.080
what do you tell kids? Yeah, you only have two on the floor.

407
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.300
You don't say they've got time for one play. One chance to win the game.

408
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.330
And I can remember Chad saying, how am I going to get open? You know it just,

409
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.323
this is over.

410
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.970
Cause he knew Robert was throwing it in and he was only one the kitchen that got

411
00:23:32.971 --> 00:23:35.280
four guys out there. Yeah. Quadruple team. Yes.

412
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:40.000
<v 3>Well now okay, I'd come. We'll have the pressure on his back.</v>

413
00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.340
<v 6>So me and Jay, we going back out there we play then all of the chairs, man,</v>

414
00:23:46.341 --> 00:23:47.140

415
00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.470
<v 8>I know, I just remember Robert was holiday and we was like his backyard.</v>

416
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.690
<v 6>It was in your backyard. I mean what are we meaning? What does bro?</v>

422
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.740
<v 8>I ran like one way and I fake back slam on the brakes and ran straight back.</v>

423
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:23.270
Robert just hoping he gets through and he was wide open and I was wide open and

424
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.360
that's what rob was seeing me. Robert through the bowel space,

425
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.860
<v 3>eight ball [inaudible]</v>

426
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.200
<v 8>just to that narrow corner.</v>

427
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.710
He's just dribbling between people trying to get by guys or whatever on the

428
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.080
little guy. Yeah, in Fort Paints, you know,

429
00:24:37.081 --> 00:24:40.190
trying to come up double team and Chad's just weaving in and out of these guys.

430
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.170
Yes. Out playing backyard ball. Almost everybody was paying.

431
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.510
<v 3>He might take it out of the way in a way on</v>

432
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.700
<v 8>I want to run these guys.</v>

433
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.090
Know when I seen that I had a layup and Chad takes a shot,

434
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.990

435
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:58.260
<v 8>takes that lap, that last shot, and he banks it and it hits the back of the,</v>

436
00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.740
the, here's the back board, here's the other side of the ramp.

437
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.093
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

438
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:10.560
<v 8>falls off, shout it, look strong. Do you like it? Oh No.</v>

439
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.240
<v 6>And all of a sudden they hit the ground and just came out the back where there's</v>

440
00:25:17.241 --> 00:25:20.540
big Robert and I was in the right spot, the right time and he grabs it.

441
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.300
And of course there's about three, four pipe people around him.

442
00:25:23.301 --> 00:25:27.110
So I'll pop for fake about twice. But I did everybody, Joe and my mind, I knew.

443
00:25:27.111 --> 00:25:30.950
I was like, oh no. And when he puts the ball up against the glass

444
00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.670
<v 3>[inaudible] just get this, the buzzer goes off.</v>

445
00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.250
[inaudible] [inaudible] it was just handled mode.

446
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.260
[inaudible] oh yeah. Never married buddy. Come on. Or the bleeding.

447
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.730
I don't even remember walking down to the club. But the next thing I know,

448
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.900
I'm being hugged by this woman in North Jackson thing and then she's swinging.

449
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.160
She had literally just just slinging me left and right lifting wraps.

450
00:26:12.161 --> 00:26:16.850
He's got you [inaudible] got me in a bear hug and I'm just like a little dish

451
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.550
rag and I'm just flopping around of course.

452
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.530
And then I start hugging her and we're benching the rail.

453
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.090
And then I remember looking at it to circle it, half code,

454
00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:28.330
and I promise you there was a pile of bodies, six feet,

455
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.040
huge, huge pile of people and on the bottom of the pile

456
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.820
<v 8>really it was like colon God. There was Chad and I was throwing the ball,</v>

457
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:39.843
try to get up

458
00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.320
<v 3>the next day when I woke up</v>

459
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.120
<v 6>it was like, this is just happening.</v>

460
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.350
It was just like a dream and a Monday morning when the boys went to school.

461
00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.490
Oh man, they were, but they were just, it was just crazy. I, everybody was,

462
00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.100
you know, talking about it, asking us question, you know what I'm saying?

463
00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:07.180
Just asking. I'll never forget that I don't do this. I've got to explain,

464
00:27:07.181 --> 00:27:07.610
you know,

465
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:12.220
they said it over the intercom and says a few people even asked them a good look

466
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.400
at. Well, rather than, I don't know, man. And everywhere they went in town,

467
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.110
people knew me. Everybody knew. Then a few days later, Davis,

468
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.130
Milford, actually it was Vic Greg's, yeah, that's right.

469
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.960
Went and call the news called the reporter in Huntsville,

470
00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:29.200
which is the nearest big city. And I was telling him about it and he said, no,

471
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.840
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did you say you want with two players?

472
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:35.710
Hung up on him. The News,

473
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.170
they hung up on him. His thought it was crazy.

474
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:39.910
But two days later they ran the story

475
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.260
<v 9>and as soon as they did, but this was in the Huntsville Times hospital, Alabama.</v>

476
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.170
Could you read it to me? This thing just kind of blew up that

477
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.970
uh, if they ever found that the, my Kauffman miracle was on Jackson,

478
00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.460
that's what many consider the North Jackson hace 69 67 victory over with,

479
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:04.700
for plain wildcats. Black Friday night. It was everywhere from Portland,

480
00:28:04.701 --> 00:28:06.650
Oregon to Mac Associated Press,

481
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.740
the Chicago Tribune plains dealer.

482
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:13.490
It would have fort worth as dramatic in eating as Hoosiers USA Today.

483
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:14.140
Ordinarily,

484
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.730
there's no way two players can make five players in a basketball game,

485
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.650
kind of laminated. They're not,

486
00:28:18.651 --> 00:28:21.590
unless the two man team is Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan.

487
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.990
But North Jackson did it. We'll phone messages,

488
00:28:23.991 --> 00:28:27.920
call this person and that person, I'll just remember like it was crazy.

489
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.530
Like ESPN, you can just do that. Sports illustrated as a movement.

490
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.300
It was just really cider. So what happens,

491
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.770
Chad? Robert are riding this high for months, months, and months. You know,

492
00:28:43.771 --> 00:28:44.770
somebody said that Lynn,

493
00:28:44.771 --> 00:28:47.820
I were Letterman or somebody even kind of mentioned something on one of their

494
00:28:47.821 --> 00:28:49.890
shows at the end of a joke. I didn't see it or hear it.

495
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.460
It seemed to a lot of people that this would turn into something.

496
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.810
I was really hoping from this deal. Uh,

497
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.580
the Amr helped Chad get a little notoriety and might help him get a scholarship,

498
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:03.960
help him get noticed, help get his name out there, you know, and uh, uh,

499
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.060
I, I don't, I don't know.

500
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:09.461
<v 6>Well, we never know what,</v>

501
00:29:09.461 --> 00:29:13.700
what little piece of the puzzle is gonna make that big a difference. Dude. Blue,

502
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.510
what does that mean? Well, nothing happened. Nothing happened.

503
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:20.130
By the end of the school year,

504
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:24.690
people stopped calling and the story just kind of faded away.

505
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.760
It just, it was over. I mean they would just,

506
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:33.050
and Robert says the game started to feel like it never even happened.

507
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.220
It has been, it has been rough for me. I mean right now it is,

508
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.320
it's been messed up from that spring after the game.

509
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:44.380
Robert Graduate High School held it together for a while,

510
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.000
but eventually fell in with some shady characters, smoking weed,

511
00:29:49.001 --> 00:29:52.690
you know what I'm saying? And kind of lost control of this life.

512
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:55.750
Really. How when I went to see him

513
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.343
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

514
00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:03.650
<v 6>he was locked up in the Scottsboro county jail for one of lots of different</v>

515
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.640
things. And I, our first week I was here, I cried every night

516
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.820
it's me. It's like, why am I here? You know, what did I do?

517
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:20.130
So you said like this game happened and then for awhile you wouldn't think about

518
00:30:20.131 --> 00:30:22.080
it cause it seemed like it hadn't even really happened.

519
00:30:22.081 --> 00:30:24.600
Like it was just a dream. Uh,

520
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.230
do you think about it ever besides when somebody comes along and asks you about

521
00:30:28.231 --> 00:30:32.480
it again? Uh,

522
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.720
not, not really. Not so much. I said like, no,

523
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.390
we got like a little basketball go. We made up back there.

524
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.400
So that's what it was back at doing when they told me to come up and no,

525
00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.180
I always inside, you know, it's like a little box, you know what I mean?

526
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.950
We done made little knit,

527
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.740
they got little bags like where we put our clothes and you know,

528
00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:52.700
they're not cut them out.

529
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:56.660
Got from like for the nits and just like we just got a lot of socks put together

530
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.840
like a ball and play basketball.

531
00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.243
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

532
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.450
<v 6>What about the other guy or the other? One of the two ball players? Chad? Chad.</v>

533
00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.500
Chad stayed in town too and he got married and had a daughter.

534
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.000
But about five years after the game,

535
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.180
I'll just go on around some back rolls around a little curve as like he had

536
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.660
gotten this motorcycle accident and tore up his knee.

537
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.380
Let me be in the opposite way. It was pretty bad. Yeah.

538
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.780
Shortly after that runs into his old buddy Travis. Remember him?

539
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.800
He was the guy who hit the shot that put the game into overtime.

540
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:34.940
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

541
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.890
<v 6>that guy. Yeah. And they got into an argument.</v>

542
00:31:36.891 --> 00:31:40.480
It was basically situation that shooting happened.

543
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.650
What it lead details are a little hazy.

544
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.820
Apparently Travis thought Chad was badmouthing him to a girl or something.

545
00:31:46.821 --> 00:31:51.060
I don't know what, what exactly. So as I was going home, he was, um,

546
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:56.840
he left the gym. But when I was going home, he was following me and he came and,

547
00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.063
um,

548
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.270
<v 7>flicking his lights at me to stop or whatever. But I had my daughter with me,</v>

549
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.620
took her home, came back out. So, you know, we're a little small town.

550
00:32:08.621 --> 00:32:13.550
We fist fight and I got out of my car and I was like, um,

551
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.470
I only got one leg. I can barely hold myself up as you get close enough to,

552
00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.470
you know, I said, uh, we can fight. He never said nothing. I said, see,

553
00:32:23.471 --> 00:32:26.110
that's what I thought. I see. You ain't nothing, you know. So I turned around,

554
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.840
I put my her leg in the car cause I was driving and it still was,

555
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.050
I was getting my other leg in the car. I just heard shots.

556
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.200
I just seen blood shooting up at the snaring with, I was like, man,

557
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.340
<v 6>just, this is not what the story is. So not what I want this story to do. Yeah,</v>

558
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.140
yeah, yeah. I thought that this is about, you know, sports in America,

559
00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.240
it's a good dream factory to some degree.

560
00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.600
If you have the magic dust then they try to sell it.

561
00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.050
So I thought these guys had dust all over them after a night like that.

562
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:02.540
And so someone was going to help them sell it. And well,

563
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.940
like my practical response in my head is like there's a crappy school for

564
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:11.510
basketball. They probably weren't really that good.

565
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.320
Like in the whole scope of basketball players that who have the same dreams.

566
00:33:15.321 --> 00:33:18.650
Like I dunno. I see. Yeah. On the other hand,

567
00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.573
hi.

568
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:28.820
Even though it was just that one moment like that still I feel like should say

569
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.780
something about who they are. And when I went to see Chad,

570
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.960
I kind of felt like it did Patrick j, what do you mean? Hi?

571
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.210
<v 8>The playoffs were on and chatter is hanging out with his kids.</v>

572
00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:47.370
Chanel and Chad two years that's pulling for the heat and I'm going for the

573
00:33:47.371 --> 00:33:51.390
Mavericks. He just don't like how to do the [inaudible] mom,

574
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.830
but I'm not just a big umbrella.

575
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.810
They were joking around watching Lebron just have this mythically terrible

576
00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:00.900
series. Not Fine. Too good to not. And you know,

577
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.690
Chad's basically raised these two kids on his own.

578
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.310
His wife left a few years ago. He gets up very early in the morning,

579
00:34:08.311 --> 00:34:12.270
drives an hour and a half to work, works really long hours,

580
00:34:12.271 --> 00:34:15.840
drives home and it just seems hard.

581
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:17.790
But he keeps doing it.

582
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.220
And this might not sound like the ending you want. No,

583
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:26.940
