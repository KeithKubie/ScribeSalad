00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.930
We're going to illustrate this
with a very simple example and

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.420
here it is, so imagine you've got
a robot that just has two things, okay?

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.420
It is a map of a hallway, okay?

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.800
So, here you're seeing a hallway and
by the way this little blue dot here,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.940
this is the robot, the robot
doesn't actually know where it is.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.610
We know where it is because
we're really really smart, okay?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.220
Or we work for the NSA,
I hope that didn't cost me my grant.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.420
Anyway, so the,
the robot knows this, this map and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.990
it knows that it, essentially where the
walls are and where the doors are and

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.640
we'll assume that the doors are open,
'kay?.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.460
The other thing that the robot has,
is it just has a detector,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.532
a sensor really dumb that
just looks out to the side.

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:44.880
You can even think of it as just
gotta stick and it pokes it.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.800
And it says,
do I hit something or don't I?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.060
And by the way, it's, it's not very
accurate, so he sticks it out there and

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.170
sometimes he sticks it this way and
sometimes.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.850
So it's, it's approximately
that direction he just says,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.890
did I hit something or not.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.720
And you might thing that might
be an incredibly dumb robot and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.130
you might be right except
here's a picture of a robot.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.110
I don't want to insult my SRI friends
because this robot actually got pretty

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.290
smart but this is the robot originally,
flaky here.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.050
And flaky had down below on the bottom,
these little ultrasonic sensors

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.190
that would send out a chirp and
it would respond back.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.500
Did I hit anything?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.890
Or how far away was
the things that I hit?

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.250
So, humor me that this is just a robot
that basically detects, just a hole or

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.040
just a not a hole.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.820
That's the only thing that it knows and

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.450
because it's not perfect in setting
out its, its signal, right?

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.220
Just because it said,
the sensor says hole,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.600
doesn't mean there actually was a hole,
right?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.810
And just because, it says wall doesn't
mean it actually was a wall, okay?
