ELIZABETH CHOE:
Becoming the Next Bill

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.440
Nye was a month-long class
that we taught at MIT.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.840
It was a class to
teach students how

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.540
to use video to engage an
audience in the things they're

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.890
excited about in science
technology, engineering,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.520
and math.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.475
It was workshop
based, very intensive.

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.000
We held it every day,
and we had everyone

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.950
from undergrads,
freshman, to grad students

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.270
coming in from all sorts
of different disciplines.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.690
And they basically had
a chance to learn how

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.095
to script, pre-produce, and host
a five-minute YouTube video.

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.690
And we had everything
from videos

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.434
on how brace's work to how
time travel works to fractals.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:45.350
And then we took some
of our favorite projects

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.290
and turned them into the third
season of MIT's original web

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.100
series, Science Out Loud.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.220
We had a teaching
team that was about as

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.630
big as our class itself.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.150
We had educators,
producers, hosts.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.300
I think the most valuable
members of our teaching team

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.280
were a group of middle
schoolers that we

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.950
had come in one day as
our class consultants.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.840
And our students actually had
to pitch their video ideas

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.560
to them, because who
better to know the YouTube

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.850
landscape better than
a bunch of pre-teens?

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.920
So on the MIT
OpenCourseWare site,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.110
you'll pretty much get as close
of an experience to actually

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.510
taking the class as
the students did,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.080
because you'll
find the syllabus,

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.955
and you'll find all the
assignments, but then

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:27.160
on top of that you'll
find video lectures

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.300
where we really try to capture
every single candid moment that

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.650
happened in the class.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.790
And then, in particular,
if you're an educator,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.810
there is a special section
called This Course at MIT

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.120
where you'll get very specific
instructor insights as

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.290
to how we approached designing
this class, how we ran it.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.140
You'll get our confessionals
and sort of insights

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.820
into our pedagogical approaches
in teaching a class like this.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.900
The great thing is,
all these materials,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.070
all of our experiences
and resources,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.170
they're all up online on
OpenCourseWare for free.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.510
There's no sign up required.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.762
You can pick and choose
what you want to learn

00:02:01.762 --> 00:02:03.220
and you can do it
at your own pace.
