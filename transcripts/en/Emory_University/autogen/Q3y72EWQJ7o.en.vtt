come to see me and a lot of them had

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
come to see me and a lot of them had
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.970
come to see me and a lot of them had

you sort of walk out of the office and
you say you can't prevent this thing

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
you say you can't prevent this thing

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
change their behavior and of course it
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.010
change their behavior and of course it
was hard for me to appreciate that the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
was hard for me to appreciate that the
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.660
was hard for me to appreciate that the
people who change their behavior weren't

infected they're not seeing people who
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910
infected they're not seeing people who
don't become infected and a lot of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
don't become infected and a lot of
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.169
don't become infected and a lot of
people are very skeptical about

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179
people are very skeptical about
 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:11.419
people are very skeptical about
behavioral science and things for those

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429
behavioral science and things for those
 

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.149
behavioral science and things for those
reasons the other reason a lot of us are

reasons the other reason a lot of us are
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.099
reasons the other reason a lot of us are
skeptical is it's even difficult for us

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:16.109
skeptical is it's even difficult for us
 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.899
skeptical is it's even difficult for us
to talk about sex and drugs and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
to talk about sex and drugs and
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.959
to talk about sex and drugs and
homosexuality because even if it's not

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969
homosexuality because even if it's not
 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.779
homosexuality because even if it's not
difficult for us it's involving the

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789
difficult for us it's involving the
 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.929
difficult for us it's involving the
important intimate details of people's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
important intimate details of people's
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.139
important intimate details of people's
lives when they feel like they're being

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149
lives when they feel like they're being
 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.870
lives when they feel like they're being
accused of betraying someone else or

accused of betraying someone else or
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.959
accused of betraying someone else or
have being betrayed themselves so even

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969
have being betrayed themselves so even
 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.209
have being betrayed themselves so even
if you don't feel uncomfortable with it

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219
if you don't feel uncomfortable with it
 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.219
if you don't feel uncomfortable with it
when you start to talk to people about

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.139
when you start to talk to people about
it it becomes quite uncomfortable

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149
it it becomes quite uncomfortable
 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.770
it it becomes quite uncomfortable
because it's uncomfortable to them so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
because it's uncomfortable to them so
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.179
because it's uncomfortable to them so
it's easier to just say won't work

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
it's easier to just say won't work
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.959
it's easier to just say won't work
anyway why do we want to do it now the

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969
anyway why do we want to do it now the
 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.300
anyway why do we want to do it now the
other thing is that prevention isn't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310

that it used to be that forty percent of
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.370
that it used to be that forty percent of
American smoked and now twenty two

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380
American smoked and now twenty two
 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.919
American smoked and now twenty two
percent of Americans smoke that means

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
percent of Americans smoke that means
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.420
percent of Americans smoke that means
there's a whole lot of people who quit

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
there's a whole lot of people who quit

smoking and didn't start smoking and
that whole lot of people is going to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
that whole lot of people is going to
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.910
that whole lot of people is going to
save hundreds of thousands of lives

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
save hundreds of thousands of lives
 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.820

but I'm still skeptical you can't get
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.810
but I'm still skeptical you can't get
people to stop smoking and you can't
