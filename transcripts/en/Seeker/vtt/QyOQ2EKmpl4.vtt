00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.580
Holy Surrogate Momma Mackerel, Batman!

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.879
Scientist want to breed endangered TUNA using
the MACKEREL!

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.870
Can it be done?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.110
Howdy pescetarians, Trace here for DNews,
fishing for science.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.939
Five of the eight species of tuna are on the
list of threatened species.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.239
The Southern Bluefin are critically endangered,
Atlantic Bluefin are endangered.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.960
The Bigeye is vulnerable and the Yellowfin
and Albacore are near threatened.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.359
The World Wildlife Federation estimated in
2006 that bluefin tuna catches alone were

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:40.850
around 50,000 tons annually (45,000 metric
tons); more 150-percent over the legal limit.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.039
Aside from refraining from eating sushi and
tuna steaks... or ending fishing altogether…

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.090
is there anything we can do?

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.160
At this point, according to the Pew Environment
Group, companies and illegal fishing groups

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.570
have decimated the bluefin tuna by 96-percent.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.690
Due to the high demand for bluefin tuna meat,
prices have soared, with one fish selling

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.760
for 1 million British pounds last year.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.760
One fish.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.960
In an effort to solve the crisis, a Japanese
marine biologist is going to try and use mackerel

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.490
to produce more tuna.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.820
It sounds kinda fishy, but it's fairly straightforward.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.890
Scientists will remove reproductive cells
from male and female tuna, and implant them

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.490
into male and female mackerel.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.920
The mackerel will then get busy…

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.439
// Sexy music // and after they lay the eggs
the baby TUNA can have THEIR cells transplanted

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.579
into more mackerel continuing the great circle…
of life!

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.009
According to Popular Science, the scientist,
Goro Yoshizaki, believes by using this method,

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.729
they can create a quote "enduring supply of
Pacific bluefin."

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.420
The process is basically in-vitro fertilization.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.700
The baby tuna would be naturally born to a
surrogate mackerel parent!

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.990
And the important part for these purposes
is, it would be safe to eat!

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.930
Will this in-vitro fertilization help speed
up the tuna, breeding process?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:57.930
Maybe.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.630
In the wild, tuna take five to eight years
to reach full maturity.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.609
And though a five-year-old female can produce
five MILLION eggs, if the fish don't live

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.800
that long, they don't get to reproduce at
all.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.930
Regulations aren't stopping illegal fishing
operations, and according to the World Wildlife

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.660
Federation fish catches have dropped 80-percent
since the 1990s alone.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.260
There just AREN'T ANY FISH TO CATCH.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.879
And thanks to overfishing, when there ARE
tuna to catch, nine out out ten of them caught

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.590
last year were too young to have bred; removing
them from the population means they'll NEVER

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.080
GET TO BREED and they can't replace themselves
as fast as we're sucking them out of the seas.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.190
And that's just the beginning.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.450
Tuna are an apex predator -- they're at the
TOP of the food chain.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.160
A tuna has to eat its weight in fish every
ten days to stay alive.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.409
If you do that math, one large tuna might
consume 15,000 smaller fish in a year, according

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.409
to National Geographic.

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.732
So removing these apex predators could destroy
the ecosystem and lead to its collapse.

00:02:56.732 --> 00:02:59.060
Keep that in mind next time you go out for
a bite.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.060
Do you eat tuna?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.470
Are you going to change your habits?
