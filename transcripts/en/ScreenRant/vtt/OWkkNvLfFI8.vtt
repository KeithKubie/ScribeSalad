00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.600
As the Marvel Cinematic Universe grows bigger
by the year, the massive, widespread stories

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.010
and villains are becoming a bit harder to
follow.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.730
So with all the time spent getting the big
picture in place, some confusing, hilarious,

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.180
or just plain awesome mistakes have managed
to slip into the finished movies.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.970
We're willing to bet fans have missed plenty,
so here are 10 Editing Mistakes Marvel Movies

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.480
Hope You Missed.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.460
Captain America: The First Avenger
He may be an American hero, but movie fans

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.370
in the Bahamas were just as excited to see
their own cameo in the movie - in the form

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.190
of the Bahamanian flag, flying between the
Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack at the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.190
World Expo.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.480
There's one problem: the flag wasn't created
until 1973.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860
Someone must have noticed, since it completely
disappears in the next shot.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.840
The Avengers
In Hollywood, continuity isn't taken lightly,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.239
with people specifically hired to keep sets,
costumes, and props exactly where they were

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.239
in the previous shots.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
So when Cap takes a serious shot during the
final fight of The Avengers, his suit is destroyed,

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.789
and remains battle damaged into the next scenes.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.400
But those who thought the damage added some
badass cred to Cap's bright costume don't

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.200
have long to enjoy it - the suit is back to
normal in the final scene, when it seems like

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.600
it probably should be there to show how hard
the battle really was.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.130
Thor
When the god of thunder first realizes he

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.159
can no longer lift his famous hammer, he's
taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.140
At least, in the story he is.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.391
In the movie, the sound effects of metal handcuffs
can be heard clearly, but when the camera

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.740
switches to the overhead shot, not only is
it just a white band on his wrists, but so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.830
loose, actor Chris Hemsworth's hands almost
slip out completely.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.090
Ant-Man
Scott Lang's time as a superhero is almost

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.770
cut short when the movie's villain has a gun
to his head, but his trusty ants save the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.049
day, jamming the gun's hammer to keep it from
firing.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.920
Which would be a pretty cool moment, if the
entire scene leading up to it hadn't shown

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.479
they were using Glocks, without external hammers.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.229
They didn't bother getting the actual gun
that would make sense, so were clearly hoping

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.119
viewers weren't paying close enough attention.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.680
It isn't just CG ants who cause problems in
Ant-Man, but good old fashioned reflections,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680
too.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.250
When Scott is parked in his van at night,
it's almost possible for the camera light

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.770
reflected on his chrome mirror to be mistaken
for a neon sign, but when the cameraman's

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.060
face comes completely into view as he pushes
in for a close-up, any chance at missing this

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.459
mistake is out the window.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.830
&nbsp;Iron Man 3
No matter how incredible blockbuster air rescues

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.790
or freefalls might get, the actual math behind
them is almost always a problem.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.610
Or, in the case of Iron Man 3, complete nonsense.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.250
When Tony first sets out to rescue falling
Air Force One passengers, JARVIS lets him

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.980
know that they're at 18,000 feet and falling.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.810
Just 10 seconds later, he claims they're at
10,000 feet.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.760
And just 4 seconds later, they've fallen to
6,000.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.680
A human at terminal velocity is close to 200
feet per second, but according to Jarvis,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.019
they're falling at four times that, and accelerating.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.849
Best to look, and not listen during this scene.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.901
Thor: The Dark World
Some mistakes are down to human error, but

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:48.750
others are... more confusing.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.290
When Thor and Loki are making their escape
from Asgard, the brave Fandral swings onto

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.410
an enemy ship to get the soldiers off their
back.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.170
He first comes in from the left of screen,
before the shot is completely flipped.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.030
There's no explanation meaning this is one
editing decision that simply doesn't make

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.030
sense.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.959
Iron Man
Problems with science are nothing new for

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.620
Marvel, but if there's one thing that's nagged
the movies from the very start, it's the speed

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.659
of sound: the fact that a distant explosion
is always seen before it's heard, since sound

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.860
travels slower than light.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.470
Those disappointed to see the Jericho missile
in Iron Man detonate a split second AFTER

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.440
they heard it have hopefully gotten used to
it.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.250
Since Thor's hammer still rattles ear drums
when it launches a sonic boom, no matter how

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.890
far away it really is.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.150
Somewhere at Marvel, there's a science buff
tearing their hair out.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.739
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
Most fans are willing to forget that it wouldn't

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.860
really be possible for Arnim Zola to live
on as an artificial intelligence thanks to

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.730
a sea of magnetic tape, since the scene it
makes possible is a pretty important one.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.250
The footage from the first Captain America
that he shows to Steve and Natasha is just

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.440
as much of a leap, but we have to draw the
line at being able to broadcast black and

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.640
white film reels and HD newspaper scans on
the green-and-black monochrome monitors actually

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.672
found in the base.

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:59.180
The computer monitors might annoy techies
in the audience, but for those who rely on

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.750
maps or GPS, The Winter Soldier is even worse.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.379
When the coordinates are shown for the satellite
launch ship in the Indian Ocean, both latitude

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.730
and longitude are given in degrees NORTH,
when latitude should be given in East or West.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.330
It's a weird mistake, since the numbers actually
make sense, just not the directions, and it's

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.090
made again when we see the SHIELD Triskellion,
with both coordinates given in NORTH and SOUTH.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.229
Those are just some of the editing mistakes
that seemed to have slipped by the great minds

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.229
at Marvel Studios.

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.420
Are there any we missed?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.400
What other editing mistakes have you noticed?
