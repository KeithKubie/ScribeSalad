00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.070
When it comes to exploring space we can either
all agree on a set of laws that make everybody

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.680
shiny and happy, or it’s like the gorram
Wild West up there.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.959
Ni hao, browncoats, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:15.959
Laws are tricky things.

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.800
They’re complicated and they change from
place to place and over time as new issues

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800
arise.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.130
Like going to space.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.991
See, when the Space Race was launched with
the starter pistol that was Sputnik 1, the

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:30.060
assumption at the time was that a nation’s
sovereignty would extended past their airspace

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.370
and right on into space… space.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.270
And right off the bat those pesky ruskies
had violated it, what with their little pronged

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.020
ball zipping over ‘Merica, beeping at us
all menacing-like.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.079
But no one made a fuss over it the way they
would if a Russian plane flew overhead unannounced,

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.160
because in order for a satellite to stay in
low earth orbit, it has to travel at almost

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.550
28 thousand km an hour (17,300 mph).

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.010
At those speeds there’s no way satellites
can’t fly over other countries.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.460
It’s impractical to claim the space above
your country if it’s just going to get violated

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.840
every 90 minutes.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.850
So should we just say nobody owns space or
everybody owns space?

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.979
Sputnik made it clear space-law needed a rethink.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.212
Ten years later the 1967 Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:16.990
Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including
the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, AKA the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.290
Outer Space Treaty, laid the ground rules
for space etiquette.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.990
Anyone who violates it has to answer to the
United Nations.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.070
104 countries have since ratified the treaty
and it has a number of guidelines that basically

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.020
say space and celestial bodies are for everyone,
except if you have a weapon of mass destruction

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.790
that's a no-no, nations are responsible for
their own public and private stuff that gets

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.040
put up there, and please do your best not
to litter.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.979
That’s another issue Sputnik brought up:
space clutter.

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.969
Ever since its launch we’ve been filling
the skies with more stuff.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.820
How do we make sure satellites are clear of
each other’s orbits?

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.420
The UN keeps a registry of objects launched
into space, but because space is so huge the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.770
odds of hitting something are pretty slim,
making the need to worry about two satellites

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.659
colliding almost a non issue.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.820
So far it’s happened only once.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.060
That’s for low-earth orbit satellites (which
are most of them), but some satellites are

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.060
a special case.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.160
Geostationary satellites orbit so far away
that they go around the earth once a day,

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.020
making them basically hover over the same
spot.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.770
Because these satellites have to be at a very
specific distance and over the equator, there

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.470
are a limited number of slots for them to
occupy.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.880
Another UN agency, the International Telecommunication
Union, coordinates 191 countries and 700 private

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.620
organizations to make sure everyone's satellites
aren’t bumping into each other and that

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.470
no one’s frequencies are interfering.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.600
Applicants are basically assigned parking
spots in space that the satellites have to

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.680
get to, and they can only stay there for so
long before someone else gets the spot.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.850
So, long story short branches of the UN are
in charge of making sure everyone plays nice

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.770
in space, and countries make their own rules
for space travel within that framework.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.800
But more challenges loom on the horizon.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.290
It’s still unclear what we’re supposed
to do about space debris and who is responsible

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.280
for damage that wasn’t caused by negligence.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.970
We’re also going to have to figure out how
to handle commercial human spaceflight or

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:57.970
shipping.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.170
Hopefully it gets figured out before we live
in a Joss Whedon universe of smugglers and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.440
eccentric characters with quippy dialo- you
know what I’m just going to cancel that

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.200
thought before it’s finished.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.870
All this space stuff may seem far away and
irrelevant but it does have an effect in your

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.930
daily life..

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:33.150
To learn what NASA has done for you, check
out Trace’s video here

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.460
So now that you know space law is a thing,
will you be the next Phoenix Wright: spAce

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.460
Attorney?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.590
Or are you more the lawless space-pirate type?
