00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:01.198
Voiceover: In the last video,

00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:03.550
we saw how a bank would account for

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.701
fractional reserve lending
on its balance sheet,

00:00:06.701 --> 00:00:07.602
and we did it with kind of

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:08.549
the conceptual understanding

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.410
that we've been talking about

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.546
fractional reserve
lending the entire time.

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:14.204
Someone deposits 100 million in reserves,

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:16.963
and 90 million of it gets lent out.

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:18.290
Of course, the offsetting liability

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.035
is that person could come at any time

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.271
and demand their money back.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:25.001
When that 90 million of
currency is lent out,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.905
the asset that it's
gotten in exchange for it

00:00:26.905 --> 00:00:29.801
is 90 million worth of IOUs.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.806
Now what I want to do in this video

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:33.036
is to clarify that this
is conceptually a good way

00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:34.810
of thinking about
fractional reserve lending,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.633
but what the bank can actually do

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:37.839
is slightly different than this.

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.272
They can actually create,

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:40.898
they can actually create the

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:44.470
they can expand both the
asset and the liability side

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.204
of their account

00:00:45.204 --> 00:00:46.803
with just 10 million of reserves

00:00:46.803 --> 00:00:49.140
to make this exact same thing happen.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.805
One thing I do want to clarify.

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:51.361
These videos,

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.189
they are not an attempt

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:54.141
to either justify
fractional reserve lending

00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:56.473
or in some way indict
fractional reserve lending.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.007
It's really just to show
how it is accounted for.

00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:00.957
You can take that debate on your own side,

00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:02.677
whether you think it's worth doing or not,

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:04.137
fractional reserve lending.

00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:05.602
Let's take the same example,

00:01:05.602 --> 00:01:07.392
but now let's take an example where

00:01:07.392 --> 00:01:09.371
so we're going to start the
same way that we started

00:01:09.371 --> 00:01:10.666
in the previous video,

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.346
where I go buy,

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:15.069
I go buy $10 million worth of assets,

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:16.072
which are essentially the building

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:17.291
and things for my bank:

00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:19.207
The buildings, the ATM,
the computer systems,

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:20.269
all of that.

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:21.355
I didn't take a loan to do it.

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:22.866
Let's just say I had that money,

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:25.470
so once again, I am
the owner of this bank,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.618
and so I get 10 ...

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:30.406
I have all of the assets are owned by me,

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:33.209
so my owner's equity is $10 million,

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.575
is $10 million.

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:35.957
Now, in this example,

00:01:35.957 --> 00:01:38.376
instead of getting $100
million of deposits

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:39.470
like we saw in the last one,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.201
let's say that person A shows up

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.200
and gives us $10 million of deposits.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.804
So they come,

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.473
and they deposit $10 million of currency,

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:52.072
so $10 million of federal reserve notes.

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:53.528
So write over there, $10 million,

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:55.959
and they can demand,

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.056
person A has a right to
demand their $10 million.

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:02.009
So this person, let's call them person B,

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.620
person B is one-tenth
as wealthy as person A,

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.555
so this is person B.

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:10.751
I'll just call it B's checking,

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.803
B's checking account.

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:14.904
Now, this is going to
seem very unintuitive,

00:02:14.904 --> 00:02:16.410
what I'm about to do.

00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:18.422
Because a bank only has to keep

00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:20.801
of the amount of checkable
deposits they have,

00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:23.376
only 10% of that has to be in reserves,

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.675
and we saw that over here,

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:26.804
instead of just only being able to lend

00:02:26.804 --> 00:02:27.679
this money over here,

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.093
the bank could keep these reserves,

00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:31.802
but then automatically
expand their checking,

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:33.840
their checkable deposits.

00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:35.808
Let's say I go to this
bank right over here,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.292
and I want a $50 million loan.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.137
They're going to say,

00:02:40.137 --> 00:02:41.903
"Okay, is he good for
the $50 million loan?

00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:42.804
"Is he going to put it to good use?

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:43.756
"Is he likely to pay?"

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:45.268
Let's say they do decide

00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:47.204
that Sal is good for the money.

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.876
what they can do,

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:50.204
what they can do,

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:51.805
they're going to lend me the money,

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:54.203
but they don't even have $50 of currency

00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:55.366
to lend the money with.

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.081
What they will do is that they will create

00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.840
a $50 million checking account for me.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.086
So they will create a $50
million checking account,

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.195
so Sal's checking,

00:03:08.503 --> 00:03:09.822
Sal's checking account,

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.245
and obviously, the bank
isn't in the business

00:03:11.245 --> 00:03:12.836
of just giving away money.

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:15.425
What they will do is they'll
have an offsetting asset

00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:16.669
that they will get from Sal,

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:18.540
which is an IOU from Sal.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.219
So let me write it this way.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.374
Loan to Sal would be an asset,

00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:23.124
because in the future,

00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:24.811
Sal's going to pay the bank.

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:26.772
We could call this "Loan to Sal"

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:31.551
or we could call this "IOU from Sal".

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.736
Let's say that Bill comes along,

00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:34.942
I'm just making up names,

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.224
let's say Bill comes along,

00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:38.430
and he wants to borrow another,

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.824
let's say, $40 million,

00:03:39.824 --> 00:03:42.835
and the bank determines
that it's a good investment,

00:03:43.158 --> 00:03:44.171
and so let me actually,

00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:44.866
this is a,

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:45.746
just to make clear,

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:47.645
this was a $50 million,

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:50.179
this was a $50 million IOU from Sal,

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.846
and this is, I have 50 million worth of,

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:55.770
I guess I can write
checks up to $50 million

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.760
to go buy,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.025
this was a $50 million loan,

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:00.022
so I can write checks against this now

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:02.854
to go and build my business or whatever,

00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:04.348
or I could even take those checks,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.337
and I could cash them out,

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:07.674
and of course the bank has to make sure

00:04:07.674 --> 00:04:08.767
it has enough reserves.

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:10.079
It wouldn't want me to show up

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.341
and try to cash out more than $10 million.

00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.829
If that started to happen,

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.496
they would have to go and borrow reserves

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:17.468
from either another bank
or, as a last resort,

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:19.171
from a central bank.

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:20.133
But let's just continue this

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.826
just to show that we can
actually end up having

00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:24.350
identical balance sheets.

00:04:24.873 --> 00:04:27.602
Let's say another businessman,

00:04:27.602 --> 00:04:28.528
let's call him Bill,

00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:29.146
comes along,

00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:31.871
and let's say that he wants
to borrow $40 million.

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.023
So the exact same thing,

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.553
the bank decides to do it,

00:04:34.553 --> 00:04:35.417
so what they will do

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:37.498
is they will lend Bill $40 million,

00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:38.147
but once again,

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:39.405
they don't have that much in reserves.

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:40.603
They will essentially create

00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:42.359
a checking account for Bill.

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:49.023
So, Bill's $40-million checking account,

00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:50.135
and of course they don't want to just

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:50.871
hand him the money,

00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:51.770
there's going to be an offsetting asset

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.940
they get from Bill,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.927
which is essentially a 40-million IOU,

00:04:57.927 --> 00:05:02.494
IOU from Bill.

00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:03.643
Now you might say,

00:05:03.643 --> 00:05:05.849
well, can't the bank just keep doing this?

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.280
Just creating, keep
getting more and more IOUs,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.893
keep, kind of, creating money

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:12.159
because these checking
accounts really are money.

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.876
You're money-creating.

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:14.280
These people can now write checks

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.725
against the bank's ability
to cash those checks,

00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:18.415
and the answer is

00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:20.655
what's limiting this bank right over here

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:22.406
is the reserve requirements.

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:23.346
The bank can only,

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:26.696
the ratio of checkable
deposits to reserves

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:29.068
can only be 10 to 1,

00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:31.003
or reserves have to be at least,

00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:32.996
and this varies from country to country,

00:05:32.996 --> 00:05:33.912
and this can change,

00:05:33.912 --> 00:05:36.249
depending on the policies
of the federal reserve,

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:38.417
and that's one way they
have of controlling money,

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:40.071
although that's not the most typical way.

00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:41.944
They have a reserve requirement here.

00:05:41.944 --> 00:05:43.278
You have a 10%.

00:05:43.278 --> 00:05:46.994
So, 10% of checkable deposits,

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:48.672
and this is true for
large banks in the US,

00:05:48.672 --> 00:05:50.568
have to be held as reserves.

00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:52.950
There has to be reserves for,

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.015
reserves for,

00:05:56.015 --> 00:06:00.071
10% of checkable deposits.

00:06:00.071 --> 00:06:01.664
That's what essentially keeps these banks

00:06:01.664 --> 00:06:02.671
from doing this forever.

00:06:02.671 --> 00:06:04.251
Now, this bank is all tapped out.

00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:06.421
It's limited by the amount of loans it has

00:06:06.421 --> 00:06:07.339
by its reserves.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:08.467
I know it looks a little bit,

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.073
it looks a little bit suspect,

00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:12.110
that they were able to essentially

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.061
create these checking
accounts out of scratch,

00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:15.940
and only have,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.986
they're essentially telling people,

00:06:17.986 --> 00:06:20.083
"Look, there's 100
million that you can have

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:22.077
"on demand now to do whatever you need,"

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:24.032
when they only have 10 million in reserves

00:06:24.032 --> 00:06:24.811
to back that up.

00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.811
The rest of their assets
are IOUs from people,

00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.167
but this is exactly what's happening

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.032
with the other conceptual version.

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:32.763
I guess the more traditional
conceptual reserve,

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.956
the more traditional
conceptual understanding

00:06:35.956 --> 00:06:37.373
of fractional reserve lending.

00:06:37.373 --> 00:06:39.031
You're telling someone
that they have 100 million

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:39.814
on demand,

00:06:39.814 --> 00:06:41.287
but you're loaning 90 million of it out.

00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:42.069
What they really have,

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.595
truly in the vault,

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:45.169
is $10 million.

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.984
So these two things,

00:06:46.984 --> 00:06:47.940
these two things,

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.068
are actually functionally,

00:06:49.068 --> 00:06:51.350
these two things are
completely equivalent,

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.595
and if you have a problem
with one of these,

00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:55.126
if you feel like just
money is being created

00:06:55.126 --> 00:06:55.694
by the bank,

00:06:55.694 --> 00:06:57.439
it's actually happening in both cases.

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.319
In that case, you would be having trouble

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.658
with fractional reserve lending,

00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:04.295
not just this idea right over here.
