1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,690
The idea is that, uh, a reaction,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,640
if you're talking about two similar
reactions to similar reagents,

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:13,850
the one that's more reactive will be
less selective in which product it gives.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,940
So here we have the
example of two radicals,

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,870
a chlorine or bromine atom
reacting with propane.

6
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,940
So when a member of the chain reaction
is that first the at the Halogen Adam

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:31,830
pulls off a hydrogen, generates a radical,
which then takes on a new halogen.

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,340
So wherever that first
hydrogen gets pulled off,

9
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,080
that's where the halogen will end up in
the product. But in the case of probate,

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,840
and they're two different
hydrogens that can,

11
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,260
you can take off the one in the middle
or the one at the end and it's easier to

12
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:50,520
take off the one in the middle
because the radical is more stable.

13
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:55,140
The secondary radical, the internal
one rather than the primary radical.

14
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,440
We talked about that last time,
the extent to which that's true,

15
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:02,730
but w for whether it's differences in
the starting material or differences in

16
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:05,130
the product,
however you slice it,

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,900
it's easier to take off the hydrogen from
the secondary position in the primary

18
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:10,734
position.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,040
So the overall heat of the reaction
as you see here is better by a 2.5

20
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,450
kilocalories for generating the secondary
radical as opposed to generating the

21
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:22,590
primary radical.

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,180
And that's true whether chlorine is
doing the abstracting or bromine is doing

23
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:31,650
the abstracting, right? The same
difference overall in the products,

24
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,150
but the,

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,260
the actual change in energy
is much more positive.

26
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,040
In the case of bromine,
it's harder to do than it is in chlorine.

27
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,030
So bromine is more
reactive. Uh, pardon me.

28
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,150
Chlorine is more reactive
and bromine is less reactive.

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:53,870
But notice that the difference
in the activation energies is,

30
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,920
uh,

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,600
is more dramatic in the case of bromine
that it is in the case of chlorine,

32
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,710
the earlier the transition comes,
the less difference there's going to be.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,250
So chlorine in the more reactive
reagent is less selective and bromine,

34
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,970
the less reactive agent is more selective,
right?

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,660
So this is called the reactivity
selectivity principle.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,560
And it only can apply to the extent
that the transition states are mirroring

37
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:30,690
what the products do and that
the two reactions are very,

38
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,130
very similar to one another.

39
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:34,410
And there's not something
else that makes the reaction.

40
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,850
Transition state come much earlier, much
later with a much different structure.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Okay. Now, so in the case of chlorine,

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,120
the relative rate of forming secondary
versus primary is a factor of four,

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,250
but in the case of bromine, it's almost
10 times as large. The sealer activity,

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,360
it's a factor of 35 that
means in the first case,

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,700
the difference in energies of the Delta,

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,090
Delta g double dagger,
right?

47
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,880
Delta g double dagger is
the activation energy.

48
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,390
But the difference in the activation
energy is 0.8 kilocalories per mole about

49
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,840
one, right? Whereas with
the later transition state,

50
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,780
the difference is very much bigger.
4.5

51
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,200
hi.

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,200
So typically more reactive
means less elective.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,280
So if you were a chemist who wanted to
prepare a certain product that required

54
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:33,210
selectivity,

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,540
you might choose to use a less reactive
reagent rather than a more reactive one.

56
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,410
So you'd get a higher yield
of the material you wanted,

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,600
even if it was a little more difficult
to do with it and took a little longer.

58
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,400
Okay. Now let's look at this a little
more carefully. The fact that the,

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,840
that the difference in
energies of activation in the
case of bromine taking off

60
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:58,410
a primary or a secondary hydrogen is,
uh,

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,550
is the difference in activation is
four and a half kilocalories per mole.

62
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,660
Okay. We just went through why it was
reasonable that it should be large,

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,610
but it shouldn't be that large.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,900
Notice that the difference when you get
all the way to products is two and a

65
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:16,260
half kilocalories per mole.
Right?

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Now we had the idea that relative
to a standard say methane,

67
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,930
right?
The energies for that,

68
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,490
for taking off a secondary
hydrogen should be, uh,

69
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,170
either the starting material is less
stable or the product is more stable,

70
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,760
right? Compared to our standard
methane in this case. But at any rate,

71
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,970
there's an increase in stability relative
to the onset to the normal case up at

72
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:46,380
the top here.
Relative to that,

73
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:50,310
there's an increase in stability as you
go from starting material to this free

74
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:52,230
radical intermediate.
Right?

75
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,090
Now there's a question
where the transition state
comes on that if it's early,

76
00:04:57,091 --> 00:05:00,960
you don't see much of, you don't see
much of that increased stability.

77
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,380
If it comes late, you'll see more
of that stability difference.

78
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,190
Okay.
Okay.

79
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,990
However you see what's nuts here?

80
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,930
What we see is this,
right?

81
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,890
There's more difference at the transition
state than there even is when you get

82
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:19,240
all the way to product.

83
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,023
Okay?

84
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,960
So how can the transition states be more
different in energy than the products

85
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:31,530
are? Right? This might not
be a straight line, right?

86
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,120
But at least you'd expect it to be
monotonic not go down and then up again.

87
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,880
There's something we're missing here.
Okay.

88
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,260
Now in the resonance point of view,
one could look,

89
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,310
the trouble we're having is understanding
the energy of transition states.

90
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,910
Regular molecules were more
or less comfortable with,

91
00:05:50,911 --> 00:05:52,710
but transition states are tougher.

92
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,553
Okay,

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,790
so one way to look at transition states,
well, like Eular, orbital theory.

94
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,890
Another one is with residents theory
and the problem is that you don't know

95
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,470
which of the ar or Vr,

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,620
the hydrogen is bonded to
when it's being transferred.

97
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,360
You could write one resident structure
in which it's bonded to r and bromine is

98
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:15,950
an Adam. Or You could add, right?

99
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,951
Another residence structure where it's
bonded to br and ar is the free radical,

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,790
right?

101
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,170
And it's exactly poised between
those two at the transition state.

102
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,440
That's the definition of the transition
state that you're about halfway there.

103
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,173
Okay.

104
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,210
But what's special about the transition
state is there can be another residence

105
00:06:38,021 --> 00:06:40,850
structure,
a third resonance structure,

106
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:45,230
which has br minus because bromine
after all is electro negative,

107
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,760
right? And our could be plus. Okay.

108
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,050
So we could have at the
transition state here,

109
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,610
we could have cat I and
character to the Ar.

110
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,130
So that will be helpful
at the transition state.

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,400
A third resonance structure here at the
stabilizing things and resonance theory,

112
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,933
right?

113
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,030
But the our cat ion is irrelevant at
when it's our h over here or when it's an

114
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,510
our radical it,
once the radical gets away,

115
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,650
it only has a certain number of electrons,
right? It's not our plus anymore.

116
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,080
So as we'll see next week,

117
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,410
substituted a methyl for hydrogen that
is going from a primary to a secondary

118
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
cad ion, right. Stabilizes
the cat eye on a lot.

119
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:40,040
So this is unusually stable,
but this is important,

120
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,090
this resonance structure
only at the transition state,

121
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,150
not in the starting material
and not in the product.

122
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,320
So we make a mistake in this case if
we assume that the character of the

123
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,250
transition state,

124
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:55,970
it's intermediate between starting
material and product for this one step

125
00:07:55,971 --> 00:08:00,971
reaction right there actually special
factors that apply only in the transition

126
00:08:01,251 --> 00:08:02,084
state.

127
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,350
And we'll see when we talk about Paris
cyclic reactions that this is very

128
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,184
important.

129
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,750
So sometimes factors involved in
stabilizing transition states could be

130
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:15,680
different from those involved
in stabilizing either
the starting materials or

131
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,514
the products.

132
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,090
And in these cases we can't
easily rationalize the
activation energy changes on

133
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:26,510
the basis of the overall exercise
exothermic city or endothermic city of the

134
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,070
reaction step,
right?

135
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,980
Because there's something special
going on at the transition state.

136
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,350
You hope that's not always the case,

137
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,740
that most cases you could do thinking
that more exothermic reactions will be

138
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:44,240
faster. But you have to be careful
in some cases. Right? And as I said,

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,350
we'll see dramatic examples where the
transition state has something special

140
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,160
about it.

141
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,180
When we get to discussing Perry cyclic
reactions in the third quarter of the

142
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,860
course. Okay. Now,

143
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,280
here are two problems for Wednesday
that have to do with free radical

144
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,110
substitution. And you can uh, work in
groups if you went, if you wish. Remember,

145
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,790
we won't have a class on one day and
there won't be discussion section in the

146
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,490
evening on Monday either. Hey, so
here's problem one. Suppose Ma,

147
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,850
as we've just been talking about,

148
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:19,851
mono chlorination of propane gives end
propyl chloride and ISO propyl chloride

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,160
and ratio 43 to 57.
Note,

150
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:27,240
I say mono chlorination because of
course these products can also have a

151
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,910
hydrogen abstracting and you can
get dechlorination chlorination,

152
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:33,960
try chlorination, so on. So if you
want to get these ratios accurately,

153
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,220
you do just a little bit of reaction and
see the first products before you get

154
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,310
subsequent substitutions
on the initial products.

155
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,340
You do just a little conversion
and see what the ratio is.

156
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,560
And in the case of propane,
propane,

157
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,590
it's 43 57 primary and
secondary reply hydrogen places.

158
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:52,560
So if that,

159
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,290
and if Mondo chlorination
of two methyl propane gives,

160
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:58,970
uh,

161
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,900
that's called ISO butane and also gives
t butyl chloride and one chloro to

162
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:07,620
methyl propane,
36 and 64% yields.

163
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,880
Notice this is a little,
uh,

164
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,460
test also on knowing what the structures
are of compounds that have these names.

165
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,040
Then predict the products for mono
chlorination of two methyl butane.

166
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,370
Okay, so you're going to
get relative reactivity of
primary and secondary for one

167
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:30,480
relative reactivity of primary
and tertiary from another.

168
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,170
And then you'll use the
relative reactivity of
secondary and tertiary to solve

169
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,130
the problem. Now you'll find, you'll
find in the textbooks that you have,

170
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:46,131
every textbook I'm confident has this
kind of problem in it about selectivity in

171
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,070
free. Radical chlorination
probably has the same examples.

172
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,150
So consult your textbook on free radical
halogenation to be sure you're taking

173
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:58,200
the statistics of hydrogen
numbers properly into account.

174
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,470
Okay, that's the first problem. The
second problem is solved the puzzle.

175
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:08,400
That's going to be coming up on slide 18.
So hold on and we'll get to that one.

176
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,340
Okay. Now, so we've been talking
about free radical substitution.

177
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,370
Take off a hydrogen and
substituted with a halogen,

178
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,270
but there's another free radical
chain reaction that evolves halogens,

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,030
and that's addition to alkenes.

180
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,270
So the starting material or starting
materials are an alkene and hydrogen

181
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:31,050
haylight,
right?

182
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,510
And somehow you get a radical to
start it off, say a halogen radical,

183
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,370
and instead of pulling off a hydrogen,
it adds to the double bond.

184
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,840
So it gives that intermediate
carbon rat radical.

185
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,460
And then that one is the one that does
an abstraction of hydrogen this time from

186
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:52,620
Hx,
right?

187
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,020
So you get a product where eight x and
h have added to the carbon carbon double

188
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:03,040
bond.
So free radical addition to the outfield,

189
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,270
and it's a chain reaction. Once you get
a radical, it can go round and round,

190
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,400
right? Without getting
rid of radicals. Now,

191
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,310
uh, let's, uh, let's look at the
energetics that are involved in this.

192
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,520
A curious thing about this reaction
is that doesn't work with all x H's.

193
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,880
Okay? Now let's see why. Okay,

194
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,720
so we'll analyze the energies
of the bonds we're using here.

195
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:35,490
Just average bond energies. Okay.
So in the starting material,

196
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,240
we have a carbon carbon double bond
that's worth one 46 and we have,

197
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,600
uh, the x radical and, and,

198
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,270
and also there's x h
the starting material.

199
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:50,770
And in the product we've added the x h
to the alkene making a new carbon carbon

200
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:55,180
bond that's worth 83 kilocalories per
mole and a carbon hydrogen bond that's

201
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:56,230
worth 99.

202
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,510
And we've converted Xh to x radical.
Okay?

203
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,120
So, so if we look at the average, uh,

204
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:10,060
bond energies involving
fluorine for our x, the product,

205
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:12,670
we have 116 that's going to go in here.

206
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,040
And in the starting material we're
going to have HX hydrogen fluoride,

207
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,280
135 that's going to go there.
So we're going to add these together,

208
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:25,240
these bond energies
here. It's 146, uh, for,

209
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:28,930
for the double bond and 135 for the Xh.

210
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,050
In the case of fluorine
and in the product,

211
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:37,051
it's going to be 83 and 99 and 100
and 616 for the carbon fluorine bond.

212
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,780
So we add them together and we find out
this is favorable by 17 kilocalories per

213
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:48,250
mold to do that step. So, uh, pardon me,

214
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:49,780
to do the overall transformation.

215
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:54,520
So it's going to be exothermic
in the case of HF, right?

216
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,800
How about in the case of the other
halogen atoms, right? We can use the,

217
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:03,040
the corresponding values for their
bonds and we get that they're all almost

218
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,090
exactly the same.

219
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,370
So all these additions would
be the same exothermic city.

220
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:12,040
So you might think they'd all
go at about the same rate,

221
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,710
but they don't at all.
Only HBR works.

222
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,773
Why?

223
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,780
The reason is the overall the trends,

224
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,670
the thermodynamics is fine
for the transformation,

225
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,990
but the question is mechanism
and activation energies, right?

226
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,640
And remember there are two
steps in this reaction. First,

227
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:38,500
the x adds to the Alkene,

228
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,650
then the new carbon radical
abstracts a hydrogen.

229
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,150
So we have to look at the individual
steps to get what the activation energies

230
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,650
are.
Okay?

231
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:52,651
So let's first look at that is we
first have to go to this intermediate,

232
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:54,680
which has a single bond worth,

233
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:59,681
83 kilocalories per mole instead of
the double bond worth one 46 okay?

234
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,560
So that's going to be fabulously
exothermic this first step,

235
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,610
okay? So that's very exothermic
should be in very fast.

236
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,620
So that's going to be no problem. That's
in the case of of flury, the blue one.

237
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,450
In the case of chlorine, it's still
exothermic. That should be not as fast,

238
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:25,310
but easy. Still Bromine
still exothermic, right?

239
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,820
But I have done is endothermic.

240
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,650
So that reaction is going to be very slow.
Okay?

241
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:36,500
So we can understand now
why I had done doesn't work,

242
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,890
but why not fluorine and why not chlorine?

243
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,430
Ah, Derrick, you're right. It's the
second step that's hard for them, right?

244
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,840
Because having this intermediate,

245
00:15:47,841 --> 00:15:52,790
we now have to go here by abstracting
the Xh bond and the Xh bond we have to

246
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,700
break in.
The case of fluorine is fabulously strong,

247
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,950
135 kilocalories per mole.

248
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,660
So that reaction is going to be way
endothermic and it'll be very slow.

249
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,890
So the,

250
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:08,300
the cyclic mechanism will cough
on the second step for that one.

251
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,340
Right. And in the case of bromine,
it's also in case of chlorine,

252
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,300
the second step is also a little bit
endothermic so it's not very fast,

253
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,670
right? But in the case
of, of uh, of bromine,

254
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,890
it's,
it's exothermic again,

255
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,040
in the case of identity
wouldn't be exothermic,

256
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,230
but the first step is where
the machine coughed. Okay.

257
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,270
So only Broan me in is set up to do
both of these relatively rapidly.

258
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,710
Now you might say, okay, uh,
we'll just, we'll do the others.

259
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:47,390
We'll just wait longer. Okay. It won't
be as fast because one of the other,

260
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:49,550
the steps will be slow.
We'll just wait.

261
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,000
But you can't do that with
free radical reactions.

262
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,330
Only HBR works fast enough in both steps
and you need both steps to be fast.

263
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,180
Now we're going to get to that to,

264
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:07,181
to discussing what would happen otherwise
if both steps aren't fast in just a

265
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:07,580
minute.

266
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,250
But first I want to comment on one
other aspect of addition to the alkenes.

267
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,480
They're what's called Riggio specificity.
I don't particularly like that word,

268
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,410
but it has to do with when
you add HX to a double bond,

269
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,630
there are two regions they could go to.

270
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,920
The h could go here and the
x here or vice versa. Okay.

271
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,780
So when we add HX,

272
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:34,520
we could imagine x going to this
carbon or h going to this carbon.

273
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,080
Right.

274
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,490
And it turns out that for any
halogen that can undergo edition,

275
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,423
right?

276
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,470
There's a principle called Markov
knockoff orientation after a Russian,

277
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,960
a chemist, the latter part
of the, of the 19th century.

278
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,640
And he discovered this in 1870 just
about the time that people knew about

279
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,720
structures of course,

280
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,050
that what you tended to get was the
more substituted haylight that is the ex

281
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:07,740
went to the carbon between these two
that has more substituents on it.

282
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,030
Right.

283
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,030
And it's understood in terms of initial
addition of h plus this was figured out

284
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:16,440
in the 1930s.
Right.

285
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,630
And it's because of this ionic
mechanism that we'll discuss in a,

286
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,140
in three weeks that, that uh, the
mark cognit cough orientation works.

287
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,270
We'll talk about that when we come to it.

288
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,580
But what's important is when you do
this HBR edition by the free radical

289
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,740
mechanism,
the cyclic mechanism,

290
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,870
you get the anti Markovnikov product.
It goes exactly the other way.

291
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,420
The bromine goes on the
less substituted carbon.

292
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,750
So this was quite a mystery for people
in the early part or from 1870 on why bro

293
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:53,220
me and with some time HBR
was sometimes a bad actor.

294
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,900
Sometimes it would give the Markovnikov
product the expected when that all the

295
00:18:57,901 --> 00:19:00,150
other ha ha hydrogen haylight we give,

296
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,710
but sometimes it gave the other and it
didn't. It tended not to give mixtures.

297
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,840
It would give all one or all of the other.

298
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,320
But in the 1930s 1933 it was found out
that this happened when the samples

299
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,050
contained little bits of peroxide.

300
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,900
Now let's see why that is.

301
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,910
It's because it's an initiator
of radical change. Remember,

302
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:27,540
you needed some way to have a
radical to begin this whole process.

303
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,890
So if you have r o r of peroxide
and Hbr and the owl keyed,

304
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,660
the first thing that happens in this
mechanism is that you break the o bond to

305
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,910
get to Aro radicals.

306
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,540
Now you have the radical that
can do a hydrogen abstraction.

307
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,060
So it abstracts hydrogen from Hbr
and now you're into the machine.

308
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,260
You have X. Dot. That can
add to the Alkene, right?

309
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,900
And get one or the other
of those two radicals.

310
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,560
Now if you've got the radical on the left,

311
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,030
you'd get Markovnikov orientation,
cause h would come here the next time,

312
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:07,860
but abstracts h from HBR.

313
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,060
But in fact this is the one you get
because the secondary radical is more

314
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:19,290
stable. Okay? So when
you're getting radicals,

315
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:22,830
you get that one rather than
the primary radical, right?

316
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,020
So now,
so that's,

317
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:31,050
that explains that the regio specificity
of the special addition of Hbr,

318
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:34,710
but only if you can get free radicals.
Now,

319
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:39,540
why can't you just do
it, uh, waiting longer?

320
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,160
This has to do with the rate law
when you have a catalytic cycle,

321
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,010
right?
So there to discuss it in this case.

322
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,280
But it's important in all sorts
of cases where there's Catalin,

323
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,960
[inaudible] and Inorganic
Chemistry and biochemistry.

324
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,450
When they're catalin this
and you have these cycles,

325
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,500
the rate laws you get are a little bit
different from what you might expect.

326
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:02,830
Okay? So where there are
two steps in this reaction.

327
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,940
The first step has a certain rate
constant and of course the rate then

328
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,450
multiplies that rate constant
by concentrations to get a rate.

329
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,740
And the two reagents are
our h and X. Dot. Okay.

330
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,840
Then there's the second step,

331
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:21,841
which has some other rate constant k two
and it's starting with Delia's starting

332
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:27,190
materials are in this case, the
dye halogen and R. Dot. Okay.

333
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,190
Now, a couple of years
ago when we were having a,

334
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:33,940
like a visiting lecture by
a Berry Sharpless who uh,

335
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,840
who won the Nobel prize in
Catalin assists, he made it,

336
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:39,640
you can look at his
lecture if you want to,

337
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:43,240
but one thing he said caught
my imagination. He said,

338
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:46,240
this is a real democracy.
Catalin Isis.

339
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,850
What did he mean by it being a democracy?

340
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,040
It's because when this thing
is going around, right,

341
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,770
these two rates have to be equal.

342
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,690
Whatever k one times those is
has to equal k two times those.

343
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,800
And the,
the concentration of the free radicals,

344
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:10,390
we'll adjust the ratio of the
two to make those two equal.

345
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,740
What would happen if the first one we're
really fast and the second one were

346
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:19,630
slow, then you would
convert x.to R. Dot. Okay.

347
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,970
So you'd have a big R. Dot. Which would
favor the second one and a small x.

348
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:28,120
Dot on the first one, and
soon, soon they'd become equal.

349
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:33,010
And then the thing could go around
at whatever rate that they allow.

350
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,630
But both steps are involved.
These two things become equal.

351
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,720
So that's what he meant by a
democracy that they were equal.

352
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,320
Now you can see an example of that.
If you look down on the,

353
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,760
on the Garden State Parkway here,
uh,

354
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,680
notice that for the,
for the cars going north,

355
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,110
uh, there's a lot of difference between
these lanes of traffic and these lanes of

356
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,800
traffic. And the same is
true here. There's a big
difference between those two.

357
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,563
Okay?

358
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,460
And the reason is that this is
Kay ash and this is easy pass.

359
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,890
Okay?
So if we look just at the cash lanes,

360
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,550
you notice that there's
a low rate constant here.

361
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,330
You've got lots of starting material
building up its concentration,

362
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:27,070
trying to get through paying,
okay. But once they get through,

363
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,830
they can accelerate and go on fine,
right?

364
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,850
So here you have a right
high rate constant. Here you
have a low rate constant,

365
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,760
but the number of cars per minute,

366
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,290
the fluxes here and here are the same,
right?

367
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,660
The cars that come here also end up here.

368
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,250
So the is that here you have
high concentration. Here
you have low concentration,

369
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,830
but the rates are the same.

370
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,980
The small rate constant paying cash times
the high concentration is the same as

371
00:23:57,441 --> 00:24:01,310
the big rate constant. Once you've
speeded up times the low concentration.

372
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,220
So it's the same as you go
around in the cycle, right?

373
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,100
The rates of the two have to be the same,

374
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:10,880
even though the rate constants are
different. So the concentrations adjust,

375
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,290
right? And you'll notice as
Sharpless said in that lecture,

376
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,930
if there's a slow step like this one,

377
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,180
then there's 99.9% of the titanium
is what he was calling you about.

378
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:26,630
Remember we talked about that last time?
That's what he was talking about.

379
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:30,770
They're stuffed before this big mountain
that goes way up like Mount Everest.

380
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:35,270
He said he's a colorful speaker.
If you get that barrier down,

381
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:39,050
then the rate goes way up. And if
you get them all at the same height,

382
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,520
then you're really rolling.
So notice that's what happens.

383
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:48,500
The easy pass lane, right?
That the uh, that the uh,

384
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,520
that they go at the same rate because
you've gotten that first big rate,

385
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:57,140
determine that rate constant down,
up the barrier down for that first step.

386
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,780
Okay? Now let's, let's, uh, apply that
principle back to this catalytic cycle.

387
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,550
So we had from the previous slide that
these two had to be equal when the,

388
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,160
when the machine is running.
Okay?

389
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:14,540
Now suppose k one is
small and k two is large.

390
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,640
Okay?
So now,

391
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:21,641
how does the rate the amount of material
you produce per minute depend on the

392
00:25:22,611 --> 00:25:24,290
concentration of r h?

393
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,450
Yeah,

394
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:31,530
well, we can look here. If
we, let's suppose what this,

395
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,880
we could rearrange this to say
that the ratio of X. Dot. R.

396
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:40,881
Dot is k two times x two over k one
times rh that we get by just dividing

397
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:46,260
through, right? So we know
the ratio of these two,

398
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,270
but the total of the two, right? But
there's a certain amount of radical there.

399
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,770
It could be as you go around the cycle,
it could be either in the form of x.

400
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:59,700
Dot or in the form of R. Dot.
So the ratio can change, right?

401
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:02,460
But the total amount is limited.
Okay,

402
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,840
so let us suppose that x.is dominant,
right?

403
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:11,910
Suppose there's 98 to two
the ratio of X. Dot. R. Dot.

404
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,793
Okay.

405
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,850
And now let's double the amount of our H,
right?

406
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,270
We're leaving the radicals the same, but
we're doubling the amount of RH, right?

407
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,770
So we're going to double
this. Double this, right?

408
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:32,150
Leave that the same. These are fixed
constants, but we're doubling this.

409
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,090
So what's going to happen?
The ratio is going to change.

410
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,920
That's what we've just been talking
about, right? So instead of 98 to two,

411
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,200
we have to get a ratio
that's only half that big,

412
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,050
right? We have a hundred radicals to deal
with. They're in the form of 98 X. Dot.

413
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:55,250
And to R. Dot. And we want to, we have to,

414
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,970
if we double rh up here, right? We're
interested in what that exponent is.

415
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,380
We double our age.
We're going to have that ratio.

416
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,700
How will we do it?
We still have a hundred radicals,

417
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,710
right? But instead of 98 to two, it's,

418
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,630
if we assume that the sum is constant,
we are going to have 96 to four.

419
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,040
Everybody see that? That's twice.
That's that's this is half.

420
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,770
This ratio is half that ratio.
Very close.

421
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,053
Okay.

422
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,210
But no, how much did that change?
The concentration of X. Dot.

423
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,620
It notice that doubled the
concentration of R. Dot.

424
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,190
But it hardly changed the concentration
of X. Dot. At all in relative terms, what?

425
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:47,040
Just went to 96 from [inaudible] 98 right?

426
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,690
So x.is still the same concentration,
right?

427
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,390
So the rate of the rate at
which you go through here,

428
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:58,650
which is the same as the rate you go
through here, is now the same here.

429
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,790
This one has been doubled and
this one is practically the same.

430
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,770
It's 96 instead of 98.

431
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,400
So what happened to the rate approximately

432
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,300
that the rate doubled?

433
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,250
So who's surprised that when you
double the starting material here,

434
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:21,630
you double the rate that is that
the question mark there is about to,

435
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,660
I see no hands, right?
What do you expect? Okay,

436
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,520
so that grows,
this rate grows by that Mt.

437
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:36,420
1.96 fold practically too,
right?

438
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,050
So it's,
it's first order in rh.

439
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,330
Did I say too before it's first
order in our age, no one's surprise.

440
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,580
Okay, so the rate, and of course the
rate is also proportional to k one.

441
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,973
Okay.

442
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,340
Now how about if we change the
concentration of x to what's its exponent?

443
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,180
So let's do the same analysis. Now we're
going to double, we're going to double,

444
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,430
uh,
x two.

445
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:10,980
So we'll double x two and now
we're going to have to, uh,

446
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:16,020
we're going to have to double,
uh, the ratio of X. Dot. R. Dot.

447
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,900
Right?
Remember we're starting from 98 to two.

448
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,870
What do we do in order
to double that ratio?

449
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,740
We have to go 99 to one.
Everybody see that?

450
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,370
Okay,
now going nine,

451
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,500
that's now going to make a difference
because if we look at this rate,

452
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,710
which is the same as that rate,
it's the same k to the same,

453
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,310
uh, uh, the same, uh, department,

454
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,330
we doubled x too. But R. Dot.

455
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,760
Is now only half as big as it was before.

456
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,373
Okay?

457
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,160
So, uh, we, we doubled x
too, but we have R. Dot.

458
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,140
So we did an accelerated the doll,

459
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:09,430
right?

460
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,410
So it's zero order and next to,

461
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,670
so it depends on the concentration
to this starting material,

462
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:17,350
the one that goes into the slow step.

463
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,160
But it doesn't depend on the
concentration of this starting material.

464
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:22,810
The one that goes into the fast step.

465
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,230
Yeah,

466
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:28,250
that's, so that's a, that's probably if
I had asked you, my guess is if I, the,

467
00:30:28,251 --> 00:30:31,460
I should've, we should've done this
as a democracy is Sharpless said,

468
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,260
and I should have asked you before,

469
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,800
what do you think that exponent is and
what do you think act that exponent, this,

470
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,120
my guess is you'd have said they're
both one, but in fact that one. Zero.

471
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,270
Yeah.

472
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,900
Okay. The rate is also there. For
instance, if it's insensitive to x two,

473
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:51,640
it's also insensitive to k
two. Okay. So in summary,

474
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,610
when one step of a cycle is
much slower than the others,

475
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:59,650
the rate of cycling is pretty insensitive
to the rate constant and concentration

476
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:01,840
of the incoming region for the fast step.

477
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,413
All right.

478
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,350
Because concentration of the minor
form of recycling reagent adjust to

479
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:12,850
compensate and fractional changes in
concentration of the dominant radical are

480
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:17,710
much more modest. Okay.
Uh, so the rates, uh,

481
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,100
obviously going to be proportional
to the amount of radical no,

482
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,980
there's no surprise that if
you're running 13 machines,

483
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:27,520
it's going to be 13 times faster
than running just one machine.

484
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,270
But that's the other factor that we were
going to get to a few minutes ago that

485
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:36,271
we're going to have initiation
and termination and in by
fancying up the slides.

486
00:31:37,121 --> 00:31:40,870
I forgot to animate that
properly, sorry. Okay,

487
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:46,170
so initiation typically involves breaking
a weak bond with light heat or adding

488
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:51,280
an electron or sometimes taking
away an electron. So heat,

489
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:55,990
you can take a week bond and with
heat break it to get to radicals.

490
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:59,860
The oxygen oxygen bond is unusually weak
as we are going to be discussing not

491
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:03,040
long from now. Right?
Or you can use light.

492
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,180
We talked about this last semester
already. Take an electron that's in sigma,

493
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:10,210
put it in Sigma Star and the
chlorides will come apart.

494
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,693
All right,

495
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,530
this one has an energy, a 30
kilocalories per mole. What? What?

496
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:20,470
What are the energies of
other sigma bonds? We've been
talking about more or less

497
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,200
C, C or c h for example, order magnitude.

498
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,030
100 right? Three times a strong.
So this is an unusually weak bond.

499
00:32:33,031 --> 00:32:34,400
So you can do it with heat.

500
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:39,440
And the reason it's weak is because
you have repulsion among these unshared

501
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:42,650
pairs of electrons that you
don't have in the other cases.

502
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,730
We'll talk about that in just
a minute as well. All right?

503
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,260
Or you can put an electron
into Sigma Star, right?

504
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:55,010
By a reduction reaction and get Ooh,
minus.

505
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,290
But the free radical,
Ooh,

506
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,220
which could do a hydrogen abstraction
and start the chain, right?

507
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,820
But even if you're generating radicals,
right,

508
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,920
you can lose by radicals being destroyed.
Because if both, remember we said,

509
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:17,180
why not just wait longer and let this
machine go around even if it's going

510
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,014
slower?

511
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:23,110
The reason is that's not all the radicals
can do abstracting hydrogens or add

512
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:26,600
into double bonds if
radicals find each other.

513
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:31,010
The Somo Somo reaction is really easy,
right?

514
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:35,030
It's all downhill and
energy. All right? Uh,

515
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,670
so you have to be sure
they don't find partners.

516
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:42,320
And that process is called termination
of a free radical chain reaction.

517
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,820
So you have initiation that generates
the radicals that allow the machine to

518
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:48,740
work propagation.

519
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,510
That's the cycling of the machine and
termination, which destroys the machines,

520
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,970
right? You remember the, uh, New Hampshire
license plate? It says live free or die.

521
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,230
If the radicals aren't free from
one another, Bingo, they're gone.

522
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,740
So that's termination.
Okay,

523
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:10,010
so now how about the kinetic
order in the amount of initiator?

524
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,020
You might think if you initiate,
uh, the chains twice as fast.

525
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:18,500
If you make, if you have twice
as many machines operating,

526
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,640
then the rate,
the reaction should be twice as fast.

527
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,550
That overall rate should be twice as fast,
but that won't,

528
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,380
that isn't true as you'll see here.

529
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:31,790
So the initiation indeed depends
on how much initiator you have.

530
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,420
And it has a certain rate constant
for initiation to give those radicals.

531
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,110
And the rate of four radicals
is therefore first order.

532
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,350
It's proportional to the
concentration of the precursor,

533
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,580
a termination as two radicals
coming together. Uh, it,

534
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:51,200
it could be any radicals.
It could be the x dots coming together.

535
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,980
It could be our dots coming
together, or it could be an r. Dot.

536
00:34:54,981 --> 00:34:58,910
Coming together with an X. Dot. All
of those reactions are a radical plus.

537
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,350
A radical will terminate.

538
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,310
And the rate of destroying
radicals is of course second order.

539
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,650
And how many radicals there are,
right?

540
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:11,060
Because two of them have to come
together and it's steady state.

541
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:16,690
Once the thing is cranking along
the rate of initiation and the,

542
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,730
which is this right here,

543
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,010
and the rate of termination must be
the same cause we're in a steady state.

544
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,590
We're not changing the number of machines.
Okay?

545
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,200
So once we get to steady state,

546
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:33,470
then those two will be a
proportional to one another.

547
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:35,690
Or the amount of R.

548
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,690
Dot is proportional to the peroxide
to the one half power because of that

549
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,720
termination, right? So in fact,

550
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,670
if the rate of the reaction
is proportional to how
many machines you have to,

551
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:51,504
the R.
Dot.

552
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,850
Is proportional to the square root
of the amount of initiator there,

553
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,670
because the destruction is second order.

554
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,580
So that's an interesting additional rate
law that when you see that half order

555
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,440
in this case, it means that
there's a chain reaction going on,

556
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:13,410
right?
And termination is involved.

557
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,460
So the answer is one half order.

558
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,150
And now we're going to,

559
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,270
we're going to shift from free radical
reactions toward ionic reactions by

560
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:32,550
considering free radical
reactions that involve ions.

561
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,080
And the reason this is important to
make this transition is because ionic

562
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:44,010
reactions are so different because
they're dependent on solvent in ways that

563
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:45,390
radical reactions aren't.

564
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,330
So here's another substitution reaction
where now instead of a halogen,

565
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,790
instead of having CLC l here,

566
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,060
we have a nitrogen chlorine bond.
Okay?

567
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:01,850
So we have nitrogen radicals that can
pull off hydrogen to generate an a mean

568
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,270
the Nh bond of an amine and give a
free radical just as we did before,

569
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:10,170
which then can pull chlorine
off here to make RCL.

570
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,390
So we can do free radical halogenation,
but instead of using a halogen,

571
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,400
we use a Clore of mead.
Right now,

572
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,260
this bond is about a hundred kilocalories
per mole. This one is a weak bond,

573
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:29,610
about 46 calories, calories
per bowl. Again, like chlorine,

574
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:34,170
chlorine would be a weak bond,
and those product ones are strong bonds.

575
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:39,120
So the first step is a
little bit exothermic.

576
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,370
And the last step is, is, uh, pardon me.

577
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,050
The first step goes from a strong
bond to a weak bond. It's Endothermic,

578
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,080
right?
So that slow the second one,

579
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:56,760
it goes from a weak bond to a strong bond
that's exothermic. So that one's fast.

580
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,280
So this,
the top one is the slow step,

581
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,840
but that means that this will be the
dominant species between these two.

582
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:07,530
You'll have a lot of this so that
this rate can be equal to this rate,

583
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:11,220
not much R. Dot. At any given time. Okay?

584
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,690
And this is then what happens?
We have the free radical, uh,

585
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:22,110
which approach, which, uh, uh, pardon me,

586
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:25,920
two free radicals can
come together in this way.

587
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:30,210
That one radical takes the hydrogen
from this ice appropriate group,

588
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,640
the hydrogen here from the other one.

589
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,580
So that's the termination of
the rate of reaction, right?

590
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,130
That's what's going to kill it,
right?

591
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:42,910
So that's slowing the reaction
down by destroying machines.

592
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,150
So if we could retard this process,

593
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,890
then we can speed up the reaction.
If you don't have termination anymore.

594
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,293
Now,

595
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,500
so this is termination by
hydrogen atom transfers.

596
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,880
Get rid of the radicals
and stop the machine.

597
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,760
Now what happens if you add acid?

598
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,620
Yeah.

599
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,300
Now you protonate the unshared
pair here in the mean,

600
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,760
right,
and charge.

601
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:15,330
We'll keep the member the most
of the radicals are in this form,

602
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,110
right?
Okay.

603
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,470
But the charge, if they're both
charged, it'll keep them apart.

604
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,080
And if they're a apart,
then they don't terminate.

605
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,220
So you can slow down the termination
by protonating these free radicals.

606
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,320
Yeah.

607
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,210
Now let's look at these results
from 1971 on using this reagent.

608
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:43,040
This is one step in the reaction that
chloro mean to to a substitute to halogen

609
00:39:44,671 --> 00:39:47,080
eight a long chain alcohol.

610
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,133
Okay?

611
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,150
So what are graphed here is what percent
of isomers you get for substitute for

612
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:58,630
putting chlorine on this carbon or this
carbon or this carbon or this carbon or

613
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,130
this cover of this carbon.
This carbon.

614
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,253
Okay.

615
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,390
And you can see that you don't get more
than 20% of any of them and you get a

616
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:12,950
real dog's breakfast mixture
here of the vise verse.

617
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:15,170
This is useless, right? You'd have to do,

618
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,020
you get a very low yield and
whatever it was you wanted.

619
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,300
And you have to do a lot
of work to purify it.

620
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,810
If you do it in 50% sulfuric acid,
right?

621
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,240
It's pretty much the same story.

622
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,810
If you do it in 60% sulfuric acid,
it's a little bit better.

623
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,490
You get more of this,

624
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,513
okay?

625
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,920
But if you do it in 70% sulfuric acid,

626
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,840
you get almost all of
this material chlorination
specifically at that position.

627
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:54,600
So isn't that a great mechanism? Right?
By choice, by changing the solvent,

628
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,310
by making it a strong acid,

629
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,090
you can make it selective for this one.

630
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,000
See the advantage of that
obvious in synthesis.

631
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,433
Why?

632
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:11,900
Why wouldn't you change from notice?
50 and 60% didn't make much difference,

633
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,734
a little difference,

634
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,910
but going to 70% really
zoomed up on that one.

635
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,420
So why does change in
the acid concentration
influenced the seal activity?

636
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,920
I notice those are mead radicals
are not really strong basis.

637
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,560
It takes a very strong acid
to get most of this stuff.

638
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,480
Protonated right? To
add another, uh, to add,

639
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,200
to add this proton on there
takes a really strong acid.

640
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,230
When you get to 70% it's
almost, well, pardon me,

641
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,410
I said exactly the wrong
thing and I apologize.

642
00:41:58,411 --> 00:42:02,090
I forget what I just said for
the last 20 seconds. Okay.

643
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,770
The amine is a reasonable base.
It's easily protonated.

644
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,980
Even in weak acid,
this is protonated,

645
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,870
but there's another base in the
system that's hard to protonate.

646
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,090
And what's that
Sebastian?

647
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:23,150
The alcohol could be protonated,

648
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,530
but you need a really strong acid
to protonate the alcohol. Okay?

649
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:33,130
So if you hear the r o h has
half protonated right now,

650
00:42:35,631 --> 00:42:37,790
if it's,
if this molecule is protonated,

651
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:41,930
it's hard to get the two protonated things
together. So the reaction slows down,

652
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,020
the reaction,
the reaction still proceeds,

653
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:49,280
but it goes with the material
that's not protonated. Okay.

654
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,750
And it's only half protonated,

655
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,150
but at 70% it's fully protonated.
Everything is like that.

656
00:42:56,151 --> 00:43:00,740
Now the reaction will slow down, right?
So it won't be as fast. But what,

657
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,300
what's the advantage?

658
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,680
It's hard for the charges to get together,

659
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,430
so they'll stay apart
to the extent they can.

660
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,223
So what

661
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,583
I,
Aisha,

662
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,290
what react here near the other positive
charge. It'll react out at the end.

663
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,800
It'll get a secondary cut.
Hydrogen, not the primary.

664
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:34,180
Why don't we've talked about that
already, right? But it gets this one,

665
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,220
not even this one,
right?

666
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,830
Isn't that a cute idea to use the
charges to make the things selective,

667
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,570
but it only happens if you can
make both reagents be charged.

668
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:47,020
This one's easy to charge,

669
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:50,410
but this one only when you get
in very strong sulfuric acid.

670
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,470
So I've always admired that experiment.

671
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:55,740
Yeah.

672
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,280
Okay. So it comes down there in
order to do, it's a reaction.

673
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,740
Now what I haven't
shown is reacting there.

674
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:07,370
Yeah,

675
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,800
and this is going to be
related to your next problem.

676
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,390
So if you use 30% sulfuric acid,

677
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,390
then you get a completely
different product.

678
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:21,590
Remember I went 50 60 70 but if you,
if you,

679
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,760
if you use 30% sulfuric acid,
then you get that product.

680
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:27,960
Yeah.

681
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,150
This carbon becomes an ester

682
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,220
or an acid.

683
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,510
So this carbon gets oxidized.

684
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:43,511
The two H's are removed and oxygen's put
on and that probably got formed from an

685
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:48,020
Aldehyde. The first thing that
probably happened was that you,

686
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,520
that you changed this ch,

687
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:53,660
two o h two c double bond o h.

688
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:55,783
Okay.

689
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,380
And mostly that's formed not by erratic.

690
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,070
It could be four by the
radical chain reaction, right?

691
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,840
But probably it's not.

692
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,890
It's probably formed by a
Homo Lubo reaction call.

693
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:12,700
An oxidation reaction
involving this reagent,

694
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,810
right?
Remember the original reagent we're using,

695
00:45:16,811 --> 00:45:21,811
the thing you put in is chloramines
and cl and an as 30% acid.

696
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:22,810
It's protonated.

697
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:28,030
So it's probably a reaction
between this stuff at this, right?

698
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:30,280
It could be the free radical reaction,

699
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,110
but it's probably a Hobo Lumo reaction
that's able to convert this to that.

700
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,700
And this is that puzzle that your
other problem for a week from today,

701
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,770
since we're not having a class on
Monday or a week from the apartment next

702
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:45,790
Wednesday,
uh,

703
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
the puzzle is to propose mechanisms to
form the Aldehyde involving both sub two

704
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,630
steps,
a substitution,

705
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:01,770
but also an elimination reaction
reaction with a base pay.

706
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:07,900
So now that substitution reaction could
either be the radical substitution,

707
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:09,550
this mechanism going like that,

708
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,550
or it could be a homo Lumo reaction.
Right?

709
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,750
So you, I've said you could get
together and work on this in groups.

710
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,420
So I think you should be
able to do both of these,

711
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:25,270
both the free radical
substitution and the Hobo Lobo,

712
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,450
that together with elimination,
right,

713
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,900
removing HX gives rise to the Aldehyde.

714
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:36,520
So see if you can figure out why at 30%
so very cast that you get a completely

715
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:39,970
different product.
Uh,

716
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,770
I think that's enough for now. Yeah.
We'll go onto this problem next time.
