00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:11.456
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: All right,
go ahead and walk.

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:13.616
Look for those organic materials.

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:17.396
You can look on the ground, in the beds.

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:18.726
&gt;&gt;Students are really engaged.

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:22.146
They're excited to learn about
the gardens and the impact

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:23.586
on the students has been amazing.

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:27.306
It just really lets them explore
and use that curiosity to learn.

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:36.126
&gt;&gt;Katie: We built our first garden
over in first grade, taking out a space

00:00:36.126 --> 00:00:38.006
that was where people dumped furniture

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:42.296
and we just slowly changed
one area at a time each year.

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:45.506
&gt;&gt;Elaine: We started a couple
years ago by putting in a few beds,

00:00:45.706 --> 00:00:48.936
just planting with the kids and
trying to figure out gardening

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:50.936
and working it into the curriculum.

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:53.256
We went through the Nevada
state standards

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:57.286
and the Next Generation standards and
we wrote curriculum based on that.

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.226
You'll see the art teacher
out there with the kids.

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:02.636
There's math, science,
there's everything.

00:01:02.856 --> 00:01:06.236
When they're working in the gardens,
it's all tied to our standards.

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:08.796
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: We want to be able
to feed our worms and we want

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:10.346
to be able to add to our compost.

00:01:10.846 --> 00:01:15.246
&gt;&gt;We typically do a garden lesson
at least two to three times a month.

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:19.176
Part of our science curriculum
is looking at plants and nature,

00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:21.966
so we thought it was a
great asset for students

00:01:22.026 --> 00:01:26.676
to learn how they can reuse
scraps and soil and worms,

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:28.086
to help make our soil better.

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:32.176
&gt;&gt;Malachi: An organic thing
is something that humans eat

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:35.046
and then they throw away,
but they can actually put it

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.816
in a compost or in the dirt.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:40.286
I think this is more important
than math and science,

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:42.226
because you're helping nature grow.

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:44.876
&gt;&gt;Katie: Initially, I just
wanted my students to know

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:47.536
that vegetables don't come
from the grocery store.

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:51.106
They come from the soil, from the
ground, they grow and it's a process.

00:01:51.106 --> 00:01:58.976
To do a lesson once in a classroom with
a lima bean in the window is not enough.

00:01:59.506 --> 00:02:01.796
&gt;&gt;Student: We're checking if the
worms, they pooped or they peed.

00:02:02.706 --> 00:02:04.026
We check it by this.

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:09.656
We need the pee so we can water our
flowers and make them grow more.

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.396
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: Students are actually

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:14.286
in the gardens every day,
even if it's only briefly.

00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:16.456
So sometimes it's something,
just a ten minute activity

00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:17.346
where they're maintaining.

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:22.086
&gt;&gt;Alana: I check to see if the soil
is moist by dipping my finger in.

00:02:22.086 --> 00:02:27.336
The last thing I have to do is
turn the compost bins around.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:31.846
I've got to see if there's any problems,
and if there is, I check off yes

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:33.096
and then write it down here.

00:02:33.606 --> 00:02:36.656
I think one day, maybe I'll
have a garden of my own.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:40.656
&gt;&gt;Elaine: It might look like they're
running around, but they're really not.

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:44.556
They have very specific jobs, and
they're planting and they're harvesting

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:47.546
and they're checking for bugs
and they're collecting seeds.

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:51.506
They're planning farmer's markets
so that we can sell the produce

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:53.866
and make money to fund the gardens.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:57.546
The enthusiasm for learning
is just incredible.

00:02:57.816 --> 00:03:02.716
You can start by planting a few seeds
in a pot, the kids, they'll respond.

00:03:02.716 --> 00:03:04.026
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: Come on under the tree.

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:05.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Can I put this in?

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:06.736
&gt;&gt;Roshelle: Is it organic?

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:07.000
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:10.696
&gt;&gt;Katie: They get to go outside and
teach lessons in a different way

00:03:10.696 --> 00:03:13.486
than what they would have, had
they been inside their classroom.

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:15.936
There's a purpose for being
outside and in the garden.
