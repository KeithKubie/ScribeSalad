00:00:00.717 --> 00:00:01.728
- Hello Grammarians!

00:00:01.728 --> 00:00:03.190
Today I want to talk about one of the

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.023
absolute thorniest issues
in usage of English.

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:11.781
And it's the difference between
there, their and they're.

00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:13.013
And if you can't tell the difference

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.461
from the way I'm saying it

00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.274
that's because it's
really confusing and evil.

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:19.283
And that is why I'm here.

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.342
Is to help you make a distinction between

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:23.778
these three sound alike words.

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:26.848
Now, first of all we have there T-H-E-R-E

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:28.506
which we're gonna use orange for

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:30.924
is an adverb and an adjective.

00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:34.591
And it's used to signify
where something is.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:39.799
So the way to remember that
this one is all about location

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:42.808
is just to take the "T"
and replace it with a "W".

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:47.571
The question is "Where?"
and the answer is "There".

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.654
So, "Have you been to
Greece? Yes, I went there."

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.030
I have not gone there.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.360
"Have you seen my dog?
Yes, there's my dog!"

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.827
So you asked the question,
"Where did you go? I went there.

00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:02.202
"Where is my dog? There is my dog."

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:05.482
And technically this is
an adverbial use, here.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.457
"There" is modifying "went".

00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:10.283
And here is an adjectival use.

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:13.200
Because "there" is modifying "dog".

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.153
The second member of this confusing trio

00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:21.320
is their T-H-E-I-R which
is a possessive determiner.

00:01:22.717 --> 00:01:24.711
Let's just call that a possessive.

00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.273
So this is when something belongs

00:01:27.273 --> 00:01:29.993
to a "they" and it's an adjective.

00:01:29.993 --> 00:01:32.930
So let's just call this
a possessive adjective

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.448
for some, for a "they".

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:38.679
"Sue and Frieda ate
their ice cream cones."

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.011
So T-H-E-I-R, the possessive
answers the question

00:01:43.011 --> 00:01:45.973
"Who does that belong to?"

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:48.278
So rounding out our trio, the last member

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:51.304
of the there, their, they're
riders of the apocalypse

00:01:51.304 --> 00:01:55.471
is T-H-E-Y-'-R-E which is a
contraction of "they are".

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:01.004
So anywhere you would
want to say "they are"

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:04.270
you can smosh that
together and say "they're".

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.929
So, "Hey kid, are your parents home?

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.096
"No, they're not home right
now, can I take a message?"

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:14.835
So you can see in this sentence

00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:16.729
"They're not home right
now, can I take a message?"

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.896
they're, T-H-E-Y-'-R-E,
is replacing "they are".

00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:24.384
Both of these things would work

00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:25.438
equally well in the sentence.

00:02:25.438 --> 00:02:28.572
They're both grammatical,
one's just shorter.

00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:31.295
And as we know, English
as with most languages

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:33.712
likes to take the easy route.

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:36.306
Finding the shortest possible

00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:39.960
or most efficient option if you prefer.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.620
So as a writer and speaker of English

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.784
you're going to come across
this situation a lot.

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:47.526
Which one of these things do you use?

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:51.017
And so when you come across
this thorny little issue

00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:53.781
"Do I use there, their or they're?"

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:56.201
you have to ask yourself
a series of questions.

00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:59.876
Questions #1, "Does it answer
the question 'where is it'?"

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.228
If so, use T-H-E-R-E.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:05.653
If the use answers the question,
"Who does it belong to?"

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.071
then you use T-H-E-I-R.

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:11.235
If what you're trying to say
is a contraction of "they are"

00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:15.993
then what you're looking
for is T-H-E-Y-'-R-E.

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:19.727
I know it's confusing but
you can learn anything.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:20.560
David out!
