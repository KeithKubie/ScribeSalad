00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.361
- [Instructor] In other videos
we talk about some of the

00:00:02.361 --> 00:00:06.528
truly ancient Chinese
dynasties, the Shang Dynasty,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.564
the Zhou Dynasty, and as we
get to the end of the Zhou

00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:14.279
Dynasty, China falls into
chaos in the Warring States

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.606
Period, which is a really
tough time for China.

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:20.435
But the silver lining is it's
also the time that you have

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:22.541
all these schools of
thought, the Hundred Schools

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:26.502
of Thought, of which
Confucianism and Daoism

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:29.002
and Legalism and all of these
other schools of thought

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:30.982
begin to emerge.

00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:33.921
But what we're really going
to focus on in this video

00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:38.753
is the beginning of truly
imperial China under the Qin

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:42.003
Dynasty from which China gets its name.

00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:46.853
So here we are in the third
century B.C.E. and you have

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:51.364
your first true emperor
of China, Qin Shi Huang,

00:00:51.364 --> 00:00:54.516
and the dynasty that he
sets up is known as the Qin

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.418
Dynasty which will be
shortly lived but it's known

00:00:57.418 --> 00:01:01.397
as the first dynasty to truly unify China.

00:01:01.397 --> 00:01:05.934
This is where we believe the
word China actually comes from,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.101
from the Qin Dynasty.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:11.631
The dynasty is known for its
fairly harsh, centralized

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:16.028
rule motivated over the
foundation on legalism.

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:18.895
In terms of relics that
we have from that period,

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:21.285
you might have heard
of the Terra Cotta Army

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:26.244
which was buried along
with Qin Shi Huang's grave.

00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:29.529
Now the Qin Dynasty is
most known for ending the

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:33.167
Warring States Period and
unifying China, and really

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.927
laying the foundation for
the Golden Age of China

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:40.556
that will happen in the Han Dynasty.

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:45.091
The Han Dynasty lasts from
roughly 200 B.C.E. to a little

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.258
after 200 C.E.

00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:50.784
And in my head I think of
it as bit of a contemporary

00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:52.584
as the Roman Empire.

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:56.608
The 200 years of the Western
Han Dynasty correspond

00:01:56.608 --> 00:02:00.672
roughly to the Roman
Republic, and as we get to the

00:02:00.672 --> 00:02:05.062
Eastern Han Dynasty, that
corresponds to really the heyday

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.077
of the Roman Empire.

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:12.067
And it's also a golden age of
China, a time where science

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:15.755
and the arts, and especially
Confucianism begins to

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:19.857
really take hold in China,
becomes officially part

00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:23.601
of the civil service,
part of the bureaucracy.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.701
The Han Dynasty was so
successful at unifying China

00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:31.868
culturally and linguistically,
that today, 92% of Chinese

00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:37.355
identify themselves as ethnically Han.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.363
So sometimes you'll hear
the word Han referring to

00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:45.090
the Han Dynasty, and sometimes
it will be referring to

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.340
the Han ethnic group,
which really derives from

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.543
the notion of the unification
under the Han Dynasty.

00:02:52.543 --> 00:02:56.030
Now the Han Dynasty, as we see
here, ends at the beginning

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.468
of the third century in the
Common Era, and then China

00:02:59.468 --> 00:03:03.012
gets fragmented again,
and it gets split into

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:04.529
multiple dynasties.

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.691
This roughly 360 years that
I don't have marked on my

00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:10.729
timeline, it's not that
nothing was happening in China,

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.566
in fact, a lot was, but
China was not unified.

00:03:14.566 --> 00:03:18.566
To get a sense of that,
here is China during the

00:03:20.983 --> 00:03:24.566
Three Kingdoms Period
in the third century,

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:29.555
shortly after the fall of the Han Dynasty.

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:33.333
You see the Jin Dynasty depicted
here in the fourth century,

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.249
still part of what's often known as the

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.772
Six Dynasties Period, this
roughly 360 years of a

00:03:38.772 --> 00:03:40.189
fragmented China.

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:44.221
And then you see this North
and South Dynasty Period

00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:47.093
here in the sixth century.

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:51.461
And eventually, China is
reunified, and that happens

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.628
under the Sui.

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:59.337
It is unified under
Emperor Wen of Sui for whom

00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:03.469
the dynasty is known,
and similar to the Qin,

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.849
what the Sui are most known
for is taking this chaotic

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.748
period and finally unifying China.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:13.250
And the Sui are ethnically Han,
and they lay the foundation

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.894
for another golden age
of China under the Tang

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:18.811
and the Sung Dynasties.

00:04:20.534 --> 00:04:24.019
The Tang Dynasty depicted
here, it rivals the Han

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:26.559
as a golden age of China.

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:31.312
It's a time where the arts,
the sciences really come about.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:35.050
One interesting thing about
this Six Dynasties Period

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.009
that we talk about,
which is a chaotic time,

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.755
it is a time that Buddhism
starts to come into China

00:04:40.755 --> 00:04:44.412
from central Asia, originally
from India, and by the

00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:48.345
Sui and the Tang, it really takes hold.

00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:51.711
Now one of the most important
innovations that comes from

00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:55.294
Tang China is the notion
of block printing.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.450
What you see depicted here
is one of the first books

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.617
ever printed, the Diamond
Sutra, during the Tang Dynasty.

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:11.876
Now, after the Tang falls in
907, you have, on a historical

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.766
time scale, a relatively
brief period of chaos again.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:20.045
About 50, I guess exactly
53 years where you get this

00:05:20.045 --> 00:05:23.652
Five Dynasties and 10 Kingdoms
Period, but then China

00:05:23.652 --> 00:05:26.819
gets reunified under the Song Dynasty.

00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:32.917
And the Song Dynasty is able
to, on some level, pick up

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:35.762
where the Tang Dynasty left off.

00:05:35.762 --> 00:05:37.724
One thing that happens as
we get into the late Tang

00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:40.736
Dynasty, is that there's
push-back against Buddhism

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.896
that we talk about in
other videos, and you see

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:45.766
Neo-Confucianism begin to
take hold and it really

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:48.460
takes hold under the Song
Dynasty that we talk about

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.985
in other videos.

00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:53.797
The Song Dynasty is also
known as a time of really

00:05:53.797 --> 00:05:56.293
putting a lot of energy
into the civil service

00:05:56.293 --> 00:06:00.056
and the bureaucracy, and it
really being very meritocratic,

00:06:00.056 --> 00:06:03.308
based on some of these
Neo-Confucian ideals.

00:06:03.308 --> 00:06:08.222
It's also a time of significant
technological innovation.

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:12.463
The compass, which has use
as early as the Han Dynasty,

00:06:12.463 --> 00:06:16.389
but it really gets into its
fairly evolved or modern form,

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.228
especially for maritime use,
during the Song Dynasty.

00:06:20.228 --> 00:06:24.712
The notion of a Chinese
junk boat also gets into its

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:28.484
evolved form during the Song Dynasty.

00:06:28.484 --> 00:06:32.588
Some of the really far-reaching
innovations from this

00:06:32.588 --> 00:06:36.755
Dynasty include building on
the Tang use of block printing,

00:06:37.757 --> 00:06:40.798
but thinking about movable
type, which makes printing

00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:42.885
far more practical.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:46.720
And maybe the biggest single
innovation that changed

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.887
the world, for better or worse,
was the use of gunpowder,

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:54.676
which there's some use in
the late Tang, but it really

00:06:54.676 --> 00:06:58.878
starts to get perfected
during the Song Dynasty.

00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:02.317
The Song Dynasty is
eventually overthrown in the

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:04.650
13th century by the Mongols.

00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:10.399
They are able to establish
the Yuan Dynasty with

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.592
Kublai Khan being the first emperor of it,

00:07:13.592 --> 00:07:17.526
grandson of Genghis, or Jen-gees Khan.

00:07:17.526 --> 00:07:21.866
They are eventually
overthrown in the 14th century

00:07:21.866 --> 00:07:23.533
by the Ming Dynasty.

00:07:25.608 --> 00:07:29.135
The Ming Dynasty is once
again ethnically Han,

00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:33.302
and some of the most famous
attractions that are associated

00:07:34.248 --> 00:07:38.415
with China today really came
about from the Ming Dynasty.

00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:42.035
This is the Forbidden Palace,
the imperial residence

00:07:42.035 --> 00:07:45.868
during the Ming and Qing
Dynasties in Beijing.

00:07:46.915 --> 00:07:48.602
This is the Great Wall of China.

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:50.605
And even though the history
of the Great Wall of China

00:07:50.605 --> 00:07:55.224
goes a good ways back, even
to the Zhou and Warring States

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:59.090
Periods, much of what you
now see as the Great Wall,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.257
a lot of this brick work, was
built during the Ming Dynasty.

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:08.418
And then the last true
Dynasty of China is the Qing.

00:08:11.383 --> 00:08:15.900
The Qing Dynasty is again,
to some degree, foreign rule.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.435
It's ruled by the Manchus
who come from Manchuria,

00:08:19.435 --> 00:08:22.435
which is this region right
over here, and they're

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:25.635
eventually able to
overwhelm the Ming Dynasty,

00:08:25.635 --> 00:08:30.351
and ruled China all the way
until the early 20th century

00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:34.518
when the Republic of China
is able to overthrow them.
