00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.325
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.300
SHEREE HAGGAN: OK,
"The View UpStairs"

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.580
is a provocative new
musical that pulls you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.490
inside the UpStairs Lounge,
a vibrant '70s gay bar

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.360
in the French Quarter
of New Orleans.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.310
This forgotten
community comes to life

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.050
when a young fashion
designer from 2017

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.630
buys the abandoned space,
setting off an exhilarating

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.210
journey of seduction
and self exploration

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.060
that "Entertainment Weekly"
calls "a moving homage

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.976
to LGBT culture,
past and present."

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:33.350
Filled with
"beautiful love songs

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.900
performed by a soulful
ensemble cast."

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.900
So, please help me welcome to
the stage, to perform for us

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.810
now, the cast from
"The View UpStairs."

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.184
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.310
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: It's 1973,
y'all, in the Big Easy--

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.246
New Orleans.

00:00:56.246 --> 00:04:12.245
[MUSIC - RANDY REDD AND COMPANY,

[APPLAUSE]

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.796
SHEREE HAGGAN: All right,
let's give it up to them

00:12:59.796 --> 00:13:00.380
one more time.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.308
That was beautiful.

00:13:01.308 --> 00:13:02.236
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
View UpStairs, y'all!

00:13:02.236 --> 00:13:02.986
SHEREE HAGGAN: OK.

00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:04.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.490
Awesome.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.080
Thank you.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.040
And then, we have a few
members of the cast who

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.780
won't be joining us
for the Q&amp;A. So we've

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.420
got April, James, and
Ben-- thank you, guys, so

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.384
much for performing.

00:13:14.384 --> 00:13:15.175
That was wonderful.

00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:15.933
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:17.558
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
Where are you going?

00:13:17.558 --> 00:13:18.148
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.796
SHEREE HAGGAN: They're
going to go explore Google.

00:13:19.796 --> 00:13:20.212
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Oh, OK.

00:13:20.212 --> 00:13:21.878
SHEREE HAGGAN: Raid
the "microkitchens,"

00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:22.746
that's the plan.

00:13:22.746 --> 00:13:23.780
All right, wonderful.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.590
Thank you, guys, so much.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.910
RANDY REDD: The what?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.170
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
Yes, I got you.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.378
SHEREE HAGGAN: [LAUGH] I
know that quite a few people

00:13:28.378 --> 00:13:31.670
in the audience weren't able
to see the play just yet.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.460
But they will be
seeing it after this.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.060
So I would love for you guys to
introduce yourselves and tell

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.480
us a little bit about the
character that you play.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.770
RANDY REDD: I'm Randy Redd.

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:42.850
I play Buddy.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.600
Buddy is one of the older
patrons in the bar--

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.510
the bitter, old daddy.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.790
He's also the piano player.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.280
He was sort of a washed up
singer-songwriter who landed

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.774
in this bar in New Orleans.

00:13:56.774 --> 00:13:57.940
ANTHONY ALFARO: I'm Anthony.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.140
And today I was playing
Freddy, a Puerto Rican drag

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.170
queen with a heart of gold.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.080
But I'm a swing, which is
an understudy for a bunch

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.670
of these fabulous people.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.224
And, yeah.

00:14:12.224 --> 00:14:13.640
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
Good afternoon,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.610
everybody here at Google.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.050
I'm Nathan Lee
Graham, and I play

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.420
Willie in "The View UpStairs."

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:21.160
And Willie is the--

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.420
let's say, he's the bon
vivant of "The View UpStairs."

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.950
He's the matchmaker, the
Dolly Levi, if you will.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.880
He likes to bring
people together,

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.140
even if he has to use
alternative facts to do so.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.800
So that's who I play.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.280
So you have to come and see him.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.488
TAYLOR FREY: I'm Taylor Frey.

00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:41.590
I play Patrick.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.140
He is currently a hustler to
make ends meet and stay alive.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.140
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Yass.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:48.515
TAYLOR FREY: Moved
to New Orleans

00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:50.410
to get out of his
bad home situation

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.480
when he was growing up.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.160
JEREMY POPE: I'm Jeremy Pope.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.350
And I'm playing
the character Wes,

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.100
who is an aspiring fashion
designer who is sent back

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.610
to New Orleans in 1973.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.616
And yeah, that's all
I'll say about that.

00:15:05.616 --> 00:15:07.360
[LAUGH]

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.070
NANCY TICOTIN: My
name is Nancy Ticotin.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.710
I play two roles in the
show-- the realtor who

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.260
succeeds at selling
this doodoo-head-- no,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.290
he buys the building
that is left.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:22.570
And I also play Inez, a mother
of the drag queen at the bar.

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.980
And the husband has left them.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.960
And she's supporting
and doing the best

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.630
she can to keep the
family together.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.560
In reality, in the real story,
she has two sons at the bar.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.556
But in our show she has one.

00:15:35.556 --> 00:15:36.930
SHEREE HAGGAN:
That's incredible.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:37.120
Great.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.470
Thank you, guys, so much.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:42.490
And how was it that you guys
got involved with this play,

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.630
or you found out about
it, and were cast?

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.040
Were there any fun stories in
terms of auditions or anything

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.110
like that you want to share?

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.100
RANDY REDD: I joined
this show back

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.320
in-- there was a reading
of the show in October,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.135
a developmental, week-long
reading back in, I think,

00:15:57.135 --> 00:15:57.760
October, right?

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.720
RANDY REDD: And I
was not involved.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.095
[LAUGH] But, come
Wednesday afternoon--

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:07.480
I teach class, and I was
in the middle of class,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.870
and I got a phone call-- can
you come now and join the show?

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.050
Can you learn the part
and go on tomorrow?

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.430
So we did two
performances on Thursday

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.640
and Friday, readings
of the show.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:21.694
So I joined the cast sort
of out of the blue, yeah.

00:16:21.694 --> 00:16:23.860
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: And thank
god he did because he's

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:24.700
fantastic in the show.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.000
RANDY REDD: Thanks,
Nathan Lee Graham.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.130
ANTHONY ALFARO: Yeah.

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.010
RANDY REDD: Can you
translate "bon vivant"?

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.760
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Bon vivant?

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.270
Google it.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
RANDY REDD: See what I--

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.165
I set you up there.

00:16:35.165 --> 00:16:37.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.395 --> 00:16:38.520
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Oh, god.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.670
The part of Willie
was written for me.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.440
So that's how I became a part
of this wonderful musical that's

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.410
based upon something that
was very tragic that happened

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.320
in 1973, in New Orleans--

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.560
five years ago, almost, Max
Vernon, who wrote the book,

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.410
lyrics, and music.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.492
So that's how I got involved
with this beautiful project.

00:16:59.492 --> 00:17:01.450
TAYLOR FREY: Some of us
weren't involved at all

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.400
and then just auditioned,
like, as an actor,

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.108
you get a lot of
appointments to come in.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.540
And you go in and do your best,
and you hear tons of no's.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.956
And then, sometimes
you get a yes.

00:17:08.956 --> 00:17:10.300
So, that was this one.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.383
JEREMY POPE: Yeah, me too.

00:17:14.344 --> 00:17:16.260
NANCY TICOTIN: You don't
want to say anything?

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.426
JEREMY POPE: I was the same.

00:17:17.426 --> 00:17:20.980
I auditioned, and I hadn't
heard about the project

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.400
prior to auditioning for it.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.710
And then when I got the
call to come in, I went in.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.850
And I actually met Taylor,
who was already hired.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.432
So it was kind of a cold read.

00:17:30.432 --> 00:17:32.140
And I had to interact
on top of all that.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.520
TAYLOR FREY: Oh, and
they didn't tell you

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.420
that I was in there, right?

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.380
JEREMY POPE: No, I
went into the room.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:35.670
TAYLOR FREY: Which
is kind of messed up.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.830
JEREMY POPE: And
then, he was there.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.990
And they were like, so
this is the person that

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.370
is cast as the role.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.557
So create chemistry, and go.

00:17:40.557 --> 00:17:41.390
And so we did, and--

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.306
TAYLOR FREY: So, usually you
know those things in advance.

00:17:44.306 --> 00:17:44.910
You can prep.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.380
And they didn't tell
any of the boys.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.421
JEREMY POPE: They didn't
tell me, which is great.

00:17:48.421 --> 00:17:50.892
But we kissed in the room,
and the sparks were flying.

00:17:50.892 --> 00:17:51.850
TAYLOR FREY: Fireworks.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:52.850
JEREMY POPE: Yeah.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:55.110
And then, it was a yes, so
feeling great about that.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:55.957 --> 00:17:57.290
SHEREE HAGGAN: That's wonderful.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.200
NANCY TICOTIN: My
story's a little similar

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.660
to Randy's, in that
there was someone

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.630
else in this role prior.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.950
And she got bumped
up into another job.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.450
And then, they called me.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.810
And I was thrown into this.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.560
I was living upstate
New York in the snow.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.350
And then, I read the script.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.350
The next day I said yes.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.230
I packed two bags.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.750
The next day, I was
at rehearsal at 10:00

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.125
and didn't know
where I was going

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:21.620
to be that night-- sleeping
on couches for a long time.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.150
But out of the blue,
just like that.

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.933
I didn't know that about
Randy, interesting.

00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:25.724
SHEREE HAGGAN: Wow.

00:18:25.724 --> 00:18:26.727
That's beautiful.

00:18:26.727 --> 00:18:29.720
Now, you had mentioned, Nathan,
that this is a true story.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.140
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Yeah.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:30.770
SHEREE HAGGAN: And
can you tell me more?

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.450
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Well,
it's based upon a true story.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.770
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah.

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.811
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Well--

00:18:33.811 --> 00:18:38.300
and anyone can please jump in
and modify or correct, please--

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.670
but in 1973, there
was an arson attack

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.290
at a lounge called the
UpStairs Lounge in New Orleans.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:49.550
And they're not sure
who started the fire.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:53.330
But this fire did
indeed killed 32 people.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.190
Some people got out.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.910
But it is 1973.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.740
This is the south.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:58.550
It is New Orleans.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.450
And so, it was under-reported,
under-investigated,

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.980
and to this day,
you can literally--

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.160
all joking aside-- Google it
and find out more about it.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.230
But it's still an
under-reported,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.030
under-investigated story.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.950
And it's our first
Orlando, if you will,

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.980
for the LGBTQ community.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.280
So it's an important
story, a pivotal story.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:27.290
And what Max has done is taken
the wonderful character of Wes,

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.830
that Jeremy plays,
from the present day

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.980
and transports him back to 1973.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.290
And we all come alive.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.700
And all of the machinations,
and contradictions,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:45.140
and differences between
1973 and the present day all

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:51.410
happen in this one bar
before this tragedy happens.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.630
And so, it's a beautiful
story about something

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.272
that was tragic that
needs to be told.

00:19:56.272 --> 00:19:57.980
And I'm just so proud
to be a part of it.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.041
Does anyone want to add?

00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:01.040
RANDY REDD: Yeah, as far
as under-reported goes,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.050
I grew up just north
of New Orleans.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.440
I was probably 10, 11, 12
years old when this happened.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.980
And never knew of it.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.576
Never heard about it
until this show came up.

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:13.700
And there's still-- I talk
to my friends and family

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:16.250
back home, and even
people in New Orleans who

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.644
don't know this story.

00:20:17.644 --> 00:20:19.310
And it's just outrageous
to me that it's

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.657
gone so missing from our
history, certainly, you know.

00:20:24.657 --> 00:20:25.740
SHEREE HAGGAN: Absolutely.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.100
TAYLOR FREY: What's cool is that
now people are seeing the show.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.930
And I have two people
that have contacted

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.350
me who have had trips planned
to New Orleans already,

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.480
saw the show, and went
and found the bar,

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.272
and looked and saw the
names outside of it.

00:20:37.272 --> 00:20:38.480
There's some in the sidewalk.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.780
There's some on the building.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.550
And so, that's really special.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.850
We get to kind of
honor those lives now.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.666
It's really something rare.

00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:47.124
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
It's incredible.

00:20:47.124 --> 00:20:48.795
SHEREE HAGGAN: Now,
it was under-reported.

00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:50.140
And you guys mention
that quite a bit

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.410
that the news didn't cover it.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.130
Why do you feel like
it wasn't covered

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.580
when so many lives were lost?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.560
Before Orlando, which
you had mentioned,

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.811
this was the largest attack
on the LGBT community.

00:21:01.811 --> 00:21:03.560
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
Does anybody want to--?

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.143
ANTHONY ALFARO: Well,
I would probably

00:21:05.143 --> 00:21:08.670
say that it was because
they were all gay.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.510
And I think that, not only
was it under-reported,

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:16.050
but the families
of the victims--

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.350
I'm sure a lot of them
were quite embarrassed

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.520
or felt some sort of shame
about having their kids,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:26.435
or their kin, or relatives at
this place that was kind of--

00:21:26.435 --> 00:21:28.560
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Well,
I mean you would be fired.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:28.885
ANTHONY ALFARO: Yeah.

00:21:28.885 --> 00:21:29.210
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Yes.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:29.450
NANCY TICOTIN: Lose your job.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:30.890
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: So
you would lose your job.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:32.348
And then your names
would literally

00:21:32.348 --> 00:21:34.670
be put in the paper,
sometimes with your address.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.460
And you would lose
your job for being

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.910
even associated with these
people, let alone, at the bar.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:44.630
So there was shame
on all fronts.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.836
And the people who
were actually victims,

00:21:47.836 --> 00:21:49.460
and the people who
were actually there,

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:55.070
couldn't even express
their shame or their grief

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:58.230
for fear of being fired or
for fear of being let go.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.830
NANCY TICOTIN: So many bodies
were not claimed, even, right?

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.000
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Yeah,
many bodies were not claimed.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.624
There were people
across the street who

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:08.180
watched this place burning
down, and they did nothing.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.670
So, and they left
one particular member

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.450
burnt to a crisp
in the actual bars

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.434
that were up to the windows.

00:22:17.434 --> 00:22:19.850
If you know New Orleans, they
had these very large windows

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.224
that you can sort
of walk out of.

00:22:21.224 --> 00:22:22.760
They're like doors.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.260
Well, this was on
the second level.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.560
And so, in order for drunk
people not to fall out of them,

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.060
they ironically put bars
up to keep people safe.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.920
And then you have a fire.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.100
And there you have it.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:40.160
So, you know, the shame
all around of being a part

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.190
or associated with the bar, and
the real-life time happenings

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:50.220
of not being able to tell people
because you would be fired.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.790
Cut to present day,
where you can still

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:59.630
be fired if you are
gay in certain places

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.280
here, in these United States--

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.660
if I'm not mistaken.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.474
So there you have it.

00:23:07.474 --> 00:23:09.140
SHEREE HAGGAN: And
we reference Orlando.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.160
And for those of
you that don't know,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.877
in June-- which is Pride
Month-- of this past year,

00:23:14.877 --> 00:23:17.210
there was a shooting that
happened at a nightclub there,

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.930
called Pulse.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.840
And so, when we say "Orlando,"
or if we use the term "Pulse,"

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.340
that's what we're
referencing, which

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.700
is now the largest killing
of the LGBT community or hate

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.525
crime towards the
LGBT community.

00:23:27.525 --> 00:23:29.150
So that's what we're
referencing there.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:33.950
How did it feel, so soon after
the Pulse shootings happened--

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:35.960
how did it feel bringing
this story to life?

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.410
Was there an element that
felt a bit more powerful?

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:41.300
Do you feel like it
was the perfect time

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.090
to bring this to light
because it's so ironically

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.100
similar to what just happened?

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.070
JEREMY POPE: I think,
for me particular,

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.180
I'm from Orlando, Florida.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:53.450
I live here in New York
City, but I was home

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.730
when the shooting happened.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.540
And we lost a bunch of familiar
faces, people from high school,

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.390
all types of things.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:05.681
So I didn't want to
deal with what happened.

00:24:05.681 --> 00:24:07.430
It was very hard for
me to deal with that.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:09.710
I came to New York
after, and I just

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.800
started auditioning
and trying to forget.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.415
So I thought I was
going to be in LA.

00:24:14.415 --> 00:24:15.790
And then this
project came along.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:16.440
I read the script.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.856
And I was like, I
need to do this.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:19.110
I have to do this for me.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.068
I need to do this because
this is so important.

00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:24.050
I didn't know about
this New Orleans attack.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:26.727
So, like Nathan has
mentioned, yes, it is tragic.

00:24:26.727 --> 00:24:28.310
But it's such a
beautiful story, where

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.250
you get to meet so many
individuals full of life,

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.700
full of character,
such important stories.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.950
And it's so great to
be a part of a piece

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:38.750
where, not only are
we creating art,

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.522
but where we're sharing history.

00:24:41.522 --> 00:24:42.980
And I feel like
that's so important

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.063
to not forget our history,
and where we came from,

00:24:45.063 --> 00:24:46.815
and those that came before us.

00:24:46.815 --> 00:24:48.440
So for me in particular,
it just struck

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.356
a chord, where every
night feels like therapy,

00:24:50.356 --> 00:24:52.760
where I go through, and I
get to meet these characters.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.930
And, yes, it's sad.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.540
But it feels progressive, like,
OK, we have to keep fighting.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.710
And we have to keep speaking up.

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:59.126
And we need to
keep doing whatever

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:02.630
we need to do to keep
taking those steps forward

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.723
in the community.

00:25:03.723 --> 00:25:04.556
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah.

00:25:04.556 --> 00:25:05.056
Great.

00:25:05.056 --> 00:25:07.880
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
It's so timely, too,

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.500
with what's going on in society,
as far as the administration

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.490
that we have
currently happening.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.430
So it's a timely piece, a
seminal piece, in that way,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.020
on all fronts.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:24.290
I really feel like it's
just, we are a part

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.920
of a larger community of artists
who are putting out some really

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.410
great work right now.

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:33.140
And I mean artists
at large, too,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.550
because I think even what
you guys do here contributes

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.570
in so many ways
with communication,

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.670
where communication
is concerned.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.260
So, that's so key.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.660
You know, I think the
operative and big word

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.260
today is "communication"--

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.757
dealing with people and
communicating with them.

00:25:54.757 --> 00:25:55.590
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.700
That's wonderful.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.880
Thank you.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.840
And we talk a lot
about community

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.480
and the importance of
community-- and community then,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.380
as well as now.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.630
Now, the bar-- it was
really interesting

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.610
because it served
so many purposes.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.900
It was a church.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.679
And it was a bar.

00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.345
But it was also like
your hangout place.

00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:12.420
And you'd do drag shows.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.350
And I feel like every
couple of minutes

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.840
it was just changing into
morphing into something new.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.290
What was the bar like for you?

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:25.050
And what did it
symbolize for you?

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:28.650
RANDY REDD: Well, I can only
speak from Buddy's perspective

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.150
here.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.790
You know, Buddy is the
showman in the room.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.630
It's his room.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.410
It's his show.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.160
It's his night.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.802
And it's sort of
taken away from him.

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:37.760
But it is the place where
Buddy can be himself.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.180
I didn't say that Buddy
is married and has kids.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.450
So he's living this other
life inside the walls

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:48.470
of the UpStairs Lounge which,
you know, while this is not

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:55.160
based specifically on one
guy, it's based on reality,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.570
for sure--

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.240
you know, this guy
hiding out in this place.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.710
So it is a place to escape.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.530
And it is some kind of paradise
for all of these people,

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.690
you know.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.890
And in that, it really is
how it starts for me, too.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.000
And the night sort
of progresses, or--

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.660
TAYLOR FREY: I think "escape"
is a good word that he used.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.660
Because for my character,
it definitely is that.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.740
and has become kind of a safe
haven for him to be who he is.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:22.220
And, much like what New
York City was for me when

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.530
I left Utah, [LAUGH]
I kind of got

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:28.970
to be myself, and do my own
thing, and explore everything

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:29.510
I was.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:31.760
And I feel like Patrick gets
to do that by just coming

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.854
into this bar every night, so.

00:27:33.854 --> 00:27:36.020
RANDY REDD: Yeah, I remember
when I was in college--

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:37.760
I went to school
at Florida State--

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.910
and, you know, I grew up in
this small town in Mississippi.

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:43.430
And I went to college
in Tallahassee.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:47.510
And the gay bar in Tallahassee
was very seedy, divey bar

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.715
downtown in the basement
of the Hilton Hotel

00:27:49.715 --> 00:27:51.210
out by the capitol.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.790
And it was called
Club Park Avenue.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.936
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:53.936 --> 00:27:55.400
Like, mirrors on the wall.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.820
It was like black velvet.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.736
And it was so, so seedy,
and so much like this bar.

00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:02.360
There were drag shows
on Sunday nights.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.090
And that was my escape.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.570
You know, like, I really felt
then like I was in this place

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:08.710
now.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.826
It's a very similar experience.

00:28:10.826 --> 00:28:11.798
SHEREE HAGGAN: Great.

00:28:11.798 --> 00:28:12.770
That's awesome.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.280
NANCY TICOTIN: I
think for me, it's

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.800
a place where my son
can go and be himself,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.900
and where it's safe.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.710
Because, even when we enter
into the show, my character

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.640
and my son in the show--

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.110
it's after being
beat up by a cop.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.420
So in this place
is the only place

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:37.691
where we can feel safe,
relax, feel good in your skin,

00:28:37.691 --> 00:28:38.860
I think.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.026
SHEREE HAGGAN: That's great.

00:28:40.026 --> 00:28:40.500
Go ahead.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.416
ANTHONY ALFARO: Well, I
was just going to say,

00:28:42.416 --> 00:28:45.660
speaking to Inez and Freddy,
they're Puerto Rican.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:50.160
So I think that, even in
their home, in their family,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.020
with their relatives,
you know, this

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.900
would be something that would
be really kind of shameful.

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.890
And the fact that he can
go there with his mom

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.540
and kind of have
this extended family,

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.297
it's like a living room.

00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:05.880
It's like grandma's
house or something

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.240
like that, where you know you
can go there and feel at home.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.900
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah,
that's so true.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.960
And that's the vibe
that I got, as well.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.980
Fun fact-- I moved here
from Utah, as well.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.265
So we're going to
have to talk to after.

00:29:17.265 --> 00:29:18.220
ANTHONY ALFARO: Yeah.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:18.720
Wow.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.540
SHEREE HAGGAN: It's
so much to talk about.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.220
But we talk about it
being this safe haven

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.170
and this sense of community.

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.849
And it symbolizes
so many things now.

00:29:28.849 --> 00:29:30.390
But then, there's
a song and it talks

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.070
about how you're going to try to
be a person, not a personality.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.450
And I feel like any
more now, our community,

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.370
or our safe haven, is like,
we hide behind technology.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:40.500
And so, we have these apps.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.300
And we have these chat rooms.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.885
I mean, our whole world,
our social network--

00:29:44.885 --> 00:29:49.400
that's our social world, is
our social media or technology.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.150
And we're a tech
space, so technology

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:52.640
is very important to us.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.445
But how has that morphed
our sense of community?

00:29:56.445 --> 00:29:57.944
And not necessarily,
it doesn't have

00:29:57.944 --> 00:30:02.070
to be a bad thing, but how have
things changed since the '70s,

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.760
in terms of the LGBT community,
and what's safe haven,

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.020
and what that means now?

00:30:10.388 --> 00:30:11.888
RANDY REDD: Don't
all speak at once.

00:30:11.888 --> 00:30:12.804
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.804 --> 00:30:13.940
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
You want to take that?

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.023
JEREMY POPE: I'll take it.

00:30:15.023 --> 00:30:17.180
Yeah, I mean, because my
character's from 2017.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.002
So Wes wants to be--

00:30:20.002 --> 00:30:20.960
he wants the following.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.130
He wants the Instagram
following, the Twitter

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.240
following.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.410
He feels like, in order to be
loved, he needs those things.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.368
In order to be respected
as a fashion designer,

00:30:26.368 --> 00:30:27.410
he needs those things.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.050
So he jumps into
this world in 1973,

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.000
where these guys
don't have that.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.970
They only have each
other and this safe haven

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.010
to spend time
together, and to fall

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.447
in love, and to fight,
and to argue, and to fix

00:30:39.447 --> 00:30:41.780
all the things that are going
wrong in life, in this one

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.500
place.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.160
So it's very interesting for
him to kind of deal with that

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.900
and see--

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.840
just kind of dealing
with that, I think.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.756
But like you said, yeah,
we live in this world

00:30:51.756 --> 00:30:53.600
now, where we are
living behind screens.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.960
And that is so important.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.501
And I've been to
auditions where they

00:30:56.501 --> 00:30:58.490
want to know how many
followers you have.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.900
Or that qualifies you
more for X, Y, and Z.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.120
So it's hard to grasp
that because I don't know

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.180
if we have the communication
of face-to-face communities,

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.860
where we can go
someplace and have

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.560
real conversations with people.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.660
Or is it all just behind
this screen of swipe

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.470
left, swipe right,
if I'm interested.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.350
So I think Max has done a
great job of just presenting

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.410
the facts and kind of
letting you deal with however

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.809
you deal with your social life.

00:31:25.809 --> 00:31:28.100
It's not necessarily a show
where we're preaching like,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.308
we need to get off our phone!

00:31:29.308 --> 00:31:31.940
You know, it's just the
reality of how things work.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:34.540
And there's positivity in
that and negativity in that.

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.416
And you kind of can
stray either way.

00:31:39.416 --> 00:31:40.790
TAYLOR FREY: I do
love Instagram.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.519
I really, really do.

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:46.060
The problem that
I'm finding with it,

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.480
is people only put out--

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.250
I've made this a goal
in the last year.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.750
My husband was like,
if you're going

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.050
to be on it as much as you
are, be your authentic self.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.410
So I've made this goal to try
to be myself on Instagram,

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.610
like, no holds barred.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:59.570
Just go for it.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.660
And that's one of the issues,
is we only put out there

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.830
what we want other people to see
or what our insecurities are.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:07.560
We're hiding.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.870
We're putting them away.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.204
And people can actually
start living in this reality

00:32:11.204 --> 00:32:13.370
world of what they're putting
out to their followers

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.100
as themselves, and,
like, lose themselves.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.240
It's kind of crazy.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.290
I saw Ted Talk on this.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.020
And the effects on
the brain of it--

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.600
you actually start to lose
yourself a little bit.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.640
And you count on
what other people are

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.070
seeing as being the real you.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.230
And it's insane.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.880
Excuse me while I
post on Instagram.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.839
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:33.839 --> 00:32:35.630
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: And
I'm one of the older

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:37.010
members of the cast.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:42.110
And so, my relationship
with technology

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:50.580
is antagonistic at times
because I'm an artist.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.392
So my whole thing is about--

00:32:54.392 --> 00:32:56.030
it's all these contradictions.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:33:01.340
My whole thing is about actually
dealing with real people,

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.260
you know, and making
that sort of connection--

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.340
even if it's through celluloid--
but connecting with real,

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.450
sort of, human emotion.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.390
But at the same
time, I'm acting.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.700
Or I'm being, right.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.950
So there's always these
constant contradictions.

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:23.420
And so, you're trying to be this
"real artist," quote, unquote.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:28.010
And then you have this
element of social media

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:33.120
that you have to deal with,
which sometimes takes you out

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.220
of your artistic self.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.030
But it needs to gird or support
what you're doing artistically.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.430
So there's this
constant give and take

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:46.920
in flux, generationally
with me, in particular--

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.920
where I'm like, can someone
else younger do this for me

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.910
while I work on the art?

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.254
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:56.254 --> 00:33:58.420
TAYLOR FREY: Well, what's
crazy is it's so tied now.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:33:58.780
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Yes.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:33:59.970
TAYLOR FREY: Like
it really is tied.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.660
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: It really is.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.576
TAYLOR FREY: To promote
your show or whatever,

00:34:02.576 --> 00:34:04.890
you have to put that out with
your name attached to it.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:05.070
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Absolutely.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.410
TAYLOR FREY: So whether your
personal life is there--

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:08.530
I mean, it's just a lot.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.447
And it's all together.

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:10.696
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: It's a lot.

00:34:10.696 --> 00:34:11.758
And it's exhausting!

00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:12.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:12.752 --> 00:34:13.252
But--

00:34:13.252 --> 00:34:14.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:14.742 --> 00:34:15.742
RANDY REDD: Here we are.

00:34:15.742 --> 00:34:16.909
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Here we are!

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:17.821
SHEREE HAGGAN: And
here we are, though.

00:34:17.821 --> 00:34:20.061
TAYLOR FREY: At Google--
doing the live feed.

00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:20.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:20.920
You know, I love it.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.380
I love it.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.300
NANCY TICOTIN:
[INAUDIBLE] too bad.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:23.184 --> 00:34:24.600
SHEREE HAGGAN:
Yes, as you should.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.030
So we're going to open it
up for audience Q&amp;A here

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.770
in just a moment.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:29.040
So if you guys do
have any questions,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.915
feel free to line up.

00:34:29.915 --> 00:34:34.260
We've got the microphones on
either side here for you all.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.440
So it sounds like there's
so many life lessons.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.500
And when I walked away, I was
like, social media cleanse.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.354
And I had my sister
change my passwords.

00:34:42.354 --> 00:34:43.770
So now I'm like,
off social media.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.270
Because I'm like, I need
to be in the moment,

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.370
and I need to be person
and not a personality.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.800
And I felt like there
were so many lessons

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.850
strewn throughout and interwoven
throughout the entire play.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.540
What do you guys feel is the one
thing that if people walk away,

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.590
you hope they got that?

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.590
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Wow,
that's a great question.

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.880
RANDY REDD: Wow.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.730
NANCY TICOTIN: Well,
I think what gets me,

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.770
and what I love that
the audience gets,

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.780
is the political point of view
that we speak of in the show.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.070
People relate to it.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.290
And they find solace.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.870
When they leave the theater,
they are moved emotionally.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.410
They feel comforted
that it's being

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.007
addressed in an artistic way.

00:35:24.007 --> 00:35:25.590
It's not being knocked
over your head.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.660
You don't read it, et cetera.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.960
It's something you
experience with us.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.400
His character is
primary in that goal.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.390
And we all, backstage,
eight shows a week,

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.300
as long as we're there,
we are re-experiencing

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:48.780
what is happening in the world
and sharing our common goals,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.020
or our wish, that we can
all move forward and find

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.830
emotional happiness and
make progress in the world.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.230
And I think the
audience does get that.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:00.201
I feel that.

00:36:00.201 --> 00:36:03.070
SHEREE HAGGAN: That's great.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.640
TAYLOR FREY: I would say,
the political climate,

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.690
that's all very prevalent in
the show, and the technology

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.970
aspect, and how people,
as we were discussing,

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:13.820
can lose themselves.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.564
But besides that,
I would just say--

00:36:16.564 --> 00:36:17.980
this is going to
sound so cliche--

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.130
but there's such a message
of love in this show.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.720
Because these
people in the South,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.240
in 1973, had to find
themselves in a little room

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.620
together to let their
freak flag kind of fly.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.710
And I just can't help but
finish the show every night

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:35.050
just thinking about
love, and acceptance,

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:37.660
and just being who you are, and
celebrating our differences,

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.820
instead of trying to hide
them, and hinder people

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.337
from being different.

00:36:42.337 --> 00:36:44.670
ANTHONY ALFARO: I think this
kind of ties in everything.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.980
But the past few
months have been

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:51.180
kind of trying for
me, personally, for--

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.940
like, what he said about
our administration and all

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.280
this kind of stuff that
seems so out of my hands.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.630
And just like, oh my god,
they're going to kill me

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.180
and everyone I love, you know.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:02.764
And I think that,
for me, the blessing

00:37:02.764 --> 00:37:04.930
of being a part of this
show, with all these people,

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:10.050
was kind of that escape, with
like-mindedness, and love,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.140
and kind of a celebration
of all the things

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.650
that make us different.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:17.010
So I find that when I
speak to my friends who

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:21.530
come to see the show after,
they kind of experienced

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.450
that kind of escape.

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:25.980
They experienced that in
that hour and 40 minutes.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:30.650
And there's usually this kind of
energized smile on their face,

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:34.590
or like a sense of relief
after, that things will be OK.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.830
And I don't know, I feel
like they kind of learn along

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:38.700
with us.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:42.011
And that's always the
kind of best thing for me.

00:37:42.011 --> 00:37:44.080
SHEREE HAGGAN: That's great.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.580
Thank you.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you
so much for being here.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.795
Loved the show.

00:37:48.795 --> 00:37:49.120
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Thank you.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.170
AUDIENCE: I was there last week.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.300
Going to go again this week.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.175
RANDY REDD: Oh, good.

00:37:52.175 --> 00:37:53.850
AUDIENCE: Sheree,
great job moderating.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.930
My question is, so when I was
at the show, what really struck

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:03.520
me was your script, right--
your dialogue and all your songs

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.350
and poetry.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:05.670
It was just absolutely amazing.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.710
I was wondering, do you guys
have one favorite lyric?

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:11.070
Or one favorite sentence
that you're just

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.110
absolutely obsessed?

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.430
And when you read it, you
were like, oh my gosh,

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:15.900
it totally speaks to me.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.530
Something that really-- your
favorite line from the show,

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:22.230
maybe from your character or
from your fellow characters,

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.111
as well.

00:38:23.111 --> 00:38:24.402
NANCY TICOTIN: There's so many.

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:24.870
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
There's so many.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.286
TAYLOR FREY: Mine is, we've
got an iron bond no hate could

00:38:27.286 --> 00:38:28.520
break apart, that he sings.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.383
Obsessed with that line.

00:38:30.383 --> 00:38:30.882
Love it.

00:38:33.907 --> 00:38:35.240
NANCY TICOTIN: I like your line.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.675
I told you this.

00:38:36.675 --> 00:38:39.710
He says, well, look at me.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:41.810
I'm a total failure, but
my life is not so bad.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:45.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.466
I love that line.

00:38:48.757 --> 00:38:51.090
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Oh, god,
it's So hard because there's

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:52.390
so many wonderful lines.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.620
JEREMY POPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.790
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
See, I'm so in it

00:38:55.790 --> 00:39:02.960
that I've gone beyond the
actual context of the line--

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.730
content of the line.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.410
I'm more about how
it sounds, right.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.410
Because they're all good.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.090
All the lines are good.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:19.110
So-- because it changes
after a couple of weeks--

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:22.770
my current sounding line
that I love so much--

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.960
Michael Longoria is not here.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.490
But he has a line, (SPANISH
ACCENT) where is my dress?

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.910
I love that right now.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:38.030
It makes me laugh every night.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.930
I'm offstage.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:45.210
And I just love it.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:46.500
SHEREE HAGGAN: That's amazing.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.160
All right.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.300
And Nancy, so that would be
your son in the play, right?

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.720
And what I have
found so interesting

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.190
was that it was
based in the '70s,

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.990
but you were so
supportive of him.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.400
And you were so loving.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.241
And just, you took
him as he was.

00:40:01.241 --> 00:40:02.115
And it was beautiful.

00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:04.720
And it was something
that I longed for.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.540
My mom is wonderful
and very supportive.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:13.020
But it was more than
just a love of him,

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:15.750
it was of everyone, and
everything that he was.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:18.120
And that's so rare, even today.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.520
How did it feel playing a
character where it's like,

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.070
in the '70s, when it's like,
you think of everyone hates

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.520
everyone that's different?

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.030
How was that?

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.800
NANCY TICOTIN: My
experience, personally,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.672
is that, first of
all, I was a dancer.

00:40:30.672 --> 00:40:32.880
I was one of the original
members of Ballet Hispanico

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.610
of New York.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.440
And so, I lived my life with
a lot of gay guys, always.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.100
And my parents-- it was
just part of our life.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.670
There was no question.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.225
One of my cousins was one
of the dancers in the show,

00:40:44.225 --> 00:40:44.850
in the company.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.310
And one day, he
said to me, Nancy,

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:48.810
I just have to tell you--

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:49.320
I'm gay.

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.480
And I'm like, I know.

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.040
And he was like [PANTING].

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.870
You know, like he was
so scared about it.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.650
But with this show,
I mean she struggled.

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.010
It wasn't like, oh, you're gay.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:00.670
It's fine.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.970
No-- she went through
a lot of hassles.

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:04.090
And she was scared.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.120
And she doesn't know
anything about how

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.720
to live a life with
a gay guy, her kids.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.394
And then the husband leaves her.

00:41:11.394 --> 00:41:12.060
And she's there.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.620
And she's struggling on her own.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:14.467
But that's the love.

00:41:14.467 --> 00:41:15.300
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.340
NANCY TICOTIN: And
it's a mother's love,

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:20.490
not just for him, but
for everybody in the bar.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.890
You know, like, I feel like
it's kind of a universal--

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:26.310
I'm the "big momma," you know.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.867
And I'm so connected to
Michael, who plays the role.

00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:29.700
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.283
NANCY TICOTIN: We
just have this bond.

00:41:31.283 --> 00:41:33.180
And we have a lot
of fun with it.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:35.160
But it's a challenging--

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.559
I find that the whole show--

00:41:36.559 --> 00:41:38.850
and I'm used to doing singing,
and dancing, and acting,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.230
and kicking my
legs, and all that.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.604
And I don't do
that in this show.

00:41:41.604 --> 00:41:43.830
But I find the show
very challenging

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.290
mentally, vocally, emotionally.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.420
It takes a lot of
my concentration.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.510
And I love that.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.340
Because then I'm
growing, and I'm sharing.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.840
I love to have that
challenge, yeah.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:54.673
SHEREE HAGGAN: Yeah.

00:41:54.673 --> 00:41:56.557
It sounds like this
character embodies

00:41:56.557 --> 00:41:58.890
some of who you are, too,
like that truth in the moment.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:41:59.973
NANCY TICOTIN: Absolutely.

00:41:59.973 --> 00:42:01.682
And I have so many
people, after the show

00:42:01.682 --> 00:42:03.390
that I speak to,
they're like, oh my god,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.580
I wish my mother was like you.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.080
You're like a dream,
fantasy mother.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.950
I swear, they say those lines to
me, which are in the show, too.

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.050
Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:10.550
I love it.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.880
SHEREE HAGGAN: That's amazing.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.780
And it's definitely
how I felt. Afterwards,

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.330
I was like, please be
in my life forever.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:14.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.550
It's so wonderful.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.170
But I just loved it so much.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.080
That was probably one
of my favorite parts.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:20.450
NANCY TICOTIN: Thank you.

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:21.825
SHEREE HAGGAN:
And it's something

00:42:21.825 --> 00:42:24.240
that I just longed for, I
guess, and that yearning.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:24.680
NANCY TICOTIN: Thank you.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.430
SHEREE HAGGAN: So my
last question for you

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.400
guys today, this is for Nathan--

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.770
what would you think is the
biggest difference in terms

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:38.040
of dating, 1973 to today?

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.140
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Well,
all of you kids are spoiled.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.172
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.740
Nowadays you can't
walk into a bathroom

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.740
without 10 guys following
you into your stall.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:53.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.790
But, once upon a time,
things were not so simple.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:01.200
There was no cruising
on the bread lines.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.750
In my early 20s, I had to
intercept more coded messages

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:05.820
than the allied forces.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.730
But I was hungry for love.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:14.160
And I certainly found it--

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.510
painters, poets,
diplomats, sailors galore.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.665
[LAUGHTER] Even a
sword swallower.

00:43:22.665 --> 00:43:25.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:32.050
They, of course, fell
deeply in love with me.

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:34.390
How could they not?

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.130
It is an undisputed
fact that I had

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:42.270
the best legs in all of
N'Orleans, for a man or woman.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:45.340
Mr. Balanchine told
me himself when

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.150
I auditioned for the ballet
"Russe de Monte Carlo"

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:50.225
in 1940--

00:43:50.225 --> 00:43:51.100
keep your mouth shut.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:57.100
Now, mind you--
and I'm no dancer--

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.930
but he was ready to
take me on my silhouette

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:12.260
alone, except for that nasty
prima ballerina, Danilova.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.450
Oh, she was a fright,
and jealous, too.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:19.580
How I would have loved to
tweeze every wayward hair

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.230
of her boorish, Russian face.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.850
But who would have
known where to begin?

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:30.182
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.530
That's all.

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:34.514
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:34.514 --> 00:44:36.949
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:36.949 --> 00:44:37.990
SHEREE HAGGAN: Thank you.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.406
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
And you can see

00:44:39.406 --> 00:44:42.550
that monologue eight
times a week, done

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:47.790
in a very different way,
with lots of physicality,

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:51.805
at the Lynn Redgrave on
Bleecker and LaFayette.

00:44:51.805 --> 00:44:52.930
SHEREE HAGGAN: 45 Bleecker.

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.705
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM:
Tuesday through Sunday.

00:44:54.705 --> 00:44:56.080
SHEREE HAGGAN:
Yes, it's so true.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.970
You can also visit them
at theviewupstairs.com.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:01.780
Or you can visit them on
Twitter and Instagram.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.815
The handle is @theviewupstairs.

00:45:03.815 --> 00:45:05.440
Thank you, guys, so
much for your time.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:05.610
NATHAN LEE GRAHAM: Thank you.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.510
SHEREE HAGGAN: Please,
let's give them

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.593
another round of applause.

00:45:07.593 --> 00:45:10.760
[APPLAUSE]
