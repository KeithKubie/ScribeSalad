00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.240
 I think it's commonplace how the face is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.030
 of a triangle if we know the length of the base 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.250
 and its height. 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.540
 So, for example, if this is my triangle, this length is here 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.910
 here - the base - is of length b, and the height here is 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.080
 with the length h, it is easy to guess that the face of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.170
 this triangle will be equal to 1/2 on the base 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.440
 the height. 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.240
 For example, if the base is equal to 5, and the height 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.180
 is equal to 6, then the face will be 1/2 by 5 by 6, 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.770
 which is 1/2 at 30 - which is equal to 15. 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 Now, what is not so well-known is how the person's face is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.250
 triangle when the sides of the triangle are given 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.740
 When the height is not given. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.470
 For example, how is a triangle located, 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.570
 where only the lengths of the parties are given. 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.530
 Let's say that this is country a, country b and country s. A, b and c are 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 the lengths of these countries. 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.360
 How did we find this? 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.270
 To do this we will apply something that 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.430
 is called the Heron formula. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 is called the Heron formula. 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.790
 I will not prove it in this video. 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.200
 I'll prove it in another video. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.400
 In fact, to prove this, I probably have 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.720
 the necessary tools. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480
 In fact, it is simply the Pythagorean theorem 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.220
 still quite algebra. 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.230
 But I will show you the formula now and how 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.760
 it is applied, then I hope you see it is 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.590
 quite simple and easy to remember. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.660
 It can be a nice trick to impress someone. 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.320
 Thus, according to the Heron formula, we first find the third variable 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 S, which is actually the perimeter of this one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.660
 triangle divided by 2. 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.810
 plus plus b plus divided by 2. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.480
 Then, once you find S, the face of the triangle - this one 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.840
 triangle here - will be equal to the square root of 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 S - this variable S here, which we have just found-- 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:10.540
 multiplied by S minus 'a' by S minus b, by S minus by. 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.480
 This is the Heron formula here. 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.830
 This combination. 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130
 I will enclose it to make it clearer. 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.700
 So here's the Heron formula. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.610
 If that looks a little complicated - a little bit 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.290
 it's really, really, a mere 1/2 on the base 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
 the height. 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.040
 Let's try one or two concrete examples and yes 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.350
 we actually see that this is not so bad. 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.320
 Let's say I have a triangle. 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.300
 Let's leave the formula here. 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.460
 Let's say I have a triangle with sides 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.920
 with lengths 9, 11 and 16. 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.040
 Apply the Heron formula. 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.190
 S in this situation will be the perimeter divided by 2. 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.630
 So 9 plus 11 plus 16 divided by 2. 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.430
 Which is equal to 9 plus 11 - is 20 - plus 16 is 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.660
 36 divided by 2 is 18. 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.430
 And then the face of the Heron formula will be equal to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.380
 square root of S, which is 18, multiplied by S minus a, which is S minus 9. 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.790
 18 minus 9 multiplied by 18 minus 11 by 18 minus 16. 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.490
 18 minus 9 by 18 minus 11 by 18 minus 16 minutes. 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.200
 Then it is equal to a square root of 18 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.730
 9 at 7 in 2. 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.340
 Which is equal to-- let's see, 2 by 18 is 36. 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.900
 I will regroup it a little. 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.700
 This is equal to a square root of 36 by 9 by 7, 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:05.540
 which is equal to a square root of 36 per square 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.330
 root of 9 per square root of 7. 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.130
 The square root of 36 is 6. 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.040
 It's just 3. 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.750
 We do not have negative square roots, 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.920
 because there are no negative lengths of the parties. 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.460
 This will be equal to 18 at 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.120
 square root of 7. 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.060
 So just that, you saw it only took it 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.760
 a few minutes for applying the Genoa formula and even less than 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.420
 this to find that face of this triangle 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.710
 here is equal to 18 square root of seven. 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.040
 Anyway, I hope it has become clear to you. 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.331
 Anyway, I hope it has become clear to you.
