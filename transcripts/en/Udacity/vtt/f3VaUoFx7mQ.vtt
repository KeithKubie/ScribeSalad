00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer to that question is yes. It correlates.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The more experience, the higher the bug density.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This may come as a surprise to you, but here is the story behind it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We mined the Eclipse bug database and check for the experience and contributions

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of the individual developers.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It turned out that the Eclipse project lead, Eric Gamma,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
had the second highest defect density in his code across all the developers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, Eric Gamma is anything but a nobody.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
He gave the world unit tests.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He gave the world design patterns.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And he gave the world the Eclipse programming environment,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
always with a team of course, but still.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Why would his bug density be the second highest across all Eclipse developers?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The reason is simple.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Suppose this is you. You have been assigned to fix a bug.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You look at the problem and you find, oh, this is terribly hard.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What you do is you delegate the problem to your boss,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
who is way more experienced than you,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now your boss is looking at the code and says,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
"Ahhhhh...this is something I can't handle."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He delegates this to his lead, and this guy says,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
"Ah, this looks really, really, really hard.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Only one person in the world can do that."

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This is Eric Gamma, the team leader, who has no one else to delegate to.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Being that the team leader, he gets the toughest problems--

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that is, those problems where the changes of screwing up are highest.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Still, he is the man, because anybody else dealing with these problem

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
would, on average, make a worse job than Eric Gamma.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is how the more experienced people get the tougher tasks,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
possibly introduce more defects, but still overall they are precisely

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the right persons to do the job.
