00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To solve this the first thing I want to know is how many moons can fit into the earth's shadow?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
How many moons widths are there associated with this time spent in eclipse.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, 205 minutes is 3.42 hours.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, I have this conversion factor here,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which relates hours to moon widths, so why don't I use that?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
3.42 hours times--well, now I want to invert this, because I want the hours to cancel out.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This guys has got to go downstairs.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Times 1 moon width per 0.93 hours.  Hours cancels. Sorry. This should have been a 2.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This equals 3.68 moon widths.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Since we said the shadow was the same size as the earth,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
this is equal to one earth width.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Let's divide this by 3.68, because I want to know what 1 moon width is.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I find it's one earth width divided by 3.68.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The moon is 3.68 times smaller than the earth.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I don't actually want width. I want circumference.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Let's go over here and say the moon's circumference, MC,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is equal to, well, 1 earth's circumference divided by 3.68.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's going to be 40,000 km--that's the earth's circumference--

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
divided by 3.68, and the circumference of the moon is about 10,900 km.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Great work. This is really amazing.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You've calculated the circumference of the earth and the circumference of the moon.
