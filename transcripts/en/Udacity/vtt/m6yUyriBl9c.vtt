00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.400
We can now use our
escapedParameters method and

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.550
concatenate its result with
the rest of the URL for

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.276
the Flickr API and I'll go ahead and
turn this string into an NSURL object.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:20.933
But unlike before, we're not going to
make a request using an NSURL.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.674
Instead we're going to use
an NSURL request object,

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:29.814
which is a class that we can wrap around
an NSURL and we can do it like so.

00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:34.606
By wrap, I mean that we can create
an NSURLRequest from an NSURL and

00:00:34.606 --> 00:00:39.154
then it allows us to have access
to more of the request options.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:45.575
For instance, we have access
to the request.HTTPMethod.

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:50.233
Now I haven't mentioned HTTP methods in
awhile, but remember, this is a term for

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.544
the type of request that's being made.

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:57.710
And for this request,
we're going to use the HTTPGet method.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.892
But since get is the default method,
we don't actually have to

00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:04.629
do anything with this particular
property, we don't need to change it.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:15.107
I should also mention that
when we're using NSURLRequest,

00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:17.135
we actually can't change it.

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:22.037
But there is a different class called
NSMutableURLRequests that gives us more

00:01:22.037 --> 00:01:27.014
configurability for the request itself
and allow us to change the HTTP method,

00:01:27.014 --> 00:01:31.560
for instance, but we're not going to
use that until later in this course.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.290
Now with our request object,
we can use the shared NSURLSession and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.380
the data task with request
method to make our data task and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.650
it takes that same trailing closure with
the data response and error parameters.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.510
And I'll say, if there's no errors
than let's just print the data and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.880
also we'll need to remember to resume
the task for the task to actually start.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.181
Now, let's run the project.

00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:00.955
Grab an image.

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:06.979
What's up with this output.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.050
It doesn't look like the JSON we've
seen before in the API Explorer.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.620
There's a reason for this and
let's tackle it next.
