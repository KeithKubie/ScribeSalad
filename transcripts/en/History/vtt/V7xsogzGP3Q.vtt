00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.964
wo-handed war mace, huh?

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:07.382
Clements: This kind of mace

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:09.217
appears in, uh, 12th-century
combat artwork.

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:11.594
Essentially, what you've got
is just a big, iron head.

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:15.098
This one's, uh,
got five flanges or flutes.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.183
This is a weapon

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:22.480
that relies on
sheer brute concussive force.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.773
What we've got here

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.526
is actually the most ancient
of weapons --

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:27.736
a club.
-A club.

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.780
In this case,
turned into a war club.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.074
And you have to keep in mind,
you're not just --

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.535
these knights are not just
hitting with this weapon.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.121
They've got the weight
and the mass of that gauntlet

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.791
and those arm pieces going
with them, with the momentum.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:45.086
So it's not just adding
to their striking power.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:46.921
It's also going to affect
their ability

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.590
to recover the weapon --

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.303
to follow through on a strike
and bring it around.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.889
You're going to see, some
of them are gonna be hitting,

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.974
bringing it right back,
hitting again.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.769
Other times, they're going
to have to wind the blow up.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:07.650
One thing about, uh, the weapons
you'll see in the league --

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.652
swords are all --

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.780
they were all sharp weapons
back in the day,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.490
and they were used
for cutting.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.325
And here, we --
we've dulled the edges.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:17.202
So they still have
the concussive force,

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.496
but they're not cutting
through anybody.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.499
This is made to scramble
your eggs inside your armor.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.959
This is a mass weapon --
what we call a mass weapon.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:27.962
Mass weapons are made
to bring the impact,

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.174
bring the force, through
the armor and crush bones.

00:01:33.218 --> 00:01:35.345
So this'll pass force
very effectively,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.806
more so than a sword
and the edged weapon,

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.642
which will often get dissipated
on the edge of a plate.

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:41.935
What kind of advantages
would I have

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.686
if I used this mace
instead of an ax?

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:47.524
Well, this -- this weapon
has advantages in all ranges.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.359
At long range,
you can choke back

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.527
and you can hit somebody
as they're --

00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:51.986
as they're closing
with you.

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:53.488
Or if they're pulling out,

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:54.989
you can get another
free hit with them.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.741
At medium range, you can
choke up a little bit

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.369
and you can still get
a very hard hit with this.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.746
But you can make blocks --
half-to-half blocks.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.331
You can also
turn the head in --

00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.458
do a pivoting movement,
and turn the head in.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.169
If one of them takes
a really solid hit

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.712
to the head with this,

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.048
is he gonna be able to
recover before his opponent

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.675
gets in that second
and third hit?

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.093
Well, that's --
that's very possible,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.803
that somebody
could get dazed.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.556
And you get dazed with a weapon
like that, somebody --

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.225
half a second, as you know,
can take you out of the fight.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.018
A lot of people can do
a lot of stuff in that --

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.687
in that time period.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:28.731
Now, to use this weapon
properly at-range, like we said,

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.150
they've gotta choke down
to get the most out of it.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.153
Once there's closure --
once they've closed range,

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.072
they've got to take
that double-handed grip

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.782
to get anything out
of this weapon.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.034
They can check with it.
They can hit with the head.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:41.744
They can grapple with it --

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:43.872
put it over the top of the head
and pull people down.
