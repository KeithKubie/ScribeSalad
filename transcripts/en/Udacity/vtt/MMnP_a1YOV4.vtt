One interesting way we learned about babies' vision and depth perception is

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:08.138
with the visual cliff task. And that's this. The researcher puts the baby on

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:11.734
one end of the platform, and then there's a piece of plexiglass on the other

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:17.168
side. This is so it looks like visual cliff. Then, the researcher asks the mom

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:21.738
to stand on the other side of the plexiglass, so she would stand here. And she

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:25.452
would call the baby to come to her. What do you think the baby would do? Type

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:26.240
