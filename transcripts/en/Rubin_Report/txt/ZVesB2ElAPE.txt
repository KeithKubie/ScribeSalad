Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible] trans part of this all fit in because I remember years ago when people would say, when I, when everyone started saying the LGBT community, I remember thinking, I have no more insight into the t part of this, then a straight CIS gendered heterosexual male. Would, you know what I mean? I just, I don't, I maybe I have somehow slightly a little more inherent empathy by being an outsider at some level, but I don't have any more knowledge of it. And now it seems like the Trans issue has almost superseded all of the other issues at least in the last year. I mean everywhere. Yeah. Everywhere you go there's, you know, every time I opened the Twitter search bar, it's another trans story or someone's being fired for this joke or that or the other. What do you think happened there that catapulted this so quickly and what are the issues around it that were kind of afraid to talk about right now? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:59          it's a really complicated fraught topic. I think trying to get you, I think like the legitimate issue about trans is there are people who are trans or field trans and they want their rights respected and that's totally legitimate and good for them. And raising awareness about that is fine. There's a much larger group of people who I think are using trans issues as a kind of wedge to destroy, uh, the gender binary or to kind of muddy the waters or basically as a weapon to beat up evolutionary psychology or evolutionary biology to say there's no such thing as sex. Really. There's no such thing as biological sex or sex is totally dissociated from gender, etc. When someone says that, and the next time someone says that on Twitter, what's the answer that the person watching this should give? That maybe Twitter is not the best one for it?

Speaker 2:          01:55          I mean, male and female or evolved strategies that exist because over thousands of generations they were like the paths to successful reproduction. Um, if you're not clearly male and functioning as a male or you're not clearly female and functioning as a female, you're your genetic dead end. So selection hammers against any ambiguity there. So it's not surprising that the vast majority of humans alive today clearly identify as one sex or the other. Um, that doesn't mean everyone should, it doesn't have any kind of moral implications about that. But just descriptively it means there is a gender binary and it evolved for good reasons. And everyone who teaches biology hopefully knows this and it shouldn't be that controversial right now. If we want to like genetically engineer people and use and whatever to destroy the gender binary for the 22nd and 23rd centuries, we can do that.

Speaker 2:          03:07          We could talk about that. Um, I don't have any particular attachment to the kind of male, female dichotomy ethically. Um, but I think descriptively it's really important to kind of accept it and to go, if it's here, it's valuable to understand and we shouldn't necessarily try to pretend it out of existence, um, or pretend that we're doing it in the name of Trans Rights, right? You can have trans rights without saying there's no such thing as sex. So this gets to the heart of what I think is really happening in this country right now, which is everything has become politicized to the point that the experts in the field seem afraid to talk to you right now are, are taking a risk by talking about these issues. Yeah. Are you seeing this across the board? Are you seeing this amongst colleagues if fear to talk about these things?

Speaker 2:          04:09          Yeah, absolutely. Now the vast majority of people like at my university don't really touch upon anything that's particularly politicized, right? They're just teaching civil engineering or law or um, immunology or whatever. And most of that isn't really politicized yet, however yet is the key word that. Right, right. Okay. I mean you get a little bit bit about what's the gender representation in certain fields, but in my department, in psychology, you do get almost everything having a kind of political edge. And I have colleagues who are frightened to teach certain classes. Like I teach psychology of human sexuality and I'm, I'm pretty upfront outspoken about what I cover and what my view is, but a lot of my colleagues will not touch it with a barge pole because there's so much risk that students will just get upset about one little thing you say. Yeah. And complained to a dean and then you'll get called into the office.

Speaker 2:          05:13          And, um, so what would be that type of thing, but beyond what you just said about the, and the evidence of, of gender differences, what, what are the other types of things that just talking about are scaring the academics? It's very awkward to talk about sex differences in any mental traits or motivations or preferences. It's hard to talk about sexual coercion, rape, pate, rape, harassment, stall gang, etc. That was being incredibly difficult one at college. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's hard to talk about, um, aggression in general, either between individuals or between groups and how that relates to sexuality. Like why hunter gatherer tribes go to war, right? It's not typically about land or food, it's about women. And that doesn't fit the kind of Marxist picture of prehistoric warfare. Right. And then if you talk about stuff like, um, pregnancy, childcare, parenting, are you being, you know, overly pro natalist and sort of family values for talking about that stuff? Is that alienating to certain students who might be homosexual or infertile or, or adopted kids or whatever? Um,

Speaker 1:          06:39          but you see, it's so interesting because I obviously hear these types of stories from academics all the time, not only in here but, but online and people email me all the time and it's like, God, we've failed. I mean, the university really had failed at that point. Like if you're afraid to talk about child rearing because that might upset a gay person. Yeah. Jesus. I mean, what's left at that point?

Speaker 2:          07:04          It's so frustrating and it means I feel bad for the students. But I also feel bad for the parents who are often footing the tuition bill because the parents have faith that if I send my kid to a state university and I paid tens of thousands and tuition and they take a course on topic x, like human sexuality, that they're going to get professors who are willing to profess to say what they really think and often and not getting that. So there's a kind of bait and switch where universities are pretending to be these bastions of free speech and inquiry and, and honesty. And in fact, um, everyone's kind of running scared and these kids are not getting our best insights. They're paying the money, but we're not delivering the service.

Speaker 1:          07:56          How much of an infection, not just in the classroom, do you see this as, but I think, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you've written around 110 published papers. Is that right? Did I get the exact number right? Is it a hundred more or less? More, more or less? You lose count anything at some point. I'm sure you're well aware of the Peter you led hoax, that it's not just what's happening in the classroom that's causing the chaos, but it actually may be what's happening before that related to all of these papers that at certain disciplines basically have, I don't think I'm all the rest of waiting. They almost have no standards. Yeah. At this point that that has got to be just incredibly frustrating for someone that actually has published some things legitimately. It's kind of frustrating, but I can see you don't get frustrated easily. But I'm like, it doesn't matter

Speaker 2:          08:41          bug me as much as maybe it bugged some other people. Partly because I spent a lot of my undergraduate, um, years taking courses on critical theory and I read a lot of dairy, dawn Foucault and, and all those French dudes. And one reason I loved those courses is it was so easy to get an a by writing a kind of bullshit paper using the right terms and ma using sufficiently obscure syntax. Right. That, so I know that game. God, that's real. Very well. It's really real and it's great fun. I understand the appeal of that stuff. It's just, I can't imagine spending my adult life doing nothing about that. And that's what's happening in a lot of the humanities. So it like if, if those folks want to do that and get paid, typically not a very good salary to do that. I don't, it doesn't really viscerally offends me. The only dangerous when is when they turn into activists and they give people like me grief based on not understanding what I do.

Speaker 1:          09:55          Well, I would imagine a lot of bitches then leaks into your classroom

Speaker 2:          09:58          and then, and all bets are off. It's weird. It doesn't actually leak in. Like when I teach human sexuality, right. The kids have a sort of vague, um, political correctness that they've absorbed mostly in k through 12 public school, I think. But if you actually ask them, have you had any courses on gender feminism? No. Have you heard of any of these leading figures from critical theory or history of feminism or even history of gay rights? I know nothing about. So it's not like they've been indoctrinated, at least not in big state schools, but they've kind of soaked up some stuff from high school. I think that influences how they interpret everything. So as two guys

Speaker 1:          10:49          wearing, might I say very nice shirts right now is shiny, terrible shirt and a shiny blue shirt. Let's talk about evolutionary aesthetics. Toll people don't talk about aesthetics. Yeah that much. But you think that sort of the things we're looking at in the west or maybe not as exciting as they should be and that there's a problem there, is that

Speaker 2:          11:08          fair to say? Yeah, I've been really into art for a long time and I think art and beauty are important, um, particularly to places people live and work. And I think as humans we kind of deserve the best from artists, interior designers, stylists, whatever, architects that make our lives as pleasant as possible. And I think basically ever since about 1910, art in architecture has failed and has not done a very good job of delivering visual environments that are actually humane and appealing and enjoyable and that kind of promote mental and physical health. What happened around 19 modernism, man, um, if you look at the way domestic architecture worked up until about that period, it was all sort of human scale and arts and crafts and um, there are places you'd want to live where you didn't have to be educated into a particular elite notion of what a house should be in order to appreciate it. Right? And then you get the bow house, international modernism, white structures, crisp hard lines, um, bad acoustics. And suddenly that becomes the fashion right? And that becomes what people think or is the future and nobody likes it, but it's kind of imposed top down by the elite. You must live like this, like it or not.

Speaker 1:          12:46          Is that top down from the elite or is that just that often those things are just easier to build probably and cheaper to build or maybe that's the same. Actually

Speaker 2:          12:54          the irony is like you could have taken cheap, easy to build reinforced concrete structures and built a lot of all, some cheap houses that were okay or you could do the traditional route, but instead of what you get is every house must be distinct and must have its own shape and there can't be any, um, standardization. So the houses end up being expensive and experimental and hard to maintain and they leak and everyone's miserable. Um, so they're not really serving the needs of the, the people at large. They're just great for architect egos.

Speaker 1:          13:35          Yeah. It's interesting because I just spent a couple of months bouncing through a lot of different countries in Europe and especially on most of these countries because the history goes back so far. You seem incredible architecture. You see eating, you know, I'd see chairs that were 150 years old and like the woodwork that would go into it in the craftsmen shit. And it was like, I don't think we could do this today or if we could do it today, this would've caught, this chair would be in our dollars. It would be like a 6,000, $500 chair, where back then, you know, this is what a guy did. It took them a couple of days and he could sell it and earn a wage and it's like we've just, the economics of everything had gotten out of whack.

Speaker 2:          14:12          Yeah. And like nice table here.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Um, this slash probably slide it on the table right when you walked in. So I know you mean it.

Speaker 2:          14:19          Yeah. Um, I've made a few pieces of furniture in my day and that's, that's pretty cool. But yeah, it was a visual art in particular. Um, the economics mean like abstract painting just is so much faster to do than representational painting, right. If you're a young aspiring artist and you want a career and you want to give your gallery a certain flow of work that they can sell, it's a lot harder to do that. If you're doing representational paintings that take a hundred, 300 hours than an abstract work that takes a 10th of that. So the economic pressures are also in that direction. Yeah. Um, but people have, um, kind of voted with their feet and like they don't like elite abstract art. They don't like conceptual art. Um, it's,

Speaker 1:          15:14          I like the word the right word. They or are, they just don't, they just don't know where it's conditioning or it's that we all like to like what everybody else likes

Speaker 2:          15:23          sort of thing. I think everybody knows that that kind of supposed to enjoy going to, like while we're visiting the city, we should go to the contemporary art museum and they get there and there's a bunch of terrible video art and there's a bunch of very puzzling conceptual art. And they read the little descriptions on the walls and they go, it just makes no sense cause it's written by an art curator for other art curators. And it's all completely alienating. And that's, that's sad because it means they're being told this is the highest expression of your culture, but it's completely inaccessible to you.

Speaker 1:          16:04          So what, uh, what do you look at that gives you some excitement or can still sort of renew your spirit, let's say? Well, there

Speaker 2:          16:14          is a movement of kind of neo traditionalism and, and art where there's, there's certain places like New York Academy of Arts that are actually teaching students how to draw and paint and sculpt and, and do the sort of traditional, um, skills that people associate with art. Um, it's just a little hard to get a foothold in the, like the New York or London gallery system if that's the kind of work that you do. Um, but my hope is that like the bay area billionaires, we'll start collecting that stuff. Um, I think the Chinese aren't market is, has got a real thirst for good representational art and I think that's going to start to dominate the art world pretty soon.

Speaker 1:          17:00          So what's the evolutionary need for good art? I mean, what's the psychological, I mean, I know you're, you're okay. There's an expression of something that can't quite be said, but what's like the driving force behind that?

Speaker 2:          17:15          So yeah, on the one hand there's, why do we bother to make art? On the other hand, why, why do we like certain kinds of art? And there's been a lot more research on why did we like certain kinds of patterns and colors and forms and compensations and whatever. But there's no sort of unified theory of, of aesthetics. In fact, I would say there's more good stuff published on that topic between about 1817, 1920 than since. Cause that's when people were sort of there inspired by Darwin. Evolutionary aesthetics was a field. There were dozens of books published on it and then modernism came and everyone forgot all of that.

Speaker 1:          17:59          How could this be connected to the earlier topic, which is sexuality. So for example, my gay male friends generally speaking, have a much better eye for art or for style or for fashion. Yeah. You know, you could get away in that crew. You know what I mean? Like you've got a nice blanket on, you got an make shirt like that. You know what I mean? Like, I mean that is a compliment. Like where Jay, again, just broadly speaking, it's like my straight guy friends, all kinds of wear big shirts and they don't know exactly how to do their hair and their, you know, so there's some connection between sexuality and artistic vision.

Speaker 2:          18:38          I think that's absolutely true. And it's not what you would predict from first principles. It's really weird. If you look around at other species, the males are typically much more ornamental than the females. They have the, the amazing plumage and they do the incredible songs and dances and the females are usually kind of drab and, and not that aesthetic. The power birds that make these incredible kind of installation works. That's all the males. Then you get to humans or at least American males, American straight nails. And it's like, can't you even find clothes that fit? We'd like colors. That is the big shift work. And like what is up with your house? You know? And when I did the,

Speaker 1:          19:26          you're in Peter's until 2 million copies to tell people to clean their room.

Speaker 2:          19:29          Yeah. So I have no idea why gay men have better taste than straight men. I think that's a fascinating, there's some, there has to be some something going on there. Um, but I think men can level up obviously cause like British and European men aren't as hopeless. If you grow up a young man in Italy, you kind of absorb some ideas about style and even the British um, kind of aristocrats landed, gentry class have a certain look that it's a bit traditionalist but at least there's taste.

Speaker 1:          20:09          I don't know if he's going to quite make sense, but where we almost getting there say 10 years ago with the rise of the metro sexual. Yeah man, it's sort of crashed because I guess maybe it relates back to what you said at the beginning about where we are more puritan. So where there was this idea there was this like mocking of them like Ah, they're just gay but don't want to admit it. Or something like that. And that whole thing seem to crash. Like there was this little brief window where straight guys were like dressing better had cooler haircuts or something, something there.

Speaker 2:          20:36          Well, even five years ago when I lived in New York for a little bit and uh, hung out, hung out a lot in Brooklyn, there was sort of, that was peak hipster in Brooklyn and the guys there, the straight guys put a lot of effort into grooming and haircuts and authentic style and this or that is in fashion. And I thought this is really cool. This is like a Europeanization of male taste and culture, but it was also very masculine. It wasn't sort of like late seventies disco culture or early nineties rave culture or, or burning man culture. You sort of more old school masculinity school. Yeah. Like I want to go to a proper barber and get proper haircut and like it's all flannel and boots and whatever and I love that stuff. Um, but I think it kind of had its moment and evaporated on it.

Speaker 1:          21:36          They just priced themselves out of the market and Brooke, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Or they just got all too busy on Twitter. Well that it always comes back to that. Let's talk a little bit about mate selection. Regardless of your sexuality, there seems to be this new thing right now where if you're not open to dating, absolutely anyone under any circumstances, no matter how they look or how they take care of themselves or whether they brush their teeth or whether they have a penis or a vagina or any combination of anything that if you are just open to anything, there is a a pretty loud and growing boys out there that is trying to frame everyone as a, as a pig, which is the reverse of what choosing a mate really has been about. It's insane. I mean, for 500 I got you. I got emotional. There were

Speaker 2:          22:23          500 million years, right? Our vertebrate ancestors have been choosing the mates selectively because that is the highest stakes decision any organism makes as who do I recombine my jeans with? Right? And so all the way through the coordinates and the vertebrates in the mammals and the primates, you get, particularly females being choosy about, you know, who they breed with, who sires their kids, but then as fit as humans start doing pair bonds million 2 million years ago and the males start investing more in offspring, start forming longer term relationships, then we also have incentives to be choosy about our female mates. And so this is the one domain where if you have even a shred of libertarian in you or you respect freedom of association at all, or you think it's okay to care who you spend your life with and like what kind of children you, you create, then mate choice should be it kind of domain of freedom,

Speaker 1:          23:33          right? Like this is a good place to be prejudice, so to speak, right? Yeah. Like you should add some,

Speaker 2:          23:38          uh, it should just be discriminating, have judgment on taste and you can always be open to the idea that maybe the current set of criteria that I have maybe could be nudged or improved or tweaked or maybe I'm subject to certain stereotypes and maybe I could overcome those. True, of course people tend to get better at may choice in their thirties and in their teens. But for someone to start lecturing you politically, like you shouldn't be attracted to women. You should be attracted to anybody or any, any kind of being or in any species and the age like, no, let please let me be attracted to, I'm attracted to because that should be like the, the pinnacle of human freedom. Yeah. If, if you don't believe in freedom anywhere else, you should believe in mate choice freedom. It should be a fundamental human right I think. And where you get horrible to tal in societies, really infringing on mate choice freedom. Like you're not allowed to marry that person or you know, you have to do an arranged marriage to that person. We kind of recoil at that and go, that's horrible. And yet in America we have busy bodies, virtue signalers um, telling us your may choice criteria are too narrow.

Speaker 2:          25:12          So where

Speaker 1:          25:14          do gay people fit in all of this then out of biological or an evolutionary perspective, you've brought up the point of passing on genes, man, gay couples or gay people, whether you're a couple or not. Don't do that. At least biologically speaking. Yup.

Speaker 2:          25:29          Um, so what, what do you make of that condition?

Speaker 1:          25:35          Is that even the right word? And I'm going to get, I'm going to get us both in trouble. Probably just for me asking the question. Let's call it a trait trait traits. Pretty neutral. Okay. Alright. Trey, it's pretty neutral.

Speaker 2:          25:44          Well, here's the fascinating thing about homosexuality is people have been developing or trying to develop series of male homosexuality and it's kind of evolutionary origins and functions for 30, 40 years and there is no good theory of it yet. It's a complete mystery. I've never seen any compelling explanation of male homosexuality. So, so what would be a compelling compelling argument would be, okay. There's costs of being like exclusively attracted to your own sex and therefore not typically having as many kids, but there's some countervailing benefits of some sort, maybe benefits to your extended family or benefits to your group or something else. But nobody can make the math work enough to, to kind of explain that. Um, female bisexuality is much easier, right? You can go, well as long as a woman is sometimes attracted to men enough to have kids, then also being attracted to women might be no cost at all or it might even be a benefit in terms of social networking, making friends sex as a great way to make friends. Um, if a lot more males were bisexual, that would be equally easy to explain. Um, it's exclusive homosexuality, that's very hard to explain. It certainly exists that exists at a, you know, a percentage that's much, much higher than you can explain is just, well, it's just mutations where it's just maladaptive. That won't work. So this is where I'll be Kinda epistemically humble and say, man, I have no idea. It's an, it's a fascinating problem. Maybe somebody will crack it within 10 or 20.

Speaker 1:          27:39          Right. It's interesting because if you were coming at it from another perspective, like a religious perspective, let's say you would find that to be a moral quandary that then you could extrapolate that all sorts of different judgements on, yeah. But I can see the way you answered it, it's like just is a thing. Yeah. Maybe we'll get more data on it, but it is, but what do you make of the fact that there are seemingly many more bisexual women where, I don't know any gay couple that wanted the guys sneaking out at night to bang a woman. Never heard of that. But you have heard of obviously straightened couples where the guy is, you know, on the DL or whatever. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          28:14          Yeah. Well my girlfriend Diana Fleishman has a whole theory of female bisexuality. That's, that's to do with the social networking benefits. Um, but then the question is, yeah, why don't the men do that too? Cause like,

Speaker 3:          28:28          okay,

Speaker 2:          28:29          if, if you're a guy and you kind of swing both ways, then like doing gay sex can be a great way to make male friends also. And it's,

Speaker 1:          28:38          well now I know we have our, uh, our promo for the show.

Speaker 2:          28:44          And so in a way the quandary isn't why do any male homosexual is exist. The quandary is why aren't all males and females bisexual?

Speaker 1:          28:56          And do you think some of that years from now we might look back and go, Whoa, that's just societal pressure.

Speaker 2:          29:02          It might be. I think certainly there's a huge amount of stigma against male bisexuals from both sexes, but especially women. Um, female bisexuality used to be stigmatized maybe 30 years ago and not so much anymore. Yeah. So it could change.

Speaker 1:          29:19          What are some of the other topics that are, that are really on your mind these days? Let's hit up effective altruism. Yeah, let's talk about that.

Speaker 2:          29:28          Um, I don't know if you've had many guests on talking about effective altruism, but it's not a tight, actually, it's sort of my hot topic of the last few years. So it's a social movement on moral movement. It's some of the smartest young people I've ever met. And their basic goal in life is do the most good. They can based on reason and evidence rather than sentimentality and virtue signaling. I've done a little bit of this sort of in an ancillary way with some of the libertarians that, yeah, yeah. Yeah. And so the kind of major domains they tend to focus on are things like how do we get charities to be more effective at reducing global poverty or promoting global public health? How do we overcome factory farming and be nice to animals and promote animal welfare? And so a lot of the effect of altruists are Vegan for ethical reasons.

Speaker 2:          30:25          And then a lot of them are focused on just survival of the species. How do we reduce existential risks to humanity like nuclear war bioweapons, um, and artificial intelligence risks. So maybe the most distinctive thing they have is this kind of ultra longterm perspective that's like, we are just these transient little beings. The thing that really matters is what is humanity turn into? How long do we last? Do we colonize the universe or do we fail? And folks who think most seriously about that think it's actually that lasting, minimizing existential risk that is absolutely crucial and everything else is just kind of fluff and bullshit

Speaker 1:          31:18          like the transhumanist who would sort of fit within them. Is there a risk? So I love this stuff because I'm a Scifi guy. Everything I mentioned Philip k Dick before, I mean every one of his stories or books or about the inevitability of all of these things. Is there a risk though? I'm always looking at what's beyond the horizon instead of going on right now.

Speaker 2:          31:38          I don't really think there's a risk unless like the vast majority of humans became effective altruists there's already so many people who are obsessed with um, you know, diversity and equity and inclusion and economic growth and all the ordinary problems that politicians talk about that that's covered this already. A lot of smart people working on that. The big neglected topics tend to be the kind of science fictiony topics where you need a sort of cadre of genius as BS, right. To work on it when nobody else is taking it seriously.

Speaker 1:          32:20          Yeah. Well speaking of they ask me is that, that's an interesting whatever we wanted to get into it. That's a little, a little controversial as well. Um, what is that all about? That so many of the creators now or the people that are coming out of the tech world, even though you can obviously make plenty of arguments at the tech world is now in his of implosion and

Speaker 2:          32:40          certainly not the creative place it was say 10 years ago, but that's so much creativity came out of a world that had so many people that were seemingly uncreated. [inaudible] I think it's fascinating. Um, I sort of identify as moderately Osby myself kind of high functioning asbergers and I've written some stuff about how um, neurodiversity issues like being asked to kind of rub up against free speech issues cause like can you explain that over people who are asked, we don't always do a good job of understanding the beliefs and desires of other people and particularly what they might find offensive, right? So they might just say something so they might just say shit. And then these really surprised that it was distressing to someone. And so if you have a model of speech that says you must never cause a fence, that assumes you can anticipate what will cause a fence, and a lot of people can't anticipate that because their brains don't work that way.

Speaker 2:          33:44          So you either need to say, okay, as bs, you can never say anything or cut them some slack and say, we understand you'll offend people once in awhile, but that's okay because that's just, that's part of your deal, man. I've never thought about this, but does this somehow explain what's going on in Silicon Valley? Right now you have a bunch of people who are somewhat socially awkward, let's say, created incredible technology that allowed us to all connect, but then when voices that are exposed, I suppose that's a horrible way of framing it within voices that are a little out there or a little contrary or whatever that might include us actually get out there. The only way they can deal with it is to shut that voice off or something like that. Like, which is why we're seeing so much d platforming and silencing and they're right. They have to be overly systematizing about it, that they have to be like, oh man, I can't, I can't navigate these gray areas if I'm running a social media platform or Patrion or whatever. Right? So I'm gonna just have a hard and fast rule that says if I get enough complaints, I d platform that person or um,

Speaker 4:          34:58          okay.

Speaker 2:          34:59          I don't know the difference between porn and erotica and just slightly sexy art. So I'm going to say no nipples or whatever. That's a kind of asked be response to getting blow back from people were like, you don't really know why they're upset. So in a weird way, if you have a bunch of the creators of Silicon Valley then are coming from that world and then you suddenly bring in a bunch of executives that come from the social justice world that really shows like a, uh, that's a match made in hell. Right? It's just matter. Anti matter. Yeah. It's, um, it's terrible. And what I hoped would happen is that maybe five or 10 years ago it seemed like,

Speaker 2:          35:46          Whoa, like tech is dominating culture generally, and tech is dominated by ASP ease. So hopefully ask me values of being kind of tolerant and eccentric and nerdy and like getting weird little enthusiasms that that would kind of trickle down and create a more tolerant culture. Is that what you would have predicted, say 10 years ago? Yeah, really. And instead you have the opposite. You have the social justice activists taking over and basically saying all of that quirky freedoms that you, you asked the people value, we're going to legislate that away. You can't have that. Um, and it's, it's tragic. I hope the pendulum swing swings back, but um, as long as the leaders of the social media platforms don't have the guts to say, look, this is our people. Um, outspoken, eccentric, slightly socially oblivious people and that's okay. And the rest of you just have to kind of suck it up and deal with it. That's what they should be doing.

Speaker 1:          37:01          Yeah. It's interesting. I met the point with all of this and you know how friends from Youtube and Twitter and patriotic and the whole thing, I'm really at the point of this where I actually believe that that solution is gone. I don't think it can come from the top anymore. I really don't believe that. I think that thing has become so corroded that I would say the only way it can come is now from the bottom and then the people will basically rise up against these things and I know that it's sort of pie in the sky because what does that even mean? Do we all sign off on the same day? Do we all bet? You know, whatever that means. But I almost see that as the only way to do this because they've had, we've done everything else or, or the governmental get involved in. That certainly rings all the bells that I'm not happy with on my libertarian side.

Speaker 2:          37:43          Yeah. I, I think at least in terms of universities, the only solution to, to some of the university problems is the government actually saying at least to the public universities that are in principle bound by the constitution. You guys have to obey the first amendment or you lose federal funding. I think that's the only leverage. Yeah. And I was really kind of hoping that POTUS would do that at some point in the last year or two and pretty disappointed that he hasn't,

Speaker 1:          38:14          well, in a weird way he almost benefits the more that they go against it. Right. Because that feeds his base of yeah. Aggrieved and politically correct. Yeah. You know that they see political correctness running amok. Yeah. Something like that. Um, all right. Before we finish up gimme gimme one thing where at the beginning of 2019 right now, give me one thing that we should be sort of thinking about that we're not thinking about now.

Speaker 2:          38:37          I love the thought experiment of like, once Elon Musk succeeds and we start colonizing Mars, what, what are the relationships and social structures in the Mars colonies going to look like? I'm fascinated by this, this issue like barred the colonies going to be like communist utopia is are they going to be libertarian, um, aspirational states? Are they, is everyone going to do monogamous lifelong marriage? Is it going to be crazy polyamorous, kinky stuff? I think it's great to think about this stuff before we attempt it. And I think Mars is going to be this amazing experiment, or like this colony gets formed based on these social and sexual assumptions and this one gets formed and this one fails catastrophic Lee or, or it's like, it doesn't work well then often it's just borrows the organization of this other place. So I think it'll be this incredible kind of behavioral science laboratory and I can't

Speaker 1:          39:44          where I say that's not too far from the way the America we set up. Right, exactly. To be those places of experiment.

Speaker 2:          39:51          Yeah. Um, it's, yeah, it's the way the east coast was 200 and 250 years ago and I think, um, the difference now is the colonies will be able to communicate with each other and with us and be able to measure a bunch of outcomes and deliberately experiment. And I think we need to kind of get out ahead of that and start like rereading all of our classic science fiction and figuring out how is this going to apply for reals now, now that we

Speaker 1:          40:22          do it. Yeah. Which is still related to why you think art is important? Because fiction's just as important. I mean, you realize it all lands that eventually they figure it out. They have their tea party and then we blow them up like, yeah, but they do beautiful art nouveau like domes in the meanwhile. Yeah. Jeffrey, I'm so glad we finally did this and listen to it again for sure. And if you want to see a good combination of bright, smart thought and snark on Twitter, follow Jeffrey at primal Polly
