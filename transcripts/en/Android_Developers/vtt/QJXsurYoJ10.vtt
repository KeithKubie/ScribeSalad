ADRIAN LUDWIG: Hi, my
name is Adrian Ludwig.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.970
I'm on the Android Security
Team here at Google.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.460
And just this week, we released
our 2016 Year in Review.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.516
And so I know that
it's a long document.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:14.390
And a lot of folks won't
have the opportunity

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.160
to go through the entire thing.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.530
So we wanted to put together
a few of the highlights,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.988
talk through them, and give
you a little bit of perspective

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:24.590
on what we've seen over the
last year in Android security.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.930
So to begin with,
what's incredible

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.235
is the continued growth
in the Android ecosystem.

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:32.360
And along with the growth
in the Android ecosystem,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.670
our protections
have grown, as well.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
In 2016, we grew to protect
over 1.4 billion devices out

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.670
in the ecosystem across
the entire globe.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.170
We scan over 750
million devices per day,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.690
so an incredibly large
investment in checking what's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.157
going on in the ecosystem,
and understanding, both

00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:52.740
the protections that
we have in place,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.560
but also the risks that
users are being exposed to.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.420
One of the most
important characteristics

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.560
of the Android ecosystem is how
we've committed to being open.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.660
And from a security standpoint,
that's incredibly valuable.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.210
It gives us the ability
to tap into the collective

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.280
intelligence around
the world that's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.040
invested in protecting the
Android ecosystem, users,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.650
devices, and applications.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.040
So you don't have to rely just
on Google, just on OEMs, just

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.950
on carriers, you can rely,
really, on the entire world,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.900
and its commitment
to protecting itself.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.150
And that's something that's
unique about the way we've

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.040
designed our ecosystem,
is the ability

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.200
to bring in that
collective intelligence.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.420
To facilitate that
intelligence, and make sure

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.280
that the best things
are being done,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.070
it's really important that
there be data, that there

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.780
be transparency into
what's happening

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.155
in the ecosystem, the direction,
and the types of threats

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:42.590
that users are being exposed to.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.131
So this Year in
Review report is just

00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.040
one example of the
type of transparency

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.623
that we're trying
to provide, and make

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.970
sure it's pervasive across
the entire ecosystem.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.310
Openness also means choice.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.080
It means that you
can look at the data,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.150
understand what's going
on in the ecosystem,

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.400
and make decisions
about how you interact

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.700
with your device, about what
type of device you select,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.620
about where you install
applications from.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.080
So all of this is designed
to make it possible for users

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.660
to do the right thing
for themselves as they're

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.639
interacting with the
rest of the world

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.440
through the Android ecosystem.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.810
And the reflection of that
is the incredible types

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.490
of experiences that
were being built.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.980
And these were experiences
that depend, at their core,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.050
on the security of
their devices, things

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.260
as simple as games, where the
integrity of the operating

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.640
system is critical to the
functioning of game play.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.220
Things like ride
sharing, or other sort

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.420
of social mechanisms for
consummating transactions,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.671
Uber, Lyft, and all of the
other types of applications

00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.420
that have been built
on top of the Android

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.970
platform and other
mobile platforms,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.754
depend upon the security
of those environments.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:46.170
Some of the most
exciting examples

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.780
of how we're seeing
Android and mobile devices

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.390
transform how people
interact with the world

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.430
are at the high
end, where payments

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.710
are becoming easier and
easier on mobile devices,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.080
because of the integrity and
security of these operating

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.980
systems.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.140
And even at the very
extreme high end,

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.660
you see users who
are potentially

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.240
some of the most significant
targets in the world--

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.780
state leaders, national
leaders, international leaders--

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.600
who are able to use the openness
and flexibility of Android

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.300
to build very secure
capabilities that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.330
haven't been possible on
closed systems in the past.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.420
For me, personally, one of the
things that's most exciting

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.030
is that Android has
facilitated low-end devices

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.470
being more secure.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.560
So for users who aren't able
to commit hundreds of dollars

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.020
or even thousands of dollars
to protect themselves,

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.951
they still get
out-of-the-box protection.

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.950
And that's one of the
things that I'm personally

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.870
very committed to, and
the team around me,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.244
and Google are
very committed to,

00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:39.780
as well-- making
sure that everybody

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.090
in the world, our
billions of users,

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.390
have access to the best security
protections that are available,

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.420
so they can go about their
lives in knowing and having

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.690
confidence in their
mobile device.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.190
So that's sort of
how we approach it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.930
from a strategic standpoint.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.367
When we look at
a single year, we

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:58.200
begin to see what the
trend lines look like.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.660
And so I wanted to hit a few
of the highlights that are

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.330
included in the annual report.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.280
It's about 75 pages long, so
you may not have an opportunity

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.414
to read the entire thing.

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:07.830
But here are some
of the takeaways

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.490
that you can probably hang onto,
and think about over the coming

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.370
year.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.450
The first is the expansion
of the protections

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.120
that we have that are
service-based in the ecosystem,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.290
so actively checking and
improving the consumer

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.280
developer enterprise protections
to make sure that users have

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.330
the best environment possible.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.080
So a big investment in
those kinds of capabilities.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.845
We've also invested quite a
bit in the platform security.

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:35.220
When I talk about
the platform, I

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.310
mean the open source technology
that's delivered on all Android

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.280
devices.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.700
So we've enhanced it with
key security technologies,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.539
greater adoption of encryption,
greater adoption of Smart Lock.

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.080
We'll talk through
some of the trends

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.760
that we've seen
over the last year

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.680
as we go through
more of the content.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.170
One of the most
significant changes in 2016

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.920
was that we transitioned towards
having monthly security update,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.734
including security fixes that
have been found by the security

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.400
community outside of the Google,
as well as our researchers here

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.340
at Google.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.150
We had 12 security updates
on a monthly basis.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.990
And we're going to continue
that going into 2017--

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.160
a very significant
adoption of those

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.240
by OEMs across the
entire Android ecosystem.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.870
One of the hallmarks of our Year
in Review is a focus on data,

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.432
and looking at what's actually
happening in the ecosystem.

00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:22.890
And so there are
a few measurements

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.940
that we're going to call out.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.050
And I'll sort of
walk through them

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.670
as we go through
this presentation.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.470
But they go really
into great detail

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.450
in the written out form
of the annual report.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.540
Some of those data are around
malware and the distribution

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.440
of malware.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.870
2016, relatively flat.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.390
Very slight declines in the
overall number of devices

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.480
that have malware installed
from what we saw in 2015.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.120
On a category-by-category
basis, whether devices

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.354
were in Play or outside of
Play, we saw those declines.

00:05:49.354 --> 00:05:50.770
And one of the
highlights, for me,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.750
was that 50 out at the top
50 most populous countries,

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.120
in terms of number of
devices that they have that

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.640
are downloading
applications, saw a decline

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.990
in the rates of malware
getting onto those devices.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.160
So incredible progress that
we've made in protecting

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.040
Android users across
the Android ecosystem.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.850
And then since there was a lot
of news about Android security,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.890
as has been the case for
the last several years,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.620
we'll flag a couple of the
most prominent stories,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.980
and talk through where those
stories went after they hit

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.602
their peak in the headlines,
and then how they declined

00:06:23.602 --> 00:06:25.060
throughout the
year, as protections

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.620
have kicked into
place, and made sure

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.040
the users ended up
in a safe place.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.920
So we're going to walk through
three different primary areas,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.860
the robust platform,
services, and updates,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.860
and talk through the changes
that happened in 2016.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.730
So here we go.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.710
Let's take a look
at the platform.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.490
At this point,
Android has delivered

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.630
on most of the major security
capabilities that are expected

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.880
of any mobile platform.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.430
We have strong integrity
through verified boot

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.730
going up through
the entire stack.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.630
It's tied to a hardware
route of trust.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.790
Encryption has been enabled
for two major releases.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.920
And so we've begun to
see substantial adoption

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.204
of encryption across
the Android ecosystem.

00:07:05.204 --> 00:07:07.120
So there were a number
of significant features

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.460
that were delivered in 2016.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.440
But one of the most
important characteristics

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.540
of these features is not
the technology itself,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.660
but the rate at which
it was being picked up,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.030
And the rate at which we're
able to deliver new security

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.480
technology into the platform.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.270
So this is a graph that's
included in the report.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.980
It talks about the fact
that, even though encryption

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.500
of full-disk encryption was
enabled all the way almost four

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.780
or five years ago in the Android
platform, prior to Android 5.1,

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.560
there was practically
no adoption of it.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.180
It was there.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.388
Users just didn't turn it on.

00:07:38.388 --> 00:07:40.850
And so we saw adoption
that was less than 1%.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.360
It became required for new
devices with Android 6.0.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.150
And with Android 7.0 we
saw continued acceleration.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.649
So we went from
1%, to 20%, to 80%.

00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:50.440
And we're expecting
that that will continue

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.290
to grow until we achieve,
over the next couple of years,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.780
nearly 100% adoption of
encryption across the Android

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.950
ecosystem.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.770
So that, I think, is one of the
most important stories of 2016,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.470
in terms of features,
is recognizing

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.800
that these features are
able to achieve velocity

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.042
and adoption very, very quickly,
which is really exciting.

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:11.000
Here's another feature.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.220
This one, there
were changes in how

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.490
users interact with the
feature, but not as substantial

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.600
as one encryption.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.410
And so we saw adoption of
Smart Lock go up by over 175%.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.720
So the story here is
really understanding

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.300
that the features that are being
released are being picked up

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.340
and being used
very, very quickly.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.730
And so when we look at the core
platform capabilities, the fact

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.993
that all of the major
features are in place,

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:36.409
and we're now starting to enter
a phase of incrementalism,

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.480
in terms of the features
that are being introduced

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.980
into Android, I
think we're actually

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:42.355
in a really exciting place
for getting these features out

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:45.130
to as many users as possible.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.150
It also makes it possible for
us to focus on the details,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.060
really invest in individual
security researchers

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.120
expanding the number of
people who are finding issues

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.140
and reporting on them.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.280
So one of the areas that we've
been investing a lot in 2016

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.330
is in our Security
Rewards program.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.850
The way this program works
is anybody in the world

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.370
can become a security
researcher focused on Android.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.610
All they have to do is find
issues and report them to us.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.830
One of the really
fascinating characteristics

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.920
that we've seen of the
Security Rewards program

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.170
is who it is that it draws in.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.120
Areas of the world that
previously have not

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.820
been significantly involved in
providing independent security

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.690
research have really
flourished on Android.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.950
So areas of China,
Eastern Europe,

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.830
and a number of other
places around the world

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.230
that previously hadn't
had a significant amount

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.960
of public open security
research have really

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.970
been contributing
a lot to Android,

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.550
to the tune of over 100
different contributors

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:42.160
around the world, and over
a million dollars invested

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.230
in finding and fixing security
issues on the Android platform.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.730
So that's where
we've been investing

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.069
in the platform itself.

00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:51.860
The other area that
we've been investing in

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.494
is in comprehensive services.

00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:54.910
These are the
services that we use

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.630
to help monitor the ecosystem
and react in near real time

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.680
to issues that might be found.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.980
So let's talk through some
of those capabilities.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.356
As you may recall from
last year's Year in Review,

00:10:05.356 --> 00:10:06.730
or if you've been
looking closely

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.410
at what we're doing
in Android security,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.035
there's four different
areas that we're

00:10:10.035 --> 00:10:11.390
investing in services.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.639
The first is around
analyzing applications.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:15.430
I'll talk more about
that in just a second.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.330
We call that Verify Apps.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.810
The second is what we refer
to as the Sensor Network,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.940
or sometimes we talk
about it as SafetyNET.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.240
This is looking at
non-application based signals

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.210
on a device to try to find
potential security risks.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.982
So we're analyzing
whether devices

00:10:29.982 --> 00:10:32.440
might be being exploited in
the browser, whether they might

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.130
be running into
network problems,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:38.560
or any other type of issue
that has security significance.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.090
The third thing
that we invest in

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.450
is protections for
lost or stolen devices.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.480
It continues to be the case that
the largest threat that most

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.870
users face is a potential
loss of the device,

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.070
where not only is their
data exposed to risk,

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.950
but they also are
potentially losing

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.520
the significant
financial investment

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.350
that they've made
in what may be one

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.920
of their most important
and valued possessions.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.970
And so Android Device
Manager is designed

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.290
to help users lock or find
a stolen or lost device.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.245
The fourth area that's a pillar
for our security services

00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:13.780
is APIs, recognizing that
Google has built these services,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.434
made them available
to consumers,

00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:17.350
but that there are
application developers that

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.266
might want to take
advantage of them, as well.

00:11:19.266 --> 00:11:22.440
So APIs is an area that we've
invested in significantly.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.790
And the report goes into a
number of different examples

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.750
of the types of APIs.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.041
I'll talk about just one today.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.930
The application review
process continues

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.140
to be one of the most
high-profile and significant

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.440
services that we have
available within Google

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.120
services for Android.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.914
It plays two
different functions.

00:11:41.914 --> 00:11:43.330
The first function
is to make sure

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.580
that any application that
gets uploaded to Google Play

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.340
has gone through a
comprehensive security review.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.880
That means dynamic analysis,
looking at signatures,

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.900
third-party reports, having an
integrated approach to handling

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.540
security reports from other
security solution providers,

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.880
anti-virus companies, et cetera.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.790
It also means that we pull in
data from the SafetyNET sensor

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.684
network to see what's actually
happening out on the ecosystem,

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:08.350
so that we can actually
incorporate that

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.120
into assessing whether
an application is

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.370
safe to be on Google Play.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.320
So that's one
function that we play.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.090
The other is to
provide a protection

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.450
for applications being installed
outside of Google Play.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.970
And they go through exactly
the same level of scrutiny--

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.790
so very, very detailed
scrutiny-- that in many cases,

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.830
can be fully automated,
but in some cases,

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.740
ends up going to a final,
manual, human review.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.360
So we can categorize
applications

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.720
into one of about 20 different
categories of potentially

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.180
harmful application,
or say that it's safe,

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.100
and the user can
go on and install,

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.780
and go about their business.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.930
We constantly re-review
these applications

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:44.680
to see if there's
anything that's changed,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.300
if there's new data
that's available,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.335
or even if maybe we made
a mistake in the past.

00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:49.960
Because these things
happen when you're

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.251
operating at the type of
scale that we're operating at,

00:12:52.251 --> 00:12:54.250
with over six billion
applications reviewed

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.952
every single day.

00:12:56.952 --> 00:12:59.160
So we've got a little video
of that sort of takes you

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.320
through the process
to understand

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.540
how it is that we approach it.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.473
And let's play it here
and take a look at it.

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.910
- Did you know Android has
built-in anti-virus protection

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.040
that gets more
powerful every second?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.380
It starts when an Android
developer uploads their app

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.740
to Google Play.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.310
A self-learning
at-risk analyzer scans

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.700
and simulates perhaps looking
for potential security issues.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.150
If there's an issue, the app
won't appear in Google Play.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.910
On Android devices,
Verify Apps regularly

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.330
scans for harmful behavior,
warning users, and then sending

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.040
this information
to the analyzer,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.720
so it keeps getting smarter.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.810
SafetyNET also scans devices
for exploits and network

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.590
vulnerabilities, protecting more
than one billion devices daily,

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.810
and again, sending data
back to the analyzer

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.740
to get more powerful.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.100
Android and Google
Play, constantly making

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.750
your mobile device
safer at home,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.556
work, and everywhere in between.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.043
ADRIAN LUDWIG: One of the
areas that we've significantly

00:14:00.043 --> 00:14:02.120
increased our
investment in 2016 was

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.990
in what's called machine
learning, neural networks,

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.960
and providing artificial
intelligence as a means

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.990
to detect harmful behavior.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.720
One of the most
interesting characteristics

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.260
that we found as we begun to
develop these new technologies

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.770
is that, often, discovery
is not about looking

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.720
for the needle in the haystack.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.120
It's about trying to find
the effect of that needle,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.047
or trying to see
what impact it has.

00:14:28.047 --> 00:14:30.380
So one of the approaches
that's sort of represented here

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.220
visually is where we cluster
applications together.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.084
So we're not necessarily looking
for the specific bad behavior

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.000
within these clusters.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.530
But we identify
applications that

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.840
are related, based on
some characteristics,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.710
all applications that
abuse SMS, all applications

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.630
that take advantage of
the user's credentials,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.280
what's called phishing.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.900
These clusters get created.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.940
And then, in an
automated fashion,

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.860
we can detect
applications that look

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.350
similar to the other
members of a cluster,

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.180
but that haven't
been categorized.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.840
And that accelerates
our ability to identify

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.910
potential related
applications that

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.320
wouldn't be visible to a human.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.486
There are just too many
variables that are in there.

00:15:11.486 --> 00:15:13.700
So we're looking at literally
hundreds of thousands

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.867
of different characteristics
of any one application,

00:15:15.867 --> 00:15:17.324
and then trying to
see how it might

00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:19.340
be related to millions
of other applications

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.840
that are out there
in the ecosystem.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.559
The human brain just can't
process that sort of scale.

00:15:23.559 --> 00:15:25.850
And so we're using machine
learning and neural networks

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.480
to build out these
kinds of capabilities.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.540
Another investment we've made
that's at incredible scale

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.670
is a technology
called Safe Browsing.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:39.150
Originally developed at
Google almost 10 years ago,

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.090
this is a protection that's been
built into most of the world's

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.040
major browsers at
this point, on most

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.400
of the world's major
platforms, so Windows, iOS,

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.960
and on Android.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.640
And what it does
is it warns users

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.460
about potential risks
on a specific website

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.310
or HTML-based page that
they might be going to.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.140
On Android, we've
gone one step further.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.040
Not only is it exposed as a
capability inside the browser,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.290
but it's also an API.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.750
So any application can
incorporate this technology

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.510
directly, and protect
users in the context

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.100
of their application
when it might

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.860
be displaying web content.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.740
We've seen, of course, that
there is some bad behavior

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.250
out there on the web.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.100
And so there are
many instances where

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:22.057
we're flagging things
across the ecosystem,

00:16:22.057 --> 00:16:23.640
and helping to protect
users that way.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.240
Another area that we've been
investing in, as I mentioned,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.940
is identifying bad
applications, and then

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.680
protecting users from them.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.170
This graph that I'm
showing here right now--

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.010
it's described in more detail
in the full annual report--

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.890
is simultaneously one
of the most boring

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.840
and one of the most
exciting graphs.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.350
And I think it's its boringness
that is what's telling.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:53.820
For many years, there has been
a concern that at any moment

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.310
there could be an uptick
in the level of potentially

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.180
harmful applications that are
installed on Android devices.

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.390
So this graph goes back almost
three years at this point,

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:06.630
showing quarter by quarter how
many devices in the Android

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.329
ecosystem had a potentially
harmful application installed.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.130
And what's interesting
about it is how flat it is.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.740
It's how boring it is.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.990
And that speaks to
the efforts that we've

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.560
had in place to protect
users on an ongoing basis.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.869
Every time we see an
uptick in the line,

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.160
new protections are introduced.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.994
Every time we see a downtick,
new protections are introduced.

00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:27.869
And so we're able to
keep it nice and stable,

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:31.920
even though there is very active
efforts to exploit or take

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.060
advantage of Android users,
as is to be naturally expected

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.430
that are an ecosystem of this
scale with the diversity of use

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.650
cases that Android is facing.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:42.870
And so I'm I excited
that this has continued

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.890
to stay stable with
about 0.7% of Android

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.600
devices having a potentially
harmful application installed

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.420
on them in 2016.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.010
We look both at the
number of devices

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:57.260
that have a potentially
harmful application installed.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.915
We also look at the mechanism by
which these installations take

00:18:00.915 --> 00:18:01.415
place.

00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:03.620
And so the second graph here--

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.900
that's described in more
detail in the report--

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.240
provides an overview
of different channels

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.650
that users might install from.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.350
If they're installing from
outside of Google Play,

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.380
we did see a decrease
in the amount of risk

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.460
that a user's exposed to.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.930
About 9% of installations
from outside of Google Play

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.020
were potentially harmful
applications in 2015.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.030
In 2016, we've cut that
nearly in half, to about 4.8%.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.120
In the context of Google Play,
which is the lower line here,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.010
we've also cut it by about 50%.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.690
But the baseline
was a lot lower,

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.106
which gives us the
ability to make

00:18:37.106 --> 00:18:40.220
a statement that the risks of
installing from Google Play

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.689
are about 1/10 the
risk that a user is

00:18:42.689 --> 00:18:45.230
exposed to if they're installing
from outside of Google Play.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.370
We're going to
continue investing

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.530
in both of these areas to make
sure that we have the best

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.160
possible protections
in Google Play,

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.040
and the best possible
protections for users

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.099
who are installing
outside of Google Play.

00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:56.390
That's the commitment that
we've made to the ecosystem,

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.870
to maintain openness,
but also allow

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.550
for users to be safe in the
face of that kind of openness.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.800
There's a lot more detail
there on the right hand side

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.882
and in the full report.

00:19:05.882 --> 00:19:07.340
I'd encourage you
to go take a look

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.444
if you want to get into it.

00:19:09.444 --> 00:19:11.360
There are a number of
other slices of the data

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.520
that are included in
the Annual Review.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.575
One of them is
country by country.

00:19:15.575 --> 00:19:18.230
I'm not going to dive
into the detail here.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.140
But as I mentioned sort of the
beginning of the presentation,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:26.330
of the 50 largest most populous
user bases for Android,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.190
those countries,
every one of them

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.380
had a decline outside
of Google Play in 2016

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.656
in the overall risk that
users were exposed to

00:19:34.656 --> 00:19:35.780
in installing applications.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.120
So I'm very proud of
the fact that we're

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.670
seeing the ecosystem get
better at protecting itself

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.410
on a country by country basis.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.730
We also have, inside the annual
report, a breakdown of type

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.420
of application.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.910
So enterprises, for
example, may not

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.130
be as concerned
about SMS fraudware,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:57.200
or maybe they're very concerned
about Trojans, or back doors,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.820
or phishing of user credentials.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.310
And so we break it down
category by category.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:04.910
Most of the major categories
did see a decline, both inside

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.330
of Google Play, and on this next
graph, outside of Google Play,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.901
as well.

00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:10.400
So you can take a
look at the report

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.850
and get into the full
details of where and what

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.160
types of risks users
are being exposed to

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.750
and understand
what it looks like.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.320
But to summarize it,
basically in 2016, everything

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.920
got a little bit better, which
is exciting for a security

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.280
practitioner to know that the
efforts that we're investing

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.440
are actually working.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.523
And we're seeing users get
to a place that's safer

00:20:31.523 --> 00:20:34.400
than it was in 2015,
'14, and sort of goes on

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.330
backwards in time.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.510
One of the key
learnings that we've

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.610
had over the last
several years is

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.440
that just protecting
from malware

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.060
is not sufficient, that there
are use cases at an application

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.000
level, but also at a personal
level where users want

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.951
to know more about
the environment

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:54.450
that their applications
are running,

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.670
and how safe their
environment is.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.730
One of the things that
was introduced in 2015

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.500
is what we call the
SafetyNET Attestation API.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.460
This is an API that's exposed
to application developers,

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.420
whether that be an enterprise
inside of their MDM agent,

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.970
or maybe a banking
application and their direct

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.320
to consumer application.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.450
Or one of the largest areas
of adoption we've seen

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.390
is actually in the gaming
space, where games--

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.180
which are, in some cases,
multibillion dollar businesses

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.690
on an annual run rate, and have
all of their revenue coming

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.700
from these client
devices that are

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.880
running Android, iOS, and other
mobile operating systems--

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.890
they really depend upon the
integrity of these devices.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.300
And so some of them take
advantage of these APIs.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.470
So because there are over
200 million instances

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.330
of the SafetyNET
Attestation API being

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.930
invoked on a daily
basis around the world,

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.420
we're able to get a good view
of the integrity of devices

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.270
around the world.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.390
And so we go into
the annual report

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.490
and break that down sort
of country by country.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.550
Here's a visualization.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.890
And you can see some highlights.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:22:00.720
In Japan, over 97% of devices
have an intact security model

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.120
that has gone through
the Google certification

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:06.924
process, so a very high
degree of confidence there.

00:22:06.924 --> 00:22:09.090
It's lesser in some of the
other areas of the world.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.860
India is an area of
the world, for example,

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.526
where the number of devices that
have gone through certification

00:22:13.526 --> 00:22:15.950
is significantly
lower, at about 86%.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.450
And that's an area that we're
going to be making investments

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.330
in 2017 and into the future
to make sure that we're

00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:24.225
able to raise both the
quality and the compatibility

00:22:24.225 --> 00:22:28.340
of these devices
around the world.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.707
So that gives you a
sense for the services

00:22:30.707 --> 00:22:32.540
and the protections
that we've put in place,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.511
and how those are playing
out in the ecosystem.

00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:37.010
The last area that I wanted to
spend some time talking about

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.170
is specifically around updates.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.400
This has been a very substantial
area of investment for Google

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.360
over 2016, as well as for a lot
of our partners in the Android

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:47.920
ecosystem.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.940
So I want to talk a
little bit about what

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.500
we've been doing in
terms of updating

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.380
both devices at the
operating system level,

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.410
but also in terms of
updating applications,

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.390
and making it possible
for developers

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.430
to be responsive to
potential security

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.090
risks in their applications.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.020
So to start, let's
talk about devices.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.790
It's been a really
exciting year.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.520
2015, we introduced what was
called the Security Patch

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.830
Level, which made
it possible to track

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.496
how many devices were being
updated with security updates.

00:23:16.496 --> 00:23:18.120
In the past, it simply
wasn't possible.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.400
The diversity of devices
in the ecosystem,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.360
the diversity of versions, made
it very challenging to do that.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.250
And there were actually
security research

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:27.780
that was done by the
University of Cambridge

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.240
and a few other places just
to understand how many devices

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.320
were being updated.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.450
So simply being
able to understand

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.390
was significant
progress in 2016.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.640
Beyond that, once
we could see that,

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.770
we could see that over
half of the top 50

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.210
devices at the end of 2016 had
an available security patch.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.580
And in fact, over half of
the devices in the Android

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.740
ecosystem, over 700
million devices,

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.590
received a security update
at some point in 2016.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:56.460
So significant investment across
all of the different OEMs.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.320
Here, we've also
highlighted a few

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.020
of the devices that are
receiving updates very, very

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.710
quickly, and are maintaining, on
an ongoing basis, a high level

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:05.460
of patching.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.830
Devices coming from Google,
like the Pixel and Pixel

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.460
XL, the Moto Z
from Motorola, OPPO

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:19.200
on the A33W, Nexus 6P,
Nexus 5, 5x, and 6, Samsung

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.550
with the Galaxy S7--

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.530
so a wide range of
different devices

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.110
that are receiving security
updates on a regular basis.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:28.920
So really exciting to
see in 2016 the ability

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.200
to actually understand
what's happening,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.090
and great progress,
in terms of getting

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.507
devices brought up to date.

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:37.340
One other reason that
those security updates

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.910
are so important is because
of the active investment

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:43.070
that we're making in
security research.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:45.950
Earlier, I talked about over 100
different security researchers

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.990
worldwide, and over
a million dollars

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.976
spent on finding
security issues,

00:24:49.976 --> 00:24:51.350
and then resolving
those security

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.180
issues across the ecosystem.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.230
The result of that labor was
over 600 different security

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.910
issues that were
identified, and that

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.680
were solved through
security bulletins that were

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.888
delivered on a monthly basis.

00:25:01.888 --> 00:25:03.860
So an incredible
amount of investment,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.020
diverse set of
perspectives and opinions

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.090
that are being brought
in that, ultimately,

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.490
make the Android ecosystem
that much more strong.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.160
So I'm really excited to see
that level of investment being

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.057
made, and the results that we're
getting from security research

00:25:16.057 --> 00:25:18.140
program, and the security
patches being pushed out

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.340
to Android devices.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.070
We want to make sure that that
same level of scrutiny that's

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:25.810
applied at the
operating system level

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.900
can be applied at the
application level, as well.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.110
My history, and the history of
lot of folks in the security

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.320
community, has been
to watch investments

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.840
made at the platform
level never really make it

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.710
to the applications.

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:41.060
And then the applications
become the weakest link.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:42.520
And so with Android,
we're trying

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.080
to make sure that
that doesn't happen

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.070
by making early investments
in detecting and preventing

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.719
security vulnerabilities
at the application level.

00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:52.510
One of the programs
that we've put in place

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.850
is what's called the Google
play Application Security

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.080
Improvements program.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.210
This was launched in 2015.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.280
It takes advantage of
our scanning technology

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.860
to look at applications that
are published to Google Play,

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.930
and find potential
security issues--

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.480
not bad behavior by the
application, but just

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.580
a mistake, including
an old version

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.040
of a library that's
no longer up-to-date,

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.620
mishandling a particular
type of certificate

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.000
when managing encryption
on an HTTPS connection.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.450
So in 2016, we expanded
the scope of that program,

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.350
adding over 18 new checks
for potential security issues

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.540
in helping developers
know about the flaws that

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.660
were introduced into their
applications and correct them.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.760
In 2017, we're going
to continue to do that.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.343
We think this is
really important sort

00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:38.050
of foundational technology
that's unique to Android,

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.510
but shows how we're very
committed to openness

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:45.060
and to helping developers
flourish on the platform.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.020
So that openness is
a double-edged sword.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.470
One of the things that comes
of being open, and transparent,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.810
and encouraging security
research on the platform

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.890
is news.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.380
And sometimes, that news
can be a little bit biting.

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:59.360
And so one of the things
that we want to do

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.470
is take a look back at some
of the larger stories in 2016,

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.600
talk about what's
happened, and make sure

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.350
that people recognize
how much protections

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.430
had been put in place
in direct response

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.940
to some of these issues.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.200
So the first example of a
potentially harmful application

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.680
that received significant
attention in 2016

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.530
was named Turkish Clicker
by Check Point in research

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:23.300
that they published this year.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.120
This was actually a family
that Google has been tracking--

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.160
through both Google
Play, and outside

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.810
of Google Play-- since 2014.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:32.310
So it's one that we've been
monitoring for quite a while.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.976
What was interesting
about it is that it

00:27:33.976 --> 00:27:36.151
diversified significantly
around the world,

00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.150
and had a large number
of different applications

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.130
that had been built.
So it was very actively

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.250
trying to evade detection,
both by Google, and by others

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.170
in the security
research community.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.974
By the end of 2016, the
protections that we had built,

00:27:48.974 --> 00:27:51.140
as well as some of the ones
that were made available

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.450
by other third parties,
had done a great job.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.420
And basically, by
the end of 2016,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.690
we'd seen Turkish Clicker come
to an almost complete decline.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.930
Ghost Push was the
name of a family that

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:08.830
received significant attention
in the middle of 2015,

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:11.500
and actually, was quite
prominent in our 2015

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.330
year in review, as well.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:18.615
At one point in 2015, it
represented almost half

00:28:18.615 --> 00:28:19.990
of the overall
installs that were

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.240
taking place in the ecosystem.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.310
It was so aggressive.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:26.020
And across the entire year,
Ghost Push was about a third

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.090
of the overall potential
harmful applications

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.180
that were installed on the
Android ecosystem in 2015.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.724
This graph in the
discussion that's

00:28:32.724 --> 00:28:35.140
inside the Year in Review talks
about the protections that

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.740
were put in place, and the
fact that, by the end of 2016,

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.280
we basically aren't seeing
Ghost Push at all anymore.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.984
Their efforts to
install applications

00:28:42.984 --> 00:28:44.650
have been thwarted
through a combination

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.450
of direct intervention
by Google,

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.360
as well as intervention in
partnership with our OEM

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.931
partners, and some of the
others in the Android ecosystem,

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.430
in order to protect
the installation

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.945
of these applications
onto devices.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:02.480
Another example that received
fairly large attention

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.970
was a family called HummingBad.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.820
These applications
routed the device,

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.060
and then tried to take advantage
of third-party properties

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:11.684
on the web.

00:29:11.684 --> 00:29:13.100
And that's a common
theme that you

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.470
might have seen across
the last three families,

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.140
where they're really
trying to monetize

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.260
the devices through abuse, such
as installing applications,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.880
or going after
properties on the web.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:25.610
What we didn't see
a lot of in 2016

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:29.490
were applications that tried
to actually access user data.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.700
Usually, if there was
any access of user data,

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.100
it was to get
credentials to facilitate

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.050
installation of
applications, or another sort

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.910
of commercial mechanism.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.430
But the short of it
is, for HummingBad,

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.780
identified over 24,000
unique applications,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.940
a large number of install
attempts around the world.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.130
But almost all of them were
outside of Google Play.

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.060
And so here was an area where
the protections in Google Play

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.201
were sufficient to
prevent all but one

00:29:56.201 --> 00:29:58.700
instance of the application in
the HummingBad family getting

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.450
on to Google Play.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.010
And so most of the activity
was outside of Google Play.

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:04.660
The clean up was successful.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.550
And at this point, we're
seeing very few installations

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.490
of HummingBad on
to user devices.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:13.430
And so to summarize, when
we're looking at potentially

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.730
harmful applications, what
we've seen consistently

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:22.130
is early detection via Google
Play, or by the Google efforts

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.009
to identify potential harmful
applications, researchers

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:27.050
in the security community
flagging or identifying

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:30.260
these things and generating
headlines and media interest

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.020
in them a little
bit later in 2016,

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.730
but that ultimately,
soon after that,

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.462
we see those families
begin to recede,

00:30:36.462 --> 00:30:38.420
in terms of their
effectiveness, and the impact

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.120
that they have on users.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.760
So the last thing that we
wanted to mention was--

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.130
I've hinted at it a few times.

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.380
The goal here was to summarize
some of the highlights

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.910
from our annual report.

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.520
There's a link-- should be
somewhere behind me, I think--

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.466
to describe where you can go to
grab the annual Year in Review.

00:30:56.466 --> 00:30:57.840
I would encourage
you to read it.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.380
It gets into a lot more
detail on individual families,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.720
on individual protections
that have been introduced,

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.330
and gives you a
good sense for where

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.150
it is that we see Android
security going in 2016,

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.620
and a precursor to where it
will be going into the future.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.020
So thank you very much.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.460
I appreciate you
taking the time.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.880
And have a good
rest of your day.
