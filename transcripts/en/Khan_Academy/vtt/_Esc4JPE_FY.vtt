00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:03.943
- [Voiceover] Let's compare 2/4 and 3/4.

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:07.306
First let's think about
what these fractions mean.

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:11.447
2/4 means we have some
whole, and we've split it

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:15.936
into four equal size pieces,
and we get two of those pieces.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:17.836
Maybe we can think about
pizza for an example.

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:20.092
We split a pizza into
four equal size pieces,

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:22.788
and we ate two of them.

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:26.792
3/4 means that same whole, that same pizza

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.837
was again split into
four equal size pieces,

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:32.069
but this time, what's
different is we got three

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:33.236
of the pieces.

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:36.454
So maybe from that description,
we can start to think

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:40.927
about which one is larger,
but let's draw them also

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:45.094
just to be sure that we can
decide which one is larger.

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:50.510
So for 2/4, we're gonna have a fraction,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.028
maybe it's a pizza, and
it's gonna be divided, split

00:00:54.028 --> 00:00:56.361
into four equal size pieces.

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:00.192
These may not be perfect lines,

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:04.032
but should represent
four equal size pieces.

00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.615
And we get two of those pieces.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:14.289
So this represents 2/4, two out of four.

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.456
3/4, again, will be the same
as the four equal size pieces,

00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:23.703
but this time, we get three of the four.

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:26.953
So, one, two, three of the four pieces.

00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:33.536
And this will represent 3/4.

00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:37.764
Now we can look at it
visually and see very clearly

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:41.715
that 3/4 is greater,
or takes up more space,

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:45.882
or we can say that 2/4 is less than 3/4.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.669
Remember this is the less than symbol

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:52.018
'cause we always want
this open, bigger side

00:01:52.018 --> 00:01:54.566
facing our larger number.

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:57.893
In this case, it's
facing the second number.

00:01:57.893 --> 00:02:02.060
So we'll say 2/4 is less than 3/4.

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:07.080
Each of these fourths is the same size,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.163
so two of them is less
than three of the fourths.

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:15.009
Here we can try one more, but this time,

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.097
let's don't draw the picture.

00:02:16.097 --> 00:02:17.544
Lets' just think about what they mean

00:02:17.544 --> 00:02:20.083
and see if we can figure it out.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.943
So for 5/8, we have a whole,

00:02:22.943 --> 00:02:26.075
and it's been divided
into eight equal pieces.

00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:29.872
For 3/8, same thing, eight equal pieces.

00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:32.976
But here in 5/8, we get
five of those pieces,

00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:36.657
and in 3/8, we get three of the pieces.

00:02:36.657 --> 00:02:38.602
So the pieces are the same size.

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:40.770
They're eighths on both side.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.740
These are eighths, and these are eighths,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.835
but here we have five of the
eights, and here we have three.

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:49.110
So if the pieces are the same size,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.034
five pieces is greater than three pieces

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:57.272
or 5/8 is greater than 3/8.

00:02:57.272 --> 00:02:59.818
And here our open end, our bigger side

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:01.331
is still facing our bigger number,

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.804
but our bigger number is first this time,

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:05.642
so this is the greater than symbol.

00:03:05.642 --> 00:03:09.475
5/8 is greater than 3/8.
