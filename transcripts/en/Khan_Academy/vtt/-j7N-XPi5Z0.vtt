00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.597
- [Instructor] Now going
to talk about a people

00:00:01.597 --> 00:00:03.901
that began to settle
and eventually conquer

00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:07.526
much of Anatolia, modern-day Turkey

00:00:07.526 --> 00:00:11.359
at the beginning of the
second millennium BCE,

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:15.415
and these people are
known as the Hittites,

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.268
and the word Hittite is referred to

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.466
in the Hebrew Bible, in the Old Testament,

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.448
and it's worth dissecting
that word a little bit

00:00:24.448 --> 00:00:26.309
because the word comes from the idea

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.019
that this region that they conquer

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.303
in modern-day Turkey was
referred to as Hatti,

00:00:31.303 --> 00:00:33.739
and Hatti had original inhabitants

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.405
known as the Hattians,
but the Hittites conquer

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:39.642
and displace these Hattians,

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:41.758
but they are referred to as the Hittites

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.175
because they settle in Hatti.

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:49.035
Now they're considered to
be Indo-European people.

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.638
This is a word that you will hear often

00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:53.775
in World History, and that's because

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:58.596
what linguists have found is
that many modern languages

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:01.144
seem to have a root in what's called

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.771
proto-Indo-European language,

00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.658
and I'll do a whole video on it,

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:07.616
but looking at linguistic structures,

00:01:07.616 --> 00:01:10.246
we believe or one model is is that

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:13.201
many of the people who speak
these Indo-European languages

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.626
or these ones that are derived

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:17.484
from the proto-Indo-European,
and that includes

00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:20.523
languages related to Greek.

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:21.586
We're talking about Latin,

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:23.199
we're talking about
the Germanic languages,

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:24.745
including what I'm speaking right now

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.787
which is English, which is fundamentally

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.602
a Germanic language with
a lot of Latin influence,

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:31.939
we're talking about Celtic,
but we're also talking

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.211
about more eastern languages like Persian,

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:35.665
and Hindi, and Bengali.

00:01:35.665 --> 00:01:38.751
All of these have a lot
of commonalities to them

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:42.441
which we believe gives
evidence that, at one point,

00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:45.512
it was a very closely
related group of people

00:01:45.512 --> 00:01:48.285
who are coming from this Caucasus region,

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:49.887
and this map that you see here,

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:53.252
this shows one model for
how those people spread

00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:55.613
and eventually broke
off into various tribes

00:01:55.613 --> 00:01:59.717
speaking different, but
very related, languages.

00:01:59.717 --> 00:02:02.134
So the fourth millennium BCE,

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.045
they were in this region right over here

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:08.155
which would be southern Russia,

00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:09.717
the Caucasus right around there,

00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:14.321
and then by 2500 BCE,
that's this orange area,

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.041
they had spread even further.

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.255
And then by 1000 BCE, they
had spread even further

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:21.372
and the Hittites would have
been one of those people

00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:25.227
because they settle in
Anatolia right over here.

00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:28.625
Now we don't know as
much about the Hittites

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.939
as we know about, say,
the ancient Egyptians

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.475
or the Mesopotamians, but we know that

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.326
they were a significant civilization.

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:40.213
Now if you look at this timeline here,

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.221
it shows the various civilizations

00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:44.382
that were emerging around this time.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:47.597
We're now talking about the mid

00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:51.514
to late second millennium,
so this is 1700 BCE,

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:54.490
let me write that down just to make sure,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.015
we know that's BCE, 1600
BCE, so on and so forth,

00:02:59.015 --> 00:03:01.055
and I show these various civilizations

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.555
that existed around that time,

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.751
and they correspond to this map here.

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:13.271
So you have Mycenaean Greece
which emerges around 1600 BCE

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:16.331
all the way to about 1100 BCE.

00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.936
You have the New kingdom of Egypt,

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:21.551
which is from about 1550 BCE

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.134
to a little bit after 1100 BCE,

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:26.665
and we do a whole series of videos

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.082
on ancient Egypt, and then we talk about

00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:30.569
the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom,

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.357
and of course, the New Kingdom.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:33.690
And the New Kingdom of Egypt is important

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.149
because they're going to
be one of the key rivals

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.395
for the Hittites in this period.

00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.545
The New Kingdom of Egypt
is often referred to

00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:42.815
as the Egyptian Empire because it was

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:46.270
the most powerful time of ancient Egypt,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.041
and you see that right over
here in this brown color.

00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:51.952
Now in this purplish-blue color,

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:54.326
that is the Hittite civilization,

00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:56.799
and this map right over here,

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.271
you can see that they started to

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.663
really settle and conquer that area

00:04:00.663 --> 00:04:02.758
at the beginning of the second millennium,

00:04:02.758 --> 00:04:06.478
and by 1600, you have
the Old Hittite kingdom,

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:09.561
and then as we get to about 1400 BCE,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.971
you have the New Hittite Kingdom,

00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.862
often known as the Hittite Empire,

00:04:14.862 --> 00:04:17.150
and this is where they really
start to flex their muscle.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.799
And notice, they're flexing their muscles

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.491
at roughly the same time as the Egyptians,

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.027
and so this map right over here,

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:26.429
this is in roughly the 14th century,

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:28.808
what this area looked like.

00:04:28.808 --> 00:04:32.291
So we're talking roughly this zone,

00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.094
and you can see there are
several civilizations,

00:04:34.094 --> 00:04:36.014
many of them that were in their peak.

00:04:36.014 --> 00:04:38.991
You see the Mitanni
Kingdom right over here.

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:41.011
You see the Middle Assyrian Empire.

00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:43.475
We talk about them when
we talk about Mesopotamia,

00:04:43.475 --> 00:04:46.953
and you see Kassite
Babylonia right over here.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.882
The Kassites took over after the Amorites

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:52.640
under Hammurabi and his dynasty,

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.735
and we'll see that they
also have a connection

00:04:54.735 --> 00:04:56.813
to the Hittites.

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.468
So this will hopefully
acquaint you with time.

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:01.839
These are Bronze Age civilizations.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:04.425
The state of the art
technology for most of them

00:05:04.425 --> 00:05:07.066
was bronze, which is
combining copper and tin,

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.585
and you can make weapons, and tools,

00:05:08.585 --> 00:05:09.806
and jewelry with it.

00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:11.388
Now what's interesting about the Hittites

00:05:11.388 --> 00:05:13.258
is that they were one of the first

00:05:13.258 --> 00:05:15.121
to start to use iron.

00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:17.134
Iron required a little
bit more technology.

00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:20.723
In order to smelt iron,
you have to get the furnace

00:05:20.723 --> 00:05:23.234
to be even hotter, and
the Hittites, we know,

00:05:23.234 --> 00:05:24.984
did make use of iron.

00:05:26.677 --> 00:05:30.708
Now they are also known
as great charioteers.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:34.130
This is an image of what a
Hittite chariot would look like,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.921
and so with a combination
of iron chariots,

00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:39.704
that's one of the things that helped them

00:05:39.704 --> 00:05:42.454
establish something of an empire.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.025
Now I mentioned that
they come into conflict

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:47.160
with many other peoples.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.988
In fact, they come into
conflict with most of

00:05:48.988 --> 00:05:52.329
the folks that you see on
this picture over here.

00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:54.104
The first time that you really see them

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:57.267
in a significant way conquering things

00:05:57.267 --> 00:06:00.017
is in 1595 BCE, and this would be

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:03.786
the Old Hittite Kingdom, but this is

00:06:03.786 --> 00:06:06.666
what famously ends Hammurabi's dynasty,

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:09.789
the Amorite dynasty in
Babylon right over here.

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.440
They go to Babylon in 1595 BCE

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.342
and they overthrow it.

00:06:14.342 --> 00:06:16.338
They're not able to maintain rule,

00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:17.381
they have to go back.

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.872
There start to be fragmentation
dissension at home,

00:06:20.872 --> 00:06:24.152
but it's the end of the
Amorites, and then eventually,

00:06:24.152 --> 00:06:26.812
another group, the Kassites,
take over this region,

00:06:26.812 --> 00:06:30.338
and you can see them in
gray right over here.

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:34.501
Now what's also interesting
in this timeline

00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:35.670
that we have, and we're talking about

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.696
hundreds of years, it's important to keep

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:40.177
things in perspective, is that you see

00:06:40.177 --> 00:06:42.966
that a lot of these
civilizations in the Middle East

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:45.466
and Mesopotamia, this
area's often referred to

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:46.746
as the Levant.

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:49.890
It's related to the word levante

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.069
from Italian for "to rise,"

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.740
because for the Romans, for the Europeans,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.707
for those in the West, this
was where the sun rose,

00:06:58.707 --> 00:07:01.662
this was the East, it was
the Eastern Mediterranean.

00:07:01.662 --> 00:07:03.321
And so you have all of these civilizations

00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:07.515
that are in the Levant
in the 14th century BCE,

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:10.908
in the 13th century BCE, but
then they start to decline,

00:07:10.908 --> 00:07:13.770
and that general period after or around

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.344
the 12th century BCE is known
as the Bronze Age Collapse

00:07:18.344 --> 00:07:20.038
when a lot of these civilizations become

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:22.484
a lot more fragmented.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.000
Now I've already alluded to the fact,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.422
and I talk about this in a lot of detail

00:07:25.422 --> 00:07:28.459
in the Ancient Egypt video,
that the chief rivals

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:31.227
of the Hittites were the Egyptians,

00:07:31.227 --> 00:07:34.961
and vice versa, and it's
particularly the case

00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:37.885
in the 14th and 13th
centuries where both of them

00:07:37.885 --> 00:07:40.871
were quite powerful empires.

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:44.409
You have the Egyptians
moving up into this area

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:47.787
right over here, modern-day
Israel and Lebanon,

00:07:47.787 --> 00:07:50.709
and you have the Hittites moving down

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:54.756
from the north, from Anatolia
into modern-day Syria.

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:57.000
And there's a whole series of conflicts

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.193
that emerge in this area,
and one of the most famous

00:08:01.193 --> 00:08:06.163
and one of the most significant
happens in 1274 BCE,

00:08:06.163 --> 00:08:08.748
and that is the Battle of Kadesh.

00:08:08.748 --> 00:08:12.303
Kadesh is an area that has switched hands

00:08:12.303 --> 00:08:15.520
multiple times between the
Egyptians and the Hittites.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.538
At this time, you have Ramses II,

00:08:18.538 --> 00:08:20.495
considered the greatest Egyptian Pharaoh,

00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:23.659
he is the Pharaoh, he
is the ruler of Egypt,

00:08:23.659 --> 00:08:25.857
and he wants to recapture Kadesh.

00:08:25.857 --> 00:08:27.771
And what's significant
about the Battle of Kadesh,

00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:30.087
it's the earliest battle where we have

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:32.880
a significant account of the tactics,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.578
of the strategy, of the
formation of the troops.

00:08:35.578 --> 00:08:38.853
We know that there were over
50,000 soldiers involved.

00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:40.544
It's currently believed it might be

00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:44.119
the largest chariot battle
in all of world history

00:08:44.119 --> 00:08:48.214
that we at least know about,
and the actual outcome

00:08:48.214 --> 00:08:51.112
of the Battle of Kadesh
seems to be a stalemate.

00:08:51.112 --> 00:08:54.422
Our accounts of it come
primarily from the Egyptians.

00:08:54.422 --> 00:08:57.505
We don't have any significant Hittite

00:08:58.883 --> 00:09:01.125
surviving accounts of
the Battle of Kadesh,

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.363
but it gave us a lot of information.

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:07.112
But beyond just the battle
itself being significant,

00:09:07.112 --> 00:09:08.679
because we have this detail about

00:09:08.679 --> 00:09:10.413
what battles were like at that time period

00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:13.397
with chariots and the type
of tactics that were used,

00:09:13.397 --> 00:09:15.713
what's also significant is 16 years after

00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:17.037
the Battle of Kadesh,

00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:21.204
you have the Egyptian-Hittite
Peace Treaty in 1258 BCE.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.033
And the reason why this is significant

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:28.168
is this is sometimes referred to as

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:30.565
the first peace treaty in history.

00:09:30.565 --> 00:09:32.191
I would qualify a little bit as saying

00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:34.620
it's the first peace
treaty that we know about

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.110
in this part of the world,
and this right over here

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.830
is the Hittite version of it,

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.982
and what's especially cool
about this peace treaty,

00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:42.572
and just so you know what
these other pictures are,

00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:44.963
this is a Hittite ramp discovered at

00:09:44.963 --> 00:09:46.990
the Hittite capital of Hattusa.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.692
This is some pictures of the Hittite

00:09:48.692 --> 00:09:50.044
gods of the underworld.

00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:51.409
But once again, we don't have as complete

00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:54.052
of a picture of the Hittite versus, say,

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:57.331
the Egyptians, but what's also neat

00:09:57.331 --> 00:09:59.019
about this treaty, it's sometimes called

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.770
the Treaty of Kadesh, but it doesn't refer

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.988
directly to Kadesh.

00:10:01.988 --> 00:10:04.324
These folks have been in
conflict with each other

00:10:04.324 --> 00:10:07.824
for nearly over 100 years right over here,

00:10:09.638 --> 00:10:11.091
so this treaty is really to talk about

00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:12.685
not just Kadesh, and this treaty happened

00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:14.599
16 years after the Battle of Kadesh,

00:10:14.599 --> 00:10:16.876
but to talk about, "Let's
just have a permanent peace

00:10:16.876 --> 00:10:20.093
"between our two great empires,"

00:10:20.093 --> 00:10:22.732
and what's cool about it is
we have surviving accounts

00:10:22.732 --> 00:10:25.990
from the Hittites that
were discovered in Hattusa,

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.056
and we also have a symmetric account

00:10:28.056 --> 00:10:30.837
that we get from the Egyptians,

00:10:30.837 --> 00:10:33.567
and so this is the one from the Hittites

00:10:33.567 --> 00:10:35.180
and this is from the Egyptians.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.855
It's written in Acadian,
which wasn't their language.

00:10:37.855 --> 00:10:40.687
Acadian, we talked about,
was a Semitic language,

00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:42.622
and they used cuneiform
script, which remember,

00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:45.938
we get from the Sumerians,
but it's cool to get

00:10:45.938 --> 00:10:47.992
the same treaty written
in different scripts

00:10:47.992 --> 00:10:50.548
from both sides of the conflict.

00:10:50.548 --> 00:10:51.822
And I'll just read a little bit of it

00:10:51.822 --> 00:10:53.350
because it's neat to just think about it,

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.663
and of course they didn't
write it in this language,

00:10:55.663 --> 00:10:57.900
modern English wouldn't show up for many,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.934
actually thousands of
years from this point,

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:02.030
but this is a translation.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.696
"Now from the beginning
of the limits of eternity,

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:07.218
"as for the situation of
the Great ruler of Egypt

00:11:07.218 --> 00:11:10.053
"with the Great Prince
of Hatti, the god did not

00:11:10.053 --> 00:11:12.064
"permit hostility to occur between them,

00:11:12.064 --> 00:11:13.581
"through a regulation.

00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:17.762
"But in the time of Muwatallis,
the Great Prince of Hatti,

00:11:17.762 --> 00:11:20.103
"my brother," so this is
from the point of view

00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:22.468
of Hattusilis, who is the Hittite king

00:11:22.468 --> 00:11:24.540
at the time of the treaty, "he fought with

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.412
"Ramses Meri-Amon," the Pharaoh Ramses,

00:11:27.412 --> 00:11:29.010
"the great ruler of Egypt.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.909
"But hereafter, from this
day, behold Hattusilis,

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:34.179
"the Great Prince of Hatti,
is under a regulation

00:11:34.179 --> 00:11:37.046
"in order not to permit hostility to occur

00:11:37.046 --> 00:11:39.060
"between them forever."

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.258
Those are big words.

00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:45.342
"Behold, Hattusilis," sometimes
it's spelled Hattusili,

00:11:45.342 --> 00:11:47.289
"the Great Prince of
Hatti, has set himself

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:51.654
"in a regulation with
User-maat-Re Setep-en-Re,"

00:11:51.654 --> 00:11:55.342
that's sometimes how
Ramses is referred to,

00:11:55.342 --> 00:11:57.447
"the Great ruler of Egypt,
beginning from this day,

00:11:57.447 --> 00:11:58.931
"to cause that good peace and brotherhood

00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.210
"occur between us forever, while he is

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.478
"in brotherhood with me
and he is at peace with me,

00:12:03.478 --> 00:12:05.639
"and I am in brotherhood with him

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:08.675
"and I am in peace with him forever.

00:12:08.675 --> 00:12:11.807
"Behold, I, as the Great Prince of Hatti,

00:12:11.807 --> 00:12:14.593
"am with Ramses Meri-Amon, in good peace

00:12:14.593 --> 00:12:16.072
"and in good brotherhood.

00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:18.206
"The children of the
children of the Great Prince

00:12:18.206 --> 00:12:20.288
"of Hatti are in brotherhood and peace

00:12:20.288 --> 00:12:23.117
"with the children of the
children of Ramses Meri-Amon,

00:12:23.117 --> 00:12:25.238
"the Great ruler of Egypt, for they are

00:12:25.238 --> 00:12:27.655
"in our situation of brotherhood

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:30.130
"and our situation of peace.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.217
"The land of Egypt,
with the land of Hatti,

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:34.816
"shall be at peace and in brotherhood

00:12:34.816 --> 00:12:36.925
"like unto us forever.

00:12:36.925 --> 00:12:40.846
"Hostilities shall not
occur between them forever."

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:42.957
So not only are they, and
this is just part of the text,

00:12:42.957 --> 00:12:44.174
it's actually quite interesting,

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:48.341
do a web search for the
Egyptian-Hittite Treaty text,

00:12:49.188 --> 00:12:50.398
and you can actually get the whole text,

00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:52.110
this is just part of an excerpt of it,

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:53.594
but they go into much more details

00:12:53.594 --> 00:12:55.646
about how they might
provide aid for each other,

00:12:55.646 --> 00:12:57.023
how they're not going to have conflict,

00:12:57.023 --> 00:12:58.508
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:58.508 --> 00:13:00.984
So I'll leave you there,
but the important thing

00:13:00.984 --> 00:13:03.336
to take away is some
of these modern notions

00:13:03.336 --> 00:13:05.358
of peace treaties and military tactics,

00:13:05.358 --> 00:13:08.153
they go deep into history, and this is

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:09.695
some of the earliest evidence we find,

00:13:09.695 --> 00:13:11.745
but I would suspect as
we discover more things,

00:13:11.745 --> 00:13:14.745
we might find even earlier evidence.
