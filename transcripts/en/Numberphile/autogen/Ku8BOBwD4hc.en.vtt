00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.480
 
I made it to bigger object they were

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490
I made it to bigger object they were
 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.370
I made it to bigger object they were
both made from you know two cups of

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
both made from you know two cups of
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.400
both made from you know two cups of
espresso one of them glued like it and

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
espresso one of them glued like it and
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.280
espresso one of them glued like it and
other one goes like this so this one I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
other one goes like this so this one I
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.950
other one goes like this so this one I
can balance very carefully like this one

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
can balance very carefully like this one
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.530
can balance very carefully like this one
at the port where is the other one I

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
at the port where is the other one I
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.620
at the port where is the other one I
have really no chance of balancing and

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630
have really no chance of balancing and
 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.609
have really no chance of balancing and
today I'm stable so you might have the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619
today I'm stable so you might have the
 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890
today I'm stable so you might have the
impression that this one is the stable

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
impression that this one is the stable
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.630
impression that this one is the stable
one and this one is the unstable one

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
one and this one is the unstable one
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.550
one and this one is the unstable one
because this you know bulges out and hug

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
because this you know bulges out and hug
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.920
because this you know bulges out and hug
whatever support it so standing onwards

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
whatever support it so standing onwards
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.400
whatever support it so standing onwards
this is on a skip well let's do the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
this is on a skip well let's do the
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560
this is on a skip well let's do the
dynamic version of the experiment so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
dynamic version of the experiment so
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.990
dynamic version of the experiment so
this is an inclined plane and we'll try

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
this is an inclined plane and we'll try
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.650
this is an inclined plane and we'll try
to let this roll down the slope here we

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
to let this roll down the slope here we
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.369
to let this roll down the slope here we
go and it rolls down and goes all the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
go and it rolls down and goes all the
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.400
go and it rolls down and goes all the
way down very happily next this one

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410
way down very happily next this one
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.010
way down very happily next this one
let's try to make it roll down the slope

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
let's try to make it roll down the slope
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.819
let's try to make it roll down the slope
and when I do that oops it went off the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
and when I do that oops it went off the
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.459
and when I do that oops it went off the
rails however hard I try to Center it it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
rails however hard I try to Center it it
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650
rails however hard I try to Center it it
really doesn't want to go all the way

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
really doesn't want to go all the way
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.290
really doesn't want to go all the way
down it's very very very difficult to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
down it's very very very difficult to
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200
down it's very very very difficult to
have me almost made it but not quite no

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
have me almost made it but not quite no
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.050
have me almost made it but not quite no
it doesn't why is this such a good

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060
it doesn't why is this such a good
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090
it doesn't why is this such a good
roller all the way down and why is this

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
roller all the way down and why is this
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.789
roller all the way down and why is this
such an unstable roller the difference

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
such an unstable roller the difference
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.710
such an unstable roller the difference
is very very interesting and it has to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
is very very interesting and it has to
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.320
is very very interesting and it has to
do with one of the most fundamental if

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330
do with one of the most fundamental if
 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.999
do with one of the most fundamental if
simplest ideas in science and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
simplest ideas in science and
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070
simplest ideas in science and
engineering which really is at the heart

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
engineering which really is at the heart
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200
engineering which really is at the heart
of today's technology called stability

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
of today's technology called stability
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.929
of today's technology called stability
and instability let's first look at this

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
and instability let's first look at this
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.480
and instability let's first look at this
one well I thought I can Center this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
one well I thought I can Center this
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.399
one well I thought I can Center this
thing exactly in the middle well that's

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
thing exactly in the middle well that's
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859
thing exactly in the middle well that's
fine goes straight down low stays on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
fine goes straight down low stays on
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630
fine goes straight down low stays on
there is no problem there that you know

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
there is no problem there that you know
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.499
there is no problem there that you know
in nature

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
in nature
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.539
in nature
you always make mistakes so there is

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
you always make mistakes so there is
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399
you always make mistakes so there is
some error initial error let's say dirty

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
some error initial error let's say dirty
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.819
some error initial error let's say dirty
hazard slightly to the left like this so

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
hazard slightly to the left like this so
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.310
hazard slightly to the left like this so
it's now deviated strategy but in that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
it's now deviated strategy but in that
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319
it's now deviated strategy but in that
case you see this thing is going to be

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
case you see this thing is going to be
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.590
case you see this thing is going to be
supported on the Left rail here and on

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
supported on the Left rail here and on
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139
supported on the Left rail here and on
the right rail here that is on the left

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
the right rail here that is on the left
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.780
the right rail here that is on the left
it's rolling on effectively a wheel that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
it's rolling on effectively a wheel that
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.149
it's rolling on effectively a wheel that
has a large radius on the here it's

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159
has a large radius on the here it's
 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.459
has a large radius on the here it's
effectively rolling on a wheeled as

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
effectively rolling on a wheeled as
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.399
effectively rolling on a wheeled as
small radius so you have a large wheel

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
small radius so you have a large wheel
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230
small radius so you have a large wheel
on this side and small wheel on this

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
on this side and small wheel on this
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.850
on this side and small wheel on this
side and you know what they are going to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
side and you know what they are going to
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.339
side and you know what they are going to
do it's going to start deviating right

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
do it's going to start deviating right
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.870
do it's going to start deviating right
word in other words in

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
word in other words in
 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.000
word in other words in
at the council the initial error to the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
at the council the initial error to the
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.940
at the council the initial error to the
left so this is a restoring mechanism or

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
left so this is a restoring mechanism or
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.800
left so this is a restoring mechanism or
an automatic correction mechanism

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
an automatic correction mechanism
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.630
an automatic correction mechanism
whenever there is a slight deviation to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
whenever there is a slight deviation to
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.100
whenever there is a slight deviation to
the left this system automatically

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
the left this system automatically
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.920
the left this system automatically
corrects itself by going right and if it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930
corrects itself by going right and if it
 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.450
corrects itself by going right and if it
deviates a little bit to the right

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460
deviates a little bit to the right
 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.740
deviates a little bit to the right
it's the same thing the other way around

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
it's the same thing the other way around
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.960
it's the same thing the other way around
is that's automatically going to the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
is that's automatically going to the
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.850
is that's automatically going to the
left so there's an automatic correction

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
left so there's an automatic correction
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.790
left so there's an automatic correction
mechanism that's why it's so stable what

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800
mechanism that's why it's so stable what
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.910
mechanism that's why it's so stable what
kind of big one just prolongs y:real use

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
kind of big one just prolongs y:real use
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.570
kind of big one just prolongs y:real use
and what what what's the physical thing

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580
and what what what's the physical thing
 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.950
and what what what's the physical thing
because if you have a small wheel on

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960
because if you have a small wheel on
 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.360
because if you have a small wheel on
this side and large wheel on this side

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
this side and large wheel on this side
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.340
this side and large wheel on this side
and if they roll both at at the same

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
and if they roll both at at the same
 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.040
and if they roll both at at the same
time you see / same amount of angular

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
time you see / same amount of angular
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560
time you see / same amount of angular
roll this small advance a small distance

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
roll this small advance a small distance
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.420
roll this small advance a small distance
and large one advance a large distance

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
and large one advance a large distance
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.400
and large one advance a large distance
so you see this one goes a little but

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
so you see this one goes a little but
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.740
so you see this one goes a little but
this one goes large so it starts curving

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
this one goes large so it starts curving
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.480
this one goes large so it starts curving
in this direction and if you have a

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490
in this direction and if you have a
 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.860
in this direction and if you have a
small one on this side and large one

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870
small one on this side and large one
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.390
small one on this side and large one
instead it's the other way start curving

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400
instead it's the other way start curving
 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.820
instead it's the other way start curving
on side so whichever side is smaller

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
on side so whichever side is smaller
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.670
on side so whichever side is smaller
that side is the side toward which the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
that side is the side toward which the
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.150
that side is the side toward which the
whole thing starts weeding yeah they're

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
whole thing starts weeding yeah they're
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.500
whole thing starts weeding yeah they're
connected yeah yeah they're connected

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
connected yeah yeah they're connected
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.050
connected yeah yeah they're connected
that's right okay so that's why this

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
that's right okay so that's why this
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.750
that's right okay so that's why this
thing is such a stable roller because

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760
thing is such a stable roller because
 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.970
thing is such a stable roller because
whenever there is an initial error which

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980
whenever there is an initial error which
 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.890
whenever there is an initial error which
is inevitable it automatically is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900
is inevitable it automatically is
 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.720
is inevitable it automatically is
collecting its course so while it's

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730
collecting its course so while it's
 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.000
collecting its course so while it's
wobbling around the center it can safely

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
wobbling around the center it can safely
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.310
wobbling around the center it can safely
go down in contrast this one is a

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320
go down in contrast this one is a
 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.910
go down in contrast this one is a
disaster because again you know if you

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
disaster because again you know if you
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160
disaster because again you know if you
can if you can at all Center it in the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170
can if you can at all Center it in the
 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.050
can if you can at all Center it in the
middle there is no problem if you go

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
middle there is no problem if you go
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210
middle there is no problem if you go
straight down but that's only idealized

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220
straight down but that's only idealized
 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.130
straight down but that's only idealized
scenario in practice there's always some

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140
scenario in practice there's always some
 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.530
scenario in practice there's always some
intro error let's add before assume that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
intro error let's add before assume that
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.780
intro error let's add before assume that
there's a slight error to the left but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
there's a slight error to the left but
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.510
there's a slight error to the left but
then you see the left part of this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520
then you see the left part of this
 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.180
then you see the left part of this
object is supported here on this rail so

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190
object is supported here on this rail so
 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.820
object is supported here on this rail so
it's rolling on a small wheel whereas

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830
it's rolling on a small wheel whereas
 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.070
it's rolling on a small wheel whereas
the right part is supported here which

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080
the right part is supported here which
 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.710
the right part is supported here which
is rolling on a large wheel so whenever

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
is rolling on a large wheel so whenever
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.290
is rolling on a large wheel so whenever
it's deviating slightly to the left you

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300
it's deviating slightly to the left you
 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.180
it's deviating slightly to the left you
have a small wheel on the Western

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190
have a small wheel on the Western
 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.470
have a small wheel on the Western
knowledge widow on the right and you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
knowledge widow on the right and you
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.360
knowledge widow on the right and you
know what those wheels will do they'll

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
know what those wheels will do they'll
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.750
know what those wheels will do they'll
start moving towards that so if there's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760
start moving towards that so if there's
 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.420
start moving towards that so if there's
a an initial left error there will be a

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430
a an initial left error there will be a
 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.100
a an initial left error there will be a
tendency to start going even further

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110
tendency to start going even further
 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.700
tendency to start going even further
left

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710
left
 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.890
left
so the error grows and grows and goes

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900
so the error grows and grows and goes
 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.900
so the error grows and grows and goes
out of control and eventually of course

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910
out of control and eventually of course
 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.900
out of control and eventually of course
the whole thing moves off the rails so

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910
the whole thing moves off the rails so
 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.470
the whole thing moves off the rails so
there is a mechanism which is opposite

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480
there is a mechanism which is opposite
 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.210
there is a mechanism which is opposite
what we had before that is whenever

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220
what we had before that is whenever
 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.070
what we had before that is whenever
there is a small initial error which is

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080
there is a small initial error which is
 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.450
there is a small initial error which is
inevitable there is some mechanism

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
inevitable there is some mechanism
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.400
inevitable there is some mechanism
devilish mechanism that makes the error

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410
devilish mechanism that makes the error
 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.200
devilish mechanism that makes the error
grow and grow and that is called an

instability and in general in abstract

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210
instability and in general in abstract
 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.270

collection mechanism that system is
stable and if the error tends to grow

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010
stable and if the error tends to grow
 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.680
stable and if the error tends to grow
and goes out of control

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690
and goes out of control
 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.570
and goes out of control
that's unstable mechanism and that is

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580
that's unstable mechanism and that is
 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.110
that's unstable mechanism and that is
why this can hardly go down this earth

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120
why this can hardly go down this earth
 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.720
why this can hardly go down this earth
whereas this is very very stable I think

if you wants to round the corner and it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510
if you wants to round the corner and it
 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.960
if you wants to round the corner and it
has a wheel let's say on this side and

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970
has a wheel let's say on this side and
 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.190
has a wheel let's say on this side and
the other way one side and they're

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200
the other way one side and they're
 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.590
the other way one side and they're
connected as it goes round the corner

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600
connected as it goes round the corner
 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.510

the distance that this outer wheel has

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520
the distance that this outer wheel has
 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.850
the distance that this outer wheel has
to travel is actually longer than the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860
to travel is actually longer than the
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.710
to travel is actually longer than the
distance that this inner will have to

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720
distance that this inner will have to
 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.450
distance that this inner will have to
travel so there's a problem because they

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
travel so there's a problem because they
 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520
travel so there's a problem because they
are rotating at the same rate one of

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530
are rotating at the same rate one of
 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.770
are rotating at the same rate one of
them are skid and that's a very bad bus

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780
them are skid and that's a very bad bus
 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.630
them are skid and that's a very bad bus
station so they cannot both role because

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640
station so they cannot both role because
 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.730
station so they cannot both role because
distance is they are different so how do

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740
distance is they are different so how do
 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.550
distance is they are different so how do
you correct for this this effect as long

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560
you correct for this this effect as long

you correct for this this effect as long
as the wheels are connected it seems to

as the wheels are connected it seems to
 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.300
as the wheels are connected it seems to
be completely uncomfortable as

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310

difficulty but there is a really nice

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320
difficulty but there is a really nice
 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.220
difficulty but there is a really nice
mechanism here is what you should do

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230
mechanism here is what you should do
 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.230
mechanism here is what you should do
effectively you should put this kind of

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240
effectively you should put this kind of
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.410
effectively you should put this kind of
design on the tail rails you see so when

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420
design on the tail rails you see so when
 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.470
design on the tail rails you see so when
it wants to go around the corner the

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480
it wants to go around the corner the
 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.780
it wants to go around the corner the
centrifugal force makes this go slightly

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790
centrifugal force makes this go slightly
 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.090
centrifugal force makes this go slightly
outside but that's very good news

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100
outside but that's very good news
 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.280
outside but that's very good news
because as long as it's owned outside

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290
because as long as it's owned outside
 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.100
because as long as it's owned outside
that part of the wheel becomes effective

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110
that part of the wheel becomes effective
 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.840
that part of the wheel becomes effective
larger and this part is actually smaller

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850
larger and this part is actually smaller
 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.690
larger and this part is actually smaller
so the distances that they travel are

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700
so the distances that they travel are
 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.820
so the distances that they travel are
automatically adjusted and indeed outer

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
automatically adjusted and indeed outer
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.400
automatically adjusted and indeed outer
wheel does travel longer distance and

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410
wheel does travel longer distance and
 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.140
wheel does travel longer distance and
you know a shorter distance and because

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150
you know a shorter distance and because
 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.140
you know a shorter distance and because
the wheel radii are different and of

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150
the wheel radii are different and of
 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.390
the wheel radii are different and of
course in a real train wheel it doesn't

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
course in a real train wheel it doesn't
 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.040
course in a real train wheel it doesn't
look like that but actually the design

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050
look like that but actually the design
 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.910
look like that but actually the design
kind of look like this in cross-section

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920
kind of look like this in cross-section
 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.470
kind of look like this in cross-section
this is sitting on the rail like this

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480
this is sitting on the rail like this
 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.030
this is sitting on the rail like this

effecting wheel size varies and that

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800
effecting wheel size varies and that
 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.160

automatically adjusts for the stable

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170
automatically adjusts for the stable

rounding of corner it's really a

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940
rounding of corner it's really a
 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.850
rounding of corner it's really a
wonderful thing and by the way if you

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860
wonderful thing and by the way if you
 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.400
wonderful thing and by the way if you
designed the wheels in this fashion that

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410
designed the wheels in this fashion that
 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.500
designed the wheels in this fashion that
would be really a disaster train that is

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:49.510
would be really a disaster train that is
 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.260
would be really a disaster train that is
