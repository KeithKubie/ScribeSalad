00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.367
Matteas: My name's Drov Matteas

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:07.467
from Disney/ABC
Television Group.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:12.067
We were approached
by Google O3D team

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:15.000
to...

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.133
to develop kind of
an interactive 3-D experience

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.367
in the browser.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.501
We also have
a developer initiative

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:25.367
where we're aiming
to expose certain metadata

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:27.734
from our company
to empower developers

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:29.434
to create experiences
around our content.

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.300
And it seemed
like a perfect fit

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.634
of new technology,
and our APIs

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:35.334
kind of develop
an exciting application

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.634
that fits right in the middle
between that, so...

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:40.367
man: So can you talk a little
bit more about

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.267
how you came to the technical
decision to use--

00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:45.234
working it and integrating it
into your application?

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:48.934
Matteas: Um, yeah, I mean,

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.467
the ideation
of the application came

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:52.901
from kind of the inspiration

00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.200
of O3D and doing
hardware-accelerated graphics

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.701
in the browser.

00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.300
I mean, previous, we would
consider doing the application

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.400
in Flash, but when we saw
the demos of the performance

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.701
of O3D running in the browser,

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.968
we thought it was cool
and just wanted to--

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.434
kind of experimented.

00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:13.300
I mean, my team, we're all kind
of fun tech guys ourselves

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.901
and wanted to kind of experiment
ourselves,

00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:17.467
so it was kind of a cool thing
to do.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:20.801
We needed, you know,
we needed something fun

00:01:20.801 --> 00:01:23.434
to kind of showcase
our developer initiatives,

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:26.067
so it just worked out.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.734
man: So, as developers,

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:30.534
we really value people
who are able to share

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:33.133
war stories and lessons
from a technical counter,

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.767
especially as O3D is
kind of new.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.534
It'd be great to get feedback,
and if you could tell everyone

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:43.767
what you think one particularly
difficult period of development

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:45.167
was that you faced

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.801
and how you approach
the technical counter.

00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:53.734
Matteas: Um, yeah, so the most
difficulty for our team

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:58.067
was we have no previous
experience with anything 3D.

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:01.234
But what we do have is a lot
of experience with JavaScript.

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:04.167
So probably for us
was the initial learning curve

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:07.601
of how to create the models
and animate them

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.300
in 3D.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.434
But it was actually fairly--
I mean, the whole application

00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:12.968
was built in four to five weeks,

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:16.067
so it was fairly kind of rabid
to get to a perfect stage

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:17.400
where we could start
playing around

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.767
and using kind of the demos

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:20.868
that Google provided.

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:24.734
You know, it really,
really helped us out.

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:25.801
man: Great.

00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:26.801
Matteas: Yeah.

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:28.767
man: And, so I mean,
how long does--

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:30.868
what do you see
as the next steps

00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:33.067
for your application?

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:37.400
Matteas: I'd love--I mean,
as we add more functionality

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.300
to our API, I mean,
I would just love to add that--

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.000
I mean, to basically add that
to the front end as well.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.567
You know, I think, through
the process of this project,

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.067
we found
a really interesting way

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:51.767
to use 3-D to navigate
through video content

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:54.033
and through imagery
of our video content.

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.901
So it's kind of the first steps,
at least internally,

00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.901
for how we can create
a new interface

00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:04.634
for our video content
using 3-D.

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.601
I mean, prior to this, our
websites have been very static.

00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.133
Or maybe dynamic
in a 2D fashion,

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:13.634
but adding kind
of the third dimension allows us

00:03:13.634 --> 00:03:16.400
to provide more information
intuitively to the user.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.033
So I'd like to--I mean,
over the case of the summer,

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:21.067
really kind of
blow out the functionality

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.100
of this application
and maybe apply it

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.434
to more of a mainstream user
base than just the developers

00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:29.033
on our site.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:35.634
man: So given what you've
learned, working with O3D,

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:40.968
um, maybe getting some
of the feedback [indistinct]

00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:43.133
is there anything that
you're going to change

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:44.467
based on the feedback?

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.567
Matteas: So, based
on the feedback

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:48.968
we got from the developers

00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:51.100
in Sandbox, if there's anything
we would--

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.934
man: Based on the experience
of things

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:56.467
that you might do differently
for any visualizations--

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:59.534
Matteas: With application,
or with O3D--

00:03:59.534 --> 00:04:00.868
Just in general, I guess.

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:03.234
man: Yeah, just in general.

00:04:03.234 --> 00:04:06.000
Matteas: Yeah, I mean, we had
a lot of feedback.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.534
I mean, in regards
to O3D,

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:10.300
most of the feedback was
how fast we got to the point

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.501
we got to, and, you know,

00:04:12.501 --> 00:04:15.400
although we didn't have
that prior 3D experience,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.367
it was actually kind of fun
to get to the point

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.267
where we are
in a very short period of time.

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:21.801
Most of the feedback
we got

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:25.067
in regards to our application
was around larger amounts

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:26.300
of data being presented.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.300
Right now, our application shows
a limited set

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.000
of maybe eight or ten results.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.167
So really kind of the problem
that we're gonna now go back to

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:37.133
is how do we expand that
to--I don't know--

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.767
maybe hundreds of results,
right,

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:40.167
which we potentially have
in our database,

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:41.901
so it'd be interesting
to kind of play

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:43.767
with that interaction model.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:44.767
Yeah.

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:46.167
Cool.

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.200
man: What's the most interesting
comment--or feedback--

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.801
that you've gotten?

00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.868
Matteas: Probably somebody--

00:04:52.868 --> 00:04:55.033
some of the visual search
techniques we're doing

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.133
with the video, people are,
"Does ABC really know

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.467
that you're doing that?"

00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:00.300
You know, a lot of people
can't believe that,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.767
as ABC traditionally being so
protective of their content,

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:06.334
that we're embracing developers
as we are.

00:05:06.334 --> 00:05:07.834
Or at least attempting to,
at least, now.

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:09.434
So that was kind of funny.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:13.334
But it's very exciting to see
kind of developers--

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:15.400
you can see them kind of come up
with their ideas

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.901
and really look forward
to working with stuff

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:19.200
that we're doing, so...

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.801
It's cool.
man: That sounds really great.

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:21.868
Matteas: Yeah.
man: Great.

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:22.801
Matteas: All right.
