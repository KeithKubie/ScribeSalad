00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.120
The Ten Commandments maintain an extraordinary hold on our imaginations
even though many of them can sound – in

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.800
the context of our own times – really rather
peculiar, with injunctions not to

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.340
covet a neighbour’s livestock or to make sure one doesn't carve images
of god-like figures in the rocks.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.100
The Commandments
were responses to the specific needs of a small nomadic

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.679
community, wandering the Sinai peninsula with
goats and sheep around

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.810
1,200 BC. Our needs have, predictably,
 changed a bit since then.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.260
But a place for rules remains: because we're still

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.500
horribly prone to violence, cruelty and self-righteousness
and need regularly to be reminded of how to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.530
live peacefully and well with ourselves and
our neighbours.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.760
What would it be like to try to update the commandments for our own times?

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.620
Here is a go...

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.460
The good person is at all times

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.339
highly aware of their flaws and committed
to becoming a better version of themselves.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.629
They are not insulted if people point out
their need for evolution, even when they do this rather clumsily.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:09.409
A good person believes in ongoing need for moral and phsycological education..

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.620
The good person knows that everyone is deeply damaged and a little
mad, starting with (of course) themselves.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.960
They are unfrightened by their own strangeness
and are committed to informing those around

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.890
them of it in very good time, and apologising
retrospectively when they have failed to do so.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.579
They understand that part of their duty is
to have a ready answer to the legitimate question,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.820
‘And how are you crazy?’

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980
The good person
is loyal in relationships not because they

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.880
think their lover is perfect, but because
they know that everyone is pretty imperfect

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.789
and rather hard to live with at close range.
They accept that the only people we can ever

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.729
think of as normal or easy are people we don’t
yet know very well.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.260
The good person knows that it is impossible to be wholly understood
by anyone and accepts that things are going

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.430
well if one is very lonely in around only
half of the key areas of one’s life.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.870
The good person tries hard never to assume
that other people should know what they are

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:26.180
thinking of or want without them having told them very clearly and kindly. They
try to resist sulking (behaviour that stems

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.810
from an incensed belief that others should
know why we are upset without us having  told them)

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.790
and are committed to teaching others
about the contents of their minds.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.209
The good person looks at people who are behaving
badly as if they might be small children;

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.030
that is with patience, charity and an active
search for mitigating circumstances. Though

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.129
our societies stress the insult of being treated
as younger than one is, the good person knows

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.370
it is the greatest privilege for anyone to
look beyond the apparently strong yet nasty

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.310
adult to the worried, anxious and probably really rather
nice child within.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.959
Confronted with a piece of stupidity or evil which they could never
be guilty of, the good person doesn’t fall

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.690
into self-righteousness. They swiftly remember
all the many stupid and evil things they have

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.909
at other points, over different things, been
guilty of. They don’t lose sight of how

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.029
much they overall stand in need of the charity
and forgiveness of others.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.700
The good person is committed to searching for the funny side
of people who might appear merely desperately

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.280
irritating. They look at others like characters
in a comedy rather than a tragedy. They know

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.630
that the greatest achievement is to be able
to move from seeing someone as an ‘idiot’

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.770
to considering them as that most privileged
of beings: a ‘loveable idiot.’

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.370
The good person is a firm believer in restraint
and in not immediately saying certain things

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.140
that are on their minds. They hold that being
fully oneself entails a level

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.680
of melodrama and rage that one should spare
any human one cares about.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.800
The good person knows that the best protection against impatience
and paranoia is a little gently-worn pessimism.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.610
They budget for disappointment far ahead of
time. They don’t cry constantly only because

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.571
they have understood that the whole of existence
is – in many ways – worthy of tears. Their

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:36.820
constant awareness of the possibility of death
and catastrophe makes them especially appreciative

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.780
of small things that happen to go well. They
relish flowers, balmy skies and so-called

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.980
‘boring days’ when everyone manages to
go to bed relatively content and at peace.
