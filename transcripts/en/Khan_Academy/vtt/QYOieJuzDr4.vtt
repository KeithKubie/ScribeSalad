00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:01.789
- [Voiceover] Jacques took a submarine

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:02.833
to the bottom of the ocean

00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:05.202
and discovered an underwater city.

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:07.779
The starfish ruled the city.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.358
This is fascinating.

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:12.632
There were 59 seahorses there,

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:15.812
which was 28 fewer than

00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:17.559
the number of starfish.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.763
28 fewer than the number--

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.365
I already used that color.

00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:25.644
Than the number

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:27.734
of starfish.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:32.213
How many starfish, how
many starfish were there?

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:34.560
So let's think about this
second sentence, here.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.230
So, number of seahorses is 28 fewer

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.483
than the number of starfish.

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:42.552
So we could write, we could write,

00:00:42.552 --> 00:00:45.417
number of seahorses,

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.525
seahorses, is 28 fewer than
the number of starfish.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:51.812
So that means that this is going

00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:54.457
to be equal to then number of starfish.

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:56.849
Number of starfish,

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:01.401
starfish minus 28.

00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.722
28 fewer than the number of starfish.

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:06.531
So, let me write that in blue.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.041
So, if I have the number of starfish,

00:01:09.041 --> 00:01:11.686
and I go 28 fewer than that,

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.263
that's going to be the
number of seahorses.

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:14.025
That's what they tell us.

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:14.950
The number of seahorses.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.645
"There were 59 seahorses there,

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.500
"which was 28 fewer than
the number of starfish."

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:20.639
And, they actually tell us what the number

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:21.378
of seahorses is.

00:01:21.378 --> 00:01:23.838
It's 59, so we could write this as--

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.694
We could write this as, 59

00:01:27.694 --> 00:01:30.339
is equal to the number of starfish.

00:01:31.154 --> 00:01:33.545
Number, actually maybe I'll just draw--

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:36.005
well I'll write it out, starfish.

00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:39.464
The number of starfish minus 28.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.483
Minus 28.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.621
Or, another way to think about it is

00:01:44.621 --> 00:01:48.289
there's 28 more starfish than seahorses.

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.402
So we could rewrite this as saying,

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:53.047
well whatever the number of seahorses are,

00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:54.555
whatever the number of seahorses are,

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.155
they tell us, there's 59 seahorses.

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:59.296
There's going to be 28 more.

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:02.268
There's going to be 28 more starfish.

00:02:02.268 --> 00:02:03.963
Whenever you do a problem like this,

00:02:03.963 --> 00:02:06.308
it's always a good idea
just to do a check.

00:02:06.308 --> 00:02:07.423
Just to say, "Okay, are
there going to be more

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:09.696
"starfish or more seahorses?"

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.647
And when you look at the
information they give us,

00:02:12.647 --> 00:02:14.505
they say they there are 59 seahorses

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:17.335
which was 28 fewer than
the number of starfish.

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:19.381
So, if there are fewer
seahorses than starfish,

00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.586
that tells you there's
going to be more starfish.

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:22.326
So it makes sense.

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:23.951
If you want to go from the seahorses,

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:25.808
the number of seahorses
to the number of starfish,

00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:27.828
you would add 28 because there is more

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.218
starfish than seahorses.

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.497
So now we just have to figure out

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:34.560
what 59 plus 28 is, so let's do that.

00:02:35.212 --> 00:02:39.089
So, 59 is five 10s, and nine, ones.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.399
28, let's write the two
10s in the 10s place,

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.535
and the eight ones, in the one's place.

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:46.298
We're adding.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:47.414
We're going to go from the number

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:49.364
of seahorses add 28 more than that

00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:51.244
to get to the number of starfish.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.800
So let's first go to the one's place.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.815
Nine ones, plus eight ones is 17 ones.

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:00.383
Write the seven ones, and one 10,

00:03:00.383 --> 00:03:02.047
or you could think of
it as I carried the one.

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:05.108
But all I did was I
wrote the one 10 in 17,

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:06.966
I wrote that in the ten's place.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:09.125
And now I could add one 10, plus five 10,

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.492
plus two 10s. So let's see.

00:03:10.492 --> 00:03:12.697
One, plus five, plus two is eight.

00:03:12.697 --> 00:03:14.228
Eight tens.

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:18.477
So the number of starfish is 87.

00:03:18.502 --> 00:03:20.012
And you should always
see if that makes sense.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:22.194
The number of starfish is,

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:24.539
this right over here, is 87.

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.118
So, if there are 59 seahorses,

00:03:26.118 --> 00:03:29.019
is that 28 fewer than 87?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.879
Sure, it is.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.528
It's exactly 28 fewer.

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:35.357
Like, that's what we used
to solve this question.
