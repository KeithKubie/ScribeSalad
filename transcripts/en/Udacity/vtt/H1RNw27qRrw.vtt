00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the interesting finding.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Because type As are so much more popular,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
your chances of linking to a type A is 0.8.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To see, let's take the extreme view.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Suppose type Bs had 0 friends.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then you'd never link to a type B.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You link to type A and to type B in a proportion of 80 to 20.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Type B would be 0.2.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That means most of your friends you link to are type A.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
They're the type of people that happen to be popular.
