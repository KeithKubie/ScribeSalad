00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.002
People are selecting
specific fire arms,

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.738
specific ammunition,
going out into the forest

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:08.841
looking just to kill
this gorgeous animal.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.978
It's not just a simple
cops and robbers model.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:15.247 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's not as easy as you
know, good guys, bad guys.

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:19.419
We need to be able to put law
and order into the equation.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.923 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is where I started
in Conkouati-Douli

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.625
in a park in Southern
Republic of Congo.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.794
This elephant is one
guy that we would see

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.796
relatively frequently
and as you can see

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.433
he's got enormous tusks.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.235 align:start size:94% position:6%
In over three years nobody
has seen this elephant.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.937
It's a national park.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.471
It's got boundaries.

00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.607 line:0%
But criminals don't care at all

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.876 line:0%
about where you drew
those lines on a map.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:46.178
Criminals have much
more complex networks

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.015
and their logistics go
as far as they need to.

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.350
We're not talking
about a guy hunting

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.818
to feed his family.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.487
Wildlife trafficking is
not subsistence hunting.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:56.588 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're talking about addressing
the industrial scale

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:58.190
problem that we're dealing with.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.825
Leopard skin's a very tough one,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.627
because we're trying to
catch the traffickers

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.662 align:start size:88% position:13%
but at the same time,
we know that the hunting

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.898 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the forest is
often opportunistic,

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.900 align:start size:88% position:13%
so hitting the
traffickers and getting

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.668
that message back
to the poachers

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.470
so that the trigger isn't
pulled in the first place

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.008
or the snare isn't laid in
the first place is very hard.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:17.844 align:start size:97% position:3%
That is not the case of
course, when it comes to ivory

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:20.546 align:start size:94% position:6%
where people are selecting
specific firearms,

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:23.115 align:start size:94% position:6%
specific ammunition,
going out into the forest

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.852
looking just to kill
this gorgeous animal.

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:30.256
We're seeing some giant
seizures over in Asia.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:33.293
From central Africa it's
coming from Congo, Gabon,

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.693
right smack in the
middle where we have

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.629
the best elephant populations.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.698
You get hundreds
of kilos of ivory

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.434 align:start size:88% position:13%
going out all the
time, accumulating into

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.403 align:start size:94% position:6%
thousands of kilos
inside of big port cities

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:46.706
like in Lome in Togo.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:50.576 align:start size:97% position:3%
Please notice that the
ammunition was an AK47 clip.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:51.543
I don't know if you want to call

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:52.978
that a leftover from conflict

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:55.915
or just an excuse
for a big problem

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.217 align:start size:94% position:6%
that we need to talk
about which is corruption.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.453 align:start size:97% position:3%
You have people in
militaries or police forces

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.922 align:start size:97% position:3%
providing ammunition to
poachers using their authority

00:02:03.922 --> 00:02:05.524
as a cover so that they can go

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:08.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
and make a lot of
money off this stuff.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.495
So who are these guys?

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.097
Everybody has this basic notion,

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:13.332
we have the poachers, they
give it to a trafficker,

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.200
the trafficker gives
it to a middle man,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.435
he goes to bigger traffickers,

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:18.438
down the line to your kingpin.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.372 align:start size:88% position:13%
And so from a law
enforcement perspective,

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:22.208
you'd think alright it's
easy, we're gonna intercept

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.111 align:start size:97% position:3%
these guys with anti-poaching
on the poachers,

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.646 align:start size:81% position:19%
some police forces
along the way,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.915
and we'll work it out.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:30.283
Gets a little bit
more complicated

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:31.917
when maybe someone
in your police force

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.286
is part of your network.

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:34.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I could add a
lot of other bubbles

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.556
and make this far
more complicated

00:02:36.556 --> 00:02:38.757
when you look at who's
providing the ammunition,

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.259
who's getting them out of jail,

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.027
who is making it so
that even if they

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:43.962
get that strong prison sentence,

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:45.331
that they can still slip away

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.500
or get a fake medical
slip or something.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.435 align:start size:94% position:6%
We have seen every
permutation of corruption

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.670
that you can imagine.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.105 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is an operation
which we did

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.639 align:start size:94% position:6%
with the National Central
Bureau of Interpol

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.675
in Conakry where over
$30,000 was seized

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:59.078
and over 800 pieces of ivory.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:03.349 align:start size:84% position:16%
This fellow is an
[bleep] that I really

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.018
want to put in jail.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:07.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
I have put him in
jail a couple of times

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.822
and he's still doing that.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.790
He's smiling there but
he's not smiling here

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.426
when we're trying to arrest him.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.294
This is a failure of ours.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.596
We failed with this guy.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:18.097
He is too powerful.

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.432 align:start size:97% position:3%
We have been trying everything
to get him arrested.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:21.701 size:88% position:44%
His name is Ikama.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.103
Our dogs have come in
and scanned the place,

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:26.973
found hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of pieces of ivory.

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.542
But this fellow got out
of jail because his son

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:32.478
is an ex-rebel leader, an
ex-member of parliament

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he's using every
bit of political

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.249
weight that he can get
to traffic his influence

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.418 align:start size:88% position:13%
across the Congo to make
sure that his father

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:40.953
doesn't go to jail,
even though is father

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.222
is one of the biggest
ivory dealers in Congo.

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.391
At the same time
he has the audacity

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.159 align:start size:94% position:6%
to go to the police
station a few weeks later

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.928
and figure out how to
get his ivory back.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:50.096
So these are the
types of problems

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.498 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we have to
figure out, is babysit

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start size:84% position:16%
these cases every
single step of the way

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.603 align:start size:97% position:3%
to make sure that he
doesn't get his ivory back.

00:03:57.603 --> 00:03:58.838
Here's a success.

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:02.274 align:start size:84% position:16%
126 kilos of ivory
seized in Brazzaville.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.109 align:start size:84% position:16%
A big trafficker,
he's got a connection

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.711
to Cameroon and into Nigeria,

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.580
he was probably going
to go on to go to Togo

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.847
and all of that stuff.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.582 align:start size:84% position:16%
We get the dogs in,
they search the place,

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.652
the guy gets two years in jail.

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.687
The dogs do lovely
stuff on their own.

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:16.555 align:start size:84% position:16%
We took them into
forestry concessions,

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.357 align:start size:88% position:13%
you can't hide anything
from these dogs.

00:04:18.357 --> 00:04:20.126
And that enables us to
prove that these camps

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.461
were not actually working
for logging concessions

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:26.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
or just doing their job,
and lit them on fire.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.101 align:start size:84% position:16%
Obviously I like
playing with the dogs.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:31.403
It's amazing to have live
animals around in our work.

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:33.438
That's the US ambassador
as well who's shaking hands

00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:35.808 align:start size:88% position:13%
with Shon, and that's
really important for us.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.277 align:start size:97% position:3%
We need political
leverage, we need that kind

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:41.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
of political weight, and
that's kind of the take home

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.216
message here is that with
all of this complicated

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:48.087 align:start size:97% position:3%
reality of how illegal
wildlife trafficking networks

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:51.790 align:start size:94% position:6%
function, we have to
accept that it's not just

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.126
this simple, cops
and robbers model.

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:57.163 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's not as easy as you
know, good guys, bad guys.

00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:59.932
It's really complex, we need
a lot of political pressure

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.767
to make sure that
we're actually able

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:03.135
to put these guys behind bars

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:05.871
and neutralize them for
as long as possible.

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:10.175
We need to be able to put law
and order into the equation.

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:12.211
So spread the word
about that please

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.013
and let's not make
it a simple thing.

00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:16.983
Let's address this problem
with the reality that it is.

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.651
Thank you very much.
