00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.180
So we've put the equation of
a line into point-slope form.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.770
So we have as y minus y one
equals m times x minus x one.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.785
I can actually go from this point-slope
version of the equation of the line,

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:16.440
to a more familiar and
easier to read slope-intercept version.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220
And I'm going to do that by
multiplying out this side and

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.180
getting Y by itself on the left side.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.383
So the first thing I'm going to do is
distribute this two-thirds, which gives

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:30.245
me two-thirds x minus two-thirds times
nine, and that is nine over one.

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:32.119
Actually let me erase nine and

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.505
write it as three times three
because then I can simplify here.

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:38.175
Okay, let's continue.

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.030
Now I have y minus eight equals
two-thirds x minus well,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.094
two times three over one,
so just minus six.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:49.100
I can now add eight to both sides and
what do you know?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.650
I have my equation in
slope-intercept form, and in fact,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.290
maybe you can now tell me,
what is the y-intercept of this line?
