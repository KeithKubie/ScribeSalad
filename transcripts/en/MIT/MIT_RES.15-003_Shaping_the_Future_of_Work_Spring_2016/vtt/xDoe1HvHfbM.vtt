00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.520
The way we have talked about
the rise of the social contract

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.710
following the Second
World War might

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.590
make it seem a little
bit more utopian

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.260
than was actually the case.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.650
Wages did rise in tandem
with productivity,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.200
and this meant a high standard
of living for many Americans.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.250
There was also less
emphasis on shareholders

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.140
and immediate
short term returns.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.700
There was also high
levels of job stability.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.960
People often came into a company
without very much experience

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.030
at all and expected
to work their way up

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.880
through promotions over time.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.410
But there we're also downsides
to employment over this period.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.700
The trade off of job
security, of having

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.980
a stable career with a
predictable career trajectory

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.230
was often the risk of
boredom and monotonous work.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.320
Corporations, in
the 1950s, were very

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.950
hierarchical and conformist.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.080
Intellectual diversity and
creativity were discouraged.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.720
These corporations,
of course, we're

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.530
also dominated by white men.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.290
There wasn't very
much diversity,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.640
and there were very
sizable gaps in pay

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.440
based on gender and race.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.230
So while we can learn
a lot from this period,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.570
it's not exactly a golden age
to which we should return.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.590
We've made a lot of progress
since this period as well.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.250
There's more diversity in the
workforce than ever before.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.640
And pay gaps between
demographic groups,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.560
though they still exist,
are becoming smaller.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.340
With the rise of the
knowledge economy moreover--

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.910
an economy that encourages ideas
and creativity and innovation--

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.680
workers are being given
more discretion in how

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.580
they go about their work and
even the types of projects

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.590
on which they work.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.820
Some organizations
are even trying

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.660
to make themselves look and feel
as non-corporate-y as possible

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.860
as a way to attract
and retain talent,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.300
and there's evidence
that this can

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.040
be good for the bottom line.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.230
In addition, due in
large part to advances

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.700
in information
technology, new technology

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.870
mediated work arrangements
are becoming more popular

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.340
and facilitating various
forms of freelance work.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.200
Freelancing is
not new of course.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.760
The word actually dates
back to medieval times

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.430
where one could be a
freelance mercenary for hire.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.850
Various new websites
and applications

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.200
are springing up
throughout the economy that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.150
connect people--
buyers and sellers--

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.030
in unique and innovative ways.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300
So for software,
for example, there's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.420
companies like
freelancer.com where

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.610
someone can go on and post a
project, for example, solicit

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.800
help coding a new
website, and people

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.160
will bid on those projects.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.070
I actually used one of these
sites not for a website per se,

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.800
but to help me learn a new
coding language called Python.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.910
I went on the site.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.440
I posted my project.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.490
And I found an undergraduate
student based in California--

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.610
a very bright young man--
who stayed up with me

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.760
into the early hours of
the morning helping me

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.380
learn how to code.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.700
And there are plenty of other
examples of technology mediated

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.220
work--

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.910
Mechanical Turk,
for example, where

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.360
buyers can pay people to do
basic, often routine tasks

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.730
like taking surveys.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.430
Taskrabbit.com, where people
can find people to do basic life

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.330
chores for them.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.540
And care.com, where
people can locate,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.210
for example, house and pet
sitters for when they are away.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.290
These alternative
modes of employment

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.350
have distinct advantages
in terms of flexibility

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.700
and individual expression.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.340
People don't
typically have a boss

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.430
looking over their shoulder, at
least not in a physical sense.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.170
They have flexibility
to work different hours,

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.230
often from various locations,
including their own home.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.540
But there are common
reoccurring disadvantages

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.190
to these modes of work as well.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.940
There are high levels of
uncertainty and insecurity.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.730
You don't know whether
you'll have work

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.170
from one month to the next.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.114
You don't know who
your next boss will be,

00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:52.280
whether they'll be fair and
ethical, whether they'll

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.227
pay in a timely way.

00:03:54.227 --> 00:03:55.810
If you have an issue
with an employer,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.720
for example, withholding
promised pay,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.610
it's often difficult to
resolve these issues.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.490
There's broad, often
global competition,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.060
which could put downward
pressure on wages.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.360
So for example, when
I hired this coder

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.120
to help me with this
freelancing project,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.922
he was competing against people
located in China and India.

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:16.380
There are other
trade offs as well.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.380
There's isolation, a lack
of pension and retirement,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.060
lack of paid vacation
and time off,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.430
the need for continuous
learning that can accommodate

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.360
the diverse and changing
needs of employers,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.700
and needing to finance
the education out

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.790
of your own pocket.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.090
In addition, many
of these employees

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.870
lack the protections
that are traditionally

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.330
afforded to workers under more
stable employment contracts.
