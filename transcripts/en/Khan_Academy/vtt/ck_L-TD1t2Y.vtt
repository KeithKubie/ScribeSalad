00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.320
and today I'm learning more

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.930
about the First Amendment
to the US Constitution.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.810
The First Amendment is one of
the most important amendments

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.515
to the Constitution, if
not the most important.

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:15.829
It reads, "Congress shall
make no law respecting

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.557
"an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:22.641
"exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech,

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.087
"or of the press; or the
right of the people peaceably

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:28.267
"to assemble, and to
petition the Government

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.490
"for a redress of grievances."

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.310
To learn more about the First Amendment,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.850
I talked to two experts.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.555
Erwin Chemerinsky is the Jesse H. Choper

00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:40.037
distinguished professor of
law and dean of Berkeley Law.

00:00:40.037 --> 00:00:42.570
Michael McConnell is the Director

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.541
of the Constitutional Law
Center at Stanford Law School,

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.680
and a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.350
Professor Chemerinsky,
there is a lot going on

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.308
in the First Amendment.

00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:54.099
Can you tell us a little bit more about

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.081
why the framers chose to protect
these rights in particular?

00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.125
- [Erwin] The historical background

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:03.731
of the First Amendment of
the Constitution shows why

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.390
the framers wanted to be sure
that all of the liberties

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.760
in the First Amendment were safeguarded.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.886
Let's focus on freedom of
speech and freedom of the press.

00:01:12.886 --> 00:01:16.555
In England, there was, after
the printing press developed,

00:01:16.555 --> 00:01:20.709
licensing so that anyone who
wanted to be able to publish

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.780
anything needed to have a
license from the government.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.139
As such, licensing was
seen to be inconsistent

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:29.993
with freedom of speech,
freedom of the press;

00:01:29.993 --> 00:01:33.390
for that matter, freedom of
thought, freedom of inquiry.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740
- [Kim] Interesting, okay, so
there are a lot of essential

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.228
freedoms that are packed
into this First Amendment,

00:01:40.228 --> 00:01:43.484
so much that it's almost
amazing that we're gonna attempt

00:01:43.484 --> 00:01:45.911
to talk about them all in one video.

00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.686
But if we dial in to freedom of speech,

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:51.995
Professor McConell, what
is freedom of speech?

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:55.518
Does that encompass some
things and not others?

00:01:55.518 --> 00:01:58.040
- [Michael] Well freedom
of speech was actually

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.288
less important to the framers
than the freedom with which

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.860
it was coupled, which was
the freedom of the press.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.410
The reason for this is
that speech that can reach

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.900
large audiences is much more
important to the individual

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.610
but also dangerous to the
state, than mere speech.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.420
When you speak, only those
people within hearing range

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.690
can hear you, but when you are able to use

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.040
Gutenberg's fantastic new technology

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.310
to publish your sentiments
and distribute them widely,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.856
maybe even over the entire
country or across the Atlantic,

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.840
reaching hundreds of thousands of people.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.543
Now that is powerful.

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:46.542
You think about how the
American Revolution was won.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.988
This required spreading the word,

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:51.150
it required gaining converts

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.240
and telling people what
their grievances were.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.138
To a very great extent this was done

00:02:56.138 --> 00:02:59.650
through the mechanism
of the printing press.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.657
- [Erwin] When you ask the question,

00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:01.877
"What's freedom of speech?"

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:04.550
there's implicit within it the issue of,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.160
'What do we mean by speech?'

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.530
Ultimately, the answer
to your question is that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.412
the First Amendment, in protecting speech,

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:15.746
broadly safeguards a right
to express one's ideas.

00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:18.110
But it's not absolute.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.500
The government can restrict expression

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.870
if there's a compelling interest.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.490
- [Kim] Interesting, can
you say more about that?

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.710
- [Erwin] The Supreme Court always

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.504
has been clear that freedom
of speech is not absolute.

00:03:31.504 --> 00:03:34.440
The Court has said that
there are certain categories

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.880
of speech that are unprotected
by the First Amendment.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.169
Incitement and illegal activity

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.960
is a category of unprotected speech.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.550
The Court has said this
requires showing that the speech

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.920
was directed at causing
imminent illegal activity,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.640
and there is a substantial likelihood

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.770
of imminent illegal activity.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.530
Another example: obscenity is unprotected

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.930
by the First Amendment.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.510
The Court struggled for
years with trying to define,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.020
'What is obscenity?'

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.950
Maybe the low point in that
is when Justice Potter Stewart

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.260
said, "I can't define it,
but I know it when I see it."

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.520
There are also these categories of speech

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.536
where the government can prohibit,

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:13.630
even punish the expression.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.134
- [Michael] That's where
most of the limitations

00:04:17.134 --> 00:04:20.072
on the freedom speech and
of the press come from,

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:23.140
is in order to make
sure that we don't hurt

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.330
other people's rights
through the use our own.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.667
An example of that, the
government can prohibit speech

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.360
which incites violence against someone.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.256
So if you're making a speech
and calling upon the crowd

00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:42.460
to attack somebody's
house or their person,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.621
that can be punished and prevented

00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:47.777
as an incitement to violence.

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:50.780
You can see how that follows
from the logical idea

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.913
of freedom of speech
being a natural right,

00:04:53.913 --> 00:04:58.270
and therefore limited by
the rights of other people.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.339
- [Kim] So let's turn
our attention toward the

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:05.198
freedom of religion part
of the First Amendment.

00:05:05.198 --> 00:05:09.364
So the first thing that the Amendment says

00:05:09.364 --> 00:05:12.620
is about establishment.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.793
What does the Establishment
Clause prevent?

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.340
- [Erwin] The language
of the First Amendment

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.760
is important, it says that Congress

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.310
may make no law respecting
the establishment of religion.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.057
Since 1947 the Supreme Court has said that

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:31.390
that also applies to state
and local governments.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.274
The Supreme Court has said this means

00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:35.610
that the government cannot act

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.100
with the purpose of advancing religion.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.406
- [Michael] To the founders,
this was a very clear

00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:45.737
legal concept, namely
it was the established

00:05:45.737 --> 00:05:49.701
Church of England that in the
statute books, in the law,

00:05:49.701 --> 00:05:53.161
the Church of England was
referred to as, and I quote,

00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:56.680
"The Church by law established."

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.551
What did it mean to be established?

00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:02.501
First of all, it meant that
the doctrines of the Church,

00:06:02.501 --> 00:06:05.931
the 39 Articles of Faith
of the Church of England,

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.050
were voted upon by parliament.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.140
So the doctrines, the liturgy, the text,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.930
were all adopted by law.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.383
The established Church was
the government's church,

00:06:20.383 --> 00:06:23.071
and it could be used,
and from time to time

00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:25.747
was used, as a instrument of government

00:06:25.747 --> 00:06:29.040
or as an instrument of politics.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.130
This is a way in which the government

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.450
is able to have a powerful influence

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.450
on the way in which values
and opinions are inculcated.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.490
It's one of the most important ideas

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.383
of the established church,
especially in the 18th century,

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:53.340
was to teach that there's
actually a religious obligation

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.288
to obey the law and to recognize the king

00:06:57.288 --> 00:07:02.288
as the supreme leader in matters
of both church and state.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.949
The framer's experience with
this was extremely powerful.

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.154
- [Erwin] That's because
the framers were aware

00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:15.820
of the religious persecution that

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.438
had gone on in other countries.

00:07:17.438 --> 00:07:20.376
They were aware of the evils that occur

00:07:20.376 --> 00:07:22.750
when the government becomes aligned

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.200
with a particular religion.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.290
- [Michael] The principal reason why many

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.730
of the colonists had come to
these shores to begin with

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.061
was to escape the oppressions
of the established

00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:36.800
Church of England back
home, and to come to a place

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.837
where they would be able to exercise

00:07:38.837 --> 00:07:41.848
the freedom of religion for themselves.

00:07:41.848 --> 00:07:44.440
The main opponents of
the established church

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.210
were not anti-Christian
or anti-religious people.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.400
They were the most religious people,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.220
and their view was the government

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.216
should stay our of our
church, that we will decide

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:58.176
what we believe for
ourselves, we will control

00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:00.850
our own church, we will
write our own liturgy,

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.899
we will decide what version of the Bible

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:07.040
we're going to use, we'll
choose our own ministers.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.170
Thank you very much
government, stay out of it.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.420
Leave us free to practice our religion

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.470
without having this kind
of an establishment.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.775
- [Erwin] For instance,
a county in Kentucky

00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:20.626
required that the Ten
Commandments be posted

00:08:20.626 --> 00:08:23.360
in all county buildings.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.127
The Supreme Court said,
"The Ten Commandments

00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:27.897
"are religious scripture.

00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:31.252
"There's no secular purpose
for having the Ten Commandments

00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:33.910
"posted in county buildings."

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:35.605
The Court declared it unconstitutional.

00:08:35.605 --> 00:08:38.837
The Supreme Court has said,
"The government can't act

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:41.037
"where there primary effect

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:44.757
"is to advance or to inhibit religion."

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:48.114
For example, there can't be
prayer in public schools.

00:08:48.114 --> 00:08:52.040
Even voluntary prayer in public
schools in impermissible,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.060
because the Court has said
that the primary effect

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.760
of having prayer in public
schools is to advance religion.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.430
The Court has explained that children

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:03.928
will inevitably feel
pressure to participate,

00:09:03.928 --> 00:09:07.090
and this coercion
violates the Constitution.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.798
- [Kim] So, the First
Amendment then prevents

00:09:10.798 --> 00:09:15.798
that kind of intermingling of
the government and the church.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.980
This is I guess the key idea of separation

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.508
between church and state,
but it also says that

00:09:23.508 --> 00:09:27.334
the Congress shall make no law prohibiting

00:09:27.334 --> 00:09:29.560
the free exercise of religion.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.210
So what does that mean?

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.340
- [Michael] Free exercise of religion

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.580
was the right to practice
your own religion.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.660
It didn't keep the government
from setting up a church,

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.410
but it did keep the
government from requiring you

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.492
to attend that church,
maybe even to contribute

00:09:45.492 --> 00:09:48.234
to the church, but also
kept the government

00:09:48.234 --> 00:09:51.272
from preventing you from
worshiping elsewhere.

00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:54.961
So the Establishment Clause
by and large prevents

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:58.610
the government from forcing
people to participate

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.025
in religion, and the Free
Exercise Clause by and large

00:10:02.025 --> 00:10:05.480
prohibits the government
from preventing people

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.520
from practicing their religion.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.520
Those two things work
together to enable everyone

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.097
to worship God in accordance
with their own conscience.

00:10:17.097 --> 00:10:17.930
- [Kim] Interesting.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.070
So you mentioned a little bit
about freedom of the press,

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.760
but there are two other
aspects of the First Amendment:

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.630
the right of the people
peaceably to assemble,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:31.490
and to petition the government
of a redress of grievances.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.450
So what is included with the
right to peaceably assemble?

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.280
Are there any situations where
that might be restricted?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.670
- [Erwin] The Supreme Court has said

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.180
that under freedom of speech,
there's a right to use

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.930
government property for speech purposes.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.376
This is also something that
tells the freedom of assembly.

00:10:50.376 --> 00:10:52.850
The Supreme Court has said
there's certain government

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.990
properties that the government is required

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.022
to make available for
speech: sidewalks and parks.

00:10:58.022 --> 00:11:00.850
There's other places where the
government has more latitude

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.240
to regulating speech: school facilities,

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.580
evenings and weekends.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.560
There's places where the
government can close entirely

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.380
to speech: military bases,
areas outside prisons and jails.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.130
All of these cases could
have been litigated

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.700
under freedom of assembly.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.919
Some of the earlier cases
explicitly mentioned

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:21.914
freedom of assembly, but
subsequent cases combined

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:24.330
freedom of assembly into the protection

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.689
of freedom of speech.

00:11:25.689 --> 00:11:27.260
- [Kim] I guess that makes sense,

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.100
But what about something
like a march, for example,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.710
that might, say, block traffic.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.114
That's perhaps a clear case
when there is this tension

00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:40.224
between freedom of speech
and assembly and say,

00:11:40.224 --> 00:11:45.224
public safety, if they're
blocking, say, an ambulance.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.550
How do you resolve that tension?

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.170
- [Michael] Sometime in roughly the 1970s,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.970
the Court began using
a quite different way

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.080
of looking at the free speech question,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.080
in which they said that laws
which regulate or prohibit

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.461
speech on the basis of the
content of the speech are,

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:11.880
generally speaking, unconstitutional,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.130
absent a very important
governmental purpose.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.960
But the laws that are content neutral,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.544
and regulate speech from
a basis of it's time,

00:12:21.544 --> 00:12:25.440
place, or manner are permitted.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.992
So the basic idea here is
the government has regulatory

00:12:28.992 --> 00:12:32.588
authority over speech,
but not over what you say.

00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:37.298
Just over when you say it, where
you say it, how you say it.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:40.250
- [Kim] So, the last thing
in the First Amendment

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.417
is the phrase "petitioning the government

00:12:42.417 --> 00:12:45.126
"for a redress of grievances."

00:12:45.126 --> 00:12:49.160
Congress shall make no law
abridging that freedom.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.360
What does this mean?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.320
How would one petition the government

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.060
for a redress of grievances?

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.110
- [Erwin] There are of
course many ways that people

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.340
can petition government
for redress of grievances.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.893
It's the ability to go and testify

00:13:00.893 --> 00:13:02.790
before our legislative body.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:06.200
It's the ability to communicate
with one's leglislators

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.460
or representatives about change.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.474
It's basically the ability
to go to the government

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:13.970
and ask it to change its policy.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.590
There are relatively few
cases just about the right

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.460
to petition government
for redress of grievances.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.323
Again, I think the reason for
that is, it's been so subsumed

00:13:22.323 --> 00:13:25.150
into the protection of freedom of speech.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:28.610
Everything one would do by
way of petitioning government

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.822
for redress of grievances is
through speech and expression,

00:13:31.822 --> 00:13:34.710
and so the larger protection
of speech and expression

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.510
has meant that the Court
hasn't needed to focus

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.360
so much on this particular right.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.250
- [Kim] Is there anything
that you feel people

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.380
commonly misunderstand
about the First Amendment,

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.913
what it encompasses and what it does not?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.053
- [Erwin] One of the most
important misunderstandings

00:13:49.053 --> 00:13:51.832
about this First Amendment,
is that people fail to realize

00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:55.100
that it, like all rights
in the Constitution,

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.820
apply only to the government.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.420
Before I took my current job,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.770
I was a professor at Duke University

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.030
in Durham, North Carolina.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:03.930
Duke is a private university.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.777
If while I was there, I had
criticized the president

00:14:06.777 --> 00:14:09.510
of the university, and he
would have ordered me fired,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.320
I could not have sued
him or Duke University

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.000
for violating my free speech rights.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.080
The First Amendment doesn't apply

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.380
because it's a private university.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.330
Now I'm at the University of
California, a state university.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.200
If I were to give a speech criticizing

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.520
the president of the university,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.478
or the chancellor of my
campus, and I was to be fired

00:14:25.478 --> 00:14:27.650
for doing that, I could sue.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.700
I would sue, because this
is a public university.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.130
The First Amendment applies.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.330
- [Michael] So I think
the really dangerous thing

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:39.330
in our times is that many people believe

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.730
that they have some kind of a right

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.470
not to hear opinions
that they find offensive.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.490
Certainly college campuses are filled

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.730
with controversies of this sort.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.220
This is something that our Constitution

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.470
was designed to prevent.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.870
Free speech can inflict offense.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:05.110
Sometimes it can be hurtful and insulting,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.110
but we as a nation have
decided that it is better

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.637
to put up with that so
that we can all be free

00:15:12.637 --> 00:15:16.190
to express ourselves, to
criticize the government,

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.026
to urge the religious and scientific

00:15:19.026 --> 00:15:22.623
and artistic ideas that we have.

00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:27.170
It's more important for
all of us to do that

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.311
than it is to be able to
retreat to safe spaces

00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:35.640
and require other people to shut up.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.120
- [Kim] So we've learned that the rights

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.700
protected in the First
Amendment derive from

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.178
the historical context
of restricted speech,

00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:45.540
press, and religion in
Europe that the framers

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.550
wished to avoid in the United States.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.460
Freedom of religion includes both

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.612
the freedom not to
participate in religion,

00:15:51.612 --> 00:15:55.330
and the freedom to practice
whatever religion you choose.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.110
Freedom of speech extends to all forms

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.000
of freedom of expression, not just words,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.810
but there are limits to
what counts as free speech.
