1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,660
Ah, three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:02,661 --> 00:00:06,510
I'm Robert Krulwich today on
radio lab blame. All right.

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:10,260
So tell me your name again. Bianca.
Bianca, yeah. And I'm a quality name.

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,640
Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So this
is taped. It was sent to us, uh,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:18,030
by a radio producer named Bianca Gaver
at the time she was in college just

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,340
starting out a bike and
across the country. Yeah.

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:24,660
We just got this grant to bicycle around
this summer and talk to you. Yeah,

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:27,600
it's called Davis projects
for peace. Oh Great.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,770
And she was riding through this part of
Tennessee and ended up on this farm type

10
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,200
place where she met this guy, Hector.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,110
My name is Hector black. I'm
86, almost 86 and a half.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,420
When you get as old as I am,

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,750
you add the halfs again like
you did when you were three.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,100
And Hector ended up telling Bianca
story that in many ways turns everything

15
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:53,880
we've learned in this hour on
its head. Um, so yeah, where's,

16
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,800
where would be the best
parts place to start? I mean,

17
00:00:55,801 --> 00:01:00,630
I think the story starts when he decided
to move to Atlanta because that's where

18
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:04,440
Patricia was his daughter.
Okay. He had fought in the war,

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,060
a combat engineer, World War
II. I was not a good soldier.

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,390
Went to Harvard, got a degree,
met his wife Suzy, and then

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,880
I did join the civil
rights work in the 60s

22
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,400
I think when Hector heard about
the civil rights movement,

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,260
he actually packed up his bags,

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,840
moved to the neighborhood
where Martin Luther King Live,

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,560
rented a house and said,
what can I do to help?

26
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:32,880
I felt that I wouldn't really understand
what was going on unless I lived there.

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,420
And that's when he meets Patricia girl
in the neighborhood who came over all the

28
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:40,590
time, just like a lot of kids.
But she stuck around longer than,

29
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,570
than anyone else. And at 11 years old
she asked them, will you adopt me?

30
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,760
Why are you explaining? Did you
adopt Patricia? What happened?

31
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:49,430
How'd you sure she, her mom

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,810
was an alcoholic. Sometimes she
drank up the rent money and,

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,230
and the kids were out on the
street with their mom and dad. Mom,

34
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,060
there was no dad and uh, so we
took them in and she was very shy.

35
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:06,650
She had impetigo sores on her legs
in a nappy headed. Knew Your Mama,

36
00:02:06,651 --> 00:02:10,310
never braided her hair. She was
just really a neglected child.

37
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,470
And so she just blossomed.

38
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,580
She got into reading, sewing,
painting. She made all her own clothes.

39
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,610
She's making bridal gowns as
a second source of income.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,930
And then she went off to college.

41
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,010
She came back and started teaching kids
to read. She even took it a few kids,

42
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,690
just like he had done adopted a
couple of kids. Yeah, he was too.

43
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,210
She's a wonderful child.

44
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,810
So unfortunately the whole story changes
now in November of 2000 because that's

45
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,510
when Patricia,

46
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,870
okay, who was murdered?

47
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,650
Ivan Simpson is the name of
the man who killed her. Yeah.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,480
He had broken into her house
looking for money and strangled her.

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,600
And later the autopsy showed he sexually
assaulted her too. At first, you know,

50
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,720
eight yellow kill the bastard
you guys saw, I saw it

51
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,190
kind of a monster. You
would do a thing like this

52
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,550
and he said for almost a year
he could not stop imagining

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,780
what he had done to her.

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,040
These visions that come at me
out of the blue just hit me.

55
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,670
Okay. Did you get,

56
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,160
he just said no control. It
was like he had control over me

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,610
pushing my face in the mud

58
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,600
after I haven't had confessed. And
this was right after the murder,

59
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,690
Hector said part of him did want
Ivan to get the death penalty,

60
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,450
but then this other part of him
was like, no, this is a test.

61
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,900
This was a test of his
principles of his beliefs.

62
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,410
And so he decided he would
not pursue the death penalty

63
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,280
it at the trial, um,
where he was sentenced,

64
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,600
he refused to look at Ivan.
Trisha's cousin got up first.

65
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,520
She was just in tears and just said how
much she hated him. I thought, oh Lord,

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,690
I hear I'm going to go say something
that's probably gonna hurt her feelings.

67
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,010
And when it came his turn,

68
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,850
I had a written statement
because of unsure how steady
my voice was going to be.

69
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,080
But I was saying how
much we love Patricia,

70
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,440
how much she meant to us and how
wounded we were by what had happened.

71
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,340
And I said, I don't know if I've
forgiven you. I haven't Simpson,

72
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:34,110
but I don't hate you. I hate with all
my soul what you did to my daughter.

73
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,580
And then you worked up the nerve to
turn around to face him to say the last

74
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,710
thing I had written that said,

75
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:45,490
I wish for all of us who had
been so wounded by this crime,

76
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,320
I wished that we might find God's
peace and I wish that also for you.

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,220
I even Simpson. And he
says when he looked up,

78
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,630
tears are streaming. Yeah,
there's cheeks and you know,

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,680
as the first time I looked into his
eyes and it was like a soul inhale

80
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:07,490
[inaudible]

81
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,020
I was just undescribable looking there

82
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,270
in the end. I haven't ended up
getting life in prison without parole.

83
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,120
What happens next was so surprising
and troubling to us frankly,

84
00:05:24,121 --> 00:05:29,121
that we sent Bianca in our producer Andy
Mills back down to Tennessee to talk to

85
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,390
Hector again. Okay. So it's
the night after the trial.

86
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,540
Hector is laying in bed in the Mattel.

87
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,130
I couldn't sleep that night and he
kept thinking about that moment in the

88
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:45,660
courtroom. I'd never, I'd never had
it looked like that my whole life.

89
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Never before or since over and over
and over and finally he just gets up.

90
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,060
He grabs a pen and paper and he starts
writing. Even Christopher Simpson,

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,250
I am writing

92
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,250
because I wanted you to know how I feel
after the court hearing Monday when I

93
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:06,890
turned around while I was reading
my statement and looked at you,

94
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,530
it was a very powerful moment for me
when you raised your tear stain face to

95
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,470
look at me. Ever since this happened,

96
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:20,390
I've been trying to find something good
in all the horror and pain I have tried

97
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,010
to be a better person

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,780
and then he writes this line maybe as
a way to push himself to be that better

99
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,870
person, but he writes, I forgive you

100
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,280
for what you did to our beloved daughter.

101
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,550
I don't know if this will be of any
comfort to you, but I wanted to tell you,

102
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,850
we will both have to live our lives
with the pain of this dude always there.

103
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,780
Patricia tried to make
the world a better place.

104
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,060
We should also try

105
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:54,800
[inaudible].

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,670
Did you think he would write you
back after that? I didn't know,

107
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,480
but about four weeks
later a letter shows up.

108
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,680
Yeah. This is it. Dear Mr
Hector, black and family,

109
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,320
I first want to say, God
bless you all in all things.

110
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,980
Second, I have to go
straight to the point.

111
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,390
I know God has forgiven
me. You have forgiven me,

112
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:25,260
but I can't forgive
myself. Not yet. Anyway.

113
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,300
I have so much anger at myself
right now. It's unbelievable.

114
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,000
This hardness I have against
mine, I will always be remorseful.

115
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:40,290
I used to hear God speak
to me all the time,

116
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,510
but I guess after what I did,
he took away his touch from me.

117
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,480
Right? No, I miss his voice.

118
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,630
I don't know that level
of love Ms Patricia had,

119
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,420
but if it's anything
like your example of it,

120
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,230
it is great. God comfort
you all in everything.

121
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,600
Few free to us. Me, anything you like.

122
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,930
If I can, I will try to answer it.

123
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,440
[inaudible]

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,410
dear Ivan, I was very
glad to have your letter.

125
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I think it is important that we be as
honest as possible with one another and so

126
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:25,220
I have to tell you that it is
hard for me to write to you.

127
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,320
I wanted to know who he was. I would
really like to hear about your life,

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,060
about the people who loved you,

129
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,380
the people who hurt you because I wanted
to knew what had happened to him that

130
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,290
could make it possible for
me to do with the length is

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,550
[inaudible].

132
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,470
Ivan writes, Dear Hector, I was
adopted when I was two days old.

133
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,080
His mother was schizophrenia.
This is Simpson.

134
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,570
The one I call mom known took me in.

135
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,890
He was raised by his
grandmother's sister. She's 80 no,

136
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,140
I used to have to stay over there
with my natural mum while Marie,

137
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,700
my mom, no had to work. My
natural mom used to beat me.

138
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,110
Blurt out. I'm glad I got rid
of you when he was a little boy.

139
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,120
Maybe about 11 or so.

140
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,280
She took him and his younger brother and
his little sister to a swimming pool.

141
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:21,630
And you tried to drone all three.
One sister died. He stood there.

142
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,510
She drowned his little
sister in front of him,

143
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,510
just the most horrible
stuff. And so we asked him,

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,970
having heard all this from Ivan,

145
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,280
did he still blame Ivan or did he blame
his mom or society or something else?

146
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,260
Well, I, I do blame him. I
mean, he made the choices.

147
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,650
He made the choices.
There's no doubt about that.

148
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,550
But he says, knowing this
also made a Monterey Bat.

149
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,610
[inaudible]

150
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,080
dear Ivan, and tell Ivan about his
life. I grew up in New York City,

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,420
his family, two brothers. My
parents argued and fought a lot.

152
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,920
Basically his whole life story.

153
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,040
I've always loved working with plans and
after we left find the city and moved

154
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:08,490
back to the country and
I haven't wrote back

155
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,530
dear Hector, I was raised in the church,

156
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:16,480
but after starting drugs and alcohol,
I changed, responded dear Ivan,

157
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,930
I don't think God has
abandoned you dear Hector.

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,130
You're the only one writing
to me. No, we exchanged many,

159
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:25,120
many letters

160
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,790
and at some point in this back and forth,

161
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,130
this almost incomprehensible
thing happens. Do you Hector?

162
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:36,350
There are letters. First of
all, thank you for the pictures.

163
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:41,080
I never knew plum trees blossom.
Really just become [inaudible] casual.

164
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,280
My favorite bloom is the water lily
blossom. They'd talk about flowers.

165
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,210
It's beautiful things they'd read.
Dear Ivan, thanks for your letters.

166
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,260
I've been closing a story someone said
to be because I thought you would enjoy

167
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:57,250
it and sometimes you, Hector, just
the most mundane details of their day,

168
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,330
just sitting around this Saturday
evening been singing him is to myself

169
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,700
basically they became friends.

170
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,300
You knew Hector, you're right.
I do sense of bone developing.

171
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,470
Unusual because of the
circumstances. Nope.

172
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,390
At all. What I expected
to happen, you know,

173
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,600
and it's just so absolutely crazy.

174
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,173
You're actually,

175
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:32,880
oh gosh.

176
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,930
Yeah. We, we,

177
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,930
we started to send him Christmas packages
and we see this box on the floor and

178
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,670
then I think to myself, you crazy old man,

179
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,970
you're Sydney Christmas packages for
the man who murdered your daughter.

180
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,720
What the Hell is [inaudible] with

181
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,720
you? So Cross

182
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,020
so totally out of

183
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,930
orbit or something and I guess that
was because people don't do that.

184
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,070
Maybe I'm trying to exact meaning from it.

185
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,100
I don't know because I
struggled so hard with y

186
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,073
y

187
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,710
no.

188
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,430
Eventually after years of writing letters,

189
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,100
Hector decided to ask that why question

190
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,180
[inaudible]

191
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,860
in its most essential form.

192
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,440
What happened that night?
This one? This one.

193
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:44,490
I just want you to know if you don't
want to read this. Oh yeah, we don't.

194
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,460
We don't want to make you read this. If
you, if you're not, you're not ready.

195
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,030
I don't think it's, this might
be a good time to say that.

196
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,150
This next part is disturbing. If you
have kids or you're just not in the mood,

197
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,490
now's a good time to duck
out for a few minutes.

198
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,360
Dear Hector, I wasn't
going to tell you. Oh,

199
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,340
what happened until you asked.

200
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,110
I'm also glad you're
relieving me of details. Also.

201
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,640
God bless you.

202
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,080
I went into the house around 7:30 PM
I'm used to breaking into place in the

203
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:19,410
past, so I figured the
house was total dark,

204
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,680
so I broke out a whole
window and climbed in.

205
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,620
I took the VCR and TV and clock.
I figured that was enough.

206
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,920
Went and gut $80 worth of
drugs. I'm a heavy users,

207
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,950
so it went in about one hour.

208
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,000
So he made his way back to Trisha's house.

209
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,470
It was still dark. So I went back in.

210
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,080
He found his way into the bedroom. I

211
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,070
saw a computer in Stereo,

212
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,540
so I said I take it and that
should last for the night.

213
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,660
But I got trapped when I saw a car,

214
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,440
so I hid until I could get
back out the way I came.

215
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,010
So I saw a lady walk to the room.

216
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,320
I tried to be quiet so I could escape.
When she opened the door to a closet,

217
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:08,280
I was hiding. As she
stepped back, she fell.

218
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,620
I told her I was going to tie her up
so it would have time to get away.

219
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,480
She said, okay sir.

220
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,290
Her glasses fell off and at no time she
saw my face so I told her I was going to

221
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,330
take the car so I could load it up.

222
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,430
She gave me the keys so I told her
after I found out her name, I said,

223
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,593
Patricia,

224
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,250
I know you're scared but I will be
out of here in about 15 minutes.

225
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:39,240
Then she said, you should get
help with your drug problem.

226
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:44,860
I told her I tried in the past
but I restarted or yeah, that's,

227
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,810
that's Trish.

228
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,730
She had no compunctions about telling
people off when they were in the room and

229
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:52,580
then I, I'm sorry for this,

230
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,410
I'm going to leave your car in the
shopping center up the street next to the

231
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:02,411
Chinese restaurant because all I need
the car for was to transport the items I

232
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:03,690
had

233
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,180
and even though Trish was
tied up around her hands,

234
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,900
she went into the kitchen and warmed
up some chicken and rolls for Ivan.

235
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,910
Then I said, I'm sorry, and I left again.

236
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,540
I got rid of the things,

237
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,610
got about $200 well a hundred
dollars drugs and $100 cash.

238
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,940
Then I said, well, I just parked
the car at the end of the driveway.

239
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,310
Then I couldn't wait. I pulled over
and smoked some of the crack cocaine

240
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,630
and at this point he's really high and
he explained that when he gets this high,

241
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,830
he's sometimes here's a male voice in
his head and as he was walking away,

242
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:39,970
the voice said to him,

243
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,680
he said, well, go get you some sex.

244
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:49,230
I told him, leave me alone, but next thing
I know I'm walking back to her house.

245
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,450
No police had come.

246
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,240
He burst through the door, ran to
where Patricia was tied up and said,

247
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,030
did you have any money? Kind of
wish. She said, look in my purse,

248
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,600
and then Ivan said that the voice in his
head became his own voice and he said

249
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,100
to her, I want some six

250
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,630
[inaudible].

251
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,130
She said, sir, you've been
so nice. Why don't do that?

252
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,750
Yeah.

253
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,050
You said only way you going
to do this if I'm dead.

254
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,570
Okay then and it happened.

255
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,760
He strangled her, sexually
assaulted her, then he ran away.

256
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,160
Sure. Around 2:00 AM I ran out of drugs.

257
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,500
You said that after he
finished getting high,

258
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,960
he started to wonder if
he had dreamt it all up.

259
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,260
So he made one last trip
back to Patricia's house.

260
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,180
So I looked up at the house. No
police and gate's still open.

261
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,570
So now have peeps through the
door. She was still laying there.

262
00:16:48,571 --> 00:16:50,580
So I said Patricia, Patricia,

263
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,270
and then the voice in his head told
him to go back in one more time.

264
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,340
He sexually assaulted her.

265
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,080
I couldn't believe what happened.

266
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,880
So went to my mom has adopted
mother and I said, Mama,

267
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,650
it's something wrong. Moma,
something wrong. She said, child,

268
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,910
tell me what you're talking
about. I couldn't tell her

269
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:18,890
[inaudible]

270
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,840
I was really hoping they would kill me
in the electric chair because I could,

271
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,910
I shouldn't be able to live with
myself and God after what I had done.

272
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,340
I just don't know why I had to do it.

273
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,480
Was it because of the
items and the money? No.

274
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,390
Getting caught later on in life.

275
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,580
No control or power? No car?

276
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,990
No. Because she saw my face. No,

277
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,950
she didn't see me at no time
fingerprints left on something.

278
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,760
No, I just don't understand why I did it.

279
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:00,723
[inaudible]

280
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,450
well, I feel the pressure has left me
for telling you first what happened.

281
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,820
My mom doesn't even know.

282
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,200
I've been keeping all this
inside and it hurts. So

283
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,220
I'm truly sorrowful for what happened.

284
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,610
May God bless you all sincerely. Ivan

285
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,060
does it, did it help?

286
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,140
But any way to know?

287
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,073
Yes,

288
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:36,160
because I mean that
sounded exactly like Trish,

289
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,590
but she was, was a really the fearless,

290
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,370
I mean a machine, Mr Burrito, I
can't imagine what a horrible,

291
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,850
Oh God. And his chest

292
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,600
amazed that she could be so strong

293
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,100
just to be raised because when you love
somebody very much, you want to know

294
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,380
about their last hours and

295
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,253
ah,

296
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,570
he, he just, he just wrote
