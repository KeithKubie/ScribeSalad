could aid in the crisis management I was
curious if you can comment on those

00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839
curious if you can comment on those
 

00:53:46.839 --> 00:53:48.559
curious if you can comment on those
which our thoughts are on those yeah

00:53:48.559 --> 00:53:48.569
which our thoughts are on those yeah
 

00:53:48.569 --> 00:53:51.299

the theory it's the practice of
 

00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:58.680
the theory it's the practice of
compensation but here is very simple

00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:58.690
compensation but here is very simple
 

00:53:58.690 --> 00:54:00.420

financial firms like investment banks

00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:10.150
financial firms like investment banks
 

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:11.730
financial firms like investment banks

hazard and compensation worked
 

00:54:17.079 --> 00:54:20.130
hazard and compensation worked
beautifully well and so the intention of

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:20.140
beautifully well and so the intention of
 

00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.710
beautifully well and so the intention of
where one has to go with this given that

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720
where one has to go with this given that
 

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.799
where one has to go with this given that
compensations levels can be large is to

00:54:25.799 --> 00:54:25.809
compensations levels can be large is to
 

00:54:25.809 --> 00:54:28.420
compensations levels can be large is to
see what can you do to mimic some of

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:28.430
see what can you do to mimic some of
 

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:30.130
see what can you do to mimic some of
private partnership aspects and

00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:30.140
private partnership aspects and
 

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.660
private partnership aspects and
compensation so you get those handcuffs

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:31.670
compensation so you get those handcuffs
 

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:34.690
compensation so you get those handcuffs
and it is long-term performance etc but

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:34.700
and it is long-term performance etc but
 

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.460
and it is long-term performance etc but
ultimately it comes down to subjective

00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:36.470
ultimately it comes down to subjective
 

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:39.520
ultimately it comes down to subjective
evaluations and that it is exactly the

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:39.530
evaluations and that it is exactly the
 

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.980
evaluations and that it is exactly the
kind of process which we're spending a

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:41.990
kind of process which we're spending a
 

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.230
kind of process which we're spending a
lot of time on the regulators are

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240
lot of time on the regulators are
 

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.520
lot of time on the regulators are
spending a lot of time on that's

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:45.530
spending a lot of time on that's
 

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:47.020
spending a lot of time on that's
important because what they're going to

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:47.030
important because what they're going to
 

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:48.700
important because what they're going to
do is look at the structure and say I

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:48.710
do is look at the structure and say I
 

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.040
do is look at the structure and say I
like it I don't like it if I don't like

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:51.050
like it I don't like it if I don't like
 

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:52.990
like it I don't like it if I don't like
it you can do it but your capital

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000
it you can do it but your capital
 

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.610
it you can do it but your capital
requirement goes up dramatically because

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:54.620
requirement goes up dramatically because
 

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.500
requirement goes up dramatically because
you're a riskier firm so there are lots

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:56.510
you're a riskier firm so there are lots
 

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:58.390
you're a riskier firm so there are lots
of different ways of getting at it but

00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400
of different ways of getting at it but
 

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.760
of different ways of getting at it but
again it's a it's not the theory it's

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:00.770
again it's a it's not the theory it's
 

00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:02.980
again it's a it's not the theory it's
the practice it's difficult but we're

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:02.990
the practice it's difficult but we're
 

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.720
the practice it's difficult but we're
going to evolve to the right answers on

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:04.730
going to evolve to the right answers on

regulator then again you have

00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:04.580
regulator then again you have

regulator that can actually gather the
information because again it's about

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:15.320
information because again it's about
 

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:18.580
information because again it's about
transparency and not everything that

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:18.590
transparency and not everything that
 

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:20.290

needs to be transparent maybe

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:20.300
needs to be transparent maybe
 

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:22.300
needs to be transparent maybe
transparent the market but it could be

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:22.310

you can call them that but they're
 

00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:41.700
you can call them that but they're
nothing more than what if scenarios and

the problem was because the bank's

00:58:20.650 --> 00:58:20.660
the problem was because the bank's
 

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.420
the problem was because the bank's

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:25.540
else's numbers in some cases members
weren't there in some cases they're just

00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:25.550
weren't there in some cases they're just
 

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:27.370
weren't there in some cases they're just
wrong in some cases nobody expected

00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:27.380

by the way if they did you would never

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440
by the way if they did you would never

by the way if they did you would never
had a bubble so it's it's less about

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:33.080
had a bubble so it's it's less about
 

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.380
had a bubble so it's it's less about
that but I think the process was really

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:35.390
that but I think the process was really
 

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.330
that but I think the process was really
important running the what-if scenarios

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:37.340
important running the what-if scenarios
 

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.470
important running the what-if scenarios
and by the way there's always going to

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480
and by the way there's always going to
 

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.120
and by the way there's always going to
be a scenario you missed we know that

00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:40.130
be a scenario you missed we know that
 

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:43.090
be a scenario you missed we know that
which is one of the points that makes

00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:43.100
which is one of the points that makes
 

00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.920
which is one of the points that makes
this such a difficult exercise but I

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:44.930
this such a difficult exercise but I
 

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:46.960
this such a difficult exercise but I
think it's a good move it's a good move

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:46.970
think it's a good move it's a good move
 

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:48.490
think it's a good move it's a good move
and it's the right thing but the water

and it's the right thing but the water
scenarios are not only about risk but

00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720
scenarios are not only about risk but
 

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.380
scenarios are not only about risk but
one of the issues is by the is that you

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:53.390
one of the issues is by the is that you
 

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.730
one of the issues is by the is that you
have

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:53.740
have
 

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:55.290

the right approach yes just to have two
 

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.130
the right approach yes just to have two
more questions high five I have two

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:20.140
more questions high five I have two
 

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:22.100
more questions high five I have two
questions so the first is for a bank

00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.110
questions so the first is for a bank
 

00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:25.440
questions so the first is for a bank
there's for a bank like citibank which

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:25.450
there's for a bank like citibank which
 

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:27.510
there's for a bank like citibank which
