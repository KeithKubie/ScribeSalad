00:00:00.756 --> 00:00:03.800
Again, I'll want to use a fun quiz

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.939
to get you situated with respect to the concept

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.780
of an abstraction. Now remember what I told

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.890
you about an abstraction, that it's an interface that

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.670
allows us to hide all the details. With that in mind, what I want you to do

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.960
Is to think about the objects and the terms

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.830
that I've laid out on this panel for you.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.260
And you may have come across many of them and from this set tell me which of

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.080
these is not an abstraction. There may be more

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.840
than one item in this set that I've shown

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470
you on this panel that may not be an

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.290
abstraction and I want you to identify all of

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.170
the items that you think is not an abstraction.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.570
The first choice I have is a door knob.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.510
The second choice I have for you is instruction set architecture. The

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.660
third choice I have is the number of pins coming out of a chip, like a processor

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.700
chip. And the next choice I have for you is a logic gate such as

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.630
and gate that does the and function. And the next item I

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.830
have for you is a transistor. And the next item I have for you is the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.480
INT data type in a programming language like C. And the last item I have for you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.080
is exact location of base pads in a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.620
baseball field. So these are the choices that I'm

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.980
giving you and what I want you to

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.110
do is think about these different items. Which you

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.690
may have come across for sure in your every

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.340
day experience, and tell me which one of these

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.734
does not qualify as an abstraction. And as I've said, there

00:01:51.734 --> 00:01:52.599
could be more than one that does not qualify as an abstraction.
