it<00:14:37.500><c> was</c><00:14:37.710><c> a</c><00:14:37.950><c> little</c><00:14:38.430><c> strange</c><00:14:38.880><c> and</c><00:14:39.330><c> yes</c><00:14:39.480><c> a</c><00:14:39.510><c> little</c>

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
it was a little strange and yes a little
 

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.780 align:start position:0%
it was a little strange and yes a little
odd<00:14:40.050><c> that</c><00:14:40.350><c> the</c><00:14:40.740><c> woods</c><00:14:40.920><c> are</c><00:14:41.070><c> this</c><00:14:41.280><c> sense</c><00:14:41.490><c> of</c><00:14:41.580><c> no</c>

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:41.790 align:start position:0%
odd that the woods are this sense of no
 

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.450 align:start position:0%
odd that the woods are this sense of no
I<00:14:42.270><c> can</c><00:14:42.810><c> see</c><00:14:43.020><c> that</c><00:14:43.050><c> like</c><00:14:43.410><c> it</c><00:14:43.680><c> shook</c><00:14:44.070><c> I've</c><00:14:44.250><c> been</c>

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
I can see that like it shook I've been
 

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.220 align:start position:0%
I can see that like it shook I've been
this<00:14:44.610><c> way</c><00:14:44.670><c> it</c><00:14:45.090><c> should</c><00:14:45.300><c> be</c><00:14:45.450><c> a</c><00:14:45.480><c> little</c><00:14:45.780><c> off</c><00:14:45.990><c> it</c>

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:46.230 align:start position:0%
this way it should be a little off it
 

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
this way it should be a little off it
should<00:14:46.410><c> be</c><00:14:46.530><c> a</c><00:14:46.560><c> little</c><00:14:46.830><c> weird</c><00:14:47.040><c> yeah</c><00:14:47.630><c> so</c><00:14:48.630><c> yeah</c><00:14:49.500><c> I</c>

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:49.530 align:start position:0%
should be a little weird yeah so yeah I
 

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.470 align:start position:0%
should be a little weird yeah so yeah I
think<00:14:50.040><c> you</c><00:14:50.100><c> nailed</c><00:14:50.250><c> it</c><00:14:50.460><c> it</c><00:14:50.640><c> has</c><00:14:50.820><c> to</c><00:14:50.970><c> follow</c><00:14:51.210><c> its</c>

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
think you nailed it it has to follow its
 

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.260 align:start position:0%
think you nailed it it has to follow its
own<00:14:51.600><c> rules</c><00:14:51.660><c> and</c><00:14:52.370><c> I</c><00:14:53.370><c> think</c><00:14:53.640><c> this</c><00:14:53.790><c> does</c><00:14:53.820><c> as</c>

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:54.270 align:start position:0%
own rules and I think this does as
 

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
own rules and I think this does as
strange<00:14:54.720><c> and</c><00:14:54.960><c> bizarre</c><00:14:55.110><c> as</c><00:14:55.500><c> it</c><00:14:55.680><c> is</c><00:14:55.830><c> it</c><00:14:56.070><c> does</c><00:14:56.250><c> set</c>

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.490 align:start position:0%
strange and bizarre as it is it does set
 

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.660 align:start position:0%
strange and bizarre as it is it does set
these<00:14:56.670><c> very</c><00:14:57.200><c> smart</c><00:14:58.200><c> rules</c><00:14:58.680><c> that</c><00:14:59.070><c> make</c><00:14:59.280><c> us</c><00:14:59.460><c> want</c>

00:14:59.660 --> 00:14:59.670 align:start position:0%
these very smart rules that make us want
 

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.820 align:start position:0%
these very smart rules that make us want
to<00:14:59.760><c> keep</c><00:14:59.910><c> coming</c><00:15:00.270><c> back</c><00:15:00.450><c> and</c><00:15:00.680><c> learning</c><00:15:01.680><c> more</c>

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:01.830 align:start position:0%
