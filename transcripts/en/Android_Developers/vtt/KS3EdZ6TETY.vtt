00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:06.230
ANTOINE SAKHO: Busuu is one of
the world's leading language

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.350
learning apps.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.800
Our mission is to empower
everyone in the world

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.420
to learn a new language.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.430
The way we do this
is by providing

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.720
our users with high
quality courses

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.700
designed in-house
enriched by conversations

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.354
with native speakers.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:23.270
The whole idea being
that to learn a language,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.210
you need to practice it with
people who actually speak it.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.560
That's really what people
love about our product,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.300
is this social interaction.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.282
To date, over 65
million people have

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:35.150
used Busuu to learn a language.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.870
And interestingly, out
of our five largest

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.790
markets on Android, four
are emerging countries--

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.181
namely Turkey, Russia,
Brazil, and India.

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.680
What we've come to realize is
that a lot of emerging markets

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.490
have limited storage, memory,
they have slow or intermittent

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.760
connectivity, so we've started
doing more to really empathize

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.330
with those users.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.510
EDOARDO TOGNONI: The Network
Log was the first tool

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330
that we used.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.440
With that, we were
able to reduce

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.300
the amount of data
we were exchanging,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.260
because we were able to
tackle some bugs in our code.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.040
The memory profiler is
another tool that we use.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.190
With that, we were
able to make sure that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.490
what's inside the memory
is what is meant to be

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.520
and nothing more.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.550
Since we are a language
learning application

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.986
and we support different
interface languages,

00:01:22.986 --> 00:01:25.490
Lint is a great tool for us.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.950
With Lint, we're
able to make sure

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.510
that we have 100% of the
data complete and correct.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.610
When we were focusing
on performances,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.940
one thing that we saw is
the database was huge.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.970
So we decide, OK, lets
get rid of the database.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.280
Let's go online.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.660
We were able to reduce the APK
size from 60 megabytes to 25

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.750
megabytes.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.890
That was a huge
improvement for us,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.640
and we saw a lot more downloads
from emerging markets.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.840
ANTOINE SAKHO: Following
our work on performance,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.530
we've seen our weekly average
ratings jump from 4.1 to 4.5,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.521
which is the highest
we've ever had.

00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:05.020
EDOARDO TOGNONI:
Every developer has

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.870
to make sure that
their own app is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.360
working in every type of device
in every type of environment.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.030
Having more tools that are
focused on performances

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.689
for sure will have and will
make developer's life easier.

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.480
ANTOINE SAKHO: Performance
is not something

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.840
that you set aside
and forget about.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.500
It's something you
have to instill

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.570
in the culture of the business.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.620
