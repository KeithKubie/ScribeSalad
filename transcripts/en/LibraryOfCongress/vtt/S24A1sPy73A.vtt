&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.666
I-- how many of have been in the
seat since 10 o'clock this morning?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.580
[ Laughter ]

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.580
&gt;&gt; Not bad.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.596
I recognize several familiar
faces from when I was

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.963
up here three hours ago introducing
the wonderful Olga Grushen.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.323
I have been reading Scott Turow for
as long as he has been publishing

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.080
and I don't believe I
reviewed his first book,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.100
the wonderful nonfiction
account, One L, of his first year

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.296
at Harvard Law School
but I've reviewed many

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.150
of this novels invariably with
greatest admiration not merely

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.163
for their very considerable hours
entertainment but for their smarts,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.066
their inherent and
essential seriousness,

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.886
the gracefulness of
their prose style.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.976
Scott is a very useful exemplar

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.263
of how so-called popular
fiction can cross

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.566
into the areas supposedly occupied
by literature and achieve durable

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
and lasting moment of its own.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.106
His new book published 25 years

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.946
after his first novel is
called Innocent and it is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.466
in effect a sequel to his
first novel Presumed Innocent.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.053
Both novels center on the
figure of Rusty Sabich

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.476
and the various extreme difficulties
he manages to get himself

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.266
into in the course of
practicing the law.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.146
I should just say before stepping
off the stage that Scott writes

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.160
about the manners of the
court house and the law and in

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.340
that respect makes me think often

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.036
of another superb lawyer
turned novelist,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.100
the late Louis Auchincloss.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.793
Very different writers but both
of them people who continued

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.303
to practice law throughout
their writing careers

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.903
and to distinguish
themselves in both endeavors.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.850
Scott?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000


00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.350
[ Applause ]

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.896
&gt;&gt; Before it gets too far away,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.430
I would you to make a brief
homage to Jonathan Yardley.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.983
I'm not sure reviewers know this

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.803
but writers do review
reviewers [laughter]

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.293
and when they get together
and of course most

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.860
of the time, it's bitching.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.680
Most of the time that I, you know,
they're sharing their complaints

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.986
about how unfair, so
and so, was to them.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.116
But, you know, when you get to
Yardley, he's generally greeted

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.880
with a, well, you know,
Yardley is not bad.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.420
[Laughter] And in point effect, he
is to me, as far as I am concerned,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.723
the best book reviewer in the
United States among the people

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.513
who do this [applause]
on a regular basis.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.796
[Applause] And my respect

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.396
for his reviews continues
notwithstanding the fact

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.063
that I'm not sure that
it's invariably praise

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.553
with what you've graded my novels
but I remember picking a book

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.790
out of a remainder bin in Arlington,
Massachusetts in 1976 while I was

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.646
in my first year of law school.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.046
And it turned out to be Anne
Tyler's The Clock Winder

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.623
and I remember reading it
because even by then and I think--

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.903
Jonathan, you were writing
for a paper in South Carolina?

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.603
&gt;&gt; The Miami Herald.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.403
&gt;&gt; You were at the Miami Herald.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.736
And even by then I recognized his
name and knew that I regarded this

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.853
as a person whose opinions
about fiction I regarded

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.556
as trustworthy and sound.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.656
And of course I was pretty snotty
young guy at that point having,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.630
you know, just arrived from
the Stanford Writing Programs.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.496
So, it is truly an
honor to be introduced

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.660
by Jonathan Yardley, America's best.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.143
When I first encountered Jonathan
this morning, I was in a suit

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.926
and tie and 'cause the--
we were at a breakfast

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.026
where the attire wear was described
as business attire and Jonathan was

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.883
in shorts and a short-sleeved shirt
and I realized if Yardley can appear

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.223
in shorts and a short-sleeved
shirt, there's no reason I can't so.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.540
And after several hours in my
suit I went back and changed

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.793
but it brought back to mind the
fact that I lived in Washington

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.216
for a summer in 1970 and at that
point, I had just finished college.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.923
I had always wanted to be a writer
of fiction and I had started

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.856
to publish some short fiction and I
sent at his invitation a collection

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.476
of my stories to an
editor at the Viking Press.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.670
And I actually went in to meet
him and of course for somebody

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.433
who long dreamed of
being a published author,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.123
this was a very auspicious
occasion and this was in the days

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.796
of the 3 martini launches and
it was clear to me once I got

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.580
into this man's office that he
definitely had the 3 martinis.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.013
And-- but he asked me what were
you gonna do for the summer?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.980
And I told him, "Well, I'm going
to move to Washington and I worked

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.306
as it happens in the General
Services Administration,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.013
in the press office there,"
and he looked at me and went,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.080
"Washington, city on a swamp."

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.753
And of course once I got down
here and found that, you know,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.610
it was hot but, you know, not
quite as unbearable as he thought.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.396
I realized this was the,
you know, inevitable--

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.623
inevitable propensity of New
Yorkers to always believe

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.933
that life is worse elsewhere.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.240
In point of fact, there's
probably no place

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.933
in the world hotter than Manhattan.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.143
Once those buildings and streets,
all that concrete and, you know,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.863
and brick and steel heats
up, you know, it's like--

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.063
it's really like walking around
in a [inaudible] but anyway.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.266
Innocent, the book I am here to
talk about which was published

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.536
in May is the book that I said I
would never write and, you know,

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.936
Presumed Innocent was like
a lightning strike for me.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.276
It-- I had spent many
years as I recount.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.830
In 1970, I was somebody who wanted
to be a published author of fiction

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.583
and by the time 1986 rolled around,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.876
I still never published a novel
despite many, many attempts

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.650
and then all of the sudden,
you know, this book came

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.140
out of it was bought by the
movies, a number of publishers

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:18.486
as it happened that chased after the
manuscript and the book, you know,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.063
seemed to justify everybody's faith
and it performed wonderfully both

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:25.723
in the United States and around
the world and at that point,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.603
the clamor began for a
sequel to Presumed Innocent.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.446
And I swore in response
to that that, you know,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.953
I was never gonna do that.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:42.806
I would never write a sequel to
Presumed Innocent and I had a couple

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.766
of reasons for saying
that at that point.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.796
One was that I really did not want
to try to compete with myself.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.293
In its own small way, in its
own small place and time,

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:05.723
Presumed Innocent was kind of a
path breaking book in the sense

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.383
that it wrote about--
it talked about lawyers

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.336
in a slightly different
fashion than they've been talked

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.536
about in fiction before and,
you know, you can't step

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.213
in the same stream twice
and whatever was inventive

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.513
about that book couldn't
be invented a second time.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.980
So I knew that the inevitable
comparisons would damn whatever

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.330
came next.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.893
And more important to me was that
I really did not want to box myself

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.740
in as an author and I know that-- I
knew that if I wrote another novel

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.056
about Rusty Sabich and Rusty
Sabich's voice that, you know,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.966
I would be a sort of tieing myself
to that for all eternity and that

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.260
if I was going to try to do other
things as a writer and as a novelist

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.880
that I had to start doing them then.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.563
And so, you know, I've
written a number of novels now.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.713
All of them sat in the milieu of
the law but, you know, otherwise,

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.246
you know, different
in their approach.

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.706
Even though they're all set in, you
know, my fictional Kindle County

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.233
in the books and the whole orient
part and the last of those books

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.160
which was basically historical novel
called Ordinary Heroes set during

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.160
World War II came out in 2005.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.383
And this was a book that drew
itself from stories of my father.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.663
Some of them true,
some of them untrue.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.290
But it had ended up being
an immensely personal book

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.526
and when I finished it, I found
myself somewhat stuck and I began

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.710
in that mood for reasons

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.686
that I couldn't really
understand thinking more

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.646
and more often about Rusty Sabich.

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:15.083
&gt;&gt; While I was on book
tour for Ordinary Heroes,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.720
I wrote down a story idea and
I do this from time to time.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.743
I have a file on my
computer which is, you know,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.386
very ceremoniously titled story
ideas and I-- but I had this--

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.496
just this one-liner
that came to me and--

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.343
then the one-liner was a
man is sitting on a bed

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.823
in which the dead body
of a woman lies.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.453
And I don't exactly know where
this image came from it was sort

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.946
of a dream, a dreamscape
of some kind.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:04.560
There is a painting by Edward Hopper
called an Education in Philosophy

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.216
where a man is indeed
sitting on a bed

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.046
with a somewhat bereft expression
and behind him is the figure

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.886
of a sleeping woman
and there's certainly

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.270
in whatever way the painting
suggest that this is post coital

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.710
and so she's clearly not dead.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.013
But somehow my imagination
transformed it in that way.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.313
So I wrote down this one-liner
on a Post-it note and I went off

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.540
on my book tour for Ordinary Heroes.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.183
I came back and as I
said I was kind of stuck

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.096
about what I was gonna
do next and Rusty Sabich

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:43.743
for whatever reason impart probably

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:46.060
because I'd always made him
forbidden fruit in a way

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.253
and that was the one thing
I was never gonna do.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.530
I began to think about him again.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.556
And at that point, I was
contacted by the New York Times

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.810
and The Times then
and for several years

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.850
to follow had begun
publishing serialized fiction

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.283
in the Sunday Magazine.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.580
It ultimately proved I guess to
be an unsuccessful experiment

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.286
which was unfortunate because
it was the revival of a practice

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:21.793
that it certainly worked well in
other centuries and even today

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.326
in other parts of the world.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.153
But they wanted me to write one
of these serialized novellas

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.200
and I had always had an idea about a
judge who could not make up his mind

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.383
about a case and oddly that sort of
fired my thoughts about Rusty Sabich

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:51.916
when I told The Times, "Well, I
think I've got an idea for something

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.876
that will fit your parameters."

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.396
And because I have always kept
track of my characters, as I said,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.196
the novels are interrelated.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:01.700
They're all set in Kindle County.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.520
Characters tend to move from
the background to the foreground

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.346
and although there are
mountains of material

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.343
that hit the cutting
room floor, you know,

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.093
I tend to develop the back
stories not only of characters

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.053
in the book I'm writing but
sometimes in the character on the--

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:26.250
of the characters who
have appeared before.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.673
And for example, Rusty
Sabich had appeared

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.813
in the first draft of
the Burden of Proof.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.033
Sandy's-- Burden of Proof is
about Rusty's defense lawyer

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.620
and Presumed Innocent's Sandy Stern.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.803
And Sandy Stern has lost his wife
at the beginning of the novel

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.326
and remarries at the
end and the judge

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:48.236
who performed the wedding ceremony
at the end of the Burden of Proof

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:56.883
in the first draft turns out to
be Judge Rusty Sabich who has gone

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.260
on the bench after his time as the
acting prosecutor in Kindle County.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.870
And my editor and my then
publisher Raj Strauss [phonetic]

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.566
who ironically I just bumped
into on the street in front

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.413
of a hotel in which I'm staying.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.013
Raj looked at me and says,
this is too Jane Austen.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.330
You can't do that.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:22.650
And so it was cut but I knew Rusty
Sabich was on the bench and then

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.810
in the course of writing
Personal Injuries,

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.423
many years later there
was discussion and wonder

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.063
about the Appellate Court.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.096
I knew that Rusty Sabich was the
Chief Judge of the Appellate Court.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.563
And I called up my agent,
Gail Hochman, and I was just

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.086
in the early stages of noodling
around about this novella and I said

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:48.810
to Gail, I said, "You know,
I'm not committed to this."

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:56.370
I said, "But what would you think--
what would you think if this judge

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:01.286
who can't decide a
case is Rusty Sabich?"

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.886
There was this long silence at
the end of the phone and she said,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.880
"You've been telling me for 20
years you're not gonna write a novel

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.186
about Rusty Sabich again
and now you're gonna do this

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:15.740
in a novella that's gonna
be published, you know,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.753
serially in the New York Times?"

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.543
And, you know, and she was--
she's never been the kind of agent

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.980
who would tell me what
to do but I said,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.866
"I take it you don't
think that's a good idea."

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.140
And she really-- her main
objection was if you're gonna write

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.550
about Rusty Sabich again, it's got
to be on a less restricted venue

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.340
so that you can write about
him with sort of equal dignity

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.250
to what you've written before.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:46.996
And I recognized that that was a
good point and I put down the phone

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:52.630
and I looked at the Post-it note.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:56.340
And I realized that it was
Rusty Sabich who was the man

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.520
who was sitting on the bed.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:01.996
And if that was the case,

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.736
then of course the most
important decision was well then

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.993
who is the woman?

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.393
And it did not take
me long to conclude

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.753
that the woman would be Rusty's wife
from Presumed Innocent, Barbara,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.026
and for those of you who have read
Presumed Innocent or seen the movie,

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.373
I think you would sort of understand
that I regarded it as sort

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.596
of just beginning that Barbara
would begin the next book dead.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.353
But the question then of course
is well, how did she die?

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.540
And even more significantly,
what in the world are they doing

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.206
in a bed together 'cause
I knew it was gonna be

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.533
in real time, 22 years later.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.293
And you know, and I first thought
it was some kind of amorous reunion

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:07.140
and then I went back and re-read
the end of Presumed Innocent

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.436
and at the end of Presumed
Innocent, Rusty Sabich says that he

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.630
and Barbara "a sort of half-assed
way" have become reconciled

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.546
that they had already begun resuming
their marriage and so I said

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.273
to myself, "God, is it really
possible that they stay married?"

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.910
And suddenly I loved the idea.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.743
I knew exactly what I was
gonna be writing about which

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:41.183
in a few words is how some people
keep making the same mistakes

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.593
in their lives and, you know,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.656
and why they that happens
at a deeper level.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:51.816
So I think what I'll do is
I'm going to show you briefly

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.993
by reading what became of my little
Post-it note and then I will stop

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.196
and let the rest of the time
be occupied by your questions.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.113
So give me one second
to grab the book.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:06.510
[ Pause ]

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.456
&gt;&gt; This is the prologue to
Innocent as the sequel is named,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.563
and it is told in the voice of
Rusty and Barbara's son, Nathaniel,

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.276
called of course in older age Nat.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.993
A man is sitting on a bed.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.756
He is my father.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.423
The body of a woman
is beneath the covers.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.710
She was my mother.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.126
This is not really where the
story starts or how it ends

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.713
but it is the moment my mind returns
to the way I always see them.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.936
According to what my father will
soon tell me, he's been there

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.430
in that room for nearly 23 hours,
except for bathroom breaks.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.293
Yesterday, he awoke, as he does
most weekdays, at half past six

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.230
and could see the mortal change
as soon as he glanced back

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.723
at my mother, just as his
feet had found his sleepers.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:06.946
He rocked her shoulder,
touched her lips.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:08.993
He pumped the heel of his palm
against her sternum a few times,

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.700
but her skin was cool as clay.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.140
Her limbs were already moving
in a piece, like a mannequin's.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.156
He will tell me he sat then,
in a chair across from her.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200
He never cried.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.800
He thought, he will say.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.886
He does not know how long, except
that the sun had moved all the way

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.780
across the room when
he finally stood again

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:34.870
and began to tidy obsessively.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.536
He will say he put the three

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.460
or four books she was always
reading back on the shelf.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.356
He hung up the clothes she had
a habit of piling on the chaise

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:44.280
in front of her dressing mirror
then made the bed around her,

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:47.203
pulling the sheets tight,
folding the spread down evenly,

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:50.986
before laying her hands
out like a doll's

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.380
on the satin binding of the blanket.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.616
He threw out two of the flowers
that had wilted in the vase

00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.360
on her night table and
straightened the papers

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.353
and magazines on her desk.

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:03.193
&gt;&gt; He will tell me he called
no one, not even the paramedics

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.886
because he was certain she was dead,
and he sent only a one-line e-mail

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.673
to his assistant to say
he would not be at work.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.953
He did not answer the phone,
although it rang several times.

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.906
Almost an entire day would have
passed before he realizes he must

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:23.190
contact me.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.790
But how can she be dead?

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.190
I will ask.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.456
She was fine two nights
ago when we were together.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.323
After a freighted second,
I will tell my father,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.923
"She didn't kill herself."

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:35.923
No, he will agree at once.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.323
She wasn't in that kind of mood.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.523
It was her heart, he will say then.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.456
And it had to be her heart
and her blood pressure.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.523
Your grandfather died the same way.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:44.760
Are you going to call the police?

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.560
I will ask.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560
The police?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.226
He will say after a time.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.426
Why would I call the police?

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.760
Well, Christ, Dad.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.560
You're a judge.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.826
Isn't that what you do
when someone dies suddenly?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.893
I was crying by now.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:02.760
I didn't know when I had started.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.160
I was going to phone the
funeral home, he will tell me,

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.426
but I realized you might want
to see her before I did that.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.226
Well, shit, well, yes,
I want to see her.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.226
As it happens, the funeral home will
tell us to call our family doctor,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.346
and he in turn will summon the
coroner, who will send the police.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.730
It will become a long morning, and
then a longer afternoon with dozens

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.616
of people moving in
and out of the house.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:26.140
The coroner will not
arrive for nearly six hours.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.543
He will be alone with my mom's body

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:28.646
for only a minute before asking my
dad's permission to make an index

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.373
of all the medications she took.

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.936
An hour later, I will
pass my parents' bathroom

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:38.086
and see a cop standing slack-jawed
before the open medicine cabinet,

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.866
a pen and pad in hand.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.093
Jesus, he will declare.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:51.290
Bipolar disorder, I will tell
him when he finally notices me.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.416
She had to take a lot of pills.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:53.880
In time, he will simply sweep
the shelves clean and go off

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.560
with a garbage bag
containing all the bottles.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:01.410
In the meanwhile, every so often
another police officer will arrive

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.156
and ask my father about
what happened.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.946
He tells the story again and
again, always the same way.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:12.916
What was there to think
about all that time?

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.903
One cop will say.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:19.770
My dad can have a hard
way with his blue eyes.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:24.363
Something he probably learned from
his own father, a man he despised.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.166
Officer, are you married?

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.590
I am, Judge.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.456
Then you know what there
was to think about.

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:31.990
Life, he will answer.

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.590
Marriage. Her.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:36.056
The police will make him go
through his account three

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.590
or four more times-- how
he sat there and why.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.943
His response will never vary.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.093
He will answer every question
in his usual contained manner,

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.826
the stolid man of law who looks
out on life as an endless sea.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:51.816
He will tell them how
he moved each item.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.170
He will tell them where
he spent each hour.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.346
But he will not tell
anybody about the girl.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160
Thank you.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.660
[ Applause ]

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.400
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.203
&gt;&gt; I ask this question not
because of what happened recently

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.796
in the news but when I read the
book-- or I listened to the book.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.620
It seemed like there was
only one line or one phrase

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.800
that mentioned capital punishment
and I copied that down and had it

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:39.456
on a Post-it note for months and
months and months and of course,

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.483
now I can't find it and
quote it back to you.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.103
Would you comment on
capital punishment

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.183
as an attorney, as an author?

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:53.316
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I have
commented extensively

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.123
on capital punishment before.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.093
My friend, David Remnick, is here
speaking now or soon to speak

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.206
and years ago, I did an article
for David in the New Yorker

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.713
about my evolving feelings
about capital punishment

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:18.716
and I basically went from a
prosecutor who was willing to live

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:23.403
with it to a defense
lawyer and then a member

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.540
of the Death Penalty
Commission in Illinois

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.960
who just simply couldn't make
any sense of it and who felt

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.000
that the death penalty basically
rests on a faulty premise

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.353
that we can kind of create moral
order out of something that is bound

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.240
to function so haphazardly.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:44.513
And ultimately, I turned that essay
or lengthened it and turned it

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.960
into a book called Ultimate
Punishment but in a few short words,

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:52.343
I thought that my own mistake
about capital punishment

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.940
and the reason I was long
ambivalent about it was

00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:58.286
that I realized every now and
then that there were cases

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.486
like mass murders such as John
Wayne Gacy in Illinois who--

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.460
for whom what I regarded

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.193
as a coherent argument
could be made for execution.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:14.200
And in time, as I worked inside
the Capital Punishment System

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:18.250
as a lawyer and eventually
on this Reformed Commission,

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.083
I realized that was
the wrong question.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.720
The question we should be asking
is can we ever device a capital

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:34.566
punishment system that reaches
those supposedly right cases

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.756
without also sweeping
in the wrong cases?

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.493
Cases of people who are innocent
and I believe it's inevitable.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.746
Cases of people whose crimes while
awful do not reach the same level

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.746
of moral gravity as others
who get death sentenced

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.573
and these other people get
death sentenced as well.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.783
And after years of
thinking about this,

00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.256
I conclude that the answer
to that question is no.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.723
The law just simply
cannot sift that fine.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.260
And if we have a death penalty
then we have to be content to say

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.163
that every now and then the
innocent will be sentenced

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.983
to death far more often that
that we will sentence people

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.786
to death whose punishment

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.996
in no relative sentence
has any equality to it.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.823
And for that reason, I became an
opponent of capital punishment

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:34.386
and I remain an opponent
of capital punishment.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.406
Nothing has changed my mind.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040
[ Applause ]

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.490
&gt;&gt; Sir?

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:47.223
&gt;&gt; Your first book One L, you
write about your experience

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:48.296
with the Harvard Law School
generally finding it very

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.150
anxiety-ridden, competitive,
and not much fun.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.440
After 33 years, have you done
any rethinking of it to help me

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.143
after 51 years maybe to
reformulate my thoughts?

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040
[ Laughter ]

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.106
&gt;&gt; Well, it's-- it's a timely
question for me because One L is

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.903
about to be re-issued by its
original paperback publisher

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.040
after a long happy life
in the Hatchet family.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.626
It's now going back to
_____ 0:27:25 Penguin

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.710
and I've done a new
afterwork for the book.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:32.996
And I confess there that legal
education at least to my eye based

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:38.363
in small part on the experience
of my own daughter who was--

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:38.793
who went through law
school at Michigan

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.340
and didn't have a severe a
time as I did, but mostly based

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:45.990
on frequent visits back
to Harvard Law School.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:52.090
I think Elena Kagan who I hope and
expect to become a great justice

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:53.670
of the Supreme Court but she
also instituted a lot of reforms

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.990
at Harvard Law School and I
made it a much more reasonable

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:00.803
and humane place.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:05.203
So I don't think I'd have
exactly the same experiences

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.243
but that being said most of--

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:12.736
One L is basically the diary of
an abashed neurotic [laughter]

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:17.390
and it has-- I think part of its
long life is that it has served

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.933
as an enduring assurance
to law students everywhere

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:23.470
that at least one person
went through the first year

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:29.810
of law school feeling crazier
than they do and so and it--

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:31.973
I suppose it will always,
you know, stand for that.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:34.986
&gt;&gt; I would say it was a dead heap.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.453
The dean at the orientation session
the first thing he said is there are

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.896
no glee clubs here.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.133
That would have been a great
title maybe, better than One L.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.060
[ Laughter ]

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:49.060
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.060
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.593
&gt;&gt; Two quick questions.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:55.860
How did you come up with the
idea of the timeline in front

00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:57.793
of the chapters because I wish
every book that moved back

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.956
and forth had that, it just made
it so much easier to pick to follow

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.926
and secondly, will there be
a sequel, sequel to Innocent

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.600
because I don't think
Nat's relationship

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.733
with I'll say the girl
can remain that way

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:09.586
with the secret hanging
over their heads?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.726
&gt;&gt; Well as to the second question,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.386
I really have learned
never to say never.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.260
Oddly, it's more Rusty
than Nat and Anna

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.606
that interest me right
now but who knows.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.116
The timeline was my
idea and my editor

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.213
at Grand Central, Deb
Futter, hated it.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.573
And she kept striking it out
as I submitted different drafts

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.320
of the manuscript.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.320
For those of you who that
haven't read the novel,

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:45.786
it does indeed go back
and forth in time.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.786
It starts as it does
with Barbara's death

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.573
and then goes backwards
to the year before that.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:59.493
And I just thought, you know,
let's help the reader our here

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.000
to understand where
this novel is going.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.420
And Deb didn't like it and I get
e-mails every week from readers

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.690
who say what a wonderful idea and
I, of course, since, you know,

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.373
since I'm a snotty little guy,
I forward all of them to Deb.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.940
Yes, sir.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.323
&gt;&gt; Hi. Can you talk a little bit
about how you write as far as,

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.823
you know, do you use an outline.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:32.556
You know, when do you
have a draft complete?

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.490
How much rewriting do you do
and just any other approaches

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.090
that you found that served you well?

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:41.890
&gt;&gt; I really resumed my career as
a writer of fiction after I got

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:43.346
out of law school by writing on
the morning commuter train and at

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.010
that point in time, I had only
like 20-30 minutes a day to write

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.283
and I found that you don't
have any time to warm

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.520
up when it's 20 or 30 minutes.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.986
So I just wrote whatever had come
to mind the prior day as something

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.643
that I thought might
be good in the novel.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.110
And it didn't matter where
it was in the story line.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:10.220
I just wrote it down whether
it's a snatch of dialogue,

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.893
a character description, a
piece of character history.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:17.683
It didn't matter.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:21.083
And the fact is I still
write that way.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.323
For about a year, I let
myself kind of wander

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:29.096
around in a book allowing the
characters to sort of, you know,

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:33.803
create slowly overtime, their
situations, to spell themselves out,

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.040
like just talking about Innocent.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.086
If Rusty and Barbara were still
married then one of the stuff,

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:43.690
the kinds of things I would write
originally would be, you know,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:51.010
well what are the terms of this
marriage trying to imagine it

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.676
and you know, that's
where the conclusion came.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.130
Well she had to have been--

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.660
she had to have been diagnosed

00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.660
with a diagnosable mental
disorder that's part

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:01.126
of the reason that
he stayed with her.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:07.126
And that's the kind of thing I mean
about feeling my way along and--

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:08.800
but there's no particular order and
then after a year, I write a draft

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.833
and I show that to agents
and family and editor.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:17.976
And, you know, I go from there.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.976
There are usually about
four to five drafts so.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:23.480
That's the-- that's
the long way I process.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.186
I'd never outlined.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.520
I could probably write
much more quickly

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.733
if I force myself to outline.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:34.910
The one exception is Limitations
that little novella I did

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:42.290
for the Times and as much as
I like things in Limitations,

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.470
I would have loved
to have had more time

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.403
and a little more chaos
in my own head.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.003
So I went right back
to my standard way

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.480
of operating after I finished it.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.400
Thank you.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.066
How are we doing on time?

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:58.800
I have a little time left, I'm told.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400
Sir?

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:02.733
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like the timeline a lot.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:04.443
I didn't read Presumed Innocent.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:10.490
By the way, I came to your novels
by a lawyer friend of mine,

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.783
who is very literary who
said you're much better

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.290
than John Grisham, so [laughter].

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.560
This may be too sillly--

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.190
&gt;&gt; You may want to pick that
microphone up a little bit

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.606
so that you're speaking-- You may
wanna repeat your prior remark.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320
[ Laughter ]

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.230
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I don't know.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.976
I wouldn't describe it as a flaw but
having not read Presumed Innocent,

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.616
Barbara comes out as a sympathetic
character to me in most of the novel

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.266
and in the end, she just comes
off as a prescription drug addict.

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.073
You know, her-- for those who
didn't read it, her husband

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.193
and her son have sex-- had an
affair with the same woman.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.603
&gt;&gt; Well, let's not tell too much to
the people here who haven't read it.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:54.413
There's gonna be a question
at the end of this though.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.073
&gt;&gt; If my perception
is right then she kind

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.606
of got what she deserves
she was just [inaudible].

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:01.950
Or maybe do we have
to read the book.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:08.363
&gt;&gt; Well, I have to say that, you
know, I never say what the ending

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.506
of Presumed Innocent was in
Innocent because it turns

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.660
out there's another generation
of readers who haven't--

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.473
don't have the same kind of level of
familiarity with Presumed Innocent.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.466
I've been delighted by the number
who have read Innocent first

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.413
and gone back to Presumed
Innocent but I thought

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:33.596
without elaborating too much on this
that one of the things I felt best

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:40.623
about was that by the time I
reached the end of Innocent,

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.186
I actually felt some
sympathy for Barbara

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.166
and found considerable nobility
in her at the end of the book.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.736
You know, people can make up their
own lines for themselves but anyway,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.523
I appreciate the question.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:02.790
Thank you.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.856
&gt;&gt; Hi. Earlier, you were speaking
about a judge who can't make

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.740
up his mind so I guess my question
is in the lives of your characters,

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.373
you're judge, jury,
bailiff, god in that way.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.540
I'm a new fan, just finished reading
Pleading Guilty and I'm wondering

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.890
without talking about the ending,

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:21.416
how you came to that
particular ending

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:23.673
and did you entertain different
ideas, different things--

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.693
&gt;&gt; The ending of Pleading
Guilty, you are trying to mean?

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.670
Yeah. Yeah.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.670
I entertained different ideas.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:35.336
You know, the story
of Pleading Guilty is

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:37.403
that after I finished
the Burden of Proof,

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:39.006
I began the novel that's now
called the Laws of Our Fathers

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.600
and I was a great reader of Norman
Mailer especially his nonfiction

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.016
and one of the remarks
he makes in Cannibals

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:50.976
and Christians is the terrible
thing about being a novelist is

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.483
that you can make a drastic mistake

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.550
and not discover that
for six months.

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.783
And in the course of writing my way
along in the Laws of Our Fathers,

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.066
I made that kind of mistake.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.666
I did something in terms of plot
that was just never ever gonna work

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.990
and so I stopped and
to amuse myself,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:26.100
I decided I'd write this story about
this kind of broken down former cop,

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.773
a fish out of water,
in a big law firm.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.586
And principally as a way to
sort of share my ironic view

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:37.470
of what was going on in the
practice of law and, you know,

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.250


00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:45.510
I find Mack Malloy to
be a tremendous wise guy

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.980
but as always happens
with me once I get

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:49.946
to know the character then I decide
that something serious is going on.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.020
And obviously the end
of Pleading Guilty

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.766
and we won't give it away is
pretty gloomy but I thought

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:03.496
that I did think it fit the novel.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.583
I thought all in all
this was not a situation

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:12.396
that was ever intended
for happy endings.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.706
So-- We have time for one more.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:19.500
We're in overtime.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.833
Alright, last question.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:23.503
Go. I'll be-- You'll be
quick and I'll be quick.

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.956
&gt;&gt; Okay. Scott, can you tell us
about how the effects of the economy

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:29.596
and recession have had on the legal
profession, changes in compensation

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.496
from billable hours to
flat rate [laughter]?

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:39.003
How does that change how
you depict your characters

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.746
so for the 20 years you've
been writing about law?

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.793
&gt;&gt; You know, I don't know yet
because I haven't had a chance

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.276
to write about the
contemporary legal environment.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:59.536
There's a little bit of reference
to it and in Innocent where one

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:00.363
of the characters is working as
an associate in big law firms says

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.826
that she suddenly sees her
future as being, you know,

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:06.813
one where she was gonna get
all her litigation experience

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.413
in bankruptcy court.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.080


00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:18.316
Lawyers in a strata have had it
very, very good in this county

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.086
for several decades and you know,
it's hard at this point to believe

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.356
that it's ever gonna quite
go back to what it was.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.276
Those kinds of predictions though
inevitably end up proving false

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.213
but I know a lot of people

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.680
in the profession don't quite see
it coming back in the same way

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.796
but I will say to you
what was said to me

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.540
when I began the practice of law.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.823
Clients will always
find a good lawyer.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.946
It will always happen.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:01.346
One of the great, great things
about the practice of law is

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.953
that in its own way, it's
extraordinarily meritocratic

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:09.100
and good lawyers who work
hard and who are dedicated

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.780
to their clients tend to
be rewarded in that system.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:14.156
So, with that closing piece
of advice, I thank everybody

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:17.663
who attended the book
fair for being here today.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.103
Thank you very much.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:24.503
This is a wonderful event.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:25.826
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
