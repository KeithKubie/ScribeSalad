the suffering it's not neutral right
it's<00:00:53.500><c> negative</c><00:00:53.949><c> so</c><00:00:54.750><c> now</c><00:00:55.750><c> the</c><00:00:55.809><c> problem</c><00:00:56.260><c> with</c>

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
having to aim up is that that produces a

having to aim up is that that produces a

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 align:start position:0%
the idea would be there's some step you

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 align:start position:0%
could take that you would take that

could take that you would take that

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 align:start position:0%
would make today or tomorrow
 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.710 align:start position:0%
would make today or tomorrow

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.869 align:start position:0%
fractionally better than yesterday right
and<00:03:43.900><c> then</c><00:03:43.989><c> you</c><00:03:44.109><c> can</c><00:03:44.260><c> iterate</c><00:03:44.410><c> that</c><00:03:44.829><c> and</c><00:03:45.129><c> that's</c>

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 align:start position:0%
and then you can iterate that and that's
 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.970 align:start position:0%
and then you can iterate that and that's

actually unbelievably powerful you you
 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.610 align:start position:0%

let's<00:03:51.310><c> say</c><00:03:51.459><c> very</c><00:03:51.699><c> very</c><00:03:51.910><c> rapidly</c><00:03:52.299><c> if</c><00:03:52.480><c> you</c><00:03:52.599><c> do</c>

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
let's say very very rapidly if you do
 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
let's say very very rapidly if you do
that<00:03:52.900><c> yeah</c><00:03:53.290><c> well</c><00:03:53.440><c> so</c><00:03:53.560><c> there's</c><00:03:53.769><c> real</c><00:03:53.980><c> utility</c>

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 align:start position:0%
that yeah well so there's real utility
 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
that yeah well so there's real utility
and<00:03:54.760><c> incremental</c><00:03:55.329><c> progress</c><00:03:55.510><c> and</c><00:03:56.019><c> you</c><00:03:56.769><c> don't</c>

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 align:start position:0%
and incremental progress and you don't
 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.589 align:start position:0%
and incremental progress and you don't
have<00:03:57.129><c> to</c><00:03:57.340><c> improve</c><00:03:57.639><c> your</c><00:03:57.790><c> life</c><00:03:57.940><c> much</c><00:03:58.299><c> in</c>

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
have to improve your life much in

have to improve your life much in

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 align:start position:0%
of compounding interest you know you
 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.449 align:start position:0%
of compounding interest you know you
make<00:04:03.099><c> one</c><00:04:03.370><c> thing</c><00:04:03.609><c> slightly</c><00:04:03.879><c> better</c><00:04:04.239><c> and</c><00:04:04.540><c> that</c>

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 align:start position:0%
make one thing slightly better and that
 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
make one thing slightly better and that
increases<00:04:06.459><c> the</c><00:04:06.489><c> probability</c><00:04:06.819><c> that</c><00:04:07.299><c> you'll</c>

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 align:start position:0%
increases the probability that you'll
 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
increases the probability that you'll
make<00:04:07.720><c> the</c><00:04:07.930><c> next</c><00:04:08.139><c> thing</c><00:04:08.440><c> slightly</c><00:04:08.769><c> better</c><00:04:09.129><c> as</c>

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 align:start position:0%
make the next thing slightly better as
 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
make the next thing slightly better as
well<00:04:09.639><c> as</c><00:04:09.790><c> having</c><00:04:10.000><c> its</c><00:04:10.389><c> positive</c><00:04:10.900><c> side</c><00:04:11.169><c> effects</c>

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 align:start position:0%
well as having its positive side effects
 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
well as having its positive side effects
and<00:04:11.799><c> so</c><00:04:12.430><c> if</c><00:04:12.639><c> you</c><00:04:12.790><c> even</c><00:04:13.419><c> if</c><00:04:13.540><c> you</c><00:04:13.629><c> make</c><00:04:13.780><c> small</c>

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 align:start position:0%
and so if you even if you make small
 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.569 align:start position:0%
and so if you even if you make small
steps<00:04:14.379><c> forward</c><00:04:14.829><c> and</c><00:04:14.949><c> you</c><00:04:15.040><c> do</c><00:04:15.220><c> that</c><00:04:15.400><c> regularly</c>

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 align:start position:0%

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
steps forward and you do that regularly
that<00:04:16.449><c> can</c><00:04:16.630><c> turn</c><00:04:16.750><c> your</c><00:04:16.930><c> life</c><00:04:17.139><c> around</c><00:04:17.260><c> very</c>

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 align:start position:0%
that can turn your life around very
 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.039 align:start position:0%
that can turn your life around very

the alternative
 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.580 align:start position:0%

so<00:04:30.270><c> it's</c><00:04:31.270><c> better</c><00:04:31.509><c> and</c><00:04:31.840><c> it</c><00:04:32.110><c> keeps</c><00:04:32.319><c> you</c><00:04:32.469><c> out</c><00:04:32.499><c> of</c>

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 align:start position:0%
so it's better and it keeps you out of
