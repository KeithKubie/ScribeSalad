- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
Bipedal, naked, large-brained, long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.680
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.540
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:11.360
to exchange insights on who we are and how
we got here, an exploration made possible

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.526
by the generosity of humans like you.

- [Steven] Where did we come from and how
did we get here? Those are important

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.360
questions. The best answer that I can give
you is I came from North Carolina, and I'm

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.620
pretty sure it was Delta 1833 last night.
But on behalf of my co-chair, Dr. Phillip

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.460
Rightmire, and me, I would like to
welcome you to this symposium on the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.810
origin of the genus Homo. There is
probably no transition in human

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.810
evolutionary history which is as
significant as the origin of the genus

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.520
Homo. Prior to about two million years
ago, the fossil record tells us that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.230
Africa was largely populated, not
completely populated, but largely

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.960
populated with Australopiths. After about
two million, the Australopiths are largely

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.770
gone and we have a diverse array of early
members of our genus, and very shortly

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.590
after that, we begin to find Homo erectus.
And with Homo erectus, we have a creature

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.360
which is in every way different from the
Australopiths, larger in body size, a

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.980
different body shape, a larger brain,
adaptations for more efficient

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.550
long-distance walking and running,
possibly adaptations in the shoulder for

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.860
being able to throw with speed. We see a
shift in dietary ecology, more consumption

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.360
of animal tissues, and that's associated
with a much greater dependence on stone

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.750
tool use. There are changes in energetics.
There's changes in thermal regulation.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.330
There are likely to be changes in social
organization, reproductive strategies,

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.770
life history. I cannot overstate the
importance of this transition in human

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.620
evolutionary history. But as important as
this is, it is equally mysterious and

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.950
frustrating to those of us who study it.
The fossil record has been fairly scrappy,

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.000
and the fossils that we do recover are
diverse.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.910
- And it's very, very difficult to
understand what to make of them. So there

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.900
are major questions which still exist.
When did the genus Homo originate? Where

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.410
did it originate? From whom did it come?
Where did Homo erectus come from? What

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.380
were the evolutionary processes? What were
the environmental conditions, the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.450
ecological circumstances? What was the
genetic background, the molecular

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.890
background? What things led to these sort
of profound changes that we see in human

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:39.740
anatomy, human physiology, human behavior,
human ecology? It's a wonderfully rich

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.440
area. There have been remarkable fossil
discoveries made in the last decade, or

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.720
so. But, with every new discovery, in some
cases it clarifies for us, but more often

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.770
than not, it simply adds more depth and
texture to the mysteries that surround the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.010
origin of the genus Homo. I'm really
excited about this workshop today because

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.710
we have brought together some of the
leading scholars that work in this area

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.400
and I think it's going to prove to be a
very, very interesting and very rewarding

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.078
workshop on the origin of the genus Homo.
