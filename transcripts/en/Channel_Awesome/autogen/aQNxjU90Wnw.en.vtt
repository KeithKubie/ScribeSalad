00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.140
well, im sure glad Tim and I stopped by for the studio auction, for 'OneStepCamp.org'. ...Plug

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.040
Well, I'm glad you shelled out all that exposition

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.740
Yeah, but why are we all in Black and White?

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.420
Oh, the colour was the first thing to go

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.180
Those two paid top dollar for it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.980
Come Lurkey!  We're going to put the colour back in the 'Last Airebender' movie!

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.300
Number 333, a DVD in peices

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.760
Some of you may recall, the strange film of, The Phantom of the Opera

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.480
[Shock gasp]

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.840
The Phantom of the Opera!?

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.160
Wasn't that supposed to be the grand adaptation of the epic Broadway musical?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.240
Well yeah, brought to you by Joel Schumacher

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.680
The bat credit card guy?

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.400
[gun shot from off-screen]

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.940
20! It deserves a Nostalgia Critic review

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.100
30! Shark Jumping would do it better!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.900
40! You don't even review movies

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.720
50! Your face looks weird when you smile

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.260
I just thought we were throwing out random insults

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.700
60! It betrayed everything that was good about the musical

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.880
70! It betrayed everything that was good about the book!

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.180
Somebody actually read the book?

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.440
Need I remind you that copyright around here

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.680
has been more tighter than this review series' budget

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.800
Doing a copyrighted movie, with copyrighted songs

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.520
might not be the best idea

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.820
oh, yeah

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.860
Well, Webber already stole from Pucinni

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.360
Maybe we can find a way to review it, despite all that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.400
Well then, perhaps we may frighten way the joke of so many years ago

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.780
with a little

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.580

[Fandumb music plays]

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.160
The Phantom of the Opera was novel in 1909

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.760
by French  author, Gaston Leroux

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.140
well its not the best novel  in the world

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.000
it was still interesting and told in a unique way for the time period

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.180
kind of a bio-graphic recap

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.040
of falsified true events

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.640
you know, like in old school, This Spinal Tap

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.760
It follows the deformed phantom who lives in the sewers of an opera house

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.460
he's secretly giving voice lessons to a young ingenue

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.740
named, Christine Daae

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.060
and like any creepy teacher, the Phantom is also attracted to her

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.020
The morale of the story is about the beauty beneath the ugliness

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.480
a sentiment shared in many French stories like

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.680
Beauty and the Beast and Hunchback of Notre Dame

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.460
But, its not just about the music being beautiful but it's also about the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.340
power of compassion and empathy

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.740
he suffers from his bad choices, while also being redeemed becasue of his good ones

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.540
The story was so timeless that they made film after film about and in 1986

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.240
Andrew Llyod Webber turned it into a smash Broadway Musical

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.500
so big that people were waiting for a movie to come about it

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.480
Webber and Schumacher first wrote the script all the way back in 1989

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.220
with original Broadway cast members Michael Crawford Sarah Brightman, set to star

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.080
but after a tough divorce between Webber and Brightman the movie

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.800
got delayed delayed util they just said, screw it, lets just throw in the guy from 300

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.800
which is what we're reviewing today

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.300
[Glass Smashing]

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.900
Or atleast trying to

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.600
What is it now, Hyper!

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.840
The only reason I agreed to play Carlotta is becuase I thought we were gonnna get a love scene

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960
Carlotta's the singer who's jealous of Christine

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.020
she doesn't have any love scenes!

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.560
Why else would you cast me as the ego-centric, primadonna character then!

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.400
No hable ingles

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.220

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.740
Whoa, whoa! Hyper fan girl you cant leave!

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.240
you score high in the 12 to 29 demographic

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.620
Plus with a subset of 65 to 70 year olds, we'd rather not talk about

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.980
I don't care I'm leaving

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.720
[Both] No no no no no

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.220
Great! Now whos gonna do the opening number?

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.300
Perhaps I can be of some assistance

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.960
Who are you?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.840
My name is Aunt Despair  and I've got a special connection with the studio

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.940
No you don't

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.260
I represent the fandumb ghost who has lived here for years

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.260
No he hasn't

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.580
He sends you, a message

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.700
I doubt that

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.880
He welcomes you to his production

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.020
Lady, I'd fire you if you worked here but you don't, so I'm just gonna call the cops

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.880
Fine, he just recommends that you replace Hyper Fan Girl with Beth

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.040
A chorus reviewer?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.520
Eh, why not?

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.480
It'll just be like when Christine replaced Carlotta in the movie

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.880
Do you really have to spell that out?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.720
You'd be surprised

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.760
[music starts to play]

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.520
[Music becomes grander]

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.780
Ah, Ah! Bravo!

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.960
That was amazingly adequate

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.120
Ya hear that?

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.640
That's your remarkably passable girlfriend

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.840
Honey, that was amazing!

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.720
how did you get so phenomally okay?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.660
Well, I literaaly had a celestial being teaching me how to sing

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.340
Alright

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.160
uh, that doesn't seem weird to you?

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.180
Nope!

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.260
Does it charge alot?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.480
No, totaly Pro-bono

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.100
Alright then

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.780
I guess if Christine in the movie can fall for a super natural entity

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.640
like a man pretending to be the angelic ghost of her father

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.820
then anything's believable

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.700
Well the funny thing is, is that this could work in some respects

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.940
in the book the phantom studied magicians and illusionists

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.500
to convince her, he wasn't human

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.580
but in the play and movie, a lot of this illusions just wouldn't look right

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.040
like mannequins that change facial expression

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.540
candles with moveable arms

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.660
and even shooting literal fireballs out of his hands

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.220
what is he, a super Saiyan?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.480
hey, hey Beth

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.700
way to be phenomenally serviceable

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.480
hey, we were gonna go have a

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.460
god laugh by watching some of the movie, you wanna come with?

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.960
yeah

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.760
alright, good job Beth

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.720
not, not great just...

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.220
good

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.800
[laughing]

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.800
can you beleive the singing choices that they made in this?

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.180
And here comes the laugh riot himself

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.060
Gerard Butler

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.940
as the Phantom

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.000
[laughing off-screen]

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.840
he never even sang before!

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.720
And it shows!

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.260
It's no surpirse Butler was at the bottom

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.480
of a long list of actors in line to play the Phantom

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.860
this includes, John Travolta, Antonio Banderas

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.800
Meatloaf

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.840
Matthew Mcconaughey!

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.420
They even looked at Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.160
I...guess that turned out well...

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.440
But then Schumacher saw Gerard Butler

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.680
in Dracula 2000

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.960
and thought, yes

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.860
that's the guy with no professional signing experience

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.060
who should star in my musical

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.800
and he was never grossly miscast again

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.660
The phantom is supposed to be a

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.420
dark, tormented creature who can teach you to sing like an Angel

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.480
Boom!

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.180
A Spartan jock

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.180
who signs like sandpapper

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.560
on an active machine gun

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.600
This is, this is fun what we're doing

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.320
I like this

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.220
um..

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.640
...open the door

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.080
yeah thats right

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.760
turn the knob

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.520
you've done this a million times

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.960
very good, push don't pull

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.020
that's a common mistake

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.700
don't forget to close it behind you

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.200
you weren't raised in a barn

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.240
there you go

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.380
oh! good god it smells terrible down here

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.580
what is that?

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.860
Well it's a sewer what do you expect?

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.360
It kinda sucks out the romance!

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.600
What, if the audience can't smell it

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.660
you can't smell it!

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.340
put your hand down

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.340
Wait, you signing verbally or mentally?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.420
you keep going back and forth

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.400
ugh, come on

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:33.900

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.280
(to self) It's Scottish doing French doing English

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.420
sing, marginally well

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.200
That's actually a little too good

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.720
No! you sound interested in what you;re signing

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.460
don't do that

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.120
More breathing

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.000
more gasping

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.160
have the lungs of an asthmatic

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.720
Stop!

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.100
you sound like a person people would actually

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.420
pay money to listen to

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.920
remember your training!

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.260
Sing like me!

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.840
What was that?

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.360
Sorry! My insticts took over

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.440
or that of my years of actual experience

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.220
from someone who doesn't sound

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.300
like a dying moose

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:00.800
Hey!

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.460
Ya gonna feed me or what?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.880
Ugh, yes yes

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.920
i will feed you soon

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.340
Yeah, was that a horse

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.760
did I ride on a horse?

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.940
Not that you cared!

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.500
do you know how hard it is to raise a  horse in the sewer?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.320
But it was done in the movie

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.180
so I am bound to it

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.320
yeah but it didnt make sense in the movie either

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.700
The Phantom puts Christine on a horse

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:23.260
and honest to god, horse in the sewers

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.640
and carries her for only like a few steps

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.700
that I'm pretty sure she could have walked by herself

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.680

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.480
Why does he keep a horse?

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.920
How the hell did the horse attain the strength

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.840
to carry a human being, if he breathed

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.120
Yeah sure it was "in the book"

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.460
but Andrew Llyod Webber took a lot

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.600
out for the musical version

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.540
and this was just about the worst thing they could have put back into the movie

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.780
Well, have ever considered the possibility that I'm

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.700

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.700
What do you mean?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.500
yeah come on this is pretty hot

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.260
The Phantom's seductive nature wasn't

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.260
from physical strength

or,  three quarters good looks on his face

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.360
it came from his passion for music and his confidence as an artist

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.040
and while his dominace and control

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.980
normally came through psychological manipulation

especially when the movie has a set up that supports it so little

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.780
You want us to confess our love for another

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.420
after we just watched a man die?

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.160
Sure!

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.020
they did in the movie

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.420
They see a guy hang

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.440
They escape to the roof

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.320
They start making out

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.820
it's a totally natural thing to do

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.340
oh, okay

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.060
if it's natural

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.160
it is trust me

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.640
murder is a total aphrodisiac

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.840
now, start the music

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.760
I can't

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.720
Yeah, those chunks of Chester are distracting

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.280
clean up!

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.280
No, I mean

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.800
I...I can't sing this

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.640
You're a wonderful singer

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.220
snugglebottom

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.380
Thanks little dumpling

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.600
but that's not what I'm talking about

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.980
I'm too good to sing this crap

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.560
In the Phantom movie

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.460
a bunch of people who couldn't carry a tune

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.120
were allowed to record their own vocals

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.560
but they insisted on dubbing over Minnie Driver

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.600
who actually can sing

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.860
so if she was too good to sing that crap

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.940
I'm too good to sing this crap

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.040
Okay, that's bullshit

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.820
if they dubbed the people who can sing

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.820
then don't dub the people who can't

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.160
we are not dubbing anyone in this musical at all!

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.680
Now

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.340
start singing with your natural voice

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.940
[with the critics voice]

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:20.240
Cut!

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:20.940
beautiful

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.760
and it is now currently six months later

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:23.980
Wait it is?

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.700
Oh yeah

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.300
in the play there's a narration to show the passage of time

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.700
but in the movie it's an incredibly sloppy transition

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.060
look! you're even engaged now!

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.520
oh yeah, so I am

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.040
care for a painful analogy for what's happening in the show

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.360
as well as our lives?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.880
Does anybody else thinks it odd

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.020
that we're signing about how colorful everything is

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.780
and the only color is faded black and urine yellow?

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.880
hey,  I'm just amazed at how lame that guys red death mask is

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.440
Hey buddy!

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.300
nice dollar store costume!

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.140
red death is supposed to be like this extravagant outfit

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.460
you look like Zorro

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.540
the gay blade stunt double

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.120
[fandom music plays]

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.600
Organ music

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.880
must be the fandom yo!

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:24.880
It is

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.020
I have written you a new musical to perform

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.780
a self inserted fanfaiction

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.740
that is destined to become a classic!

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.620
It is the sequel to the Phantom of the opera

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.220
everybody has always wanted

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.640
what if the Phantom and Christine had sex the night before the wedding

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.180
and Raoul is a drunk broke gambler now

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.520
and the Phantom is super succesful

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.440
and hosts a carnival

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.560
and Christine totally still loves him

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.300
and her ten year old son

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.420
is actually the Phantoms son

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.640
and when she dies in the end

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.960
the son goes to live with the Phantom forever

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.180
I'd say you've been reading Hyper Fan girls live journal for too long

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.740
This review is still mine

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.800
you will sing for me

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.520
Okay just don't sing for us!

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.440
Trap door

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.560
I'm not sure why we had that installed

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.320
Oh great, now we have to do a sequel

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.740
to that crappy musical

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.120
Wait

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.120
you didn't like the stage play?

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.960
No, I mean its not bad

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.420
it doesn't represent the original story

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:21.340
it misses the point

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.500
on lots of occasions

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.600
I don't know what to say

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.260
like every Phantom fan

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.620
the idea of someone not like the show is inconceivable to me

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.760
You do know it wasn't a critical hit when it came out right?

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.480
the only reason it ran for 30 years

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.920
is because Rudy Giuliani murdered all the homeless

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.340
and slack jaw rubson ohio suddenly weren't afraid to go to Times Square anymore

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.320
Away with you!

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.360
Wait Beth, where are you going?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.300
Where all sappy dramatic musicals lead

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:03.580
Why does no-one remember what an amazing novel you were?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.700
Sorry?

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:07.400
oh, nothing

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.960
just remarking on something pretty close to me

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.240
how watching it fade is kinda like losing a friend

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.320
Yeah,

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:17.260
I know what you're talking about

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.980
And I thought my problems were bad

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.840
Yes yes, boo hoo

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.800
Beth, after all I've done for you

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.460
tell me your hatred for the musical is not true

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.740
I mean it's okay

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.260
but it took out the best parts of the book

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.380
and stupid  80's synth cheese

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.480
Damn you!

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.600
I know Beth

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.740
the movie can be pretty tough to get through

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.080
No, I was talking about the play

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.360
I know, the movie

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.040
that's what I said

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.900
I've come to grips with it

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960
no, I'm talking about

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.700
Let me live in my denial

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.200
Okay

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:40.980
You!

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.820
you betrayed me

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.500
I'm fed up with this world

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.960
now I will show you the true meaning of pain

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.460
Ha Hey, yeah!

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.800
not so tough are yah

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.180
hey, word of advice jackass

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.340
the Phantom is not a sword fighter

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:55.660
he's an illusionist

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.820
literal smoke and mirrors to trick people

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.320
where the hell does a guy in a sewere

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.000
even learn sword fighting?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.600
The horse! Of course

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.260
everyone knows they're master swordsman!

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:06.380
why else would you keep one around?

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.540
en garde ass munch

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.820
well you're about to be put out of your misery

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.600
No Critic

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.460
not like this

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:14.900
yeah, yeah

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.640
yeah I think like this

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.020
We have to do it, like in the movie

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.540
even though we have him cornered

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.480
and can end the blood shed right now

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.900
we have to perform his magical play

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.700
setting up a trap to catch him later

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.720
I have a horse pointing a sword at me right now

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.460
and that makes more sense than anything you just said

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:30.320
Just do it

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:31.900
Fine

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.800
but if a cast member and or building

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.160
gets destroyed I'm blaming you

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.200
I have an idea

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.620
Alright, lets wrap up this stinker

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:43.760
Wait, I'm confused

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.220
why am I wearing the mask now?

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.780
Becasue in this version, Raoul is the real monster

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.820
so, we're having him wear the mask instead

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.520
Then how come its jut a little bit of paint under here?

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.520
Oh, that's from the movie!

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.180
But in every version of the story, the Phantom is horribly deformed

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.400
usually in really creative and distinct ways

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.960
how come this version looks like a bad sun burn?

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.520
Because the Phantom is visually sexy now

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:05.900
not psychologically

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.800
It's no worse than giving him a carnival freak show backstory

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.280
okay, lets begin the song with Tim

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.480
Phantom, what are you dong?

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:13.980
I...

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.600
I do not know no Phantom

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.860
I am Tim whatever my last name is!

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.260
It's so obviously you

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.500
you just wanna do a love scene in front of the world with

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.740
what the hell is going on here?

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.740
why are there two Fandumbs?

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.120
There's only one original Phantom around here

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:30.900
oh my God

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.400
is that

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.900
Michael Crawford!

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:33.900
Yes

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.180
The young lady

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.220
alerted me that my honor was being threatened

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:39.940
okay, way to go Hyper

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.140
This is absurd

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.000
Alright Crawford

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.700
show that no talent hack, what real singing is!

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.780
Were we knocked out or something?

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.440
You'll wish you'd stayed that way

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.420
You know

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.680
this guy sounds pretty silly too

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.360
You think!

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:10.700
You know

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.600
maybe this play isn't as

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.560
flawless as I remember it

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.300
I gotta admit

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.820
only time I believe the chemistry

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:32.240
My mask!

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:34.540
ah ha, now we'll find who the Fandumb really is!

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.640
I got a feeling the butler did it

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.240
[together] Andrew Lloyd Webber!

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.300
oh I was way off

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:42.760
buddy?

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.560
yes, it was me all along

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.060
Wait a minute, your singing sounds just like Gerard Butler

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.680
That's why you cast him

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.320
Yeah and this whole thing was just for your stupid Phantom sequal

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.720
which was so bad its never been shown in the US

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.480
and this from the country that turned 'Bend and Snap' into a musical number!

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.280
Well you can't blame a guy for trying can you

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.400
You murdered a man!

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.460
Oh yes that's true

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.700
well, I'd better be off then

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.440
What the hell?

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.960
Oh yes, don't you know?

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.320
horses fly

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.100
My God, everyone should get a horse!

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.040
I'm sorry I did what I did Critic

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.820
I felt if one of us could remember the truth about the past

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.320
Well

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.260
maybe we both remember the past a little differently

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.880
can we still be friends?

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.260
Only if we're the best!

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.000
[car horn]

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.560
Oh, that's my date

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:40.680
What!

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.040
you were dating someone while you were trying to still get me?

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.020
I have a life outside of you, Critic

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:51.040
[Devil Boner] Come on Baby! Wer're gonna be late to the Pottery Barn

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.080
Oh you!

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.000
So, what can we say about Phantom of the Opera?

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.840
I mean like, all of it

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.260
The book definitely stands on its own as a solid piece of work

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.540
but even I'll admit

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.000
that it lends itself to a lot of interpretations

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.780
whether its, Lon Chaney, creeping through the sewers in 1925

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.460
or a god awful video game from the mid 90's

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.580
so even if one isn't your cup of tea

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.800
you know there are several right around the corner

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.660
the musical has a lot of cool things about it

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.040
but it's also very flawed

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.420
with tons of plot holes

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:26.300
clumsy lyrics

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.480
and weird character choices

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.500
to the movies credit, they tried to fix some of these problems

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.320
but in doing so, they create a slew of others

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:37.880
The movie is not a very good adaptation of either the novel or the musical

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.560
but in all fairness, it's not without some good moments

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.000
the sets are nice

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
the cinematography can be good

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.160
but the most important investments

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.240
like character and music completely miss the mark

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.900
one thing all of these have in common though

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.600
is that they are an experience

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.600
whether it be through words

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.160
music, or bat shit crazy film choices

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.140
The Phantom will always leave us asking the question

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.140
"What the hell did I just watch?"

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:09.580
But hey, atleat its not 'Love Never Dies'

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:11.120
I'm the Nostalgia Critic!

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.040
[together] And We're Shark Jumping!

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.540
and...

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.600
lets go buy a horse

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.800
aren't they amazing!

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.860
They're just so practical

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:45.860
Um...

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.740
Should I just show myself out?

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.560
hello?

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.900
don't go!

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.480
so be it!

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:00.580
I'm forced to show myself out the door!

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.420
Food!

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.440
Shut up!

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.100
Hey, Doug Walker here

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.140
doing the charity shout out

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.720
and you know I was gonna do another charity

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.860
but then I realized we had a plug for OneStepCamp.org

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.600
and I'm like, eh, lets do it again!

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.120
There's plenty of other charity's we'll get too

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.060
uh, you know in future videos and  such

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.280
but the more I was thinking about it

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:28.680
I'm like this is such a good charity

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.520
and we've had, uh, first hand contact with them, we've been to this camp

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.520
this is a camp for children who have cancer

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.840
and we've seen it in action

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.700
uh, we've seen it wrap up with all these children coming together

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.740
and uh, at the closing ceremony and everything

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.680
I mean its like

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.120
it's a phenomenal thing they're doing because when

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:51.360
you get this disease, you're immediately kinda isolated from everybody

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.860
and you feel isolated

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.720
and this is a place where all of these kids can come together

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.460
and they can be just be a kid

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:02.320
they can do every day stuff without feeling like an outsider

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.440
and it's one of those places where there's so much love

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.340
there's so much togetherness

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.440
there is so much hope, there's so much joy

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.860
and so many of these kids who go there just say

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.980
it's one of the best experiences of their lives

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.840
and its just a phenomenal thing

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.320
and if you go to their website, if you go to their youtube channel

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.900
and you look up all this stuff

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.280
you'll see all the incredible work that they do

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.780
and it's just such a good cause

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.880
so many good people there and like I've said, we've had first hand experience with them

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.820
and they're just so fantastic

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.320
so, please definitely go check out their website

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.340
and definitely donate if you can

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.220
because it's going to such a fantastic cause

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.060
so thank you so much for watching

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.180
and yeah, next week we'll have a different charity

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.000
but trust me when i say it, it's worth two shout outs

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.980
uh, we've actually done several shout outs for them in the past becuase we like them that much

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.120
and uh, he we are doing it again

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:00.140
so, yeah, that's about it

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:00.980
I'll see you next time

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:01.480
take care
