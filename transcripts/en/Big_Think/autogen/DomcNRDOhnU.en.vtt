when we can live longer and healthier

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680
when we can live longer and healthier
 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.309
when we can live longer and healthier
lives there's the question of what

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319
lives there's the question of what
 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.260
lives there's the question of what
happens to many different areas of our

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
happens to many different areas of our
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.020
happens to many different areas of our
lives the family is one that's super

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030
lives the family is one that's super
 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.360
lives the family is one that's super
important what happened the last time we

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370
important what happened the last time we
 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.940
important what happened the last time we
doubled human life expectancy human life

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
doubled human life expectancy human life
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.010
doubled human life expectancy human life
expectancy in 1850 in the United States

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
expectancy in 1850 in the United States
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.130
expectancy in 1850 in the United States
was 43 years today it's around 80 years

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
was 43 years today it's around 80 years
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.500
was 43 years today it's around 80 years
we've roughly doubled it already and so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
we've roughly doubled it already and so
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.000
we've roughly doubled it already and so
the question is is well what happened

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
the question is is well what happened
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370
the question is is well what happened
family life during that time and if you

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
family life during that time and if you
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.679
family life during that time and if you
look you can see that the age of first

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
look you can see that the age of first
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.410
look you can see that the age of first
marriage has gone up significantly the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
marriage has gone up significantly the
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.840
marriage has gone up significantly the
age of first-time mothers has gone up

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
age of first-time mothers has gone up
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.220
age of first-time mothers has gone up
already I mean right now we're in the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
already I mean right now we're in the
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.160
already I mean right now we're in the
era of the 40 year old mother and I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
era of the 40 year old mother and I
 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110
era of the 40 year old mother and I
think that at some point there'll be a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
think that at some point there'll be a
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150
think that at some point there'll be a
time when we're in the era of the 70

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
time when we're in the era of the 70
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069
time when we're in the era of the 70
year old mother we're at the point where

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
year old mother we're at the point where
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470
year old mother we're at the point where
we're going to see new life phases

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
we're going to see new life phases
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.799
we're going to see new life phases
coming along and so a lot of scholars

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
coming along and so a lot of scholars
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.389
coming along and so a lot of scholars
are focused on the idea of retirement

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
are focused on the idea of retirement
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.150
are focused on the idea of retirement
right now and how the definition of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
right now and how the definition of
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.279
right now and how the definition of
retirement is changing right now we

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
retirement is changing right now we
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380
retirement is changing right now we
think of it as a period in time at the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
think of it as a period in time at the
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.479
think of it as a period in time at the
end of our lives where we take time off

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
end of our lives where we take time off
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700
end of our lives where we take time off
to relax go traveling and that kind of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
to relax go traveling and that kind of
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.380
to relax go traveling and that kind of
thing but I think in a longer lived

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
thing but I think in a longer lived
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390
thing but I think in a longer lived
world where people can be healthier for

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
world where people can be healthier for
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.969
world where people can be healthier for
longer periods of time and work longer

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979
longer periods of time and work longer
 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.580
longer periods of time and work longer
retirement might be redefined to mean

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
retirement might be redefined to mean
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.800
retirement might be redefined to mean
something like large chunks of time that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
something like large chunks of time that
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.510
something like large chunks of time that
you take out of your life to go get

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
you take out of your life to go get
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.940
you take out of your life to go get
re-educated or even take off time to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950
re-educated or even take off time to
 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649
re-educated or even take off time to
have children or do something else

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
have children or do something else
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.109
have children or do something else
because if you could live to be 150

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
because if you could live to be 150
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.969
because if you could live to be 150
years old in a relatively healthy state

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
years old in a relatively healthy state
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.649
years old in a relatively healthy state
then you might want to have more than

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
then you might want to have more than
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.920
then you might want to have more than
one career that that requires a lot of

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
one career that that requires a lot of
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200
one career that that requires a lot of
education and then with longer lives we

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
education and then with longer lives we
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030
education and then with longer lives we
might also have other periods of life

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
might also have other periods of life
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550
might also have other periods of life
that for instance when when we extended

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
that for instance when when we extended
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.819
that for instance when when we extended
our life expectancy a new phase of life

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
our life expectancy a new phase of life
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.969
our life expectancy a new phase of life
came along called adolescence and that

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
came along called adolescence and that
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.100
came along called adolescence and that
didn't used to exist before we used to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
didn't used to exist before we used to
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.359
didn't used to exist before we used to
go straight from childhood to adulthood

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
go straight from childhood to adulthood
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520
go straight from childhood to adulthood
but as we lived longer and healthier

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
but as we lived longer and healthier
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499
but as we lived longer and healthier
this new phase of life came along called

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
this new phase of life came along called
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109
this new phase of life came along called
adolescence and now scholars are

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
adolescence and now scholars are
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240
adolescence and now scholars are
starting to see another phase of life

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250
starting to see another phase of life
 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.460
starting to see another phase of life
which they're calling adult lessons and

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
which they're calling adult lessons and
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.709
which they're calling adult lessons and
that's the time after adolescence but

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
that's the time after adolescence but
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959
that's the time after adolescence but
you're not quite an adult yet and as we

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
you're not quite an adult yet and as we
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.789
you're not quite an adult yet and as we
live longer and longer we might see new

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799
live longer and longer we might see new
 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.990
live longer and longer we might see new
phases of life like that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000
phases of life like that
 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.060
phases of life like that
