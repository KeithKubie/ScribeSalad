our first employment as a team actually
 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.240
our first employment as a team actually
was with the melon Institute we worked

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250
was with the melon Institute we worked
 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.619
was with the melon Institute we worked
on a chemistry game we did some

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:07.629
on a chemistry game we did some
 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:09.419
on a chemistry game we did some
prototypes making a chemistry game for

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:09.429
prototypes making a chemistry game for
 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.700
prototypes making a chemistry game for
them and then sophomore year we decided

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:11.710
them and then sophomore year we decided
 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.919
them and then sophomore year we decided
that we could probably start from

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:13.929
that we could probably start from
 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.830
that we could probably start from
scratch and do a do experiments working

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840
scratch and do a do experiments working
 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.480
scratch and do a do experiments working
with our own names and the way that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490
with our own names and the way that

with our own names and the way that
people make decisions involving games we

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500
people make decisions involving games we
 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.470

actually worked with us early on the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699
actually worked with us early on the
 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.829
actually worked with us early on the
research face and he also helps set up

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839
research face and he also helps set up
 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.000

the experiment again through the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010
the experiment again through the
 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.860
the experiment again through the
experiment scripts the hope would be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870
experiment scripts the hope would be
 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.549
experiment scripts the hope would be
that one day something that something

that one day something that something
that's learned from these experiments is

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300
that's learned from these experiments is
 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.090
that's learned from these experiments is
going to be integrated into educational

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100
going to be integrated into educational
 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.510
going to be integrated into educational
games educating kids and middle schools

games educating kids and middle schools
 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.910
games educating kids and middle schools
out there

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
 
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 
so what we're trying to do this semester

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930
so what we're trying to do this semester
 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.539
so what we're trying to do this semester
is really focus in on how feedback

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549
is really focus in on how feedback
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.950
is really focus in on how feedback
effects how much kids learn in the game

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960
effects how much kids learn in the game
 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.690
effects how much kids learn in the game
but we realized that we kind of made

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700
but we realized that we kind of made
 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.460
but we realized that we kind of made
this whole complex system that the kids

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470
this whole complex system that the kids
 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.950
this whole complex system that the kids
are interacting with and a lot of the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960
are interacting with and a lot of the
 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.420
are interacting with and a lot of the
decisions we made in designing that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430
decisions we made in designing that
 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.279
decisions we made in designing that
we're just kind of based on our own

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289
we're just kind of based on our own
 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.200
we're just kind of based on our own
sense as designers and not necessarily

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210
sense as designers and not necessarily
 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.490
sense as designers and not necessarily
on empirical data we edited our kind of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500
on empirical data we edited our kind of
 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.700
on empirical data we edited our kind of
initial proposal a few times we found we

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710
initial proposal a few times we found we
 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.080
initial proposal a few times we found we
found assumptions that we made that we

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090
found assumptions that we made that we
 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.990
found assumptions that we made that we
thought were worth digging into we've

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000
thought were worth digging into we've
 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.639
thought were worth digging into we've
met with people who had different

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649
met with people who had different
 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.870
met with people who had different
concerns about assumptions with that we

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880
concerns about assumptions with that we
 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.340
concerns about assumptions with that we
made or things that other directions

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350
made or things that other directions
 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.169
made or things that other directions
that we could take the project it and so

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179
that we could take the project it and so
 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.480
that we could take the project it and so
my I guess our conception of our project

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490
my I guess our conception of our project
 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.889
my I guess our conception of our project
is entirely different than it was when

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899
is entirely different than it was when
 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.450
is entirely different than it was when
we first proposed it the classic saying

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460
we first proposed it the classic saying
 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.399
we first proposed it the classic saying
and like product development is you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409
and like product development is you
 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.050
and like product development is you
never finish a product you just ship it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060
never finish a product you just ship it
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.240
never finish a product you just ship it
I think the same goes for research you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250
I think the same goes for research you
 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.889
I think the same goes for research you
never really finish a research project

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899
never really finish a research project
 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.449
never really finish a research project
you just present it when the truth is

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459
you just present it when the truth is
 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.570
you just present it when the truth is
you're never ready to run a study the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580
you're never ready to run a study the
 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.520
you're never ready to run a study the
sub just show up and you do the best you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530
sub just show up and you do the best you
 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.620
sub just show up and you do the best you
can with all the preparations you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630
can with all the preparations you
 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.030
can with all the preparations you
already made there's always going to be

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
already made there's always going to be
 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.610
already made there's always going to be
something I didn't prepare for because I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
something I didn't prepare for because I
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.720
something I didn't prepare for because I
guess that's what happens when you're

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730
guess that's what happens when you're
 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.940
guess that's what happens when you're
doing new research if the main

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
doing new research if the main
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.870
doing new research if the main
experiment that we're going to be

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880
experiment that we're going to be
 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.620
experiment that we're going to be
presenting a meeting of the minds is

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630
presenting a meeting of the minds is
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.060
presenting a meeting of the minds is
looking at how the feedback effects how

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070
looking at how the feedback effects how
 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.890
looking at how the feedback effects how
much kids learn they do like a fraction

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900
much kids learn they do like a fraction
 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.569
much kids learn they do like a fraction
task to practice learning on the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579
task to practice learning on the
 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.199
task to practice learning on the
fractions and then they play like a fun

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209
fractions and then they play like a fun
 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.660
fractions and then they play like a fun
game in between sections of the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670
game in between sections of the
 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.599
game in between sections of the
fractions and so what we're varying

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:36.609
fractions and so what we're varying
 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.740
fractions and so what we're varying
between subjects is how much your

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
between subjects is how much your
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.569
between subjects is how much your
performance on the fractions affects the

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579
performance on the fractions affects the
 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.920
performance on the fractions affects the
game you know we're running experiments

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
game you know we're running experiments
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.360
game you know we're running experiments
right up until meeting of the minds and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
right up until meeting of the minds and
 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.390
right up until meeting of the minds and
in all likelihood will will still be in

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400
in all likelihood will will still be in
 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.480
in all likelihood will will still be in
gear to continue running afterwards

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
 
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.190
 
it feels like you can do this project

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
it feels like you can do this project
 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660
it feels like you can do this project
for some time now you kind of have to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670
for some time now you kind of have to
 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.520
for some time now you kind of have to
step back and start to square when we're

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530
step back and start to square when we're
 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.410
step back and start to square when we're
describing it to people again and we

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420
describing it to people again and we
 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.090
describing it to people again and we
kind of had to take a look back I guess

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100
kind of had to take a look back I guess
 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.670
kind of had to take a look back I guess
over the entire project and you know see

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680
over the entire project and you know see
 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.590
over the entire project and you know see
what the coherent story is the whole

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600
what the coherent story is the whole
 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.810
what the coherent story is the whole
thing there's always a lot of research

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820
thing there's always a lot of research
 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.140
thing there's always a lot of research
going

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
 
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.970
 
really big chance to really see what

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980
really big chance to really see what
 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:17.780
really big chance to really see what
ever has to do

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
ever has to do
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.849
ever has to do
