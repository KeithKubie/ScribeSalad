<v 1>joining me today is an Iraq war veteran,</v>

3
00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:11.440
a political analysts at America's favorite Black Gay Republican.

4
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.620
Rob Smith.
Welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for having me there.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.740
America's favorite Black Gay Republican.

6
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:20.540
That's a lot of pressure to put in a Twitter bio.
You know,

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.350
it's a lot of pressure.
I feel that,
um,

8
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.660
about a year ago about this time,

9
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:30.160
because I came out as conservative a year ago and I,
I out as conservative,

10
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.450
fascinating phrase that we're going to talk a little,
get into that.
Absolutely.

11
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.620
But when I came out I said I want something pithy and catchy and kind of funny

12
00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.710
because it's a joke,
you know,
America's favorite Black Gay Republican.

13
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:44.770
I want there to be a sense of humor in it because as you know,
you know,

14
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.950
you use humor to bring people in,
then you hit them with the facts.

15
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.830
So a lot of people are going to be going,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

16
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.230
These guys are supposed to hate identity politics.

17
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:57.310
But he's saying he's America's favorite Black Gay Republican.
Well,

18
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.970
here's my thing with that.
I think that there's a,
number one,

19
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:04.510
all politics is identity politics.
So everybody does identity politics.

20
00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:05.950
The left does it in the right,
does it,

21
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.290
I think that since coming out as a conservative,

22
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.800
the way I play identity politics is this,
I'm black,
I'm gay,

23
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:12.750
I'm going to rock war veteran,

24
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.450
I'm all these different things and they don't matter about my politics because I

25
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:18.820
can be all of these things and still love America.

26
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.990
And the way the left plays identity politics is we hate you,

27
00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:27.730
evil white men or you know,
this is my 72 genders or all this stuff.

28
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:31.960
So I feel like they use identity politics not only in a super negative and

29
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:35.950
controlling way,
but as a way to get people's votes.
80 sucks though,

30
00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:39.370
to kind of have to do a little bit of what they do to throw it in their face.

31
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:42.850
Right.
Cause like any time,
I don't mention that I'm gay that often,

32
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.240
but anytime that I do,
I have no problem mentioning it.

33
00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.760
Like I'm more than happy to talk about it.
Yeah.
But anytime that I do,

34
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:53.761
it really only is to throw the use the way that they use gay people.

35
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.760
Uh,
it's to throw that back in their face like I have no,

36
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.670
I don't want special credit for it.
You know?
I mean there's,

37
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:02.860
there's no special credit.
I think that for me,

38
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.060
when you get into my history and you know,
I'm going to rock war veteran,

39
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.930
I protested against,
don't ask,
don't tell.

40
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.970
And I came out at 19 or I came out at 19 kind of like to myself in a couple of

41
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:16.450
friends of my mother.
But when I got out of the military at around 21 years old,

42
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.870
because I had to serve under,
don't ask,
don't tell,
I said I'm done with closets,

43
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.130
so I'm going to be out as gay.

44
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:24.790
So being gay to me has always kinda been a political act.

45
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.940
And when I was protesting against,
don't ask,
don't tell,

46
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:30.640
and getting arrested at the White House and doing all these different things,

47
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.190
it was always a political act for me to be gay.

48
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.700
So even coming out as a conservative and being on the right,

49
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:38.170
and I'm proudly on the right,

50
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.490
being gay is a political act because I have to go into these spaces and say I'm

51
00:02:42.491 --> 00:02:47.491
gay and this is why that matters and this is how we can change the party and

52
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:50.770
change the idea of conservatism to bring more people in.

53
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.670
Do you ever find that conservatives have problems?

54
00:02:54.671 --> 00:02:58.180
We gave people because people keep telling me that all these conservatives hate

55
00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:00.040
gay people,
and I go to events all

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.140
<v 2>over the place,
all over the country,
all over the world,</v>

57
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.570
and I meet all these conservatives.
I'm not saying there are none.

58
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.830
I have no doubt there's a certain sect of Bible thumpers obviously that's still

59
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.980
do or some people that have different religious beliefs.
You know,

60
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.100
Ben Shapiro from an Orthodox Jewish perspective,
not thrilled with gay marriage,

61
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.130
but now takes the libertarian approach civil than which I'm okay with.

62
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.380
I don't need him to bow to my beliefs,

63
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.620
but I don't find that there's any real push back against gay people from

64
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.420
conservatives anymore.
I just don't see it.
This is what I've seen

65
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.960
<v 1>and I've seen very,</v>

66
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:34.260
very little in the way of people having some problem with me being gay.
The um,

67
00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.710
in my experience,
and I've been,
God,

68
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.470
I spoke at the Metropolitan Republican Club in New York City and I,

69
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:43.310
and I speak at these republican events all over the country and it's not so much

70
00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:47.100
I have a problem with you being gay.
It's some people say,
um,
one,

71
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:49.220
one person came up to me and she said,
you know,

72
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:52.550
you're so good looking and you're black and you know,
you're all these things.

73
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:56.090
Like why do you have to talk about the gay thing?
And I told her,
I was like,

74
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.390
I talk about the gay thing because it's very important for me to talk about it

75
00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:02.690
because people need to know there are gay conservatives out there that follow me

76
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:04.340
right now that are afraid to come out.

77
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.900
And so I need to take this gain as to the space and let them know that it's
okay.

78
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.890
And also let you guys know that you're missing out on a base of millions of

79
00:04:12.891 --> 00:04:16.850
voters by,
by doing things that can even be construed as it.
Yeah.

80
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.630
<v 2>You think it's one of those things where it's sort of,</v>

81
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.530
you have to do it so that it can get to the point that you don't have to do it.

82
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:24.160
Is that really?
Yes.
Yeah,

83
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.650
<v 1>and I was having this conversation with,</v>

84
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.650
with Candace and I shared this at the blocks are rally over the weekend as well.

85
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.680
Um,
doing identity politics,

86
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.430
you do it now so that at a certain point we don't have to do it anymore.

87
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.850
So we have to say that I'm a gay republican or I'm a black republican or I'm a

88
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.780
gay,
black,
conservative,
whatever you want to say.
Because as Americans,

89
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.490
we have to break all that stuff down and figure out what our identity as

90
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.490
Americans is.
And that's the point for me.

91
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.131
<v 2>Yeah.
All right.</v>

92
00:04:52.131 --> 00:04:54.920
So I want to talk about what it's like coming out as a conservative,

93
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.420
as a gay black man.
The rest of it.
But let,
let's just back up.
Yeah.
All together.

94
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.050
Tell me a little bit about growing up in a family,
that kind of thing.
Yeah,
so

95
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.590
<v 1>I am from Akron,
Ohio.
One of the biggest,
um,</v>

96
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.910
things that people like to say to discredit black conservatives is that we were

97
00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:14.540
all born wealthy.
We were all born them upper middle class.

98
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:17.810
And what we're doing is we're just trying to protect our privilege.

99
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.430
I'm from Akron,
Ohio.
You weren't in Bel Air.
I was not in Bel Air.
All right.

100
00:05:22.431 --> 00:05:25.280
I was in Akron,
Ohio in check the stats on Akron,
Ohio.

101
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.010
Anybody that doesn't know where that is,
um,

102
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.360
went to the worst one of the worst public school systems in the state.

103
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:35.240
You can look on the website right now.
I can,
public schools are rated d plus.

104
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.340
So I came from a single mother household.
You know,

105
00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:45.320
I came from all this stuff and my mother tells me this story and I was too young

106
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:46.154
to remember,

107
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.110
but obviously I went to kindergarten in a school that was in my neighborhood and

108
00:05:51.111 --> 00:05:55.070
my mother tells me the story about going to see me in kindergarten one day.

109
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.880
And it was just,
you know,
90% black school,

110
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.370
let's just to the people were just running around crazy and she said,

111
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.770
I had to pull you out of that school because I knew you weren't going to learn

112
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.450
anything.
Wow.
Send me to school all the way across town.
Um,
the school was,

113
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.150
was mostly why that doesn't make it better or made it better was the property

114
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:13.640
taxes and it was just a,
a more funded school.

115
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.910
So I was able to get that kind of base,

116
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.930
went back to my side of town for middle school and high school,

117
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.300
which was just a terrible experience.
I,

118
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.270
and I tell people all the time when they asked me about,
you know,

119
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.600
sort of things in the world,
in Western civilization,
all that,
I'm like,
look,

120
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.140
I went to Akron public schools.
There are so many things that I just do not know.

121
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.480
Um,
and so I had that experience.
But in those days,

122
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.880
and probably still today,
somebody that looks like me,

123
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:44.960
that comes from where I'd come from if I'm not dribbling a basketball or doing

124
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:46.490
whatever they like,
they don't know what to do with you.

125
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.180
So it's not tracked in the college.
I wasn't attracted to any of these things.

126
00:06:50.181 --> 00:06:52.850
I graduated high school at barely,

127
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.810
I think it was either 16 or barely 17 and just had no path.

128
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.970
So I joined the military right out of high school because I needed a path.

129
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.070
I needed a job.
I needed something to do.
I wish that I could say in,

130
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:08.870
in my military service is great and I love this country.

131
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.560
And that five years that I spent in the military is probably the greatest thing

132
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:16.760
I'll ever do.
But I can't lie and say that as 17 years old,

133
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.160
like I was so patriotic,
I wanted to serve my country.

134
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.220
It was a way for me to move beyond.

135
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.470
<v 2>Yeah.
Yeah.
All right,
well before we get to that,</v>

136
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:28.480
I can't let anyone mention basketball.
I got,
I got a boy.
You got any skills now?

137
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.200
I don't.
I'm the word black man.
Ever.
I like am terrible at basketball.

138
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.921
I don't want to Brag,

139
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:38.350
but I won most improved player of the New York City gay men's basketball this

140
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.420
year.

141
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.230
I think 2012 when I was already like 37 which could be most improved player at

142
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:45.640
37 that's not bad.
That's pretty good.
It's really funny that I'm,

143
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:47.120
they have that gay basketball league there.

144
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.750
There's a part of me that has always wanted to try,

145
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.290
but I know it'd be so bad and there were guys dunking.

146
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.350
I mean it's a serious,
it's a seriously you got,
it's funny because I don't mind,

147
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.930
I always,
for me at least,
and I wonder for you,

148
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.110
like my sports and my sexuality had nothing to do with each other ever.

149
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.630
Like I never brought my sexuality when I'm out on the court in any way.

150
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:10.100
You know what I mean?
Like it wasn't like that.

151
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.970
The only reason I joined that league was at that point in my life when I came

152
00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:16.340
out late and I finally was like,
Oh,
let me just meet some,

153
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.500
I didn't really like like the bar scene or like yeah,
like I didn't,

154
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.090
I didn't like that and I was like,
Oh man,

155
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.550
if there's happened to be some gay people that also like basketball maybe you

156
00:08:26.551 --> 00:08:29.360
know,
I'll find some friends and I did find some friends there and it's like,

157
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:31.240
and half of them it's like you're gay.
Really?

158
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.630
Like the guy like dunks on you and like some of those guys,

159
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:38.030
like almost when pro,
that's how good they've got.

160
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.450
The weird thing about kind of like being gay and not only am I gay,

161
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:44.030
I was so used to be a fat kid as well,

162
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.760
so I think you're really going for it here.
I'm like,
God,
everything.

163
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:51.680
Did you have a limp at any point?
Did not have a line like five.
Like I said,

164
00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:55.980
I was like some fat black gay kids was not athletic at all.
So I

165
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.780
<v 1>didn't discover because there are some sports I'm good at.</v>

166
00:08:57.781 --> 00:09:00.900
I played in in the Gay Volleyball League in New York City for a couple of years

167
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:04.630
and now I'm a pariah since I came out as conservatives.
Oh,
GPA.

168
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.280
I thought they're all talented.
Yeah,
right.
New York City gays,

169
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:13.140
they're not tolerant.
This is not so much,

170
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:13.741
I am shocked,

171
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:18.000
but I discovered that I am athletic and I discovered that I'm great at

172
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:21.240
volleyball,
great at tennis,
you know,
like,
like lifting weights,

173
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:24.570
like being in shape.
But that's kind of what I discovered about myself.

174
00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:26.100
Kind of like,
I don't want to say later in life,

175
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:30.320
but definitely post 30 that I actually,
you know,
have some sports skills.
Yeah.

176
00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.510
All right,
good.
So when you joined the military,
we,
you,

177
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.900
were you already sort of out to yourself?
Now I'm talking about sexuality,

178
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.430
politics,
not politics,
NYSE,
but certainly not a conservative thing.
I was,

179
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:46.230
I was out to myself,
I think in the way that a lot of gay teens are.
You know,

180
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:50.610
I knew that I was kind of like feeling away about guys that I was supposed to

181
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:51.570
feel about girls,

182
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.660
but I don't know if I could really kind of quantify it in that way.
Um,

183
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.300
and when I went into the military,
they actually,

184
00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:01.170
in those days I actually asked you,
are you gay?
And I said,
no,
I'm not,

185
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:04.020
only because I didn't know how to define it at the time,

186
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:08.070
but also I knew that that was a barrier to,
to what I wanted to do,
you know.

187
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.350
So being in the military,

188
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:15.090
I came out to myself,
you know,
started exploring my sexuality,

189
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:18.690
exploring all of that stuff.
And like I said,
when I got done with the military,

190
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:21.000
coming out was like a political act.
I was like,
no more closets.

191
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.890
Were you finding other gay people in the military?
Like what is that?

192
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.810
What was that like then?
I mean,
now,

193
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.260
now where it's more accepted and donate until doesn't exist or whatever.

194
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.550
The thing about,
um,

195
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.120
it's really funny how it is now is that there are entire Instagram accounts

196
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:40.540
dedicated to gay guys in the military.
It's called gay military dudes.
And I,

197
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:45.390
and I love the fact that these bees,
young gay men in the military,

198
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:49.500
so open about their sexuality and their posting thought picks and they're doing

199
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:50.580
all this.
And I'm like,
great.

200
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.020
You were saying the military hasn't crumbled since and it's causing a

201
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:59.220
demoralization or everyone's still okay.
We still,
everybody still good.

202
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.230
But back then there was this,
this underground movement of,

203
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.050
of gay people,
gays and lesbians that were in the military.

204
00:11:07.051 --> 00:11:10.440
And I remember the very first pride I went to,
I was,
um,

205
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.380
I was stationed in Fort Carson,
Colorado,
so like right on Colorado Springs.

206
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.500
And my very first pride was Denver pride.

207
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.390
So I went there and I think it was like maybe 19 or 20 at the time.

208
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.490
And that was my first time being around a lots of other gay men at the same
time.

209
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:29.430
And it was the first time that,
um,
you know,
I was,
I was,

210
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.650
I was getting attention from men and then like,

211
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.050
people were looking at me and I was like,
oh,
he's cute.
And I was like,
oh,

212
00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:36.120
so this is what this is like.
Um,

213
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.800
so there was a thriving underground gay culture in the military.
How do,

214
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.450
were you afraid to go out and go to a gay pride parade while you're [inaudible]?

215
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.700
Absolutely.
Because it's like if I don't ask,

216
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:49.800
don't tell was tricky because it was not only,

217
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:53.800
you can't tell somebody that you're gay,
but if you were discovered to be gay,

218
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.790
then people would,
um,
you know,
go up the chain of command and kick you out.

219
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.310
But the thing about it is,
and this is what we always realize,

220
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.520
that nobody would care because there are plenty of guys in my unit that,

221
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:07.030
that knew I was gay and a funny story,
there was a club called,

222
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:07.900
I think it's now defunct,

223
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.730
called hide and seek in Colorado Springs and they used to be open to people

224
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:17.080
under 21 after 2:00 AM.
So I would be,
yeah,
yeah,

225
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.900
yeah.
It will be opened at 21.
Uh,

226
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.530
it would be open to people under 21 after 2:00 AM because it'd be like open till

227
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:27.680
five and they wouldn't be serving any booze.
So I was young in the military.

228
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:31.090
I was like maybe 20 years old,
I would take a nap at 10 30 at night.

229
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:33.860
I wake up at one 30 I would put on,
I had like,

230
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:38.110
like leather pants and a tank top is insane.
Crazy.
Um,

231
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.590
and then drive to hide and seek and dance all night.
And it was kind of,

232
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:44.170
it was a more gay crowd,
but it was mixed as well.

233
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:48.500
And I saw a couple of my sergeants there,
wow.
Time at the club and they saw me,

234
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.590
they saw me and they saw me and they were like,
okay,
this is interesting.

235
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:56.860
And they saw me kind of like dancing with some red head and you know,

236
00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.490
feeling my oats,
you know what I mean?
Feeling myself.

237
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:04.780
But I remember being terrified that weekend that they were going to out me,

238
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.570
that they were going to like tell my superiors and whatever.
It never did

239
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.700
<v 2>well,
but you had it on them too,
right?
I mean,
no,
they weren't gay.
They were,</v>

240
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.060
they were just there with their girlfriends because it was like,
oh wow.

241
00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:17.970
I just had a completely different story going on in my head for the last 30

242
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:22.410
seconds.
Yeah,
no,
they were there with their girlfriends.
Oh,
they're our spot.
Oh,

243
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.100
whoa.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
Yeah.
Okay.
And so they did.
They did

244
00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:31.140
<v 1>bust me out in a lot of these guys are still my friends to this day,</v>

245
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:33.310
my Facebook friends,
and they see all the stuff that I'm doing.

246
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.500
I'm here on there and coming out as a Republican.
I'm doing all this.

247
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:37.570
And they're like,
Smith,
you know,
we always knew you were gay.

248
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.550
We just didn't care because you're a good soldier.

249
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.140
<v 2>So I know what most gay people feel about being in the closet.</v>

250
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:46.170
Just how you can be as a person.
It's just,
you know,
you're,
you're,

251
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.890
I always felt like I was like lying all the time accidentally.
Like I was,

252
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.400
it wasn't even intentionalized people would ask me something and I could

253
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:55.140
immediately,
you know,
where were you last night?

254
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:57.930
And I could just lie without thinking,
you know,
it's really,

255
00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:02.710
it's a really twisted,
dark.
It's not fun to think back on that kind of thing.
Um,

256
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.370
but for someone in the military during don't ask,
don't tell,

257
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.840
do you think that affected your ability to function as a,

258
00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:12.270
as a soldier and I think it did

259
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.853
<v 1>the,</v>

260
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:19.070
I think that to me the biggest thing about being closeted in the military was

261
00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:24.420
that it affected the relationships that I was able to have with my fellow

262
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:25.140
soldiers.

263
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.790
There was a wall there and if I was able to just be gay and nobody cared,

264
00:14:29.791 --> 00:14:31.520
that wall wouldn't be there.
And,

265
00:14:31.521 --> 00:14:35.130
and it's so important when you're serving with people to be able to be close to

266
00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:38.640
them.
Like literally to be able to,
to bring your full self self to work.

267
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.240
Because not only were we serving together,
I mean we deployed together,
you know,

268
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:44.260
I did a tour in Kuwait,
I did a tour and arrived,

269
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.960
these are the people that you're with.

270
00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:50.850
These are basically your family and you have to hide a part of yourself and all

271
00:14:50.851 --> 00:14:54.950
the,
that they were hanging out or doing things that we could become closer.

272
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.890
I was separating myself from that because I knew that there was a part of me

273
00:14:57.891 --> 00:14:58.730
that had to hide.

274
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.710
And so when I bring all of that stuff now too,

275
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:06.890
to being gay and being open as a conservative and everything,

276
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.510
it is so important for me to be open in that way because there I can't have that

277
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.780
wall there between me and other conservatives and me and other people in the

278
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.260
movement.
And the younger conservatives had been s like,

279
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.620
these kids don't care.
They don't care.

280
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.860
Some of the older ones need to kind of be brought around a little bit,
but man,

281
00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:25.694
they don't care.

282
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.120
Do you think it's just because young people somehow have started to embrace a

283
00:15:30.121 --> 00:15:33.560
more libertarian view of the world?
I mean,
it's like we've got sort of,
you know,

284
00:15:33.561 --> 00:15:37.370
crazy leftism on one hand seems to be catching fire all the time and was really

285
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:41.600
pushed on us by the media.
But then I see,
and I guess it's a little selected by,

286
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.130
by who invites me to these schools,

287
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.400
but I see such a strong libertarian like spirit with these kids.

288
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.800
Not meaning that they're all politically libertarians at every level,

289
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:54.410
but like they just,
they want to live their lives.

290
00:15:54.411 --> 00:15:55.670
They want to love who they love,

291
00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:58.920
they want to smoke whatever they want to smoke or whatever.
And,

292
00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:03.290
and I'm very enthused by that.
I think that the,
the generation right now,

293
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:04.610
they really do just,

294
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.630
they just want to let people live and they want to let people do their thing.

295
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.060
They don't care about gay,
they don't care about transgender,

296
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:13.580
they don't care about any of these different things.

297
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.250
They just want to let people live.
And it's really funny,

298
00:16:16.251 --> 00:16:19.010
like the conversation I had last night,
I'm at Ucla,

299
00:16:19.011 --> 00:16:23.810
I had an event and it's so funny because when I was protesting against don't
ask,

300
00:16:23.811 --> 00:16:25.070
don't tell,
I was,
I was,
you know,

301
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:28.760
doing a lot of lecture work and I was talking with the young LGBT student groups

302
00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:31.130
and I was just like,
you know,
you can be anything you want to be.

303
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.470
Let's empower you.
Like let's do all this stuff.

304
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.920
And I'm having the same conversations with young people who are afraid to come

305
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:40.160
out as conservative.
Same thing.
Data.
Yeah,
no,
it is.
All right.
So,
all right,

306
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.580
let's just dive into that then.
So,
because I really do feel this now,

307
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:46.990
because I find,
I know what the closeted thing was like,
as,

308
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.040
as in terms of sexuality.

309
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.000
But I see this now the amount of emails that I get and when I meet people on the

310
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:56.900
street and they'll kinda whisper it to me,
you know,
it's not even,

311
00:16:56.901 --> 00:16:59.450
they're not even saying,
yeah,
well they'll go,
you Dave.
And then they'll go,

312
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.310
it's not even that they're saying they're a conservative per se.

313
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:04.940
They're basically just saying they're not a progressive yeah.
That they're not,

314
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.380
they don't come from the woke monster,
you know what I mean?

315
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.320
And I,
and they're walking around with that,

316
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:15.380
that feeling that you described a moment ago related to sexuality where you

317
00:17:15.381 --> 00:17:18.840
can't be fully there with someone.
And I think there are,

318
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.180
there are quite literally,

319
00:17:20.181 --> 00:17:23.120
I think there were millions of people in the United States that are walking

320
00:17:23.121 --> 00:17:27.050
around in a,
in a closeted stand,
not because they're Nazis are white,

321
00:17:27.051 --> 00:17:29.030
supremacists are haters are racists,

322
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.590
but just because they happen to have either some conservative beliefs or,
uh,

323
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.360
some libertarian beliefs or something like that.

324
00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:38.930
And I see it all the time and I'm sure you probably get 10 times as many

325
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:43.310
messages as I do,
but you see it and when you go have these conversations,

326
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.900
it is the same conversations that I was having with a young gay kids that were

327
00:17:47.901 --> 00:17:50.970
afraid to come out.
I had conversation with the kid last night.
He was just like,

328
00:17:50.971 --> 00:17:55.230
man,
how do I come out to my friends as conservative or how do I come out to my

329
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:59.310
friends as somebody who's like not a leftist and this is what I always say to

330
00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:03.510
them.
You know the real ones will stick around the fake ones.
We'll go,

331
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.830
I promise you that.
And when like a year ago,

332
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.180
I remember sitting,

333
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:13.050
I was visiting my best friend in Vegas and I was thinking about,

334
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:17.310
I know from my experience,
you know,
being very prominent in the don't ask,

335
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:21.330
don't tell thing that when you come out as something like you're coming out to

336
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:25.320
make a statement and it has to be a media moment and you have to get your face

337
00:18:25.321 --> 00:18:28.260
out there because that's what gives other people the strength to come out.

338
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.110
And I was like,
man,
if I don't do this,

339
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.350
somebody else is going to do this because I know I'm not the only black gay

340
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:36.840
republican out there.
I have fans that are,

341
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:41.790
that are Black Gay Republicans and Latina Lesbian Conservatives and all sorts of

342
00:18:41.791 --> 00:18:44.070
stuff.
Um,
but I was like,
if I don't do this,

343
00:18:44.071 --> 00:18:47.880
somebody else is going to do this and somebody needs to do this because these

344
00:18:47.881 --> 00:18:49.560
people need to know that it's okay.

345
00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.800
And when I take the hits and you take the hits and canvas takes the hits and all

346
00:18:55.031 --> 00:18:56.670
of these other people takes the hits,

347
00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.600
it makes it easier for these other people to come out.

348
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.040
<v 2>So I've asked a lot of my guests that have taken those heads.
Yeah.
This question,</v>

349
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.210
I usually ask it at the end,

350
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.720
but what do you think it is about you that allows you to,

351
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.180
to want to take the hits or maybe not even want to,

352
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.460
that you do whether you want to or not.

353
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.470
<v 1>I'm telling you the army built something that is indestructable.</v>

354
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.190
I indestructable I served for five years.

355
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.830
I saw some things on a rock.

356
00:19:22.831 --> 00:19:27.660
I saw some things overseas and in not even outside of that,

357
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.840
what the basic training does is it just builds you up.

358
00:19:30.841 --> 00:19:34.170
And as somebody that has a lot of discipline that can take a lot of hits.

359
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.270
And I know enough about media and I know enough about the people that are making

360
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:44.040
the moves right now.
I know that it is important for me to do this because,

361
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.210
and I'm telling you,
they have,

362
00:19:45.211 --> 00:19:49.350
and you've probably seen the ship in the past five to seven years since you've

363
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:52.160
been doing this and have really been blown up and traveling all the,

364
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.003
all the world.

365
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.660
There's a shift that's going on and I believe it's real.

366
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.540
And in three to five years,

367
00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.890
me being a black gay conservative,
it's just going to be like,
you know,
whatever.

368
00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:10.050
And I hate the fact that the gay community,
I'm,

369
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:12.720
I'm Kinda my am ex communicated now,
you know,

370
00:20:12.721 --> 00:20:15.300
so I'm not getting invites to the glazing medium

371
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.160
<v 2>borough with me.
Yeah,
we should start our own awards.
We totally should.</v>

372
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.250
<v 1>The,
the,
the,
the gay free thinkers,
wars,
you know,</v>

373
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.200
but you get excommunicated and they're,
they're very high level people that,

374
00:20:27.201 --> 00:20:28.660
I mean,
I used to get invited to,

375
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.570
to all of this stuff in New York City because I was like a person in the media.

376
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.900
And when I came out last year it was like,
it was like silence.

377
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.780
<v 2>So what does that really tell you about these organizations?</v>

378
00:20:39.781 --> 00:20:42.200
And sorta like glad and these other organizations that are there,

379
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.390
there for gay people,
right?
They're supposed to be for gay people and,

380
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:48.130
and if they subscribe to,
they should be for

381
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.750
<v 1>black people in the rest of it.</v>

382
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.980
But you're saying you were in that they loved you.
You come out as conservative.

383
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.610
We're done with you.
Would,
it tells me is number one,

384
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.690
that these organizations are not for all Lgbtq people.

385
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.170
Therefore Lgbtq,
um,
democrats,
first of all,

386
00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:08.260
these are leftist organization.
People really need to understand this.

387
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.520
I know I say it all the time,

388
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:13.900
but like I think that because people just think glad is for gay people.

389
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:18.070
This is for this per,
and it's like,
no,
that's not really what's going on here,

390
00:21:18.071 --> 00:21:18.501
but let's go.

391
00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:22.540
Going on really takes work to get people to fully understand why that is true.

392
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.990
And there used to be,
and we talked about this a little bit before we started,

393
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.010
before we started filming,

394
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:31.870
there used to be a part of me that wanted nothing more than to be kind of like a

395
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:34.750
gay celebrity.
I like,
oh,
I get to go,

396
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.640
I get to go to the glad media awards and I get to go to the HRC red carpets and

397
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:40.630
I get to to be,

398
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.840
and now I realize that what I'm doing right now is so much bigger than any of

399
00:21:46.901 --> 00:21:48.880
that stuff.
And I'm not,

400
00:21:48.881 --> 00:21:53.881
I'm doing this not for fame or because the concept of fame has been very strange

401
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:57.670
to me and in grappling with this newfound attention,

402
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.030
but it's not about being with some delists.

403
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.050
I'm gay celebrities on the red carpet.
It's certainly not about being with,

404
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:06.280
even though I love the way,

405
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:08.110
usually the ones that they're putting on the red carpet,

406
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:10.050
they're not even gay half the time.
Right.
Yeah,

407
00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.500
I told you I used to do these red carpets when I had a show on our Q and I was,

408
00:22:13.501 --> 00:22:14.560
so I was interviewing people,

409
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:18.040
I was on the other side of the red carpet and mostly it was just housewives of

410
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:23.130
New York drunk,
these drunk plastic women that are like,
ah,
I'll have him gave,

411
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.320
let me tell you something and I can tell you a story and she will remain

412
00:22:26.321 --> 00:22:30.820
nameless.
But I was actually at,
Huh?
It's on me after.
Oh,

413
00:22:30.821 --> 00:22:32.110
I can tell you the name of it.
So yeah.
Yeah.

414
00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.140
But I was on one of these award shows and this was obviously before I came out

415
00:22:35.141 --> 00:22:38.650
when I was still getting invited and this person was H's,

416
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.040
a drunken sloppy mess.
And I'm just like,

417
00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:45.880
how is this celebrating gay people?
How is this elevating us?

418
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.410
And so what you have is with the glands of the world,

419
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.580
this is about bullying Hollywood celebrities in the thinking that,
you know what,

420
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.190
if you don't,
if you don't show up to our red carpet events,

421
00:22:57.191 --> 00:23:00.640
you're not supporting,
you know,
the Lgbtq community.

422
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.400
So that's what that's all about.
Um,

423
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:07.840
the HRC is obviously of leftist organization,
like very much so.

424
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:12.670
I left this organization and what irritates me about this entire thing is that

425
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.390
these organizations were not started as leftist organizations.

426
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.050
They weren't supposed to be left as well cause at that time they wanted real

427
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:24.820
equality,
equality under the law.
They wanted the things that we have right now.

428
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.670
But to continue to get funding,

429
00:23:27.671 --> 00:23:30.910
to continue to be data centers for the Democratic Party,

430
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:34.090
they have to go with whatever far left craziness.

431
00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:36.880
And it's the intersectionality cold and it's,

432
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.910
it's being lectured by a queer Muslim at the glad media where it's about how

433
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:46.700
gays aren't inclusive enough for,
for Islam and,
and about,
you know,
how,

434
00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.300
how the LGBT community needs to accept undocumented people.

435
00:23:51.301 --> 00:23:53.990
It was just like all this stuff that was never,

436
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:58.340
it's never what our movement was about.
And at the same time for me as a gay man,

437
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.930
I know that um,

438
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:04.100
HIV aids rates among young black gay men are still exploding.
Um,

439
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:08.330
we have a huge problem with Matt that there's real stuff still going on.

440
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.880
So what should they have done then?
W W

441
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.280
<v 2>was there a moment that there should've been a course correction?</v>

442
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:16.130
So say gay marriage gets passed on,
ask,
don't tell is gone.

443
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.610
What do you think the organization's,
if they had done it right?
I mean,
is it,

444
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.550
is it,
do they close up shop?
Do they well,
that's what I think.

445
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:24.290
That's what they were afraid of.
They were afraid of,

446
00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:28.430
now that we have this quote unquote true quality that the close up shop Chris

447
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:30.290
Chris rock that had been one of his great lines.

448
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:31.580
The cops need a certain amount of crime.

449
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.140
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
And I think that would happen after.</v>

450
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.210
Don't ask,
don't tell.

451
00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:42.211
Repeal and marriage equality were two of the biggest gay rights wins of our

452
00:24:43.541 --> 00:24:47.110
generation.
Like I think of our lifetime.
And after that happened,

453
00:24:47.111 --> 00:24:49.990
I think that they just needed something else.
They needed some more funding.

454
00:24:49.991 --> 00:24:53.890
They needed to,
to continue to be relevant.

455
00:24:53.891 --> 00:24:58.480
So they'd gone into all of this intersectionality far left insanity.

456
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:03.780
And what I see from being so open and being a gay conservative out here is that

457
00:25:04.151 --> 00:25:09.151
there is a large group of gays and lesbians that are conservative that want

458
00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:12.190
nothing to do with the leftist nonsense.

459
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.130
They don't want to vote with their sexual orientation.

460
00:25:15.131 --> 00:25:19.470
They want to vote for their values.
They want to vote with their pocket books.

461
00:25:19.471 --> 00:25:23.290
And you know,
they,
they,
they want to vote based on who they are.
So you're saying,

462
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:26.470
let me get this straight.
Yeah.
Gay people are just like everybody else,

463
00:25:26.471 --> 00:25:31.420
just like everybody else.
They just like,
everybody's crazy.
Right?
Nuts.

464
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.000
Insane.
Yeah.
And you'd think

465
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:38.590
<v 2>so where are,
where are the,
the right gay organizations?
Are there any,</v>

466
00:25:38.591 --> 00:25:39.940
I mean like the log cabin Republicans,

467
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:41.770
are there anybody that you're out there and you're like,
oh,

468
00:25:41.771 --> 00:25:44.720
you guys are doing some good grassroots work related to

469
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.770
<v 1>I issues remain.
It's always,</v>

470
00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:52.150
it's never going to be the HRCS and the glads of the world.

471
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.530
It's always the grassroots organizations.
It's your,
your,
your,

472
00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.010
um,
Columbus pride.
You know,
it's,

473
00:26:00.011 --> 00:26:02.350
you're the Brooklyn Community Pride Center.

474
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:07.180
It's like these are the organizations that are money really needs to go to

475
00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.420
because these organizations are doing work on the ground to like give young LGBT

476
00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:17.641
people access to jobs and education and all the stuff that the glads and the HRC

477
00:26:18.781 --> 00:26:20.770
is of the world claim that they're fighting for.

478
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.100
But really they're just paying a lot of big wigs,
sick,

479
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.600
like insane six figure salaries and,
and trying to get Madonna on a re carpet.

480
00:26:28.601 --> 00:26:32.050
And God loved Madonna.
We don't love Madonna,
but that's not the word.

481
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:37.210
So I always try to elevate the smaller organizations because they need the time

482
00:26:38.021 --> 00:26:40.090
and the money more than the big ones.
For the record,

483
00:26:40.091 --> 00:26:42.460
I'm more of a Tina Turner guy.
You Remember Tina Turner?

484
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.130
I hear she gives an amazing

485
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:47.320
<v 2>show.
I haven't been yet.
I never,
well,
I don't think she's going live anymore.</v>

486
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.830
I think she's done tour and she shines.
I think she like,

487
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:51.600
she moved to like Sweden or something.

488
00:26:51.601 --> 00:26:55.920
I think she gave up her us citizenship and she's just riding it out,
man.
