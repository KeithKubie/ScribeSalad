00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.100
&gt;&gt; Now it's my pleasure
to introduce Sam Kean.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.220
Sam is a science writer, as
I'm sure all of you know.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.590
He's written several
very well-received books.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.470
One is The Tale of
Dueling Neurosurgeons.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.240
Another one is The
Disappearing Spoon.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.000
They have been named among the
top science books on Amazon

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.480
in the years they came out.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.860
He has been published by just about
everyone from the New York Times

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.900
to The Atlantic to Slate.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.290
And his new book is called
Caesar's Last Breath.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.020
And if you haven't read it,
it's much like his other books.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.160
It makes science hugely readable.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.510
And with no further ado, Sam Kean.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.350
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: All right.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.650
Well, hello everyone.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.040
Thank you all for joining
this evening.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.990
So there's an old joke
about two fish

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.020
that are swimming along
in the ocean.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.770
And they, you know, just
talking, hanging out,

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.690
and they pass by an old-timer fish.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.070
And as they pass him
the old-timer fish says,

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.710
hey boys, how's the water today?

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.790
And the two fish just kind of
nod and keep going and then

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.650
about a minute later one of the
young fish turns to the other one

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.820 position:56%
and he says, what the heck is water?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.440
Now, that's not a very good joke, I
admit, but there is kind of a truth

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.460
in there, in that, you know, the
fish are so immersed in water

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.580
that they have a hard time
even realizing what water is.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.970
And I think human beings are

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.850
in a lot the same relationship
with the air around us.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.330
It's always around us, but it's
invisible, it's ubiquitous,

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.690
but we barely pay any
attention to it.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.240
And so that's kind of the premise
of my book Caesar's Last Breath,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.140 position:56%
which is to make us pay attention to
the air, make us think about the air

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.280
in a way that we really
wouldn't otherwise.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.470
And I think it's important
to be aware of the air,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.600
because it is something we
really take for granted.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.740
It might've been the first fact
you ever learned in science class,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970 position:56%
which is that, you know, some things
are solid, some things are liquid,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.910
and some things, like
air, are gases.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.040 position:56%
And we pay a lot of attention to the
solids and the liquids in our life,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.590
but the gases are really the
most important thing around.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.940
Because think about it, you
know, if you could go --

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.610
you know, if you had
to go without solids,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.650
without food for a few
days, you'd probably live.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.050
You'd pull through that.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.370
Without liquids you
could go, you know,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.260
maybe a week or so, you'd be okay.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.140
But without gases, without the
air, you'd maybe last a few minutes

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.710
at most before you'd die.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.210 position:56%
Air is really the most important
thing in your environment right now,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.150
and yet it's something we
barely pay attention to.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.560
And so the premise of the
book was to know, you know,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.180
imagine taking a deep
breath, inhaling,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.350
exhaling all of these different
gases, things like nitrogen,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.500
oxygen are the big ones,
but there's also things

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.610
like little bits of anesthesia.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.620
There are noble gases.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.920
There's ozone.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.220
There are pollutants.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.520
There are refrigerants.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.950
There is radioactive fallout
from 1950's weapons testing

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.890
that is still in the air around us.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.150
So the book examines the origins
of all of these gases and it tries

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.440
to tell kind of a funny or a spooky
or a touching story about each one

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.520
of them and how it shapes
our lives in hidden ways.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.420
And there's actually something
kind of bigger connecting all

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.840
of these different gases, too,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.810
kind of the overarching
story of the book.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.460
And that is, if you look at these
different gases some of them come

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.000
from the very first
days of planet Earth.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.480
They're billions of years old.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.440
Some of these gases only came
about later with the rise of life.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.080
Some of these gases only came

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.530
about with the rise of
human civilizations.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.830
So they're very new.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.890
And if you look at all
of these gases in tandem,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.640 position:56%
kind of the whole ensemble of gases,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.080
you can actually get a
complete history of Earth.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.460
In fact, you can reconstruct
the whole history

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.980
of our planet every single time
you take a breath if you know how

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.240
to decode those stories
that are in those gases.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.910 position:56%
So I thought I would take a few
minutes tonight to try to share some

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.100
of the stories with you, and
just try to get you to be aware,

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.430
be more -- try to have
a better perspective

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.810
about what it is you're breathing.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.200
So I'm going to start with
a very early planet Earth

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.220
and talk a little bit about
the early atmospheres on Earth.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.200
And you sometimes hear that the
atmosphere is the most complicated

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.960
system that we know of
besides the human brain.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.440
And it's true, the atmosphere is
a very, very complicated system.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.220
And like a living thing the
atmosphere has evolved over time.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.960
Our air has changed
throughout Earth's history.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.980
So the very first atmosphere we had
was just some hydrogen and helium

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.830
that was left over from
the formation of the sun.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.390
It was a very thin atmosphere,
very wispy atmosphere.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.820
I call it sort of a comb over
atmosphere on our planet.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.780
It wasn't very substantial.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.800
It wasn't really fooling anyone.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.360
And very quickly it got blown
away into space and disappeared.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.580
But that was our first atmosphere,
was just made of this hydrogen

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.450
and helium left over from the sun.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.480
Not long after that we
got our second atmosphere.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.900
And the second atmosphere,
the air above us,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.310
actually came from
the ground beneath us.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.160
It came from volcanic
vents and fissures

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.540 position:56%
and other things on the early Earth.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.740
Early Earth was a very
dynamic place,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.290
lots of volcanoes erupting
all the time.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.290 position:56%
They would spew out these hot, nasty
reactive gases that would then go up

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.280
and they started to build up
and form our first atmosphere.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.350
You had things like hydrogen
sulfide, the rotten egg smell,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.050
you had ammonia, and you especially
had carbon dioxide building up.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.450
And if you were to get into a time
machine and go back to this era,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.350
kind step out, you know, try to
stretch your arms a little bit

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.030
after your journey,
take a nice deep breath,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.160
your lungs would just
start burning inside you.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.170
This is very, very nasty
air to try to breathe.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.490
It would have destroyed
your lungs basically.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.020
So this was not the kind of air
that we wanted to, you know,

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.090
breathe that was really
supportive of life.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.390
It was from volcanoes.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.650 position:56%
If you've ever been around a volcano
eruption, something like that,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.950
you can imagine it's
not very pleasant gas.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.190
But that was our second atmosphere,
was from these volcanoes,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.980
the exhaust that would
come out volcanoes.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.200
And so our third atmosphere
kind of took over gradually

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.370
from the second atmosphere.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.800
What happened was, you
know, all these hot,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.640
nasty gases would spew out,
but there was one component

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.980
of the eruptions that would kind
of sneak in there all the time,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.180
and that component was nitrogen.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.240
So nowadays, you know, nitrogen is
a dominant component of the air,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.960
but with each one of these
eruptions you'd get a little tiny,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.550 position:56%
tiny bit of nitrogen, just is a very
small percentage that would sort

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.870
of seep out with each one
of these volcanic eruptions.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.390
But what would happen is that
all these other hot nasty gases,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.680
the carbon dioxide, the
sulfur dioxide, the ammonia,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.290
they would go off and they
would start reacting with things

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.080 position:56%
and eventually they would disappear,
they would fall out of the air.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.440
But nitrogen is a very
unreactive gas, it's very hardy.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.250
And once nitrogen gets into
the air it stays in the air,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.690
and it stays in the air for a
really, really long time, millions,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.330
sometimes even billions of years.

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.790 position:56%
So when the nitrogen started leaking
out it would stay in the atmosphere.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:07.700
But then, you know, you'd have
another volcanic eruption,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.380
all these hot nasty gases would
come out, but they would react,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.660
they would disappear, and you'd
get a little bit more nitrogen.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.150
Then you'd have another eruption,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.700
all the hot nasty gases would
come out, they would react,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.370
they would disappear, you'd
get a little bit more nitrogen.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.800
And it kept building up like this
very, very slowly over the years.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.980
And when I say slowly, I
mean very, very slowly,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.280
like the ultimate slow and steady.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.960
It took a few billion years for
this process to happen for nitrogen

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.710
to finally build up to appreciable
levels in the atmosphere.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.620
But after a few billion years
nitrogen became the dominant gas

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.920
in our atmosphere.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.220
Now it makes up about
78% of our air,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.890
so about four of every five
molecules we breathe came

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.300
from these volcanoes ultimately.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.040
And we really should be thankful
for that because it allowed life

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.830
to form and exist on land.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.830
If we still had all
that volcano exhaust

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.500
around there would be no way
we could support life on land

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.970
because the hot nasty air that
was around would just destroy it.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.480
So we really should be thankful
for this volcano exhaust

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.650
and the little bit nitrogen
because it made life safe

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.070
for creatures like us on land.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.460
So that was the third
atmosphere with nitrogen.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.430
And eventually that gave rise
to the fourth atmosphere,

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.220
which is the one we have today.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.170
And the fourth atmosphere,
the additional gas

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.830
that the fourth atmosphere
had in it was oxygen.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.820
Oxygen is an important
gas, obviously for us.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.370
And it's kind of weird
to think about the fact

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:46.080
that oxygen wasn't always a
part of Earth's atmosphere.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.180
And, in fact, life arose on
Earth well before the first

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.480
oxygen existed.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.280
And that's really strange
to think about,

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.920 position:56%
because nowadays we associate
oxygen very, very closely with life.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.750
It seems vital for life.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:07.930
But in truth, oxygen was actually
toxic for most forms of life

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:09.740
that existed on early Earth.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.170 position:56%
Oxygen was actually a poison for
these creatures, microbes and things

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.940
that were around at the
time, and the reason why is

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:21.310
that oxygen is a very reactive gas.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.380
Once oxygen started to get
inside these cells it would come

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.850
across these delicate biochemical
structures they had, enzymes,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.790
other things, and chemically
oxygen is basically a big bully.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.250
It goes in, it starts punching
things, ripping things apart,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.890
destroying things,
and so these microbes

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.710
when they had oxygen inside them
it would basically destroy them.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.560
It would rip everything
apart inside them.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.090
So what these creatures, these
little microbes would do,

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.430 position:56%
is they would actually expel oxygen.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.720
They would get rid of it the way
that we get rid of carbon dioxide.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.800
They would breathe it out and
let it go into the atmosphere.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.340
And that worked fine
for them for a while.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.280
But, unfortunately, enough of these
little critters started building

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.170
up where the oxygen level
started rising in the air.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.200
And once they got to be an
appreciable level they started

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.650
to have some problems,
some big problems.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.270
It would be like nowadays
if all of a sudden a bunch

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.510
of chlorine gas started
flooding the entire Earth,

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.810
you can imagine we would have
a lot of problems breathing

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.780
because it would sear
our lungs, it would start

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.810
to destroy the structures
inside of us.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.620
It was doing the same thing to
these microbes, the oxygen was.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.660
And eventually it built up to such
a high level that it started wiping

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.870 position:56%
out huge swathes of these creatures.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.200
And geologists can go back
and they can see evidence

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.050
of a mass extinction that
was caused by oxygen.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.830
It was called the great
oxygen catastrophe.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.000
So kind of this big, big event that
happened all because of this gas

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.020
that nowadays we associate
very, very closely with life.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.520
But eventually though,
our ancestors,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.090
these microbial ancestors,
did learn to harness oxygen.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.940
They learned to tame it.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.990 position:56%
And what they did basically was
they started treating oxygen the way

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.010
that we treat plutonium
in a nuclear power plant.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.110
So plutonium is a great
thing to have, you know,

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.110
a lot of energy it can give off,

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:23.290
but you have to keep a very
close eye on the plutonium.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.020 position:56%
You can't just have plutonium
sitting wherever you want inside one

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.320
of these power plants.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.340
You have to keep it very tightly
confined to certain areas.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.510
And ourselves eventually
learned to do this with oxygen.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.890
They would harness it.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.430
You kind of keep it -- keep it in
a confined area, but once they did

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.910
that they realized, wow, you know,

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.170
oxygen actually can
do a lot of things.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.750
It's very reactive, very
energetic, and once you learn how

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.810
to harness oxygen that's when you
can get creatures that can do cool,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:58.300
interesting things, creatures
that can run and jump

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.080
and think, creatures a lot like us.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.630
So without this oxygen, you know,
we could have life on Earth,

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.290
but we definitely wouldn't
have the complex,

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.440
dynamic life that we have today.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.180
Oxygen, this poison, is
really what enabled Earth

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.190
to support creatures like us.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:20.810
And nowadays oxygen makes up
about 21% of our atmosphere,

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:25.610 position:56%
so about one of every five molecules
we breathe is an oxygen molecule.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.370
But that number has actually
kind of veered up and down a lot

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.910
over the history of the Earth, the
past few hundred million years.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:38.520
At some times in Earth's history
it's dropped to as low as 15%.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:44.900 position:56%
And when oxygen is just at 15% fires
actually have a really hard time

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.310
starting out in nature.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.050
Even things like lightning strikes

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.810
and volcano eruptions
really can't get fires going

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.040
when oxygen levels are that low.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.000
And in fact, geologists, when they
look at the geological record,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.910
they see no evidence of any
widespread fires anywhere

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.580
in Earth's history until just
a few hundred million years ago

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.640
when oxygen levels finally
built up high enough

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.260
where the atmosphere
could support burning.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.490
So without oxygen we wouldn't
have fires around either.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.950
So that was when oxygen
was at low levels,

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.190
but at other times it's
risen higher, much higher,

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:26.660
something to like 35%
of the atmosphere.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.960
And when oxygen levels are at 35%

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.130
of the atmosphere you can
imagine that fires burn wildly.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.870
You know, even dropping two
rocks, having a little spark

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.790 position:56%
or something go off, all of a sudden
you had this huge conflagration

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.310
with fires burning everywhere.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.050
So when oxygen levels
are that high it's kind

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.060
of a dangerous time to be alive.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.370
It's also kind of a
creepy time to be alive,

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.610
because oxygen levels affect
the evolution of certain animals

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:02.280 position:56%
in a kind of unusual way,
especially the evolution of insects.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.340
So unlike us, insects
really don't have lungs.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:09.260
So they don't -- you
know, we have lungs.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.890
We breathe air in.

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:15.140
It dissolves the oxygen into
our blood and our blood takes it

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.390
around to our inner
cells, our inner organs.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:23.070
Insects don't have lungs that work
quite the same way that we do.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:26.070
Instead of having lungs
that inhale air,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.150
what they have are
these little holes,

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.140
or little pores, on their skin.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.080
And so the oxygen just kind of has

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.980
to passively diffuse
in through their skin.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:42.090
And that works fine for them, it's
okay except, if the insects start

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:47.210
to get too big this passive process
of just letting oxygen flow in,

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:53.300 position:56%
the insects actually struggle to get
oxygen to their deep interior cells.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.720
And that's actually why
insects are always so tiny.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.910
If you've ever wondered, you
know, like we have big birds,

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.980
we have big lizards,
we have big mammals,

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.060
why can't we have really
big insects?

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.810
Well, the answer why is that it's

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.010
because of their inefficient
breathing process.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.540
They have a lot of
trouble getting oxygen

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.520
to their inner cells
if they get too large.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:22.570
But if oxygen levels rise higher,
if they rise to say 35%, well,

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.540
all of a sudden you
can get very, very --

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.390
you can get very, very
large insects suddenly.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.870
And they have seen
in the fossil record,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.810
you can get millipedes
that are a yard long.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.490
You can get dragonflies
the size of seagulls.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.480
You can get spiders
the size of car tires.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.940
Or who knows, you know, someday
we might even find bigger spiders

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.640
out there in the geological record.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.080
We don't really know the limit

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.110
on how big these insects
could have gotten.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.730
So we really should be thankful,
I think, for this nice even kind

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:02.460
of balance we have of oxygen at
about 21%, because we get things

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.670
like fires, we get the
warmth, all that stuff,

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.950 position:56%
but we don't have a dog-sized creepy
crawlies running around either.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.810
It is a nice balance that we have.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.020
So in summary, that was
our four atmospheres.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.660
And if you were paying attention
there you might've noticed

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:21.900
that I said, well, the
nitrogen makes up about 78%

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.730
of our atmosphere,
and the oxygen makes

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.840
up about 21% of our atmosphere.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.750
And if you add those two together
that is already 99% of air.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:39.950
And so you might be thinking,
well, you know, that other 1%,

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.150
it probably can't do
a whole lot, right?

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.700
Like it's just kind of 1%.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.840
It's probably not that important.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.030
Well, not so fast.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:52.290
The analogy I like to make
is with a glass of wine.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:57.160
So a glass of wine is
well over 99% oxygen --

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.860
or excuse me, water molecules
and alcohol molecules.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.060
But if you think a glass of
wine is just water molecules

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.460
and alcohol molecules you're crazy.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.360
There are the overtones of
wine, there's the finish,

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.090
all those other things in that
1% are what make the wine wine.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.730
And it's really the
same way with our air.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.090
That 1% is vitally important.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.260
It gives the overtones
and the finish to our air.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:33.280 position:56%
For instance, all of global warming,
all of it, comes from that 1%.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.120
All odors, all smells, all
scents, things like perfume,

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.180
barbecue sizzling,
fresh-baked bread,

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.640
all of that comes from that 1%.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.110
We would be vastly poorer
without that 1% of our air.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.690
And for the last story
tonight I'm going to look

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.490
at one of the gases in that 1%.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.660
It's a gas you've probably
had in your home

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.640
at some point in your life.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.130 position:56%
It's one of the more important gases
in the history of civilization,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.320
for better and often for worse.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.620
So this story is a story
of rival inventors.

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.700
And these inventors were
working on home appliances.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.750
And like most stories of rival
inventors, it's a story of winners,

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.550
and it's a story of losers.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:23.900
And I'm going to get to
the winners in the moment,

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.330
but right now I'm going
to focus on the losers.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:33.180
I'm going to especially focus on
the big, big loser in this story.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.180
It's a man you might recognize,
kind of famous historically,

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.840
the big loser in this story.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:45.490
So get ready to boo, get ready
to hiss, yeah, Albert Einstein.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:49.310 position:56%
Now, of course, we don't think about
Albert Einstein as a big loser,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.690
and we definitely don't think about
him as a home appliances guru,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:57.090
but in this story he
was actually both.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.490
So one morning, 1926, Einstein
is reading the newspaper

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.750
when he almost choked on his eggs.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.340
It turned out that an
entire family in Berlin,

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.320
including several children, had
died because of their refrigerator.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.050
Refrigerators back then used
poisonous gases as coolants,

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:21.720
things like ammonia, methyl
chloride, sulfur dioxide and,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.400 position:56%
unfortunately, they often had spotty
motors with bad seals on them.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.740
The seals would crack,
they would break,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.540
these toxic gases would
leak out into the apartment.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.500
And if it was tightly sealed enough
it would suffocate everyone inside.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.660
And, unfortunately, this was
a kind of common occurrence.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.800
And so Einstein called
up a scientist friend

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.370
of his named Leo Szilard.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:45.670
You can se4e him in
the picture here.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.450
And he had kind of this lump
in his throat and he said,

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:53.720
there must be a better way,
and it turned out there was.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.360
So in the book I get into a little
bit more about the details here,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.500
but just briefly this is
how a refrigerator works.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.520
So imagine taking a
casserole, you know,

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.380
putting it in your
refrigerator to let it cool down.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.940
If you were to tear
the inner panels off

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.030
of your fridge you would see a
series of tubes inside there.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:16.090
These tubes have a
liquid inside them

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.480
that has a very low boiling point,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.290
which means it turns
into a gas very easily.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.980
And as your casserole starts
to give off heat the liquid

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:30.370
in the tubes absorbs the heat,
starts to boil, turns into a gas,

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.030
and that's good, because
having a gas gives you lots

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.470
of different options.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:41.220
For one thing, gases are really,
really good at absorbing energy.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.290
So they can suck up a lot
of heat from this casserole.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.270
The other great thing about
gas is, is that they're mobile.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.420
They can move very easily.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.970
So after the liquid turns
into a gas it starts

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.110
to float away inside these tubes,

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.720
and eventually it winds its
way behind your refrigerator.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.920
And if you've ever been behind
a refrigerator while it's

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.330
on you might've noticed that
it's a little warm back there

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.070
and get a little hot in the
back of your refrigerator.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.910
What's happening is that the
gas that has taken the heat

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:15.780
from inside your fridge is
now dumping it out back.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.570
The warmth is coming from
the gas dumping heat.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.820
And that's basically the
art of refrigeration,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.700
is the art of manipulating
gases to take heat

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.970
from one place inside the fridge,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.070
move it to another place
outside the fridge.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.240
So that's basically
how refrigerators work.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.670
Now to work continuously in a
cycle and to keep things cold

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:43.040
over a long period, eventually the
fridge has to turn that gas back

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.540
into a liquid, and here's where
Einstein solved the problem.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.050 position:56%
One of the tricks that
refrigerators use to turn gases back

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.970
into liquids is they
use a compressor.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.400
Basically it's just a piston
that squishes the gases down

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.750
and applies pressure to them.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.250
If you've ever heard the hum, the
[humming sound], of refrigerators,

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.100
that's the compressor, that's
the motor running the compressor.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.910
But, unfortunately,
as I said before,

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.410
motors back then had
bad seals on them.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:12.710
They would crack.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.930
All these gases would leak out.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.290
They would kill people
in the apartment.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.710
So what Einstein did,
and his friend Szilard,

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.820 position:56%
they came up with some alternatives.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.690
And actually they came up
with three different types

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.560
of alternative refrigerators.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:32.020
The first one they came up with was
a very small scale refrigerator.

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.550
It still use a gas and
a liquid is a coolant,

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.300
but it was actually
powered by tap water.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.810
So you would turn on
your kitchen sink

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.980
and it would power this
little tiny refrigerator.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.240
Very innovative, very interesting.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.560
Einstein thought it would
be for poor families,

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.860
ones who couldn't afford
a full refrigerator.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.130
And it had this long king of
metal wand coming out of it.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.150
And what you did is you took your,
you know, mug of water or beer

00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.590
or whatever, and you took this wand
and you plunged it inside the mug

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.880
and it would cool things
down very quickly.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.010
And again, Einstein thought this
would be great for poor people.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.380
It would be very widespread
in Germany and Europe.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.290
And so he came up with
a great name for it.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:16.100
He called it [inaudible], which
means the people's fridge.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.770
And I love that name,
the people's fridge.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.470
So that was the first one,

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.230
was the people's fridge,
a very simple device.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.890
The second refrigerator that he

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:30.100
and Szilard invented went the
complete opposite direction

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.850
in that it was a super
complicated, intricate device.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.490
It had all these valves and
pumps and cooling lines in it.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:41.670
There were these huge
electromagnetic coils in it.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.500
It was pumping molten sodium
up and down during part of it.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.100
As you can imagine, this
was a little bit impractical

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.460
of your average kitchen
in the 1920's,

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.970
to have these huge molten sodium
pumps kind of running around in it.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:25:00.960
So it never really had any use as
an appliance, but in a few decades

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.360
after that it actually found use
in the nuclear power industry

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.740
where they would use it to
cool some nuclear power plant.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:14.450
So even a few decades before
nuclear power existed, Einstein

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.180
and Szilard had invented
a way to cool the plant.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.640
So that was kind of interesting.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.780
But the third fridge, the third
fridge is the one they really

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.580 position:56%
thought was going to be the big hit.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.310
It had three different gases
inside it that it used as coolant.

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:31.310
So a very intricate system there.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:35.720
And it was powered by
methane, by natural gas.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.880
And the key part about
this refrigerator is

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.420
that it had no motor.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.140
It didn't use any electricity.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.180
So it was completely silent.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.040
And because it had no motor
there was no weak spot.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.590
There were no seals
to crack and break

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.990
and start leaking toxic gases
out into your apartment.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.340
They could seal everything

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.840
up very tightly behind
thick sheets of metal.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.840
So this refrigerator they invented
was suddenly very, very safe.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.410
And now at this point you might
be thinking, I mean, come on,

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.890
this is Albert Einstein, like
the guy who invented relativity.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.280
How much time was he
actually spending dinking

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.260
around on refrigerators?

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.530
And the answer is, well,
kind of a lot of time.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.860 position:56%
Again, he and Szilard invented three
different types of refrigerators.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:30.000
And they filed for patents for them
in several different countries.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.740
And as you can imagine, there
were a lot of patent lawyers

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.580
in these countries who
were a little surprised.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.080 position:56%
They would get the patent for, you
know, this new type of refrigerator.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.290
They would start flipping through
it and then they would come

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.810
to the signature line and
they would say, wait a second,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.200
Albert Einstein, that
Albert Einstein?

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.700
Well, you know, sure enough,
it was that Albert Einstein.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.640
He had already revolutionized
our concept of space time,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.290
why not revolutionize our
concept of home appliances?

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.270
It makes perfect sense.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:27:00.420
And there was another reason
Einstein was very interested

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:06.190
in these refrigerators, kind of an
age old reason, and that was money.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.250
Albert Einstein needed money.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.910
He was living in Berlin
between the world wars

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:15.190
when inflation was
completely out of control.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:19.440
At one point a loaf of bread,
just a single loaf of bread,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.180
cost a billion Deutschmarks.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.260
So inflation was out of
control, the economy was

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.080
in shambles, Einstein needed money.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.540
He'd also sort of recklessly
divorced his first wife,

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.490
married another woman, he
had two families to support,

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:36.570
so he needed some cash
quick and he really thought

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.130
that these refrigerators were
going to be his meal ticket.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:43.380
But there was just one problem,

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.870
those rivals that I
mentioned before.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.540
Because it turns out, a few
chemists at General Motors

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.810
in Michigan were messing
around in the lab one day

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:56.310
when they invented a
new gas called Freon.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:00.370
It turns out that Freon had a
very low boiling temperature,

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.800
so it could cool things
like casseroles very well.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.450
It was completely --
it was very cheap

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:07.750
to make, so that's always good.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.090
And it was completely non-toxic.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.430
So refrigerator makers could keep
their old designs, they didn't have

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:17.570
to switch to this fancy
Einstein design,

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:21.780
they could keep their old
designs, swap in the Freon

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.620
and things would work just as well.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.640
Because, you know, your motor might
break down, the Freon might leak

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.920
out in your apartment, but
it was completely non-toxic

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.310
so it didn't matter.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:35.450
So no one ended up
using Einstein's design.

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:37.960
Nothing ever came of
it and it never ended

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.680
up in anyone's home unfortunately.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.680
And this would have just been kind
of a curious footnote to the life

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:51.610
of Albert Einstein except for one
thing, that magical Freon gas,

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:56.450
as you can see here, the atoms
inside of it are chlorine atoms,

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.560
fluorine atoms, and carbon atoms.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.090
It is a chlorofluorocarbon, a CFC.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.770
And if there little hairs rising
on the back of your neck right now,

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.020
that is for a good reason.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.980
Remember the hole in the
ozone layer, well CFC's,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.640
chlorofluorocarbons like this,

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.650
were the ones that ate the
hole in the ozone layer.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.110
People would take their
refrigerators, they would dump them

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:26.060
in junkyards, eventually
something would puncture the tank,

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.560
all these chlorofluorocarbons
would leak out,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.380
they would go into the atmosphere,
and they would start gobbling

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.640
up all of the ozone there.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.770
They are responsible for
the hole in the ozone layer.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.390
And most people don't know it,

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:44.910
but chlorofluorocarbons are also
horrendous greenhouse gases.

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:50.080
Molecule by molecule they absorb
thousands of times more heat

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.110
than a molecule of
carbon dioxide does.

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:58.190
CFC's account for just parts per
billion of our atmosphere, so very,

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.410
very small parts per billion.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.260
But they also account
for a full one quarter

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.680 position:56%
of all human induced global warming.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.140
So the world could have saved
itself a heck of a lot of trouble

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.260
in the long run if we had just gone

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.800
with Albert Einstein
and the people's fridge.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.100
And that kind of brings
us full circle here,

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.860
because at the beginning of
the talk I was, you know,

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.400
mentioning volcanoes, how they
were spewing up these hot, nasty,

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.590
reactive gases into the atmosphere,
things like carbon dioxide, well,

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.870
nowadays we're putting carbon
dioxide and some other kind

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.120
of nasty gases back
into the atmosphere.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.450
Our air has changed in the
past, and it's changing again.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.050
The air is not the same air today

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.840
that our ancestors
breathed 250 years ago.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.510
And it's probably not
going to be the same air

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.070
that our descendants breathe
250 years in the future.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:56.140
We could be seeing the emergence
of a fifth distinct atmosphere.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.420
Now, I spoke before about how
you can inhale the history

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.780
of the world every
time you take a breath.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:06.160
Well, in a lot of ways that
history is still being written.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.680
Early change was driven by
volcanoes, then later by microbes,

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.760
nowadays it's human beings.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.080
We've inherited a big,
big responsibility,

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.150
and as a result the air is kind
of a controversial topic nowadays.

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:24.360 position:56%
And again, we pay more attention to
solids and liquids than we do gases,

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.900
but I hope that people in
the future have the luxury

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.140
to take it air granted as well.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:34.850
But the first step to preserving
air is understanding the air,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:39.260
to notice the air, to notice
those little stories flitting

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.740
around in front you,
coursing into and out

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.580
of your lungs every
time you take a breath.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.870
You have to make those
invisible stories visible,

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.800
the way your breath is visible
on a crisp November morning.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.540
And I hope the talk tonight,

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.320
and I specially hope Caesar's
Last Breath can help you do that.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.890
You know, pure air is odorless.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.190
Pure air is colorless.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.550
And by itself it sounds like
nothing, but that doesn't mean

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:12.650
that it's mute, that
it has no voice.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:17.970
Air is actually burning to tell
its story if we just listen.

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:19.640
So again, thank you all
for coming out tonight.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.440
I appreciate it.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:27.250
[ Applause ]

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.550
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:32.660
And I think we have time for
questions if anyone has some.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.930
A little hard for me to
see, but okay, right there.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:37.980
&gt;&gt; I was wondering where you
get your story ideas from.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.620
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: So she asked where
I get the story ideas from.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:44.360
I pray every night for new
story ideas, I don't know.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.450
They come out of nowhere.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.810
With the books, especially though,
what I try to do is I want there

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.280
to be a central scientific topic.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.190
You know, I wrote a book
about the periodic table,

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:57.260
about the human genome,
the brain, the atmosphere,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.980
but I want to be able to branch
out into a lot of different things.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.370
I don't want to just be
confined to sort of the science

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.100
or the lab work or
something like that.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.000
So I want to make sure they are
really good stories out there,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.710
and that's really what I focus on.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:17.240
I'm looking for drama, conflict,
heroes, villains, things like that.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.350
And beyond that, about, you know,
getting the details and things,

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.770
it's just a lot of reading, a lot
of hunting through footnotes and,

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:27.730
you know, reading as widely
as I can, reading fiction,

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:31.020 position:56%
reading other genres, things I maybe
wouldn't think I'd be interested in,

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.820
just picking them up, reading them,
and seeing what pops into my head.

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.710
&gt;&gt; How did you get the
idea for this book?

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.090
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: For this book,
a few different things.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.620
I had heard a few stories about
the atmosphere, things I wanted

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.270
to get into, like the
Einstein refrigerator,

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.140
things about different gases.

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.680
And then just knowing air
is a controversial topic,

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.050
it's topical nowadays,
people are interested in it,

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:53.770
but we really do take
it for granted.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.480
So that ability to kind of make
people appreciate, to see the air,

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.540
and then the stories in there
was an appealing combination.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.010
Oh, we'll go there and then.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:06.000
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.510

tell me I can repeat it.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:54.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:57.340
So yeah, the atmosphere, it
depends on kind of where you want

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.800
to cut it off, because there are
different layers in the atmosphere.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.510
So it depends on where
you want to cut it off.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:12.550
[ Inaudible ]

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:16.790 position:56%
Okay, so I'll take the second first.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:21.250
That would be hard because
the atmosphere is much thicker

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:22.550
down here.

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:24.510
So it would be hard to like
get that turnover going.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:29.140
And I think the pollution
would just kind

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.560
of eventually work its way down.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.440
So I don't think that
would really work.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.380
But you do make a good point,
that there are, you know,

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.500
some good things going on
in the atmosphere, too.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.020
The air we breathe nowadays
is a lot cleaner in some ways

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.620
than the air we were breathing,
you know, 20, 30 years ago.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.760
So we have done a very good
job of getting rid of a lot

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.710
of pollutants, things like that.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.260
And the ozone layer has started
to come back in some cases.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.810
In some areas it has shrunk.

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.580
We've provided that cover again.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.550
So there are good stories out there
nowadays, a lot less acid rain

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.960
for instance, things like that.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.900
But there are other things we're
still struggling with a lot, too.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.980
So it's kind of improving in some
ways, not improving in others.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.780
So there's hope out there.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:13.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.010
Eliminating COC --
CFC's is one reason.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.710
And then ozone builds
up naturally in the air.

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.720
So if you just give it time
eventually it will start

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.020
to form more.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:28.870
In your, sort of [inaudible]
account, shall we say,

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:32.250
you mentioned oxygen suddenly
appeared on the scene.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.290
I never quite heard
where it came from,

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.840
but my understanding
is it came from plants.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.760
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: So oxygen when
it first started to appear

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.330
on the scene actually
came from microbes.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.630
&gt;&gt; Right, right.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.930
But the photosynthesis process.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.230
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Photo --
it was photosynthesis.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a type of plant.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.830
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.130
&gt;&gt; Where did they come from?

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.430
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Where did they come?

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.970
So the microbes were -- the
microbes appeared fairly early

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:52.990
in Earth's history,
and then eventually,

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.390
no one knows quite what happened,

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.910
they got the ability
to photosynthesize.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:00.390
So it's just a long process
of, you know, incremental steps

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.700
where they finally built up
the chlorophyll molecules,

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.630
got the ability to photosynthesize,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:08.220
and then they would expel
the oxygen as it a pollutant.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.520
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.820
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Yeah.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:17.580
&gt;&gt; With the pollution we got
with, you know, the fuel we use,

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:22.570
the fossil fuels, and then we
have all the animals and stuff,

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.900
it seems like a lot of people
are suppressing the information

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:30.340
that fossil fuels are causing a
bigger problem than the methane gas

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.130
that the animals produce.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.360
What -- you know, the
greenhouse gas thing.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.400
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Yeah, I mean, both
of them are contributing to it,

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.980
but fossil fuels and, you know,
vehicles and industrial production,

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:43.850
cement production actually produces
lots of -- lots of pollutants.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.400
So there's lots of industry
things going into it, yeah.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.570
&gt;&gt; But then what I'm saying is
that I think we need to concentrate

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.930
on the aspect of like the
animals and the methane like that,

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:55.230
you know what I'm saying?

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cows and other domesticated
animals do produce a lot of methane.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.390
And there are people who
are trying to fix it.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:04.630
You see -- like I saw these
pictures the other day of cows

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.820
with big backpacks on them
where it was trying to suck

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.930
up the methane that they produce.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.970
You can imagine where
all the tubes went.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.060
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: There are people
working on this problem.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.620
Or, you know, probably a
more realistic solution is

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.760
to add something to the feed that
can help break the methane down,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.570
or to -- the methane is produced
actually by bacteria in their gut.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:27.250
So if you could have
another bacteria

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.230
that could break the methane down,

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.650
there are scientists
working on the problem.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:37.080
&gt;&gt; I was curious, how did
you come up with your title?

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.440
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Well, I
didn't come up with some

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.270
of the titles for the books.

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:45.300
With this one, I should actually
go to that slide if you like.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.270
So actually it's kind
of a classic problem

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:52.010
for physics and chemistry students.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.570
They ask them, what are the odds

00:38:54.570 --> 00:39:00.160
that your breathing right now a
molecule the Julius Caesar breathed

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.620
during his last breath
when he got assassinated?

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.210
And your first thought might
be, well, that seems impossible.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.870
There's no way any of Caesar's
last breath is still around.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:13.620
I mean, he died over 2000 years ago

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.890
and anything he exhaled would
have just been like smeared

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.290
around the entire atmosphere.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:21.680
Like the atmosphere is so
big compared to a breath

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.120
that the answer has to be zero.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.150
It has to have disappeared by now.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.380
But if you start to look
at it and like drill

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.180
down to the nitty gritty details,
it turns out that there are

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:36.340
so many molecules in every
breath we take, there are 25,

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:42.230
that's 25 sextillion molecules,
that's a 25 with 21 zeros after it.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:46.720
There are so many molecules in
every breath we take that you start

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.320
to maybe think, well, you know,
that's a lot of molecules.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.220
Like maybe some of
them are still around,

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.670
because most of them were nitrogen
molecules, which as I mentioned,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.360
stick around for a
very, very long time.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.920 position:56%
So the question basically comes down
to, well, which is going to win,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.200
that really big number or
the really small number

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:09.150
which is how big one breath is
compared to the overall atmosphere?

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.010
And it turns out that if you do
the math, go through all of it,

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:17.060 position:56%
those two numbers cancel out almost
exactly, and it turns out that we --

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.520
every single time we take a breath
we inhale about one molecule

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.410
that Caesar did during his
last breath while he was

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:25.840
being assassinated.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.320
So we have this direct
material connection to someone

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.150
like Julius Caesar every
single time we take a breath.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.490
We are still inhaling
the same air that he did.

00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:39.020
And, you know, it doesn't have
to be Julius Caesar either.

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:42.460
You can talk about Amelia
Earhart or Confucius

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:46.330
or Jumbo the giant circus elephant,
like any creature that ever lived

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:49.130
and breathed in the
history of planet Earth,

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.310
we are still inhaling the
same air that they did.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:56.440
So air is one thing that really
unites all of human beings,

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.950
and it really connects us to our
past in a direct material way.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:03.280
So that's why I chose it as
the title story for this book.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.770
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Do we
have time for one more?

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.260
We'll do one more, all right.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:13.130
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering about
how the atmosphere is changing,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.320
it's changing global warming,
but how does it affect us,

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.860
our evolution, changes
in [inaudible]?

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.390
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: How does
it affect our evolution?

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.690
&gt;&gt; How would it?

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:22.990
&gt;&gt; Sam Kean: Okay, and
I should say, you know,

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.290
I'll be around for a
few minutes afterwards.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:26.280
So if you are -- if you're too
shy, you have a burning question,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.560
I'll be sticking around
for a little bit at least.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.520
How it affects our evolution?

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.300
Well, it probably hasn't affected
our evolution too much yet,

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.420
but you can imagine it in the
future affecting our evolution

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.770
in some different ways.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.330
You know, if pollutants start
to build up we are going to have

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.190
to become resistant
to those pollutants.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:48.530
If the temperature increases
a lot we're going to have

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:50.270 position:56%
to be more resistant to temperature.

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.350
If water become scarce we're
going to have to be better at,

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:54.650
you know, being dehydrated.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.950
Things like that.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:42:01.280
You do start to see evolution of
human beings in air with people

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.500
who live on mountain tops
in Tibet and other places.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:10.200
They have a -- they have an
enhanced ability to breathe in --

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.030
or I should say, they have a
more efficient breathing process,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.440
and they also have some
other biochemical changes

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.090
that you can see directly in their
genes because they've just had

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.170
to adapt to living
at higher elevations.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:27.530
So if we have to escape
to the mountains someday

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:29.890
because it's too hot at sea level,

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:31.540
it could be another
adaptation we have.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.520
So you probably will see
some changes in human beings

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.580
over the course of the next
few millennia, unfortunately.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.470
But, again, I think that's it,
but thank you all for coming out.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:42.270
I appreciate it.

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:49.910
[ Applause ]

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.800

of the Library of Congress.
