00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.469
As Eames said,
the details make the design.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.020
Motion can be an opportunity
to provide delight and

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.970
make a connection with your user.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.170
They can also bring
personality to your app.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.710
After all, animating literally
means bringing to life.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.280
Whenever an element changes state
this is a great opportunity to

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.580
animate this change.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.460
This helps both to explain what is
changing and can direct attention.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.900
This technique isn't restricted
to larger blocks of your UI.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.390
Animating small details
eases the transition.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.120
Take a look at these examples.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.190
The clock up here runs an animation
whenever we switch tab.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.500
This helps to communicate
the tab's purpose.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.230
PocketCasts here animates the transition
between the play and pause states.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.340
And here the Google I/O app, when we
reach the bottom, it animates the logo.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.620
Now these last two might not
provide extra functionality.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.010
These small details bring
a smile to your face and

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.430
make the experience of using
the app more enjoyable.
