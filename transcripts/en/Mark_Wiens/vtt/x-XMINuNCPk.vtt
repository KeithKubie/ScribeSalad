00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:01.701
- Oh, it is detached.

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:03.135
Okay.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:04.576
Oh, wow.

00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:06.140
It's absolutely superb.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.473
I'm just gonna eat that all in one bite.

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.924
(upbeat music)

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:18.463
Good morning, everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:18.463 --> 00:00:21.709
with migrationology.com in Hong Kong.

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:24.047
This is our last day of the trip,

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:26.051
our final day in Hong Kong.

00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:29.218
This evening, we fly back
to Bangkok back home,

00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.863
and so today, this morning,
I thought it would be

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:35.035
a fantastic idea to take a little trip

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.872
to the Aberdeen fish market,
which is on the opposite side

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.621
of Hong Kong Island from the city,

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:43.346
and go there to eat seafood.

00:00:43.346 --> 00:00:46.125
I just could not resist the opportunity

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:47.942
to go one more food adventure

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.440
on this round-the-world trip for food.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.254
The bus station should
be just up ahead now.

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:55.837
(mellow music)

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.123
- [both] Thank you.

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:05.997
- This is bus 69X, I
think it's an express bus,

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:07.290
and it's more like a-

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.192
It's more of a minibus,

00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:13.308
and we should be at the
Aberdeen fish market very soon.

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:15.131
(mumbles)

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:16.234
What was that?
- over air.

00:01:16.234 --> 00:01:17.151
- Over air.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:35.096
Driving underneath the mountain.

00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:40.864
Thank you.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.910
That literally only took exactly
seven minutes to get here,

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.878
and just like that, we
drove under a tunnel

00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:52.130
under the mountain, and we
are on the opposite side

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.797
of Hong Kong Island.

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:01.500
Aberdeen fish market

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440
is one of the main fish
markets in Hong Kong.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.623
This is where a lot of
the seafood comes in,

00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:07.727
and a lot of the seafood here

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.097
then is distributed around Hong Kong,

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.152
but I'm glad to be here.

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:13.917
We're gonna try to go to the
canteen, the restaurant first

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.449
before it gets too busy.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.013
We're here pretty early right now,

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.043
and then after that, hopefully
walk around the fish market

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:20.126
a little bit.

00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:28.459
Navigating our way through
the road of trucks.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.039
These are all ice or fridge trucks

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.956
that are distributing
seafood around Hong Kong.

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:48.281
We walked around the fish
market for a little bit.

00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:50.564
A little bit confused, it's really wet,

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:51.987
and they are just carting around,

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:56.235
just tanks full of fresh
seafood, and fish, and lobsters,

00:02:56.235 --> 00:02:58.228
and crabs, and lots of shrimp,

00:02:58.228 --> 00:02:59.936
and I was a little bit confused.

00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:02.704
I'm not sure which one
is the actual restaurant.

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:04.097
I'm not sure if there's
more than one restaurant,

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:04.950
or if there's only one restaurant,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.892
but we've stepped in here.

00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:07.624
They said this one is the canteen,

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:09.795
and this is a seafood restaurant,

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.574
which is literally right in the middle.

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:12.430
It's an indoor restaurant,

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.465
but it's right in the
middle of the fish market.

00:03:14.465 --> 00:03:17.164
Just outside, there
are lots of fish tanks,

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.774
and there's an aquarium of seafood,

00:03:18.774 --> 00:03:20.729
and right next to the ocean.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.786
The boats are docking right out there.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:25.146
They do have just a limited English menu,

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:26.862
but this set, it looks almost exactly

00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:28.965
like what I wanted to eat anyway.

00:03:28.965 --> 00:03:32.570
For two, 598 Hong Kong
Dollars include steamed fish,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.070
scallops, abalone,

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:36.587
crab.

00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:38.600
Seasonal vegetables, actually
this might be perfect.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.767
I think we might just got
for this set right here.

00:03:49.406 --> 00:03:51.447
The first dish that has come out

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:53.882
is the salt and pepper fried abalone.

00:03:53.882 --> 00:03:56.138
(laughs) I'm so excited to eat this,

00:03:56.138 --> 00:04:00.270
and you can see that
beautiful abalone shell,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.156
and then they have taken it out,

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:05.689
and maybe it's lightly battered,
and then deep-fried it.

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.651
As tempted as I am to eat
the entire thing in one bite,

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.818
I think it would be best
since there are only-

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.176
since I'm only having one
of them, to eat half of it,

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:17.009
and then we can see what's inside.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.079
It's very similar to a scallop.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:30.382
It's like meaty and a little bit chewy.

00:04:30.382 --> 00:04:32.908
You can really taste the
black pepper on it too.

00:04:32.908 --> 00:04:36.056
I'm not really sure what are
all those little crispy bits,

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:38.280
but maybe it's like caramelized,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.835
really, really crispy garlic.

00:04:40.835 --> 00:04:42.203
I'm not totally sure,

00:04:42.203 --> 00:04:45.120
but this is a lovely fresh abalone.

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:53.861
Oh, abalone.

00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.361
You are wonderful.

00:04:58.182 --> 00:04:59.015
Thank you.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.162
I think most of the main
dishes have just arrived.

00:05:03.162 --> 00:05:05.138
This food looks spectacular.

00:05:05.138 --> 00:05:08.362
The two main dishes are a
steamed fish, and a fried crab,

00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:10.791
both of which smell and look incredible.

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:12.364
I'm gonna begin with the fish,

00:05:12.364 --> 00:05:15.240
and I'm not totally sure
what type of fish it was.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.796
At first, I thought-

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:18.074
take a look the eye.

00:05:18.074 --> 00:05:19.782
First I thought it was a grouper,

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:22.319
but now it's looks kind
of like a circular fish,

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.803
and a grouper is more of a-

00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:25.988
but the skin looks like a grouper,

00:05:25.988 --> 00:05:26.821
unless it's butterfly cut.

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:27.801
I don't think so.

00:05:27.801 --> 00:05:28.918
One more dish arrived

00:05:28.918 --> 00:05:30.280
as I was about to take
a bite off the fish.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.423
I had forgotten about the scallops.

00:05:32.423 --> 00:05:34.066
How could I forget about the scallops?

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:35.738
Back to my bite of fish,

00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:38.139
and I'm gonna reach in
for this piece here.

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.211
Look at all the shredded
green onions in here,

00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:43.628
and I love that soy sauce, steamed sauce.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:48.299
It looks incredible with
that swirl of fish oils.

00:05:48.299 --> 00:05:49.132
Okay.

00:05:58.554 --> 00:06:00.188
Wow.

00:06:00.188 --> 00:06:02.359
All that fish just melts in your mouth.

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:06.725
It's like silky smooth,
and just dissolves.

00:06:06.725 --> 00:06:08.517
This fish is so good.

00:06:08.517 --> 00:06:11.775
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take a little bit more of it

00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:15.531
to experience more, and
get some of that juice,

00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:17.106
and put it onto my rice.

00:06:17.106 --> 00:06:20.254
Set this right on top of my mountain-

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:24.421
my cup shape of rice, which
I haven't even started yet.

00:06:27.428 --> 00:06:30.533
Steamed fish is one of
my absolute favorite ways

00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:31.713
to eat fish,

00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:34.134
and fish happens to be
one of my favorite foods,

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:37.076
and that is incredibly fresh.

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:40.089
It is an incredibly good fish.

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:41.780
I love how they have prepared it.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.305
Not too salty, but just really
focusing on the freshness

00:06:44.305 --> 00:06:45.332
of that fish.

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:46.553
I'm gonna follow that with a bite of-

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:48.282
I think this is Bok Choy,

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:49.264
and there are mushrooms in here.

00:06:49.264 --> 00:06:52.931
There are pieces of
ginger, and also garlic.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.933
Really nice with the ginger.

00:06:57.933 --> 00:06:59.440
I'm gonna take a piece of the ginger,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.176
and then also a clove of garlic,

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:04.009
which has been fried and withered.

00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:07.471
Oh yeah.

00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:08.722
Oh, ginger.

00:07:08.722 --> 00:07:10.101
Ginger is a wonderful thing.

00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:12.790
Since the scallops have just
arrived fresh from the kitchen,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.002
I'm gonna take this opportunity
to eat it immediately.

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.421
It's topped with mung bean noodles.

00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.772
I'm guessing that's garlic.

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:19.736
There are green onions on here,

00:07:19.736 --> 00:07:22.871
and I'm not sure exactly
how the scallop is.

00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:24.764
I think it's still attached.

00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:27.394
It's down there below,
so maybe I'll pick it up

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:30.371
and slurp the noodles first,

00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:31.625
and then eat the scallop.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:34.534
I want to make sure to get lots of garlic.

00:07:34.534 --> 00:07:35.367
Oh, yes.

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.602
It's a really strong garlic flavor,

00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:48.275
but at the same time it's not
like a burning garlic flavor.

00:07:48.275 --> 00:07:50.113
And again, it's not too salty,

00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:53.653
but just so delicately flavorful.

00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:54.890
Here's the scallop.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.126
Oh, it is detached.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:57.565
Okay.

00:07:57.565 --> 00:07:58.723
Oh, wow.

00:07:58.723 --> 00:08:00.492
It's absolutely superb.

00:08:00.492 --> 00:08:03.825
I'm just gonna eat that all in one bite.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.477
That is sensational.

00:08:15.397 --> 00:08:17.564
That scallop is so tender.

00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:21.228
It's so sweet.

00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:24.873
I need to drink the rest of this.

00:08:31.403 --> 00:08:33.217
That scallop was ridiculous.

00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:35.300
I love how it's prepared.

00:08:36.337 --> 00:08:38.761
Very similar tasting
to the fish, actually,

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:40.821
but just the beauty of that scallop,

00:08:40.821 --> 00:08:44.008
the freshness, the sweetness of it.

00:08:44.008 --> 00:08:45.322
It was so tender.

00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:48.451
That brings us to the final
dish, which is the crab,

00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:50.126
which has been-

00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:51.723
I think it's been stir-fried
with lots of ginger

00:08:51.723 --> 00:08:52.909
and green onions,

00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:55.195
and this is the top shell here.

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:57.503
There are some claws below here.

00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:00.951
Maybe I'll just begin
with this guy right here,

00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:01.784
and yeah,

00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:05.617
I'm just going right
into this crab drumstick.

00:09:13.655 --> 00:09:17.822
Again, I can taste the ginger,
embedded into that crab meat.

00:09:18.843 --> 00:09:21.097
It's like flaky crab.

00:09:21.097 --> 00:09:22.589
It's naturally sweet again.

00:09:22.589 --> 00:09:24.237
There's some raw there too.

00:09:24.237 --> 00:09:26.154
I better slurp that up.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.515
Me, try to break this guy in half

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:35.182
to reveal the rest of that crab.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.863
Maybe, reach in with my chopsticks here.

00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:44.638
Look at that.

00:09:44.638 --> 00:09:47.721
Look at the stringiness of that crab.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.924
That crab is so sweet,

00:09:52.924 --> 00:09:54.976
and so stringy.

00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:56.226
It's wonderful.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.068
Let me get some more of this fish.

00:10:00.068 --> 00:10:02.735
This fish is just insanely good.

00:10:04.539 --> 00:10:05.793
I'm still not sure what
type of fish it is.

00:10:05.793 --> 00:10:08.543
Could it be a flounder, possibly?

00:10:10.383 --> 00:10:12.133
Add a bit more and...

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:19.096
That was a

00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:22.684
memorable seafood meal.

00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:24.626
Every dish was so good,

00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:27.937
and I have now come to my
final trophy possession

00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:29.134
of the meal.

00:10:29.134 --> 00:10:30.861
The last crab claw,

00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:32.633
and this is gonna be-

00:10:32.633 --> 00:10:34.424
Yeah, everything is gone.

00:10:34.424 --> 00:10:36.828
It is a sad but joyful moment.

00:10:36.828 --> 00:10:38.151
Also, this meal,

00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:42.318
it was just the absolute,
perfect amount for Ying and I.

00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:45.583
Let's see if-

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:49.779
Let me see if I can peel
this in a pretty manner.

00:10:49.779 --> 00:10:51.303
Ying, I might need your help.

00:10:51.303 --> 00:10:53.386
Look at that last beauty.

00:10:54.634 --> 00:10:56.717
(laughs)

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.703
Stunning.

00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:11.699
This crab is so sweet.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.753
All right.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.411
We still have dessert, I
think, on that set menu.

00:11:27.411 --> 00:11:29.254
I actually completely forgot about it.

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:32.161
I was so engulfed within that seafood.

00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:35.239
I'm not a desserts guy, but
since this dessert was included

00:11:35.239 --> 00:11:37.489
in our set meal, we got it.

00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:40.742
Wow.

00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.198
It's quite a structure.

00:11:42.198 --> 00:11:45.509
This is some kind of toast,
but they are in cubes,

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:46.939
and then it's drizzled-

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:48.122
Maybe, they're deep-fried.

00:11:48.122 --> 00:11:49.997
It looks coated in some kind of,

00:11:49.997 --> 00:11:52.902
maybe an egg batter or
something, and then fried it.

00:11:52.902 --> 00:11:55.441
There are just literally
like little cubes of butter,

00:11:55.441 --> 00:11:57.104
which are just slowly melting,

00:11:57.104 --> 00:12:00.354
and swirling within the condensed milk.

00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:02.100
Wow.

00:12:03.061 --> 00:12:06.972
I'm gonna go for this piece
right down here on the bottom.

00:12:06.972 --> 00:12:07.971
(laughs)

00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:11.408
It almost look like cubes of tofu.

00:12:11.408 --> 00:12:14.112
I'm pretty sure it's bread though.

00:12:14.112 --> 00:12:15.975
Let me take this piece.

00:12:15.975 --> 00:12:19.091
Wow, and there's even
butter on the inside here.

00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:20.512
It's just dripping as I-

00:12:20.512 --> 00:12:22.679
I better eat it right now.

00:12:30.552 --> 00:12:31.385
Wow.

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:37.137
That is pretty good.

00:12:37.137 --> 00:12:38.499
It's french toast, I think.

00:12:38.499 --> 00:12:40.457
It's pieces of bread,

00:12:40.457 --> 00:12:43.048
or cubes of bread that have been dumped,

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:45.182
or soaked in egg, and then fried.

00:12:45.182 --> 00:12:46.015
I think the sweetness

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.865
is mostly just coming
from that condensed milk,

00:12:47.865 --> 00:12:51.161
but it is just oozing with butter.

00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:51.994
That is for sure.

00:12:51.994 --> 00:12:54.339
There might even be some
peanut butter in here.

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:57.200
I'm getting a little bit of nuttiness.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.226
I liked that better that I
thought I was gonna like it.

00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:03.635
Following that with hot Chinese tea.

00:13:03.635 --> 00:13:04.635
That's good.

00:13:05.563 --> 00:13:07.970
If you like french toast,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.515
I think this might be the
ultimate french toast.

00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:13.753
It is actually incredibly good,

00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:15.003
and so buttery.

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:20.920
Ying and I just finished
with seafood meal.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.580
What I really loved so much is that

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.144
they cooked things just
perfectly, not everything-

00:13:26.144 --> 00:13:28.746
Nothing was too salty, and
it really, really focused

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:32.204
and highlighted on the
freshness of that seafood.

00:13:32.204 --> 00:13:35.895
The steamed fish in particular
was probably my favorite,

00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:38.930
but actually everything was
good, including the scallop,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.330
and that crab.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.983
Coming out here to the
Aberdeen fish market

00:13:41.983 --> 00:13:45.270
was well worth it for that seafood meal,

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.070
and if you love seafood,

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.270
it's just a great place
to visit in Hong Kong,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.415
and that's actually gonna be
our final meal in Hong Kong.

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.524
We are gonna take the
bus back to our hotel,

00:13:55.524 --> 00:13:58.455
pack up, and it's about
time to go to the airport

00:13:58.455 --> 00:13:59.400
this afternoon.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.983
(mellow music)

00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:17.500
(sensor beeps)

00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:21.031
We're on the double-decker bus.

00:14:21.031 --> 00:14:24.948
We should be back to
Causeway Bay very shortly.

00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:37.306
See you later, Hong Kong,
and this amazing view.

00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:44.478
(sensor beeps)

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:48.703
Hope it doesn't leave.

00:14:48.703 --> 00:14:52.837
We ran to buy tickets, and it
costs 170 Hong Kong Dollars

00:14:52.837 --> 00:14:56.049
for two of us, and then got
immediately on the train.

00:14:56.049 --> 00:14:57.988
I think the train should
leave in a couple minutes,

00:14:57.988 --> 00:15:01.071
and we are on our way to the airport.

00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:23.554
That took about 25 minutes on the train.

00:15:23.554 --> 00:15:25.175
We made it to the airport,

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.366
and we are flying out of terminal two.

00:15:28.366 --> 00:15:30.508
Terminal two in Hong Kong is amazing.

00:15:30.508 --> 00:15:33.735
It's huge, and we just got all checked in.

00:15:33.735 --> 00:15:37.140
We are flying with Thai
Airways back home to Bangkok.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.723
(mellow music)

00:15:41.936 --> 00:15:44.985
It's been a total of 39 days
since Ying and I set off

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.087
from Bangkok on this
round-the-world trip for food

00:15:47.087 --> 00:15:48.493
with Star Alliance.

00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:50.784
Now you know how fast my hair grows.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:54.034
If you go back to day one,
you'll see short my hair was.

00:15:54.034 --> 00:15:58.483
But anyway, I don't know if
I have ever done so much,

00:15:58.483 --> 00:16:01.230
and traveled so much, and eaten so much

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.813
in a span of 39 days
as I did on this trip.

00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:09.244
(mellow music)

00:16:12.854 --> 00:16:15.986
This is our final flight, our
final business-class flight

00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:17.112
on this trip,

00:16:17.112 --> 00:16:19.699
and it happens to be on
our hometown airline.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:23.866
- [Crowd] (speaking in foreign language)

00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:28.248
- Welcome champagne.

00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:32.037
- This thing is really good.

00:16:32.037 --> 00:16:32.870
- What is that?

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.177
- Anchan Manaw.

00:16:34.177 --> 00:16:36.094
- Oh, butterfly pea and

00:16:37.485 --> 00:16:38.367
lime juice.

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:40.034
Butterfly pea juice.

00:16:44.511 --> 00:16:46.399
Yeah, it is really good.

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:47.838
Tastes like (mumbles).

00:16:47.838 --> 00:16:51.588
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:53.138 --> 00:16:55.272
We took off about 15 minutes ago,

00:16:55.272 --> 00:16:59.189
and this is gonna be
two-hour-and-20-minute flight,

00:16:59.189 --> 00:17:01.635
and it is time for dinner now.

00:17:01.635 --> 00:17:04.226
This is the first course, which is salmon

00:17:04.226 --> 00:17:06.567
and some kind of salad on the side here.

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:09.370
I have had a lot of salmon on this trip,

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:13.537
and I don't mind eating it
every opportunity that I have.

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:19.473
Oh, yes, that is the fork-tender salmon.

00:17:19.473 --> 00:17:22.390
It's some capers on the side there.

00:17:28.377 --> 00:17:30.569
Really, really smokey.

00:17:30.569 --> 00:17:32.902
I think that's dough on top.

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:36.555
- [Attendant] (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.388
- For the main course,

00:17:37.388 --> 00:17:38.844
they had a couple of different options,

00:17:38.844 --> 00:17:41.514
but I chose the only thing,
which is the real Thai dish

00:17:41.514 --> 00:17:42.702
on the menu,

00:17:42.702 --> 00:17:45.868
and that is pad ka-prao, which is...

00:17:45.868 --> 00:17:47.998
I think this time it's minced chicken,

00:17:47.998 --> 00:17:50.294
stir-fried with holy basil with rice,

00:17:50.294 --> 00:17:53.269
and then also came with a

00:17:53.269 --> 00:17:56.592
classic Thai deep-fried egg on the side.

00:17:56.592 --> 00:17:59.259
Let me fist crack into that egg.

00:18:01.569 --> 00:18:05.236
You got to love the
crispy edges on the egg.

00:18:09.944 --> 00:18:13.770
So crispy, that you got
to really work at it

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.392
to break it off.

00:18:15.392 --> 00:18:18.665
Look at the crispiness
of that egg, with rice.

00:18:18.665 --> 00:18:21.082
Grab some of the pad ka-prao.

00:18:24.501 --> 00:18:25.334
Basil.

00:18:27.412 --> 00:18:28.245
All right.

00:18:37.928 --> 00:18:40.971
How I've missed Thai-style
deep-fried eggs.

00:18:40.971 --> 00:18:43.001
It's a little bit on the sweet side,

00:18:43.001 --> 00:18:46.634
and then just little pieces of chicken

00:18:46.634 --> 00:18:49.360
with chilies in there,
and also the holy basil.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.625
That concludes this brief dinner

00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:53.180
on this Thai Airways flight.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.763
(mellow music)

00:19:01.784 --> 00:19:05.951
- [PA] (speaking in foreign language)

00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:26.821
- Feels good to be home,
but that was honestly

00:19:26.821 --> 00:19:29.615
a food trip of a lifetime.

00:19:29.615 --> 00:19:32.009
I don't know, in a span of 39 days,

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:35.350
if I have ever eaten
such a diverse spectrum

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.183
of cuisine in my life.

00:19:44.214 --> 00:19:45.083
We just made it back home.

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:47.000
Ying is about to see...

00:19:48.981 --> 00:19:50.796
(laughs)

00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:54.963
- [Ying] (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.669
- [Mark] We're back, Sheep.

00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:02.726
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:02.726 --> 00:20:04.745
- [Mark] (laughs)

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:07.959
- [Ying] (speaks in foreign language)

00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:11.284
- Yeah, gets fatter every time we see him.

00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:13.230
Before I wrap up today's video,

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.246
and then wrap up this entire series,

00:20:15.246 --> 00:20:16.540
a couple of things.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.204
Number one, I wanted to thank
each and every one of you

00:20:19.204 --> 00:20:21.412
for watching this entire series,

00:20:21.412 --> 00:20:24.329
and also many of you contributed in

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.151
giving me restaurant recommendations

00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:29.984
in each of the destinations
that we visited,

00:20:29.984 --> 00:20:32.346
so I want to say a big thank you to you,

00:20:32.346 --> 00:20:35.499
and also thank you to
Myriad for sponsoring

00:20:35.499 --> 00:20:37.793
much of the accommodation
that Ying and I stayed at

00:20:37.793 --> 00:20:39.070
throughout this trip.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.165
And finally, a major thank
you to Star Alliance,

00:20:42.165 --> 00:20:44.458
who made this entire trip possible,

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:47.301
and it was a real honor to be invited,

00:20:47.301 --> 00:20:50.124
and to have this opportunity to take part

00:20:50.124 --> 00:20:53.332
in a round-the-world
trip with Star Alliance.

00:20:53.332 --> 00:20:54.665
And then lastly,

00:20:55.813 --> 00:20:56.646
this video,

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:59.453
and if you haven't seen
the entire video series

00:20:59.453 --> 00:21:01.906
from this round-the-world trip for food,

00:21:01.906 --> 00:21:04.875
I have included all of them in a playlist,

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:07.143
all in consecutive order.

00:21:07.143 --> 00:21:09.323
Again, the link is in the
description box below,

00:21:09.323 --> 00:21:12.404
so you can watch through the entire series

00:21:12.404 --> 00:21:13.737
of these videos,

00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:19.966
and I think that is a complete
wrap on this video series.

00:21:19.966 --> 00:21:22.195
It has been so much fun.

00:21:22.195 --> 00:21:24.354
