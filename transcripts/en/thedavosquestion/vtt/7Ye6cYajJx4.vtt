&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Kathy Calvin, and I'm the CEO of
the United Nations Foundation.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.421
We were founded 12 years ago by Ted Turner
who believed that everyone

00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:13.309
can help the UN be a stronger institution,
and help take care of the

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.200
world.
And right now we need your help to help Haiti.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.730
The devastation there, the loss, the number
of orphans, the hunger, and

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.070
the rebuilding that has to take place is enormous.
The UN is in place to do the job and has been

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.410
already making a national
and international appeal for help and funds.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.140
We've been gratified by the number of people
who've stepped up with $10

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.140
contributions to $10,000 contributions.
And we need everyone's help.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.069
You can go to the UN foundation's website,
www.UNFoundation.org, and

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:54.280
find out how to text to give or send a donation
or some simply give

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.789
support to the UN for the work it's doing.
The next big challenge to going to be reconstruction

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.760
and all the
nations of the world need to help get in there

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.229
to rebuild the schools
and let the markets flourish and get people

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.829
back to work.
So please help Haiti.

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:11.100
We're all part of the same world.
Thank you.
