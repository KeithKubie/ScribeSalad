00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.880
FHIR solutions are built from a set of
modular components called resources.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.800
The FHIR resources are a subset of RIM,
essentially the most important and

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.820
most commonly used data constructs,
organized and categorized as shown here.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.811
I suggest you visit the resources
section of the FHIR website to

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:26.144
further explore this
key element of FHIR.

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:30.782
These resources can easily be assembled
into working systems that more quickly

00:00:30.782 --> 00:00:34.810
and easily solve real world clinical and
administrative problems.

00:00:36.025 --> 00:00:41.490
FHIR is suitable for a wide
variety of contexts as shown here.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.243
This might include mobile phone apps,
cloud communications,

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:48.717
EHR based data sharing,
server communication in large and

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:53.440
institutional health care provider
settings and other environments.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.520
The key is the use of FHIR resource
tags in the underlying data structures.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.930
The interaction between the systems and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.270
the databases is via restful APIs
which are relatively easy and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.010
fast to implement, further facilitating
innovation and development.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.500
As we discussed earlier,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.450
a similar web-services approach was
specified by Healthy Decisions.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.590
The web-services paradigm is
increasingly seen as the best vehicle

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.480
for developing and more rapidly
deploying interoperability solutions and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.340
even analytic routines, and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.470
services such as those required for
clinical decision support.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.350
This is an important trend that
I strongly encourage you to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.470
follow over time.
