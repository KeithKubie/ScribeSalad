00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.646
LAURA LING: You build these
really cool, unique structures

00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:09.270
of these tree houses
and these campers.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.150
And they're smaller dwellings.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.900
JAY NELSON: Yeah.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.430
LAURA LING: Is there something
about the simplicity of it all?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.888
JAY NELSON: Well, originally
that's why I started doing it.

00:00:17.888 --> 00:00:21.190
I mean, I was right
out of college.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.310
I wasn't really making
any money at that time.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.030
And I wanted to be an artist.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.390
And I wanted to figure out how
to live a lifestyle that was

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.380
just as minimal as possible.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.044
I had a Honda Civic CRX that
a friend of mine, his mom

00:00:37.044 --> 00:00:37.710
had totalled it.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.286
And she gave it to me.

00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:41.852
I, for a while, just
drove it around.

00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:44.060
And then eventually, I just
thought, well, maybe I'll

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.150
build a box over it.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.260
And then I was like, actually,
maybe I'll build a camper,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.760
like a little place
to sleep up top.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.250
What really did
excite me about it

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.390
was that it was
kind of like I was

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.950
driving this artwork around.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.871
And I mean, it was really
exciting the way people reacted

00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:04.370
to it.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.840
And I guess I saw it
as like, wow, this

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.075
is a real kind of direction
I can go with my work.

00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:12.450
LAURA LING: Tell me about the
first tree house you built.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.760
JAY NELSON: I built one
when I was 10 years old.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.859
And then my friends and I
all through high school,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:17.650
that's what we did.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.130
We just built forts.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.050
We weren't really interested
in girls or-- [LAUGHS] we just

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.550
weren't.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.870
We were interested in
building forts and surfing.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.054
We never really grew out of it.

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.928
And they just became
more and more elaborate.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:34.590
LAURA LING: It's amazing.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.544
These trees are
beautiful, first of all.

00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:37.960
JAY NELSON: You
can come this way.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.798
Watch your head.

00:01:43.124 --> 00:01:44.540
LAURA LING: Wow,
we're so high up.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.070
JAY NELSON: Yeah, it was pretty
crazy working on this thing.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.264
I fell off the roof once.

00:01:49.264 --> 00:01:50.430
Luckily, I had a harness on.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.990
So it was OK, but--

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.960
LAURA LING: Super, super
cool and beautiful.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.160
So tell me about the
vision for this tree house.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.660
JAY NELSON: For me
with tree houses,

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.700
I don't really like to
come up with a total plan.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.590
Like, we had an idea
what it would look like.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.798
But I really like to be able
to come up here and just

00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:11.540
start building it and kind
of see where things go.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.740
I think it's really hard
without actually being up

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.350
in the tree to really understand
the type of tree house

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.530
you want to make, and what
you want people to see,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.250
and the landscape
you want to showcase.

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:25.215
LAURA LING: What was the biggest
challenge in building this?

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.630
JAY NELSON: This was
a really hard project.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.020
Building the roof was
really, really hard for me.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.130
I mean, every single piece
has a different angle.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.700
It was really one piece at a
time, figuring out the angle,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.320
cutting it.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.400
No, wrong.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.115
Go back.

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:38.740
Do another one.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.130
Cut it.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.398
And it took forever.

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:46.260
LAURA LING: Tell me about
the materials that you use.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.200
JAY NELSON: I've always
used found materials.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.370
I mean, everything has a story
and comes from somewhere.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.980
And then also not just
that I know the story,

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.420
but they're also visually,
they have a story.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.010
Well, this is a pretty
nice piece right here.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.810
It was a piece of the floor
from this firehouse, which

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.930
I thought was cool.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.070
And it's a really
beautiful piece of wood.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.666
It has all sorts of wear.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.450
And it's really nice.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.180
So I saw that.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.469
And I thought, oh, that would be
perfect to create this loft up

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:14.968
here.

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.510
LAURA LING: One of the most
striking things about your work

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.926
in these structures
is that you're

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:25.232
taking this worn,
discarded material,

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:26.690
and then you're
giving it new life.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.480
JAY NELSON: Like to me, going to
the lumberyard and buying wood,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.540
it just feels like dead trees.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.220
But old wood that you find and
it's like this exciting hunt,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.430
that has life.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.535
Right away, it has life.

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:41.910
Well, the cool thing is, like,
I'll find a piece of wood.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.390
And it will just look like junk.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.400
It will have nails
on it and paint.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.390
And then I'll take it home.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.070
And I'll just start
working on it.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.712
In a couple hours, it's like
the most beautiful piece of wood

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:52.420
you've ever seen.

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.300
LAURA LING: What do
you hope people get out

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.439
of your work and your art?

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.480
JAY NELSON: I would like
people to feel inspired.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.482
But I hope that it helps
people, kind of changes

00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:07.190
their perspective a
little bit on things,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.080
and kind of opens their
life up a little bit

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.387
to new possibilities.

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:15.967
LAURA LING: Be sure to
check out this next episode.

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:17.425
KELLEY LEWIS: All
the things that I

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:22.420
have used, such as the windows
and doors and the stove,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.210
have all been
recycled materials.
