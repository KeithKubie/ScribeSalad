can completely
change their life.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.584 line:0%
It gives them milk
to drink, and butter,

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:19.552 align:start size:88% position:13%
and cheese, and they can
sell or eat the eggs.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.321 line:0%
It kind of creates
a renewable resource

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.356 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and actually creates
a local economy.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.192 line:0%
- The best dressed jet
skier on the planet.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.961 line:0%
Have a good time kid.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.563
- Let's recap.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.198
It's day one of my trip.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.136 align:start position:0%
I've done some mildly
condescending TV news, very fun.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:39.205 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've auctioned off the rights
to christen my jet ski,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.641
so we got the HMS
Rebecca O'Malley

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.444
and the HMS Kill Rock Stars.

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:45.712
And then,

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.147
0.05 miles

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.516
into the 1,000 mile trip

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:53.686 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we hit a lock, and
we're stuck for three hours.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.757
(lock signal horn blares)

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.726
We are seriously fucked.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.163
(invigorating rock music)

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.507 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Well, at this rate
we'll get to New Orleans

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.010
by 2 1/2 years, so.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:20.947
- Surprise!

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:24.417 align:start size:94% position:6%
It is a bad idea to travel
industrial waterways

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.854 align:start size:94% position:6%
on a vehicle primarily
intended for divorced dads

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.990
to get drunk on, while still
seeming cool to their kids.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.192
(laughter)

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:33.793
(signal horn blares)

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:37.030 align:start size:94% position:6%
- We're good.
- We're back on the road!

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:42.635
(inspiring indie music)

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.971
Let's get wet for goats!

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.773
Hello Chicago!

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.041
Have fun at work today!

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.544
Business casual, right
choice for Friday, guys!

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.847
I love the way you look Chicago!

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:56.149
I love the way you
guys have lunch!

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.518
Nobody has lunch like Chicago!

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.752
I'm Kurt Braunohler,

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:01.488 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm jet skiing from
Chicago to New Orleans,

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.223 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're seeing the
beginning of my trip.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:06.092
And we're sending 500 goats
and 1000 chickens to Africa.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.995
Thank you so much
for your support.

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:19.806
Safety first!

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.676
Start point.

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.345
Ground zero.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.980
Not in the 9/11 sense

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.150 align:start size:88% position:13%
but just in the sense
that I'm beginning here.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.586
(plaintive Latin guitar)

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.059
Some say the mayor used
to live in that house

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.594
on top of this bridge

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:44.564
because he was a hermit
and he loved bridges.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.465
Roustabout!

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.967
- My dude's hot dogging.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.504 line:0%
This is some classic
Braunohler right here.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.606
Classic hot dogging.

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.476 align:start position:0%
- Now, the Chicago river
connects to the Illinois River.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.011 align:start size:81% position:19%
And you've seen
the Chicago river.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.280 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's pretty, they make it
clean for St. Patrick's Day,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.682
once you get out
of Chicago, guys,

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:07.420
very quickly it becomes
an industrial wasteland.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.224
There's a homeless
man living in a tent!

00:03:11.224 --> 00:03:13.927
Like as soon as the
buildings fall away,

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:17.197
it just goes from fields, to
gravel pits, to junkyards,

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:19.999
to sand pits and back
to junkyards again.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.804
I'm not gonna lie, shit got
real depressing, real fast.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:27.207
And I'm the one who's
on the fun jet ski.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.474
My crew is back on the boat,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:29.709
and can totally tell,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.778
they already hate me
for bringing them here

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.348
so I decided, I'm gonna rally
everybody, get them excited,

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:39.219
by giving Li'l Minnow
a ride on the jet ski.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:41.854 align:start size:84% position:16%
Li'l Minnow, why don't
you ride with me?

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.890 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Okay.
- Let's do it together.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.491
- Together forever.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.029 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You ready to lose
your virginity?

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.364
- Yeah!

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:55.034
(heartfelt acoustic guitar)

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:06.613
- Here we are, the great sand
pits of southern Illinois.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.781
- [Both] Sand! Sand! Sand!

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.951
- The water is warm.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.420 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's just the chemicals
burning your skin.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.423 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Man, it's beautiful.
- It is beautiful.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.092
That's when I told my stepdad,

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:23.296
I don't need to necessarily
go to a four year university,

00:04:23.296 --> 00:04:26.199
I mean, maybe I'd ride
the rails for a while.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.270 align:start size:94% position:6%
Maybe I take up commercial
fishing, I don't know.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.175
(boat's horn blares)

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.513 line:0%
- [Interviewer] What's your
gas situation right now?

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:41.748
- I'm just trying
not to kill it,

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:44.751
we've been running
it all day here, so.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.158
Have no gas, we just died.

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.593 align:start size:84% position:16%
So we're in the
middle of the river.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:56.763 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Then about five miles
outside of Chicago,

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:59.532
our chase boat runs out of gas.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:00.733
(laughter)

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.368 align:start size:84% position:16%
And like, when a
car runs out of gas,

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.103
it just comes to a stop.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.972
But when a boat runs out of gas,

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:08.474 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's just a fucking
free for all.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:13.379 align:start size:97% position:3%
It just continues to go where
you don't want it to go.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.014
Where's this magical gas station

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
that was supposed
to be a fucking mile
away when we started.

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:18.751
- They were closed.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:20.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I mean I know I
didn't prepare for this,

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:22.588 align:start size:94% position:6%
but did no one else
prepare for this journey?

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:23.423
All right.

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.766
(jet ski engine roars distantly)

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:34.967
I'll be honest.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.103
I end up yelling
at the marine crew,

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:38.738
like a real asshole guys.

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:40.940
It's not one of
my finer moments.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.077
I'm mad at myself, I mean I'm
also mad at the marine crew.

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:47.480
Because fucking, you ran
out of gas motherfuckers!

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.915
Get your shit together!

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:50.383
But I'm the one who put us

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.452 align:start size:84% position:16%
all in this situation
to begin with

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:53.820 align:start size:84% position:16%
and now I'm watching
my whole plan

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.188
just crumble before my eyes

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.690
and it's only been five hours.

00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:02.995
- Everybody might want
to put on a life-jacket.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.065
- In case there's an accident.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:09.035 line:0%
We have no control, we
are floating out here,

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.970 line:0%
and it's not a good
thing to be floating.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.773
- This is uh, this might be it.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:17.009
- As long as we don't see
a big barge coming at us,

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:17.910
we're good.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.882
(barge horn blares)

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.652
- Sorry, Africa.

00:06:27.587 --> 00:06:30.923
(tense desperado music)

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.277
- Help!

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:52.111
Help!

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:54.847
Help!

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:56.716
Help!

00:06:58.851 --> 00:06:59.685
Heeeelp!

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.221
Help!

00:07:03.489 --> 00:07:04.323
Help!

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:09.429
Help!

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.464
Heeelp!
