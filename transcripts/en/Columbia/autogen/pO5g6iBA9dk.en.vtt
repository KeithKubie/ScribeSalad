think from an analytical point of view

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
think from an analytical point of view
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.780

it would be the other way around that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
it would be the other way around that
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.440

that would be large and state would be

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450
that would be large and state would be
 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810
that would be large and state would be
small because it's the effect of that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
small because it's the effect of that
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.109
small because it's the effect of that
state the singularity of it which is the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
state the singularity of it which is the
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.380
state the singularity of it which is the
which is the prime which is the primary

effect of state right so one could even

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
effect of state right so one could even
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.260
effect of state right so one could even
say that state is the effect of that

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
say that state is the effect of that
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.890
say that state is the effect of that
constructs a sense of that right and i

apparatus is to produce this effect and

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
apparatus is to produce this effect and
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.490
apparatus is to produce this effect and
of course as you know I'm bound to argue

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
of course as you know I'm bound to argue
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.520
of course as you know I'm bound to argue
that this effect is the product of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530
that this effect is the product of
 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.590
that this effect is the product of
heterogeneous incompatible forces so the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
heterogeneous incompatible forces so the
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.370
heterogeneous incompatible forces so the
effect of that is an illusion produced

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
effect of that is an illusion produced
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.399
effect of that is an illusion produced
by its very opposite heterogeneity so

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409
by its very opposite heterogeneity so
 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.280
by its very opposite heterogeneity so
the apparatus of that state or let's say

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
the apparatus of that state or let's say
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.649
the apparatus of that state or let's say
state apparatus is not and can never be

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
state apparatus is not and can never be
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.429

power comes

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
power comes
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.199
power comes
from this effect right this illusion of

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
from this effect right this illusion of
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.880
from this effect right this illusion of
singularity which is the main work of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890
singularity which is the main work of
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.520
singularity which is the main work of
the state apparatus and it's an illusion

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530
the state apparatus and it's an illusion
 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.980
the state apparatus and it's an illusion

effects so that would imply that this

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120

conference on architecture in the state

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
conference on architecture in the state
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.090
conference on architecture in the state
really has to be about architectures

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
really has to be about architectures
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100
really has to be about architectures
relationship to the heterogeneity rather

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110
relationship to the heterogeneity rather
 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.590
relationship to the heterogeneity rather
than to the singularity if it really

root causes or at least would have to

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
root causes or at least would have to
 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.240
root causes or at least would have to
somehow set up the dialog between what

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
somehow set up the dialog between what
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.590
somehow set up the dialog between what
we think architecture is and the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600
we think architecture is and the
 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.030
we think architecture is and the
contradictions kind of veiled within the

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
contradictions kind of veiled within the
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.759
contradictions kind of veiled within the
effect of that state but of course that

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769
effect of that state but of course that
 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.199
effect of that state but of course that
all of this becomes more complicated

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
all of this becomes more complicated
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.960
all of this becomes more complicated
because architecture is itself and this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970
because architecture is itself and this
 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.850
because architecture is itself and this
is why the conference is so timely and I

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860
is why the conference is so timely and I
 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.320
is why the conference is so timely and I
think so interesting is itself a

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330
think so interesting is itself a
 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.590
think so interesting is itself a
mechanism for producing the effect of

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600
mechanism for producing the effect of
 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.090
mechanism for producing the effect of
singularity I mean it's one of the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100
singularity I mean it's one of the
 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.820
singularity I mean it's one of the
mechanisms for producing an effect so

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830
mechanisms for producing an effect so
 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.830
mechanisms for producing an effect so
then we could reframe the question of

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840
then we could reframe the question of
 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.350
then we could reframe the question of
the conference to say the question is

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360
the conference to say the question is
 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.770
the conference to say the question is
something like what is the complicity or

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
something like what is the complicity or
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.270
something like what is the complicity or
interdependence of these two effects the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
interdependence of these two effects the
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.569
interdependence of these two effects the
the effect architecture and the effect

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579
the effect architecture and the effect
 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.020
the effect architecture and the effect
State and of course there's this

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030
State and of course there's this
 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.910
State and of course there's this
interdependence is is made obvious in

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920
interdependence is is made obvious in
 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.520
interdependence is is made obvious in
the ease with which we all to naturally

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
the ease with which we all to naturally
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.050
the ease with which we all to naturally
refer to the architecture of the state

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
refer to the architecture of the state
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.710
refer to the architecture of the state
on one side and not at all thinking that

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720
on one side and not at all thinking that
 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.240
on one side and not at all thinking that
we're entered into some metaphoric

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250
we're entered into some metaphoric
 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.670
we're entered into some metaphoric
territory on the opposite think to think

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
territory on the opposite think to think
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.140
territory on the opposite think to think
that we're moving into some sort of I

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
that we're moving into some sort of I
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.910
that we're moving into some sort of I
was going to say structural but that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920
was going to say structural but that
 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.710
was going to say structural but that
would be the very same potential

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720
would be the very same potential
 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.020
would be the very same potential
metaphor we think we are really

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030
metaphor we think we are really
 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.810
metaphor we think we are really
encountering the state as it were Aurore

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820
encountering the state as it were Aurore
 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.360
encountering the state as it were Aurore
when we describe its architecture but

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370
when we describe its architecture but
 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.470
when we describe its architecture but
also in Reverse I think we ought to

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480
also in Reverse I think we ought to
 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.780
also in Reverse I think we ought to
naturally think find it easy to think of

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790
naturally think find it easy to think of
 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.030
naturally think find it easy to think of
architecture as a system of control as

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
architecture as a system of control as
 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.569
architecture as a system of control as
though it were a quasi or mini state

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579
though it were a quasi or mini state
 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.080

apparatus so having said all of that and

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090
apparatus so having said all of that and
 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.390
apparatus so having said all of that and
I apologize for this I then become

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400
I apologize for this I then become
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.130
I apologize for this I then become
interested in the titles of each of the

interested in the titles of each of the
 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.360
interested in the titles of each of the
papers because of course in theory

everybody to get into the I mean the

everybody to get into the I mean the

question is how would one choose papers

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880
question is how would one choose papers
 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.729
question is how would one choose papers
for conference like this if what I just

for conference like this if what I just

for conference like this if what I just
said to you is even half true and I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600
said to you is even half true and I
 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.090
said to you is even half true and I
think it's at least three-quarters true

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100
think it's at least three-quarters true

American condition 74 is a good stopping
 

01:45:59.510 --> 01:46:01.419
American condition 74 is a good stopping
point because a lot of this apparatus

01:46:01.419 --> 01:46:01.429
point because a lot of this apparatus
 

01:46:01.429 --> 01:46:03.250
point because a lot of this apparatus
becomes privatized at that point and

01:46:03.250 --> 01:46:03.260
becomes privatized at that point and
 

01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:05.469

he's no longer a member of the state in
that sense and so there's there's quite

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:32.690
that sense and so there's there's quite
 

01:46:32.690 --> 01:46:34.450

you know the research economy changes

01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:34.460
you know the research economy changes
 

01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.060
you know the research economy changes
very much and I think the drug companies

01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:37.070
very much and I think the drug companies
 

01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:39.370
very much and I think the drug companies
are part of it but in the early 60s it's

01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:39.380
are part of it but in the early 60s it's
