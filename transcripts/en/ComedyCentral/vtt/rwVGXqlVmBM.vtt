00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.270
We are under attack.

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:06.806
The demon hand of censorship
strikes again.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.809
Opposables, we all know
censorship is a powerful weapon

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:12.145
that should only be used
against a real threat,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.680
like Democratic memos
or that eye exam poster

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.749
that has the secret
deep state message in it.

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:19.619
But we should never censor
Internet truth.

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:22.889
Look at this latest assault on
one of our alt-media brethren.

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.357
REPORTER:
 YouTube starting to crack down

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.958
 on a controversial channel.

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.761
 Reports say it gave
 an Infowars channel

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.297
 its first strike
 for sharing various theories

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.366
 about the school shooting
 in Florida.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.835
 YouTube is trying to cut down
 on hate speech and fake news

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:37.437
 by permanently banning accounts

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.106
 with three strikes
 in three months.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.108
What?
Three strikes and you're out?

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.878
Nothing could be less American.

00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:49.482
-(applause)
-But this,

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.484
this is where we are.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.153
YouTube claims they gave
Infowars their first strike

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.355
because they are violating
their content policy

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:59.025
by spreading "hate speech
and fake news."

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.027
But that's fake news.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.230
Infowars has been truth-telling
like this for years,

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:08.034
since lizard people first
demanded immigration rights.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.435
I mean, look!

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.438
What is your take
on-on Sandy Hook?

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.741
All the people that look
and act like actors.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.844
I'm sorry, folks,
this is such a false flag.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.846
This was such an attempt
to make Trump look bad.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.748
You look at the Aurora shooting.
That was totally staged.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.184
Alex Jones says the things
no one else would,

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:28.087
because only he dares
to stoop so brave.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.922
(laughter)

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.125
That's why the establishment
comes after him like this.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.460
Everyone has it in
for Alex Jones.

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.462
CNN, MSNBC, cholesterol.

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:38.131
(laughter)

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:41.300
And now there's a new narc
yapping at his heels.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.137
And a few days ago,
Jones called him out by name.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.671
Jordan Keppler.
What's his name?

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:47.006
MAN:
Josh Keppler or something?

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.808
The.... And I don't just act,
like, cool,

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.043
like I don't know who he is.
I don't watch.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.145
This Keppler guy.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.248
There are ten shows we know of--

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.150
 Homeland, Keppler--

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.019
who attack us
five nights a week,

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.055
and who say things
we never said.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.891
Keppler is... is-is-is again,

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.460
like the classic psychopath
in school,

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:10.496
and he's just lording
and enjoying the lies.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.498
Keppler is a failed actor.

00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.901
So he's another dropping
of Soros.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.003
Yeah. You heard that, right?

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.805
There's a failed actor out there
on Comedy Central

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:24.410
who's attacking Alex Jones, and
his name is... Jordan Keppler.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:27.046
(laughter)

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.115
This guy sounds like a dick.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:31.017
(laughter)

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.586
Oh, he's handsome for a soy-boy,
I'll give him that.

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:35.087
(laughter)

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.423
You look at that guy,
and you see Armie Hammer

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:38.858
without all the flashy muscles

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:41.027
and the grandstanding jawbone,
you know?

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.896
He's got a forehead
that goes all the way up.

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.965
But don't be fooled.

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:49.368
This guy is bad news.

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:50.369
He's deep state.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.371
I did a little digging,
and if he's an actor,

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:54.874
why does IMDB claim
he does not exist?

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.610
(laughter)

00:02:57.643 --> 00:03:00.012
Because Keppler is too smart.

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:01.747
He scrubbed the database.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.617
But Alex Jones never lets a
total lack of evidence stop him

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.052
from reporting the truth.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.487
Here's the crazy thing.
Jones is upset

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.791
because this Jordan Keppler
criticized Infowars

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.826
for reporting
crisis actors were employed

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.628
after the Parkland shooting,

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:18.431
the same claims that got him
his first YouTube strike.

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.199
And what's even more wild--

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.735
the same night this Keppler guy
was attacking Infowars,

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:25.504
our show,
hosted by me, Jordan Klepper,

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:31.110
was very sincerely defending
 Infowars for that same story.

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:33.512
(laughter)

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:36.949
This Keppler is a disgusting,
deep-state mole.

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:41.821
Also, it sounds like he has
some real gastric problems.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.590
The point is, is that
diarrhea coming out

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:49.095
of a wart-infested butt,
Keppler, uh, is a joke.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.931
I mean, this is a parasite
that reads off a teleprompter.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.499
Diarrhea coming out
of somebody's ass.

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:55.234
A tumor in your MRI.

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.937
Let's go back to turd blossom.
Here's Lord Keppler.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.039
Yeah. Whoa. It sounds...

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.607
To be fair, it sounds gross,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.243
but turd blossoms were actually
the flowers at my first wedding.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.078
(laughter)

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.080
Clearly, Jones knows
how to win an argument.

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:09.749
But what I worry about is

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.551
that the folks at YouTube
won't listen to reason.

00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:15.688
If left unchecked, this Keppler
might draw attention

00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.557
to other Infowars videos
that YouTube could use

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.694
as an excuse to ban them.
Things like,

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:25.598
"PROOF! Boston Marathon Bombing
is Staged Terror Attack," or

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.067
"The Orlando Shooting
Was A False Flag," or

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.636
"The War On Male Vitality
Exposed: Special Report."

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.171
(laughter)

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:33.706
Hard-hitting reporting.

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:36.942
The fact is, Alex Jones is
facing a potential ban

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:40.179
from YouTube because
of the things his show said.

00:04:40.212 --> 00:04:43.149
Now, is that his fault? No!

00:04:43.182 --> 00:04:46.952
It's the fault
of people like Jordan Keppler.

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:48.587
Opposers,
don't let the mainstream media

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.089
and Keppler win.

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:51.524
Can't pay off
your student loans?

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:54.260
Well, who's choice was it
to major in musical poetry?

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:56.062
Blame Keppler!

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:59.098
Someone farted in the elevator
you're alone in?

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.267
Blame Keppler!

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.135
He's literally made of diarrhea!

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.237
Get your YouTube channel
shut down

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.139
for violating their policy
on hate speech,

00:05:07.172 --> 00:05:08.474
thus drastically reducing

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.209
your vitamin supplement
revenue stream?

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.645
-Blame Keppler!
-(laughter, applause)

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:16.015
Opposers,
we need to spread the word.

00:05:16.048 --> 00:05:18.317
Tweet @RealAlexJones
all the things

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.686
that Jordan Keppler has ruined
so he knows

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:22.655
to hashtag "blame Keppler."

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:25.725
Because if there's not
a shadowy figure on the horizon

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:28.494
who you can blame
all your problems on,

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:30.396
then the problem is you.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.932
And that sounds like
some crazy conspiracy theory.

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.100
(laughter)
