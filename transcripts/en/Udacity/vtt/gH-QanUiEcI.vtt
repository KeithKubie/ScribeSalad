00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's take a look at the answers together,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's going to turn out that we'll be able to compute this, fairly systematically,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
just by remembering the rule for how to compute the closure.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We have a dot in front of the nonterminal E,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so I go over to our grammar

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and find all of the rules that start with nonterminal E.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And there are 3 of them, and I'm going to add all of them to chart[2]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
with a red dot right at the beginning and a from2--

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because that's where we currently are--1, 2--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as they are little provenance information off here, to the right.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So one of our rules is:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(E --&gt; int)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so we will definitely add (E --&gt; dot int from2).

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Again, the from2 is because we brought in

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or we computed the closure, starting in state[2].

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Another possible rule is:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
E --&gt; (F).

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So (E --&gt; dot (F), coming from position 2)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is a valid prediction we might make.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We might see parentheses right after seeing a minus sign; that's valid for this language.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Now our third rule is: (E --&gt; E - E)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so this option may look very tempting.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's got the (E - E).

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It's got the dot in the front, but it has the wrong (from) state information.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's included from0 instead of from2.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We need to remember these 2 tokens we've seen previously--the (E) and the (-).

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We need to know which state we were in

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
when we decided to take the closure.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This one is not correct.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Over here we see one that's very similar:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(E --&gt; E - E, with a dot in front).

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That's very good; it's a rule that starts with (E),

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and we need to start with (E) because the dot is before the (E).

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And this one correctly has from2.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We computed the closure in chart[2].

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And finally, this one's a bit of a ringer--

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
it has (F --&gt; dot string from2).

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Well, the from2 looks pretty good; the dot at the beginning looks very good.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But our rule is: since this dot was before an (E),

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we take all the grammar rules that start with (E)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
on the left-hand side, and that's it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So (F --&gt; string)--that's out of place.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm not going to predict seeing a string

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
until I've seen an open parenthesis.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If you think about this grammar,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the only way to get to string is after an open parenthesis.

00:02:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I haven't seen one of those, so this is a bad prediction.
