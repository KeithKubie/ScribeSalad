00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.729
The U.S. is in the middle of a government
shutdown - and if it doesn’t end soon it

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:05.120
will be the longest in history.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.620
But to be clear this is a “partial” shutdown
which means that 75% of the government was

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.600
approved for funding in the new year and the
rest got caught up in the demands from President

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.790
Donald Trump to build a wall on the southern
border for over 5 billion dollars.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.740
Since the shutdown began at the end of December
2018, it has affected thousands of scientists

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.710
and made lasting impacts on the scientific
community.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.180
Even for a partial shutdown we’re looking
at 9 government departments affected with

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.480
nearly four hundred thousand federal employees
furloughed, meaning they’ve been put on

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.920
leave without pay.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.449
Only those deemed “essential” are left
to be part of the skeleton workforce that

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.100
operate the facilities, also without pay.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.260
And scientific communities are taking a toll.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.300
The agencies affected include NASA, NOAA,
the National Science Foundation, the , and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.379
the National Parks Service, just to name a
few.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.579
These are some of the biggest funders of grants
and projects across the country.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.069
Without government money coming to fund the
research, thousands of scientists are now

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.141
out of pay, out of work, and losing valuable
information from their labs.And the impact

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.910
is being felt outside government grounds as
well.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.409
Even if you’re not a federal employee, but
your research is funded by one of the federal

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.969
science powerhouses, your progress is still
affected.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.680
And some experiments can’t just be put on
pause.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.890
Ongoing research, like the state of our ecosystem
is constantly collected and analyzed.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.020
Science magazine reported about an entomologist
at Michigan State University who’s endangered

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.270
bumble bees are just sitting in a fridge in
his lab waiting to be shipped to the USDA

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.270
laboratories.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.270
But they’re closed.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.869
He explains that this delay could cost him
a whole a whole year of progress.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.869
At SFSU, William Chadwick, works as a research
technician in cellular molecular biology,

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.280
analyzing and manipulating yeast cells; specifically
their waste removal organelle called the vacuole.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.119
Humans have organelles in their cells called
lysosomes that have the same function of the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.119
vacuole.

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:57.221
So, by looking at mutated yeast strands, Chadwick
can find correlations back to humans, even

00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:59.689
sometimes helping progress research with disease.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.420
“So essentially what happens in the example
that I always give called Batten disease.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.229
It's an infantile disease that usually kills
the children.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.220
There are too many lysosomes because they
can't break things down and so their body

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.610
can't break down things it needs to [..] we
found a way to recover that gene that creates

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.610
Batten's disease.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.880
It's called BTM1…

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.360
So if we can fix that disease that occurs
in yeast is the idea that we can use that

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.569
same gene to create a gene therapy for people
suffering from Batten disease.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.500
“
BUT his lab can’t get their contacts from

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.660
the National Science Foundation to help them
proceed to next steps, so they’ll be pushed

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.720
6 months behind.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.340
What does a 6 month delay mean?
“and if labs can't access research or access

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.220
funding, then it just prevents or pushes back
the development of a cure.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.310
So if a child who would have had a cure in
six months doesn't for another five years

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.310
and passes between those two points[..], that's
just kind of the easiest way to think of how

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.760
it affects people and funding of research
and science and society in general.”

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.780
And just because you’re not a scientist
or don’t have a disease doesn’t mean you’re

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.080
off the hook either.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.930
Researchers collect a lot of critical data
that the average person doesn’t think about

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.210
and, we use it to power our everyday lives,
like weather forecasts for example.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.740
During the shutdown, national weather forecasts
are going to be worse because there aren’t

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.970
enough people to maintain and repair malfunctioning
programs.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.960
It may seem trivial, but winter is primetime
for updates to hurricane models and they use

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.100
this time to train emergency managers for
the next storm season.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.410
But that’s at a halt.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.570
The government shutdown is also having a ripple
effect on an international level.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.820
At the beginning of January, NASA completed
a flyby to the most distant object we’ve

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.520
ever visited in history, and yet, they couldn’t
share their accomplishment with fellow peers.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.180
It’s estimated that one thousand federal
employees couldn’t attend the American Astronomical

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.380
Society or American Meteorological Society
conferences to share and exchange knowledge

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.380
from the year.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.790
Some scientists say the U.S. absence is not
only a missed chance to learn, but also a

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.340
possible turning point for the U.S. to fall
behind in scientific research.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.290
The list goes on and on about the countless
impacts this partial government shutdown has

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.290
caused.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.810
And every day it progresses, the impacts reach
more people and they get worse.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.370
With no end in sight, we can only hope that
it’ll be over quickly and we can bounce

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.160
back better than before.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.820
What do you think about all of this?

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.750
Tell us down below and if you’ve ever wondered
how scientists can work together even when

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.080
they’re countries don’t, watch this video
