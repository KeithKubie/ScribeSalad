00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:05.166
&gt;&gt;Emily: I believe there are a select
few who get to shape the world we live

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.896
in and that that's not right.

00:00:08.246 --> 00:00:11.006
So, I want to have 16 year
old high school students

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.926
who are building 2,200
square foot farmers markets

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.686
that change the face of their home town.

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:19.776
I want to have 10 year old
girls who walk in fearful

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:21.866
and walk out having fused metal.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:27.976
I think that what we're doing is
changing who gets to make the world.

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:36.686
&gt;&gt;Emily: So, I'm going to hold
it and you go really slowly,

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:39.116
and it's going to grab it and
tighten it in place for you.

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:43.356
&gt;&gt;Emily: I spent a lot of my childhood
in the woods building tree houses

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.966
and I have always felt
that there were things

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.536
that I was learning outside of school--

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.376
That I wasn't
able to access within school.

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:57.896
I came into the education space
with the training of an architect,

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:03.826
but a lot of the ideals and
passions of an educator.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.686
I knew there were things about
architecture and design that had a place

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:11.336
and could have a deep
impact in a classroom.

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.576
They can sand this out, that's easy.

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:16.966
&gt;&gt;Emily: And then, it's
one, two, three, four holes.

00:01:17.546 --> 00:01:22.466
So that is what inspired me to leave
a very traditional architecture

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.416
and design path, and instead
start my own non-profit.

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:31.856
Project H Design to give young people a
physical space, and the physical tools

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:38.826
to make things and ideas real, and
prove that a program like this can live

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:41.486
in a K through 12 public space.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:47.926
The students that I've worked with,
come to us with such different stories,

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:52.376
whether these are 10 year old
girls who I'm teaching how to weld,

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:56.956
or they're 17 year olds who are living
in not so great family situations.

00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:02.036
I want them to leave my class
feeling like whatever that thing is,

00:02:02.036 --> 00:02:04.856
it's not an obstacle to
their success and happiness.

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:12.216
So, what motivates me and what is so
rewarding is watching the transformation

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:17.856
from that moment of fear or
hesitation to a moment of confidence,

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.156
accomplishment, and what's next.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:27.086
I think that maker based
learning really sticks with kids

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:31.086
because it's not just the act
of making that is important,

00:02:31.086 --> 00:02:33.976
it's knowing why you're making
something, and for whom.

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:35.066
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Great, great job.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:37.426
I really appreciate all the
work you guys did today.

00:02:37.636 --> 00:02:38.546
One, two, three.

00:02:38.546 --> 00:02:43.956
&gt;&gt;Emily: It is a challenge back onto
the educational community to continue

00:02:43.956 --> 00:02:48.126
to push on the things we offer to
kids within the school walls, and say,

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:51.106
it doesn't have to look like
standardized testing all day long.

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:53.956
It can look like architecture
built by 16 year olds.

00:02:54.616 --> 00:02:59.056
We say that we're never bored and
we're never done, and I'm certainly,

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:00.346
neither of those two things.
