about what keeps me motivated so be
 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.320
about what keeps me motivated so be

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330
interesting and unique thing about
 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.450
interesting and unique thing about
dealing with extreme environments where

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460
dealing with extreme environments where
 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430
dealing with extreme environments where
people's lives are on the line is that

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440
people's lives are on the line is that
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.400
people's lives are on the line is that
the environment itself is actually

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410
the environment itself is actually
 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.050
the environment itself is actually
inherently or revealing so you don't

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
inherently or revealing so you don't
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.460
inherently or revealing so you don't
have to worry about keeping a team

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
have to worry about keeping a team
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.630
have to worry about keeping a team
motivated because they're going to be

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
motivated because they're going to be
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.470
motivated because they're going to be
motivated by the fact that their life is

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
motivated by the fact that their life is
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240
motivated by the fact that their life is
on the line or their health may be at

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
on the line or their health may be at
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.150
on the line or their health may be at
risk so instead of worrying about

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
risk so instead of worrying about
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.009
risk so instead of worrying about
motivation in these environments really

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
motivation in these environments really
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.540
motivation in these environments really

what you have to think about is how to
deal with those environments as they're

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
deal with those environments as they're
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760

always changing and you have to
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.690
