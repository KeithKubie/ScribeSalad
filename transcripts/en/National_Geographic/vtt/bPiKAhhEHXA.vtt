ERIKA LARSEN: The Sami are by
tradition reindeer herders

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.035
that have lived as nomads.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.503
Everything revolved
around reindeer.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:43.076
The food, the children, the
stories... everything.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.478
Herders were working so
in tandem with nature

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:48.981
that they could interpret the
Arctic to the rest of the world.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:51.051
The Sami people have
their own voice

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.052
and their own way to tell
the world who they were.

I'm going to open tonight
with a journal entry.

November 2010, reindeer
herd separation.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.573
Dusatatsva, Norway.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.475
'I'm not ready to
leave this place,

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:19.111
the longer I stay the
more it suits me.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.880
The land is like
a magnet,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.217
a person can either repel or
connect to this landscape.

00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:26.419
I woke up this morning
and the lavut closest

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:28.988
to ours revealed it had
snowed all night.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.824
It was covered like a
white sugar almond

00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:33.960
that one might have received
as a wedding favor.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.831
But as this world becomes more
real to me the other fades away.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.566
I came here to find people
of when the land speaks

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.936
could interpret
it's language.

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:44.703
I came here in
search of silence

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:47.240
so that I could begin
to hear again.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.243
I am now more a stranger in
my own home than here.'

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:57.750
So tonight I want to take you to
the Scandinavian Arctic,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.386
where I encountered
the Sami people.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.321
The Sami are by
tradition reindeer herders

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.189
that have lived
as nomads.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.727
Today they are considered the
indigenous group of Europe.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.162
To create this body of work, I
lived there for four years

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:12.198
and worked as a beaga.

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.800
A beaga is a woman
in Sami culture

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.536
that would go and live with a
family of reindeer herders.

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:21.440
She would help with the
children, she would help
cook and clean.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.442
She would also travel
with the herders

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:24.877
when they were with
the reindeer.

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.546
She would help
slaughter the reindeer,

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.415
and basically anything
that needed to be done.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:34.487
Um, but first let's
watch a small video.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:38.157
This ran with my
article in 2011.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:17.023
So, the Sami homeland
is called Sapmi,

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:21.394
but maybe many people here have
heard it referred to as Lapland.

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:23.596
It ranges today in
four countries,

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:25.898
Norway, Sweden,
Finland and Russia.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.834
But the majority of my work was
done in Norway and Sweden,

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:30.103
where you see the
grey dots.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:34.139
Jokkmokk, Gallivare,
Harra, Kautokeino.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.077
Today there's approximately
between 80,000 to 100,000 Sami.

00:04:38.077 --> 00:04:43.149
But only 10 percent are actively
involved in reindeer herding.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:45.952
So, my journey
began in 2007.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:49.155
I had a few email
correspondences
with a Sami woman.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:50.456
I wrote her a
letter and said,

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:51.891
I was interested in
learning about

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.227
traditional medicine of
the Arctic landscape.

00:04:54.227 --> 00:04:57.330
And she invited me to come and
stay with her for several weeks.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.898
And so I did.

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:03.469
And, when I got there, she made
a few things really clear to me.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.172
One was that the Sami
people had their own voice

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:08.908
and their own way to tell
the world who they were.

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.843
They didn't need someone
coming from the outside

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.978
and telling them
who they were.

00:05:12.978 --> 00:05:18.184
And the other was, 'but if you
want to learn who we are

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:21.119
then you need to stay
here for a long time.'

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:22.187
And I said,
'Well, you know

00:05:22.187 --> 00:05:24.156
I worked on my last
project over eight years.'

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:25.491
And she said, 'Well,
that's great!'

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.659
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- And so

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.728
it kind of set the
scene for us.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:30.796
So she said, 'Why don't you
go visit my husband,

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:32.131
he is a reindeer herder.'

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.566
And she goes, 'But I think he is
hunting moose right now.'

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:37.169
And she drew a map
on a napkin,

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.071
and she said, 'Just follow this
map and you'll find him.'

00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:40.806
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) -
I said, 'Okay.'

00:05:40.806 --> 00:05:43.509
So, I drove about an hour to
rail-- railroad tracks,

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.711
it was like the main
marker on the map.

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.881
I drove to the railroad tracks
and put on my backpack.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:50.983
And, parked the car and
put on my backpack

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:53.352
and I walked another three miles
until I found this house.

00:05:53.352 --> 00:05:55.988
And to me this house was
'the middle of nowhere'.

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:57.790
And, this is Arild

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.828
and he is slicing dried reindeer
meat at the table.

00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:06.232
But this was the first thing
I noticed on the wall.

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.367
There was just this picture
and I really had no idea

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.169
what it was and what
was happening.

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.538
And I would truly have no idea
of the deep significance

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:16.242
of this event for another
year and a half.

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.609
But it was the only
thing on the wall,

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:20.346
so I figured intuitively it
must be important.

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:24.150
And, um... it's a reindeer calf
that's being marked in the ear.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.218
The earmark shows
the ownership.

00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:30.756
And in Scandinavia today the
majority of reindeer are owned.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:31.857
And at that time,

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:34.626
I didn't speak Sami language and
Arild didn't speak English,

00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:37.229
so we had to find ways
to communicate.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.064
And the first thing he did
was come up to me

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:40.666
and he had me smell
his watchband.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:43.268
He kind of put it up to my
nose and I said, 'Ah.'

00:06:43.268 --> 00:06:45.538
And it smelled like he had just
slaughtered an animal.

00:06:45.538 --> 00:06:46.672
And that was his
way of saying,

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.374
'Well, you know, we actually
did shoot a moose,

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:50.943
why don't you come out and
we'll show it to you.'

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:53.812
I said, 'Okay.' So, we walked
out and I followed him.

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.247
And this is what I saw.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:58.584
And I said, 'Ah, finally, like I
feel really comfortable.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:03.422
This is... this is what I
came to look for.'

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:06.159
And instantly he just
made some gestures

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.794
and he was with his nephew
and they were telling me

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:12.197
to collect some wood to see if
I could build a fire.

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:14.833
And so that again set
the stage for

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:17.202
not only would I be here for an
extended period of time

00:07:17.202 --> 00:07:21.006
but that I would be... needing
to make myself useful.

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:23.976
It wasn't that the Sami people
needed my help by any means,

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:25.777
but, um, they really
also didn't need

00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:28.014
someone standing around
doing nothing.

00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:32.351
Um... about a
year later,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:36.155
I follow Arild to his
summer grounds

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:37.856
and this is a
calf marking.

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:39.625
And this is one of the
most important times

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:43.162
in the Sami herding year, as it
projects the prosperity

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:46.132
of the herd for the families
for the years to come.

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.099
And what's
happening here is

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.568
you see female reindeers
running in circles

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:51.970
and the herders are
watching their earmarks.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.873
And they'll watch as the
calf is following

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:56.175
and then they'll lasso those
calves and mark the ears.

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:59.145
And that's how this continues,
this tradition.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:04.584
And that fall, I followed
Arild's daughter, Sunna.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.452
This is during the
fall slaughter

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.320
and I took notice of... a
few of the women

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.523
were collecting the blood after
the reindeer's were slaughtered.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:13.358
And they would sit there and
stir it for about an hour.

00:08:13.358 --> 00:08:15.161
And I asked her
what they were doing.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.196
She said, 'We
collect the blood.

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:18.864
We can either dry it or
we will freeze it

00:08:18.864 --> 00:08:22.067
and this will be later
used in cooking.'

00:08:22.067 --> 00:08:23.402
And, when I began to
work as a beaga

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.938
this is one of the first things
I did was learn how to cook.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:27.339
I cooked many
dishes with blood

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.542
but my favorite was
blood pancakes.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:31.344
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:36.282
The first year and a half
though I went back

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.984
and forth from New
York to Sapmi,

00:08:38.984 --> 00:08:43.021
trying to find ways to...
to stay there, get visas,

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.191
how I could live in one
person's home,

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.826
just logistically how this
was going to work.

00:08:47.826 --> 00:08:50.396
When I would go back and forth,
I thought of the images

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:53.231
and was making those
impressions,

00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:55.434
my impressions of what
I was seeing.

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:59.204
And this, this reindeer skin
hanging on the side,

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:00.906
this is a side
of a shed,

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.976
but there would be houses
every-- and Sami villages

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:09.248
had skins and skin on houses
after house after house.

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.984
And I'd later find out that
these skins could be sold

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.219
but also they could be used
on the snowmobiles

00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:16.355
to kind of keep warm, they would
wrap around the snowmobiles.

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.156
Or they'd put them on the
floor of the lavut

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:20.159
which was that first
structure you saw in the,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.429
in the first slide
that I showed.

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.731
And this is Laila the
woman that invited me

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.533
with Sunna her daughter.

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:30.869
And, of course I was taken
by the visual beauty

00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:33.672
of their traditional dress,
which is called the Gahkti.

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:37.042
But in time I learned that it
had deeper significance.

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:40.379
The Gahkti would tell
an outsider exactly where
they were coming from

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:42.214
what village they
were coming from.

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:46.017
But even more so it
could tell you what
family they belonged to.

00:09:46.017 --> 00:09:47.553
And if you really knew
what you were doing

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:51.590
and you looked close enough, you
could tell who sewed the Gahkti.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.158
I later learned that
if a minor,

00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:55.594
Sami minor got in
trouble,

00:09:55.594 --> 00:09:57.596
if a picture went in
the newspaper

00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.265
no part of the Gahkti could be
shown as well as the face.

00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:03.803
It would be like
identifying the person.

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:09.141
And, this is Ella-Li, she is the
niece of Arild and Laila.

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:12.645
She is from Jokkmokk and she
is a reindeer herder.

00:10:12.645 --> 00:10:15.581
I was struck by this luminescent
quality she had,

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.849
but I was also taken
by her scarf.

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:20.085
And I had no idea if it
was Swedish or Sami.

00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:22.521
And she said to me,
'Of course it's Sami!'

00:10:22.521 --> 00:10:25.591
And she said, 'You know, we wear
it on our traditional Gahkti but

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:26.926
when we are in our
street clothes',

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.894
and I call it street clothes,
she didn't call them that but,

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.662
'you know, when we wear it in
our everyday clothes,

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:32.998
it's called
Sami-inspired.'

00:10:32.998 --> 00:10:34.433
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:39.171
And finally I made my
way to Kautokeino.

00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:42.908
Kautokeino is considered
the-- it's just,

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.676
if you want to say, sort
of the Sami capital,

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:48.914
98 percent of the people
speak Sami language.

00:10:48.914 --> 00:10:51.817
And Laila took me there to meet
her extended relatives.

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:55.154
And this is where I ended
up meeting Nils Peder
and Ingrid Gaup.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:58.290
And it was them that I
worked for as the beaga.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.161
And, Nils Peder comes
from a long lineage of
reindeer herders.

00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:05.397
It was from him that I
could finally

00:11:05.397 --> 00:11:08.834
begin to get answers about
my initial question.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.804
Were there people that could
interpret nature's landscape?

00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:15.207
And not only did the Sami
language itself have deep, deep

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:18.177
and rich vocabulary to describe
the natural world,

00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:22.147
but herders were working so in
tandem with nature that in fact

00:11:22.147 --> 00:11:26.551
they could interpret the Arctic
to the rest of the world.

00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:31.023
Um... another thing
in this image, I think
it was the first time

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:34.359
I had experienced where I could
see no horizon line.

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:35.527
I just kept
looking around

00:11:35.527 --> 00:11:41.066
and it was like you couldn't--
the focal point was this.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:44.203
And this is Nils Peder and
Ingrid's main house.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:45.537
And I say main house

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:49.575
because many herders have a
house in their summer grounds

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:51.209
and a house in their
winter grounds,

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:52.444
where the reindeer are
in the summer

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:53.412
and where the reindeer
are in the winter.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.047
And then they have a
main house.

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:57.749
This is where I mostly
lived and worked.

00:11:57.749 --> 00:11:59.885
And one day I had
been out all day,

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.354
most likely with the herd and
with Nils Peder and I came in

00:12:02.354 --> 00:12:05.490
and I saw this sitting on the
table and I thought, 'Okay.'

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.493
And they told me,

00:12:07.493 --> 00:12:08.693
you know, it was so
cold outside

00:12:08.693 --> 00:12:10.061
that they couldn't cut
the meat up outside.

00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:11.563
It was freezing, so they
had to bring it in.

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:13.064
So of course, I run
downstairs

00:12:13.064 --> 00:12:15.968
and I get my camera and come
back up and everyone laughing.

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:18.604
'Oh my gosh, again she is taking
pictures every day.

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.272
This is-- what is she
taking a picture of.'

00:12:20.272 --> 00:12:21.173
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:12:21.373 --> 00:12:23.409
And so, I was like, 'I have
to get this picture.'

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.944
They... 'okay'.

00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:30.582
And then about a year later, I
came across the same scene.

00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:33.485
I had been out all day, probably
with the reindeer and I came in

00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.054
and the calf was
sitting on the table.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:39.191
And I thought to myself, 'Oh my
gosh, I got to get some food.'

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:41.593
I've been out all day and I
made myself some soup

00:12:41.593 --> 00:12:43.996
and I sat down and I
started eating.

00:12:43.996 --> 00:12:46.966
And Ingrid raced and got her
camera and she came back.

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:47.999
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:49.067
And she took this
picture.

00:12:49.134 --> 00:12:52.604
And she said, 'Well, now you're
part of the every day.'

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:57.576
And, but, you know, it--
I think it felt really good

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:59.010
but at the same time it
made me think,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.482
'Wow, what's my perspective now,
what does that mean?'

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:04.650
And then I realized that

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.286
I... I... could make
pictures like this.

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:09.888
That's what it meant.

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:12.591
This is Nils Peder and his
herding dog, Giddeo.

00:13:12.591 --> 00:13:14.660
And for them this is what
would be considered

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.995
the ultimate herder's
perspective.

00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:19.064
You can see the entire herd
in the background,

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.099
you can see what
weather is coming in,

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:22.300
if there's
reindeer missing,

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.437
if there's predators,
if there's food.

00:13:25.437 --> 00:13:27.505
But, you know, three
years before

00:13:27.505 --> 00:13:30.242
I wanted to be as close as
possible to the reindeer,

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:32.044
I wanted to be as close as
possible to the people,

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.244
I wanted to capture
their face,

00:13:33.244 --> 00:13:35.714
I would never have taken
a picture like this.

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:37.716
And also probably I
wouldn't have been

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:41.019
in a position to be
here to see this.

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:44.155
And as I studied more and
learned more about Sami artwork,

00:13:44.155 --> 00:13:46.458
when a herder would
paint a herding scene,

00:13:46.591 --> 00:13:48.794
it would always be
from this vantage point.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.567
And the lavut again.

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:56.268
Many herders today
use the lavut

00:13:56.268 --> 00:13:59.170
when they are actually out
with the reindeer.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:04.743
And by this time I decided I had
to learn Sami language.

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.713
In Kautokeino, like I said 98%
of the people speak Sami,

00:14:07.713 --> 00:14:09.181
so I was surround with it
all the time,

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:10.449
but there's also
something called

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.452
Sami Allaskuvla or
Sami University.

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.054
And I took a seven-month
immersion course.

00:14:16.054 --> 00:14:19.190
And Sami were put in
boarding schools and

00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.259
many generations lost
their language,

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:23.161
so this school kind of
gives this back

00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:25.697
to the generations
that have lost it.

00:14:25.697 --> 00:14:30.168
But I also took it and-- Finally
I could sit in a lavut like this

00:14:30.168 --> 00:14:32.804
and this is when I began to
understand the history

00:14:32.804 --> 00:14:35.073
and learn about the
culture because

00:14:35.073 --> 00:14:37.409
grandparents,
extended family,

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:40.078
aunts, uncles, children were
all sitting in this lavut

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:42.147
and telling
stories in Sami

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:45.784
and drinking coffee and eating
dried reindeer meat.

00:14:45.784 --> 00:14:48.520
And they weren't being
translated into English

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.156
and if they were, they really
lost the significance.

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.959
So, finally I could hear and
feel these stories.

00:14:57.128 --> 00:14:58.730
And, this is
Mattis Gaup,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.233
he's Nils Peder's
brother and they, they

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.968
work with the
herds together

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:05.637
and for me pictures like
this are important

00:15:05.637 --> 00:15:07.239
because I didn't take
very many of them.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.174
A lot of my work is
kind of silent

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:12.011
and still and more reflections
on the moments.

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:15.113
But it would be a
real disservice

00:15:15.113 --> 00:15:18.149
to take away... what hard work
reindeer herding is.

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:20.953
It's all year long,
there's no vacations.

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:22.254
If a herder takes
vacations

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.556
it's usually to visit
extended family members

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:26.524
and help them with
their herd.

00:15:26.524 --> 00:15:31.196
They are often working in minus
30, minus 40, minus 50.

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:36.835
It's not a lot of money,
this is a lifestyle.

00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:39.604
One side note, I was at
a family party

00:15:39.604 --> 00:15:41.206
and this guy
Mattis walks in.

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:43.141
His entire face is
frostbit,

00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:45.977
it's brown and kind of
peeling away.

00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:48.280
And nobody blinked. It's just
me, I was like, 'Wow'!

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.547
It was just...
just came in.

00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:52.618
He'd been out with the reindeer
for a few weeks. So...

00:15:55.553 --> 00:16:00.692
And one spring I got
to follow the Gaups on
their spring migration.

00:16:00.692 --> 00:16:04.829
The spring migration is probably
about 200-250 kilometer trek

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:06.131
from the winter
grazing grounds north

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.899
to the summer
grazing grounds.

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:09.934
It can take anywhere from a
few days or a few weeks

00:16:09.934 --> 00:16:12.971
depending on the
weather.

00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:16.642
And in this situation,
the weather would,

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.510
you know, get a little bit
bad, so they would stop,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.978
sometimes they would
pitch the lavut

00:16:19.978 --> 00:16:22.180
and we could sit for
15 or 20 hours.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.049
Or some times they just
take a break life this

00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:26.151
for an hour and go
to sleep.

00:16:28.787 --> 00:16:32.524
And this is how I saw the
herd on that migration.

00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:35.360
And again I just
remember it was a--

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.995
the migration itself is
very meditative.

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:39.998
You're just kind of
going and going and
you don't see very much,

00:16:39.998 --> 00:16:42.868
you just see the herd. And I
saw this and I realized,

00:16:42.868 --> 00:16:46.404
'Wow, my only focal
point are reindeer'.

00:16:46.404 --> 00:16:49.007
And... and that extended
to many years,

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:50.775
it wasn't just today
in this time.

00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:53.778
And in that moment,
I realized

00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:56.981
I had been living in a bubble of
reindeer for like years.

00:16:56.981 --> 00:17:00.685
And in, in the best way, I mean
everything revolved--

00:17:00.685 --> 00:17:02.621
with the herding
families I lived with

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:04.256
everything revolved
around reindeer.

00:17:04.256 --> 00:17:06.191
The food, the children,

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:10.496
the stories... everything had
to do with reindeer.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.604
And this picture is
really important to me

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:22.040
because this is Nils Peder
sitting with his herd.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.009
Actually today the herds
are a lot more wild

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:25.410
than they used to be.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.112
Because of things like
snowmobiles and helicopters,

00:17:28.112 --> 00:17:29.848
which a lot of
herders use,

00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:32.016
they are not physically with the
herds the way they used to be.

00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:34.119
They used to ski with the herds
or walk with the herds

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:35.320
so the herd was
more tame.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.388
So for him to sit

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:39.458
and have the herd kind of
circling with... around him,

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:41.994
it means he's been with his
herd every single day.

00:17:41.994 --> 00:17:44.462
And then he sat there and
he began to yoik.

00:17:44.462 --> 00:17:47.232
And yoik is that sort of throaty
chant you heard in the video

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:49.268
I showed at the
beginning.

00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:54.272
And, um, the yoik has-- it's
very special to the Sami.

00:17:54.272 --> 00:17:58.143
It's a way to pay reverence
to a person, place or thing.

00:17:58.143 --> 00:18:00.178
And he sat down and he
began to yoik his wife,

00:18:00.178 --> 00:18:04.249
which means he is evoking her
presence in the herd.

00:18:06.318 --> 00:18:09.922
And, this is his
wife, Ingrid.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:13.057
And she took me under her
wing when I was there.

00:18:13.057 --> 00:18:14.960
And she showed me what
a woman's role

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.861
was in a reindeer
herding family.

00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:20.632
And the role is to be the heart
and soul of the family.

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:23.268
And that's what she was.

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.970
And just like Arild in
the very beginning

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.739
that had me
build a fire,

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:28.941
Ingrid did the
same thing.

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.910
She had me cook, she, she
went out to cut grass

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.146
which she is doing here. I would
go out and cut grass.

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:36.247
And she is cutting grass,
it will later be dried,

00:18:36.247 --> 00:18:38.583
it will be put in shoes
in the winter time.

00:18:38.583 --> 00:18:41.753
And she swears this is warmer
than synthetic material.

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:48.026
And, this is skin,
reindeer skin.

00:18:48.026 --> 00:18:50.161
And Ingrid taught me how
to work with skin.

00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:52.030
How to take the hair off,
how to dry it,

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.700
how to later make a
bark concoction,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.571
which would preserve the skin,
and also how to sew with it.

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:02.640
When I was six months
pregnant, I went back

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.746
and we sewed shoes for my son,
which is a tradition.

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.447
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

00:19:09.447 --> 00:19:11.983
And, these are not my
son's shoes.

00:19:11.983 --> 00:19:13.819
(LAUGHTER)

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.453
But these are
reindeer shoes.

00:19:15.453 --> 00:19:17.055
But these have...
this has the hair on it,

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:19.525
so these will be shoes that
are used in the winter.

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:22.760
These are for female and
these would be for fancy,

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.396
very dressy occasion, it would
be used with the Gahkti.

00:19:25.396 --> 00:19:27.766
But this style of the
toe being curled up

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:29.734
would be on men or
women's shoes

00:19:29.734 --> 00:19:31.069
and it comes from
the old days

00:19:31.069 --> 00:19:33.405
when they used to lock
into the skis with it.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.208
This is Ellen-Ingrid,

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:38.943
this is the granddaughter of
Nils Peder and Ingrid.

00:19:38.943 --> 00:19:42.781
And, this would be
like similar to a
Native American cradleboard,

00:19:42.781 --> 00:19:44.649
and you can see here the
wood has been covered

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:48.587
with this skin that's finally
been preserved by the bark.

00:19:48.587 --> 00:19:52.224
A lot of the women today use
these for the children.

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:56.027
And, this is Ingrid

00:19:56.027 --> 00:19:58.463
and her youngest daughter,
Sara, in a lavut.

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:00.298
And this is during
their calf marking.

00:20:00.298 --> 00:20:03.901
And I followed them when we were
here for a couple of weeks.

00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:05.704
We set up the lavut and
we went inside,

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:07.405
and you can see the skins
that I showed you

00:20:07.405 --> 00:20:09.007
in the beginning
on the shed,

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:10.475
they are on the ground
there sitting.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:13.478
They set up the fireplace
and she cooked coffee.

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:16.248
Um, and, she sat down and
all she said to me,

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:19.451
she said, 'This is home,
this is what home is.'

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:25.089
This is Johann, he is a
young herder from Sweden

00:20:25.089 --> 00:20:27.292
and I spent a couple of
weeks with him.

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:31.663
And I asked him, 'What
is herding to you?

00:20:31.663 --> 00:20:33.898
What are you going to do?
What are you going to be?'

00:20:33.898 --> 00:20:36.935
And he said,
'Herding is everything.

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:39.837
I've learned this
from my uncles,

00:20:39.837 --> 00:20:43.141
I've learned it from my aunts,
I learned it from my mother.

00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.144
I am a reindeer herder.

00:20:46.144 --> 00:20:48.079
But to be a reindeer
herder today,

00:20:48.079 --> 00:20:49.147
it's very, very difficult.

00:20:49.147 --> 00:20:50.949
I won't be able to be just
a reindeer herder.

00:20:50.949 --> 00:20:53.285
I will have to take
another job.'

00:20:53.285 --> 00:20:58.055
Just the cost of the gas,
and the equipment,

00:20:58.055 --> 00:21:00.625
reindeer herding isn't
economically viable,

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:04.095
it's regulated by
the EU but

00:21:04.095 --> 00:21:07.298
what he was telling me is that
young reindeer herders,

00:21:07.298 --> 00:21:10.435
they can continue but they will
have to take other work.

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:16.908
And, this is Sven. I spent a
lot of time with Sven.

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:18.310
He came to visit me
in New York.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.047
He is 70, he's been reindeer
herding his entire life.

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.683
And I'm going to end on
another journal entry.

00:21:27.318 --> 00:21:30.088
'Today we came across
two women reindeer

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:31.556
that while fighting
locked horns.

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:34.292
Unable to unlock they
starved to death.

00:21:34.292 --> 00:21:36.594
I watched Sven as he
approached the scene.

00:21:36.594 --> 00:21:39.130
He seemed forlorn and
lost in thought.

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:41.133
I only took a few pictures.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:43.502
It struck me how
a man close to 70

00:21:43.502 --> 00:21:47.005
that had been a reindeer herder
his entire life could be so sad.

00:21:47.005 --> 00:21:47.906
I could only imagine

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:50.208
how many reindeer he had
slaughtered in his lifetime.

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:53.278
And that this cycle of life and
death would seem so natural.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.814
When I asked him, he said
that they had suffered.

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:57.482
He estimated it took
them three days

00:21:57.482 --> 00:21:59.384
to die of
starvation and cold.

00:21:59.384 --> 00:22:01.486
And this is what
bothered him.

00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:04.089
He looked at the earmark to see
whom they belonged to.

00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.525
One was his and one
was his cousin.

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:08.426
He separated their
locked horns,

00:22:08.426 --> 00:22:12.264
cut them off and brought them
home to give as a keepsake.'

00:22:13.498 --> 00:22:14.799
Thank you.

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.935
