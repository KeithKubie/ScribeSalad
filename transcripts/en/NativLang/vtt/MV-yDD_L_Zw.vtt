You are about to decide the fate of this channel.

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.060
You, I've been taking you guys seriously, really seriously. So many. Seriously,

3
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.510
seriously though. Youtube data,

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.050
bootcamps, strategies, big schemes,

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.790
bigger dreams, hunched over that notebook,

6
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.560
tongue hanging out, got those crazy. Don't mess with me eyes.

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
Then you get up too fast and let your head who comes.

8
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:39.150
We call that dedication.

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.940
Speaking of splitting,

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.970
should we stay one mixed channel or do you want to clearly separated channels?

11
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.230
This is for real folks. Be honest now, genuine. Thanks for your opinion.
