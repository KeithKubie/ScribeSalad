00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,560
Last time I told you that Sumerian had
a massive influence on later today,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,310
foreign languages. I spared you
the details though, until now.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,820
Here's my favorite example of
Sumerian. Ization run a muck.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,393
Okay.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,500
Sumerian cuneiform built words
with two kinds of characters,

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,160
syllable characters, and these
kinds of picture word characters.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,480
So scribes could write about a star
by drawing the word character star or

8
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:31,400
spelling it with the syllables. Mu
and Ooh, Moodle, Sumerian, four star.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,670
When the Acadians took over cuneiform,

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,010
they grabbed that word symbol
and also syllables to write.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,370
Cock kaaboo their own
Acadian word for star.

12
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,760
But the Acadians kept around
some Samarian baggage.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,590
Actually a lot of Samarian baggage,
which led them to a bazaar. Third option,

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,510
spell the word in Samarian, but
pronounce it in Acadian. This technique,

15
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:57,770
let them transform Sumerian words
into new symbols. Simera grams,

16
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,070
Acadian words with Sumerian spellings.

17
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,870
The Hittites got sucked into this when
they joined the Akkadian Cuneiform party.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,400
The native Hittite word for
backwards was up reasonably.

19
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,010
Hittite scribes wrote it
with three characters,

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,010
but they could also switch in
the Sumerian word for back.

21
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,890
Write it this way with the Sumeria ground.

22
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:23,210
It wasn't just Simera grounds though
the Hittites turn this around on the

23
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:27,740
Acadians creating a Qaeda
grounds. Here's a strange example.

24
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,470
Acadian used lots of little prepositions,

25
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:33,560
kind of like English on a meant for as an

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,750
Ana Lugo for the king.

27
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,310
No surprise king is in Samarian
there Hittite work differently.

28
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,070
It had all of these Indo
European case endings.

29
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,220
Therefore the king had a root hus Su and
an attached ending II date of case or

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,420
for like in Latin or Greek.
Oddly he type describes,

31
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:58,421
could write the Acadian preposition on
a next to the Sumerian Lugo even while

32
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:03,230
they read it as the Hittite Noun
with the case ending. What a mess.

33
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:06,290
Just imagine if English writers
glorified a language of this much.

34
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,450
It's like writing the word city in Greek,

35
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:13,451
but insisting that those characters spell
this sound city and then in a phrase

36
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:18,110
like for the city, we'll slap a Latin
case sending on to the Greek. Good gram.

37
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,200
Here's, see, this means
money for the city.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,820
Obviously actually Somero Keto
grams are worse. At least Greek,

39
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,950
Latin and English are related. Hittite,

40
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:31,850
Acadian and Samarian are three
different beasts. Anyhow,

41
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,540
that's one very quirky example of the
kind of linguistic influence Sumerian

42
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,860
cuneiform had on later.

43
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:41,030
Civilizations stick around throughout
2015 from more about writing and

44
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:42,230
subscribed for language.

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:48,700
[inaudible].
