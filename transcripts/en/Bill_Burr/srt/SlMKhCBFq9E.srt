1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,490
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:08,590
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday. Sorry for Thursday.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,140
No, it isn't. It's not the money. My, it's
a Thursday afternoon, just before Friday,

4
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:18,070
Monday morning podcast at [inaudible].
Just checking in on you.

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:23,500
I'm just checking in on you.
How you doing? What are you,
what are you done today?

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,210
How did you watch the news?

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,650
Did you fill your head up with all
the fucking craziness on the news?

8
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:34,600
Isn't it great watching the news? Oh yeah.
Hey, I'm waking up. I'm feeling good.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,210
You know what?
Let's turn on the news.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,390
Why would you put on the fucking news?
What are you going to see?

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,870
Are you going to see an accurate
portrayal of what's going on?

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,470
Sticking out the fucking window? I
look at your neighbor. Hey Buddy.

13
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:55,471
I look at him walking out to his car
with his little brown sack with this

14
00:00:55,931 --> 00:01:00,130
fucking lunch in it. Oh,
is he saluting Hitler?

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,250
You know, it's just, ah,

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,020
is he got a bomb strapped around his
waist as he got a mosquito on his head

17
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,720
that's biting him and Zoe
has babies with little heads.

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:11,540
Yeah.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,110
Jesus fucking
Christ the Goddamn the hysteria,

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,330
the hysteria that these
news organizations,

21
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:23,980
social media in all of this shit has
created. Yeah. Can you just need,

22
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,720
I'm just, I'm fucking one block in a
way, man. I'm walking away. I'm done.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,220
I don't need to know what's going on.
I don't need to be informed. Okay.

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,280
Because walking around in a constant
state of fucking hysteria is,

25
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,580
I don't think that that
is being informed when,

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,893
yeah,

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,900
my real, my reality, my day
to day is I get in a car,

28
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,400
I drive to a building and I write
dialog for cartoon characters.

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,750
Occasionally I get to play drums.
I do stand up,

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,310
I hang out with my wife in his,
that by right.

31
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,810
I hang out with my daughter and that's it.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,090
But I put on the news and I will literally
think that there's a glacier melting

33
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,430
right above me that's going to drown me.

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,900
Polar bears are going to swim in and eat
me with fucking a bomb strapped around

35
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:17,860
their fucking waste.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,390
That'd be body fucking relax,

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,440
fucking relax and all these people fucking
going on there and they just show and

38
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:33,670
show. Got On TV and told Trump
supporters. I love these people that like,

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,000
you know, on these fucking news channels,
they go on and they fucking, you know,

40
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:41,470
give the other side a piece of their
mind is if the other side even sees it,

41
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,990
they're too busy, like watching their
own shit. And even if they see your shit,

42
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,080
you're not going to sway them.
Equate it to the,

43
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:54,350
all those years I lived in New
York City as a Boston red sox fan.

44
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:57,140
During that time I didn't have
money for the baseball package,

45
00:02:57,141 --> 00:03:00,820
so I used to watch the yes network.
I always watched Janky home games,

46
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,710
always home and away,
whatever.

47
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,830
I rooted against them the
entire time I watched them.

48
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,860
I watched more Yankee Games from 1999
to 2007 then I watched red sox games.

49
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,590
So in theory I should have become
a Yankee fan, but I, I did not.

50
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,360
Yeah.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,120
Because I was a staunch,
uh,

52
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,760
red freckled faced red
sox fan and that's it.

53
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,660
So all these people going on TV
talking about these fucking people.

54
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:33,800
Now these fucking jerk offs are
going to go up to Boston, right?

55
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,050
You know, 18 fucking jerk offs, you know,
I know it's more than that, but everybody,

56
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,130
oh my God,
or the nats,

57
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,880
he's taken over and then they're going
to take it to show the fucking footage of

58
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:48,290
Boston and busing and all of that
shit from way back in the fucking day.

59
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,470
Is this a perfect storm or racism?

60
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,560
Is Hitler really dead when we return?

61
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,230
His body was never found.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,280
Okay.

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,210
According to reports,

64
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,680
there was an angry looking jerk off
riding around in a Mercedes Benz spotted

65
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,030
just last year

66
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,950
down in South America.
Um,

67
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,070
I'm done with all of them.

68
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,340
Absolute fucking hysteria out there.

69
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:26,660
These people are losing
their fucking minds,

70
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,200
losing their minds,
screaming and yelling at each other.

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,910
Nobody's listening to anybody.

72
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,080
Everybody's acting like
the fucking sky is falling.

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,940
One fat fuck shoots off a fucking
missile and everybody loses their shit.

74
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,580
One missile, we do that every
fucking day, but worry about this guy

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,140
when fucking fat guy with,

76
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,250
I just don't understand the level of
fucking freak out that's going on.

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,830
You know,
it's fine.

78
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,290
Yankees of playing the red
sox this weekend. All right.

79
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,290
College football's coming up.
Nfl Football,

80
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,790
baseball playoffs are coming.
It's all going to be fine.

81
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,300
All right.
I gotta tell you,

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,820
there's always been Nazi supporters
and they've kind of always had rallies,

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,390
but at, it's not like they're
growing, you know what I mean?

84
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,110
Are they, I mean, I just, I
gotta be honest with you. You,

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,390
you don't get any whiter than me
and I've never gotten a flyer.

86
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:44,080
No one's ever asked me to join. I
don't walk down the street. Hey, hey,

87
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,200
okay.

88
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,033
Guten tag.

89
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,220
Look, I'm not saying these
aren't important issues,

90
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:58,221
but I'm just saying that the level
that people are fucking freaking out.

91
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,610
All right? Just need to fucking
relax. Just fuck of a Laxman.

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:05,960
Okay.

93
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,670
You can vote against whoever you
want to vote against very soon,

94
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,970
right? Isn't it like midterm elections
and then there's this other shit.

95
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,150
You know it's going to happen. You
know what's going to happen. Okay?

96
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,550
There's this fucking country
goes, wait, gone way over here.

97
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,080
We're going to go back and back over here.
So anyways,

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,970
whatever. How are you doing? How
was your Thursday afternoon? Huh?

99
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,180
Got Good people in your life. Do
you have a sandwich today? Ah,

100
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,400
I wasn't that delicious.
Was there a terrorist in your sandwich?

101
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,140
Was there a little Nazi flag on the
fucking toothpick that they stuck in your

102
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:43,880
fucking club sandwich there?

103
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,410
Pr.
I'm going to say there wasn't,

104
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,830
I'm going to go out on a limb and
I'm going to say there wasn't,

105
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,450
I'm actually doing the Trump hand thing
right now where you put your index

106
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:55,040
finger and you're on your thumb.
I like it.

107
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,140
The other three fingers stickup
you know what's great about it?

108
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,660
You really feel like you fucking
drive and your point home.

109
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm going to start doing
that with my wife. Okay.

110
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,340
I'll tell you right now there's going
to be cold, cold beer in the fridge.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,193
Um,

112
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,460
you know at the biggest crisis in my
life is right now is I cannot fucking,

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,950
I cannot sustain

114
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,370
a work out or eating well
for any significant amount
of times to prevent me from

115
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,760
staying at the fucking weight or
gaining weight. I just can't do it.

116
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:26,990
This fucking writer's room.

117
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,430
You're just sitting in there with all
these people you love watching them slowly

118
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:35,510
die. That's what it is. Because no
matter how few calories you eat,

119
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,020
you're sitting on your fucking ass for
eight to 10 hours a day and you just

120
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,190
can't.
You can't fucking do it.

121
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm so fucking pissed at myself right now.

122
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,150
I'm going to have to
start doing two a days.

123
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:51,020
I'm going to workout in the morning
and I'm just going to have to like,

124
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,100
I don't know what to do. Went
out last night and I did, uh,

125
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,410
I did a show down at Largo and I
stopped eating it. Like, you know,

126
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,960
I don't know when the fuck I didn't
want to have like five o'clock.

127
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,920
I don't even remember what I had for
dinner. Five 30 or something like that.

128
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,020
Oh. Then I got down to the club and I
was hungry and I went to this vegetarian

129
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:16,670
restaurant, those fucking
things. Oh, I didn't eat meat.
Yeah, but what did you eat?

130
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,230
What was in that fucking sauce? You know,
it's gone right to your fucking ass,

131
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:24,470
right. Your stomach. And then, um,

132
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,240
you know, I have one,
one whiskey. That was it.

133
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,670
And then I came home and
I'm fucking starving.

134
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,870
My wife had a little bit of Thai food
and I had that and I'm just, I'm fucked.

135
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,420
I'm killing my side. I
don't know. I, I gotta,

136
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:42,500
I gotta I don't know what
happened to by discipline. Um,

137
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,650
I dunno. I'm just under a lot
of fucking stress right now.

138
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,140
I guess that's why I'm having
this reaction to the fucking news.

139
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,860
And everybody's watching it and then
they are coming in and they're like,

140
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:55,560
can you fucking believe this? Can you
fucking believe this? It's just like,

141
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,390
all right, Kay. You know, it'd
be great in the news that they,

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,500
if they showed the amount of fucking
people last week who didn't get in a car

143
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,590
and plow down a bunch of fucking people,
like a complete piece of shit,

144
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:08,880
that would be the rest of us.
Then this one fucking asshole does it.

145
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,050
And then everybody starts thinking,

146
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,010
is this what the world's going to be
like now? Is this going to happen?

147
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,850
It's just how fucking,

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,210
I don't know how awful a fucking parents
did that person have Jesus Christ.

149
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:18,361
You know?

150
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,180
I think when your kid starts putting
like the Hitler poster on the wall,

151
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,920
it's time to be a little more involved.

152
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,790
Maybe sign them up for volleyball or
something. Try to get them out there,

153
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,624
you know?

154
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,363
All right.

155
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,040
I Dunno what you do with that.
Is there a hotline for that?

156
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,340
A one 800.
My son's into Hitler.

157
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,390
A one 800. I keep finding two
holes poked in the pillow cases.

158
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,700
Um, you know what I mean?
There's unconditional love
and then there's Hitler.

159
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,520
Right? Who's kidding who, and then it's
Kinda like, all right. You know what? Uh,

160
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:57,570
I think it's a time to ship you off to
the loony Bin and let's make a new kid.

161
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,260
It's time to make a new kid shot.
You know what?

162
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,220
You're like an old star
Steinburg Gulf,

163
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,460
which you like Brett Farve when he
got shipped to the fucking jets.

164
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,340
It's all there for you. It's over. Okay.

165
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't make the pass across the
field anymore. You know what I mean?

166
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:19,710
You've lost your vision, ed.
You got posters, a Hitler,
it's over with Trey to you,

167
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:24,030
to the New York jets and what bringing in
the nose. That baby, she had a baby man.

168
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,590
We're having a fucking,
that's what I would do.

169
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,330
Yeah.

170
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,520
By kid became a racist.

171
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:32,570
I would fucking turn my kid in and then I
would just make a new kid. That's it. I,

172
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,000
you know, go back to the
draft. You know what I mean?

173
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,760
I maybe adopt basically
signed a free agent.

174
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,360
Yeah.

175
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,950
Yeah.

176
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,390
You really have to have a strict no
Hitler fucking policy and your house.

177
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,410
You just have to have it.

178
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,440
Um, anyways, I saw this thing where, uh,

179
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,430
people were going on to an white people
go into an and ancestry.com and we're

180
00:10:57,431 --> 00:11:01,690
not pleased with some of
the results. Yeah. I mean,

181
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:04,570
that's going to happen,
right? It's going to happen.

182
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,270
You're going to find a couple of surprises
in there that's going to fuck up.

183
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:11,200
Fuck with your manifesto. You know,
I would love if he could fucking,

184
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,170
what the fuck did they

185
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,480
do with Hitler anyways? What
do you mean? Even if he lived,

186
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:19,050
he's gotta be dead by now. Right. And
what was that guy born 1890 something.

187
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,850
He's so evil. Like maybe he's still
alive. Just the hate is keeping him going.

188
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,550
Yeah.

189
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,340
You know,

190
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,340
just picture them with like a fucking
s s walker screaming with every step

191
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:36,800
trying to get to the fucking toilet,
you know,

192
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,470
to take a master race shit.

193
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,270
Ah,
if

194
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,280
they only just encouraged
his painting at that,

195
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:51,280
it only happened that you wouldn't have
all this craziness. Why you still want,

196
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:55,270
they'd find something else anyways,
socks up, down, up, down, up,

197
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:58,780
down against this week it a Yankees,

198
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:00,670
I think they won last
night against the mets.

199
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,520
So the red sox Yankees
played this weekend. Right.

200
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,400
Everybody's going to have a
good time and enjoy the game.

201
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:10,990
I take way out to the ball game,
take me out to the crowd,

202
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,750
buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks,

203
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,223
you know,

204
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:22,080
scan your fingerprints at fucking tiger
stadium because you are a fucking dope

205
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,980
opal. So anyways, I'm going to
start doing two a day workouts.

206
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,800
That's when I got to do it. And I just
have to, I have to fucking commit.

207
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,703
MMM.

208
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm trying to figure out this new life
that I have with this fucking writer's

209
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,900
room because it takes up so much,
so much of my head

210
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,920
time that um,

211
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,890
you know, I have a very finite
amount of time to fucking work out.

212
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,700
It's still actually keep my standup back
going and all of this shit and I think

213
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:48,870
it's causing me stress.

214
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,240
And uh, maybe that's the fucking
problem. Maybe I'm just old.

215
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,350
I Dunno. I got a fight. A dude,
I can't have the fucking dead,

216
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,420
but you know,

217
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,520
we just like just thick it big fucking
you stupid skinny arms coming out the

218
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:09,110
side that Mr. Potato Head,
fucking body, you know,

219
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,510
I can't fucking do it.

220
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,170
I guess also because I blew out my
shoulder, which is finally the thing is,

221
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,150
is better now I'm going really slow.
Add the a the rotator cuff shit going on.

222
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:26,950
Right. So I'm now, this morning I actually
for the first time in like a year,

223
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,380
I had the fucking Bob Bell and I was
benching and I had five pounds on each

224
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:36,470
side.
That's how long and slow this processes.

225
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,560
And I felt like the,

226
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:40,850
just a little something and I was
going to do three sets and I said I

227
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:44,090
immediately stopped, which is what
you have to do with an injury.

228
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
So you'd have to immediately
go, you know what? Fuck this.

229
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,390
I'm not doing this anymore. So
anyways, let's, let's, you know, let's,

230
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:52,710
let's Google some news.

231
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,180
Yeah.

232
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,830
Google cans cancels domain
registration for daily stormer.

233
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,900
All right,
let's see what we got here.

234
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:04,390
Google has canceled all this is
going to be more hate groups. Shit.

235
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,620
Justin Bieber may been unknown. 17
year old, famous with a single picture.

236
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:14,470
Uh,

237
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,470
really a reporter calls out Huckabee's
claim that countless FBI employees were.

238
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,130
That's like reporting.
Now you just put,

239
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,100
your headline is really three death foods.
You should avoid

240
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,720
death foods.
Okay.

241
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,570
All right, let's just
read this one. Let's see,

242
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:38,500
we see we are canceling daily stormers
registration with Google domains for

243
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:43,090
violating our terms of
service. This supposed person
told business insider, well,

244
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,130
where the fuck was this a while ago?
Uh,

245
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,680
you read Google's registration agreement,
you can read it here. Okay, go, go.

246
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,070
Didn't want it.
Service used to incite violence.

247
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,470
A source close to Google
told business insider. Um,

248
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,490
I dunno, I hate to do
the Cliche, but when you,

249
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,720
those fucking white supremacist groups,
they just, the dumbest fucking people

250
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,590
look at this fucking guy.

251
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,033
Okay?

252
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,200
It's like if they went there, they
made a movie about white supremacists.

253
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,430
Guy went to the casting.

254
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,703
I Dunno,

255
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,970
I don't get people who go down and protest
the fucking these hate groups just to

256
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,280
let him go down there and screaming,
yell to nobody.

257
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,830
You know what I mean? Why do you go
down there and then what do you do?

258
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,950
You start tearing their signs down
as if they're going to be like, oh,

259
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:44,270
they tore our side down.
Now I see their fucking,

260
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,530
now I see this side of it.

261
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:50,120
All you're doing is reinforcing it in
their head that you guys are fucking

262
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:53,240
assholes.
You should go down there.

263
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:55,180
You should make them a little pumpkin pie,

264
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,180
little apple pie and just give him
some food and just be nice to them.

265
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:02,600
That's what we should do with that
fucking guy that fatty over there in North

266
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,433
Korea.

267
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,713
You know,

268
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,020
Bob's trumpet go over there and smoke
a cigar with the talk about grabbing

269
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:11,850
pussies. Whatever the fuck
you wanted to do, you know?

270
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,450
Yeah.

271
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,220
Instead of using the old book, we do that.
We're going to do this. All right. Um,

272
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,600
oh God.
I have to get out of this vortex here.

273
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:29,190
I just fucking Google News Boston to
hate groups. You're not welcome here.

274
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,930
Ah, you're not welcome
here. We got plenty of VI.

275
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,030
Hate is already here in Boston

276
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,873
that,
that

277
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,440
it'll be funny if other racists in
Boston were upset about the racist coming

278
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,010
here. They're going to take our,
Hey, I think I'd take her jobs, man.

279
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,563
Okay.

280
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:52,021
Doh.

281
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:56,190
We can't have a bunch of other people
coming up here dropping the fucking Edward

282
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,050
or what are we going to dote in?

283
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,900
You're not wanted here. Dope. We're not
hiring. We got fucking plenty of them.

284
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:12,430
Um, anyways. Uh, what else? What
else? I got nothing going on,

285
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:12,611
dude.

286
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:16,150
I'm just sitting in a fucking writer's
room eating salads and somehow putting on

287
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:20,080
weight because at the end of the day, I
fuck it up. But last night I was at Largo.

288
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,070
I've got one more show down there
tonight. Um, I worked with Joe Barton,

289
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:28,770
nick and Todd rex to
absolute fucking bese and um,

290
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,030
they killed it last night. We're going
to be down there again tonight for a,

291
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,940
a a great cause. A friend of mine, uh,

292
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,730
peak common unfortunately
passed away last year. Uh,

293
00:17:39,731 --> 00:17:44,050
one of the great comics that I met
on the way up and just a great guy.

294
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:45,670
So we're raising money for his kids.

295
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:49,620
So I want to thank everybody that
came down there last night tonight,

296
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,810
raising funds, doing something
positive, not being an isis,

297
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:00,610
not being in a hate group.
Write something positive.

298
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,290
Um,
honey,

299
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:09,580
when I told you I wanted you to be more
social, I should've been more specific.

300
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,800
That's it. Mom pulling up to like
a Klan rally yelling at her son

301
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,770
Timmy. I wish you wouldn't do
that. I really wish you wouldn't.

302
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:30,130
Could you just stop it? I mean, um,

303
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
anyways, I just can't get out of
the vortex of that. So anyways,

304
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,290
I'm all freckles is trying to invest his
fucking money because the government's

305
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,124
taken all of it.

306
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,790
And I'm sitting here trying to buy the
smallest of small little properties here.

307
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,300
So someday when I'm in my
fucking seventies and eighties,

308
00:18:46,301 --> 00:18:49,690
and I don't feel like going out on the
road unless I want to, I don't have to.

309
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,520
You know what I mean? I
don't want to fuck, you know
what I mean? Cause you know,

310
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:56,620
you,
what goes up comes back down again.

311
00:18:56,621 --> 00:19:01,621
And if I'd start the gentle slide back
down to doing the fucking comedy vault at

312
00:19:02,261 --> 00:19:06,220
Remington's in Boston, when
I'm in my eighties, um,

313
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:09,820
which unfortunately that room finally
passed away like a year or two ago,

314
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,040
about a year and a half
ago. The comedy vault. Okay.

315
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,180
Legendary room starting in 1993.
Dick Doroty.

316
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,650
How Spike Tobin,
I was on one of the first nights.

317
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,400
They're put together my first five
minutes write down there right next to the

318
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:27,940
fucking bank vault.
Why am I thinking of that shit?

319
00:19:27,941 --> 00:19:31,900
Because right now I'm trying
to get a loan. All right.

320
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,500
And I have,
I should have perfect fucking credit,

321
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,710
but I don't because I pay off my
credit cards every fucking month.

322
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,740
So when they don't like that,
I paid off my loans early.

323
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,880
They don't like that dings your credit.
They look at that like a loss. Like, Hey,

324
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,420
we were gonna make five grand off this
loan. He paid it off twice as fast,

325
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,770
really made 2,500 bucks.
We lost 2,500 bucks in this guy.

326
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,880
So I've given these guys every fucking
goddamn piece of information they need.

327
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,650
I have the credit, I have the
fucking money. It's a fucking joke.

328
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,150
And then today they come at me.
They want two years of my, uh,

329
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,840
my fucking cell phone bill.

330
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,890
Now I've got to dig through all
of my shit to try and find that.

331
00:20:12,891 --> 00:20:17,030
And I just want to say to them, you can
you just tell me why you need all this?

332
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,300
Oh, these are the new regulations.
Blood. Yes. Yes. And why?

333
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,450
Why are these new regular, why do these
New York regulations exist? Yeah. Well,

334
00:20:25,451 --> 00:20:29,940
I mean that's just something that all,
yeah,

335
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,160
they exist because you guys were
irresponsible with your own country,

336
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,090
Mints Money 10 fucking years ago and you
fucking nuclear economy. I didn't do it.

337
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,150
I'm a responsible fucking guy.
I live within my means.

338
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:47,950
My checkbook is balanced and now I have
to jump through all these hoops. Why?

339
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,660
Because you guys are greasy,

340
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:54,430
greedy fucking pieces of shit that gave
every fucking mouth breathing dope.

341
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:58,960
500 fucking thousand dollars came
walking through your bank doors for good.

342
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:00,880
Seven,
eight years in the last decade.

343
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,970
Now I got to sit here digging through
shoe boxes. A fucking phone bills.

344
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,120
Okay?

345
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,210
You know, because you're a double
secret probation cause you're a fuck up.

346
00:21:11,211 --> 00:21:12,860
I love how cause they're a fuck up.

347
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,890
All of a sudden it reverts back to me
like now I have to pay for this since

348
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,210
well actually build this you the fact
that they are holding their feet to the

349
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:24,060
fire like DC,

350
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,630
you know that's a good thing for you
and your money because your money's tied

351
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,960
into the system. I realized that.
I just wish that when you say, hey,

352
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:33,770
why do I have to do this?
They don't hide behind a regulations.

353
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,940
They should say, well, because
we got so greedy 10 years ago,

354
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,170
the combination of our greed
ended up with the, the fucking,

355
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,460
the cooking of the fucking economy and
old people thought they could retire then

356
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:51,710
had to continue working right
into their fucking grave.

357
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,470
That's what the fuck we
did with your money. Hence,

358
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,760
we need to see the last fucking two
years. You got damn phone bill. Oh,

359
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:02,060
we're taking collars. Um, all right.

360
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:05,510
Let me read a couple of
advertisements here. All right.

361
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,670
All right.
In don't cheat or Indochina,

362
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,030
Indochina, uh, talk about how every man
looks better in his suit. Ah, tell you,

363
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,310
you know what I mean? When I
look at Paul version, I'm like,

364
00:22:19,311 --> 00:22:22,880
this guy's a fucking animal. Yet you
put them in a suit. I'm like, Holy Shit.

365
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,230
I want to hear what that man has to say.
He looks a lot better.

366
00:22:27,231 --> 00:22:30,830
Look at him in that three piece
suit and those Jordan threes. Dude,

367
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,510
the Jordan's phrase with the
three piece suit, dude, um,

368
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,560
Indochino is making it easy
to get perfectly tailored,

369
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,140

at an incredible price.

372
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,200
whether it's for work or a wedding
or another special occasion.

373
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,560

wear brand in the world.

375
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,800
Here's how it works.

376
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,630
You drop your fucking drawers and a
little fella comes in and he measured from

377
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:10,760
your ball bag down to
your ankle. No, sorry.

378
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,060
Visit a showroom or shop
online@indochino.com pick your fabric.

379
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,760
What do you want next to your bulls?

lapels to pleats to jacket linings
in more. Submit your measurements,

382

Me Undies,

395
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,810
your sons into fucking Hitler.
Do to to to be on these beyond the days,

396
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,490
but has pants on and watch
him take his shit lawyer.

397
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,280
He's got a fucking Adolf stash.
What do you need? Nothing rhymes.

398
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:44,240
I'm fucking sorry. Fuck. I went
with Hitler and mustache stash.

399
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,210
He's got a Hitler fucking stash.
You're a dope. You fucking white trash.

400
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:52,070
No one cares.
You're not supreme.

401
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,000
You just a bunch of fucking
losers getting sunburns.

402
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,240
Everyone should just ignore them.

403
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,300
I love that whole feeling
that if you ignore them,

404
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:06,540
that that's just what exactly what they
did when they were in fucking German up.

405
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,910
This is different. This is different.
Okay. You don't have a fleas, aren't you?

406
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,360
That this is different,
right? Isn't it different?

407
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,350
It's completely different.

408
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,540
It's a different scenario. This
country is on top. Germany wasn't,

409
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,400
you know what I mean? If this country
spiraled down in the rankings,

410
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,070
you know like what happened to the
Michigan Wolverines over the last 20 years

411
00:25:34,071 --> 00:25:34,461
where they were,

412
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:38,840
they were this powerhouse fucking program
and then they just dropped out at site,

413
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,190
flatlined for 15 years. That's when,
that's when they can take hold.

414
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:45,350
But you know everybody,
everybody's got their fucking,

415
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,650
everybody's walking around with Crocs,
right?

416
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,870
They got the Jags Jagging Zion.
Everybody's got a flat screen TV.

417
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,850
Everybody's putting on weight, like
meets a fucking great country. So they,

418
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,490
nobody hears them.
I don't think,

419
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,370
now I'm just going to shut up me undies.
Okay,

420
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:06,710
you want to look good in your
underwear? And be comfortable. Right?

421
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,570
But that perfect balance is hard to find.
Yeah. If you're fucking mushrooms fat,

422
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:16,100
fuck like me. Talk about why me undies
is the best underwear you will ever own.

423
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,200
Feel free to improvise.

424
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,780
Um, listen, I just, if you fucking
want your balls to fill nice and soft,

425
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,840
okay.
Do you want to treat your balls right?

426
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,030
Basically the weak point in the
death star, that is the male body,

427
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,350
which is the balls.
Okay?

428
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,080
Cause I don't give a shit how
many fucking weights you lift,

429
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,930
how many fucking come
full classes you take.

430
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,050
If you look in the other way in a fucking,
I don't care.

431
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:49,530
A little bunny rabbit is hopping by and

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,220

485
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:58,330
So right now you don't give a shit. I'll
fucking walk right up to an alligator.

What do you got buddy? Right? I
don't care. I'm covered. Legal Zoom.

487
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,450
Design A, design this kid to provide
the tools you need all in one place.

488
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:11,410
Whether a will or a trust
is right for you. I do both.

489
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,180
I have a will and a trust.
All right. Do not revive me.

490
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,040
Light me up. Do not bury me
in the ground. That's it.

491
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,100
Sprinkle my ashes over a dumpster.
Move on.

492
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,040
Um, I should actually say, just put me in
the ground. No coffin. Right there you go.

493
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,990
No coughing. Just let me
fucking decompose. Naturally.
Feed the fucking soil.

494
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,260
He's no dumb. It is that we actually,
you put a box in the ground.

495
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,000
It's so fucking stupid.
You dead. It's over.

496
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,640
But what if I still feel something? Then
you'd still be alive, but you're dead.

497
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,890
You know,
like those people who won't get cremated,

498
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:56,980
but they're going to sit there and let
somebody fucking drain all the shit out

499
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:00,190
of him. Take out all your fucking organs
and then fill it up with formaldehyde or

500
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,550
whatever the fuck they do.
Or you can just get it over with.

501
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:06,130
If you actually feel anything,
you just be like, ah,

502
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,990
like a fucking minute and a half in and
then it's over. What do you die again?

503
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,030

legal, zoom.com/prepare it.

509
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:34,390
And I have to tell you something.
If you're married and you have kids,

510
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:38,840
you have to do that. There's so many
guys out there, they're just afraid of,

511
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,910
of thinking about their own mortality.
And I have to tell you, it's, it's a,

512
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,860
it's a weight off of your chest, all
right? Cause when you get to my age,

513
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,290
you're going to see,
unfortunately,

514
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,350
people dying who don't do that stuff.

515
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,250
And how they leave their loved ones is,

516
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,810
is the second tragedy. Um, you know,

517
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,020
so don't fucking do that to
the people you love, all right?

518
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:08,170
Being dead serious here. Dead
fucking serious, no pun intended.

519
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,000
You've got to fucking do that.
You got to take care of them.

520
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,060
You're going to die fucking
deal with it all right?

521
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:14,950
And God knows if you've
got a woman in your life,

522
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:18,820
you're going to die sooner rather than
fucking later with all of this shit that

523
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:22,450
they do, they just, you know, they
can't help. It's just what they are.

524
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,920
They give they love and they
take this to balance. You know,

525
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,840
everything that they give your kid a,

526
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,650
they take away from you and
then you just slowly died.

527
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,090
This lonely existence in a
room full of other people.

528
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:37,390
And that is the podcast for
this afternoon. Kidding. Um,

529
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,300
that's everyday was fucking around
today on this podcast. But seriously,

530
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,560
stick your head out the window. You
know, just fucking everybody relax.

531
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,880
Fucking relax.

532
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,010
She's fucking Christ. He can see
these goddamn people. I mean,

533
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:57,270
they're too fucking stupid. They're too
fucking stupid to brush their teeth.

534
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,460
They're going to run
a country. Um, anyway.

535
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,670
And what does everything always go back
to Germany to this is like jeopardy and

536
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:08,340
the fucking 1930s. Well,
why isn't it like Russia?

537
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,430
Oh,

538
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,630
why is it that our country in the
fucking 16, 17 and 18 hundreds,

539
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,650
it wasn't exactly a great place to
live for a lot of fucking people. Um,

540
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,340
oh Jesus, now I'm doing it.
I'm talking to the fucking,

541
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:29,820
I don't know what I'm doing. Am I, am I
ranting and raving now? I have no idea.

542
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:33,300
All I know is I'm going to be in a good
mood today and I have to do two a days,

543
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,360
two a day. So I don't look
like a freckle doughboy here.

544
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,340
I worked out this morning,
you know,

545
00:33:38,341 --> 00:33:41,610
I did my little half hour on the fucking
elliptical and I threw the weights

546
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:45,990
around.
Now the most crucial thing is what I eat.

547
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:49,590
And when I stopped fucking eating.
All right,

548
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,660
so I already got it tonight.

549
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:56,661
I stopped eating at five o'clock I'm
having a Turkey Patty with the Tabbouleh

550
00:33:58,830 --> 00:33:59,610
Salad,
and then that's it.

551
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,100
And then I have to drink waters
for the rest of the fucking time.

552
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:04,140
And then to make up for my,
since last night,

553
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,550
I'm going to skip rope for
fucking three rounds. You know,

554
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,410
try to burn off some shit that way.
And maybe that's what I'll do.

555
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:14,430
I'll do fucking two a days. Is that what
I got to do? I know what I gotta do.

556
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:16,830
I gotta fucking get out of this
writer's room. That's what I have to do.

557
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,840
Maybe instead of taking a lunch,
maybe I'll,

558
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:23,130
I'll fucking bringing elliptical into
the office. And when we pitched jokes,

559
00:34:23,131 --> 00:34:24,450
I'll just be on the fucking thing.

560
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,470
And everybody in the writer's
room just takes a turn, you know,

561
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,710
or every time you pitch a joke
and it doesn't get a laugh,

562
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,460
he owed 10 minutes on the
fucking elliptical. You know,

563
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,910
our whole fucking room will look like a,
you know,

564
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,120
they look at the end of the Tour de
France. We just burned so many calories.

565
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:48,030
Like your body's like eating yourself.
Um,

566
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,780
they'd be going to the table reads by
episodes eight and nine being like,

567
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:52,591
you know,
it's a funny show,

568
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:56,730
but Jesus Christ fucking Amaziah
what kind of show we do it here?

569
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,320
Um, they put their heart and soul into
this fucking thing. Um, oh wait a second.

570
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:04,650
All of a sudden it got loud in my
ears. Oh, I turned it up by accident.

571
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,750
Brushed against it with my forearm
there. All right. Um, hey, by the way,

572
00:35:09,751 --> 00:35:11,490
I got a new band and
I'd been listening to,

573
00:35:11,491 --> 00:35:14,580
and I'm not going to remember the fucking
name of him cause I know my phone.

574
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,800
It's a really weird name for a band.
Let me see.

575
00:35:19,801 --> 00:35:24,330
I'm opening my fucking iTunes,
go to artists.

576
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,130
I know it begins with an a, this is
getting everybody excited, pleased.

577
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,850
Say My alt J.

578
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,670
I downloaded this album called this
is all yours and I fucking love it.

579
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,400
Great album, great album
to chill out to. I listen,

580
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:41,570
I worked out to what this morning
cause it was early in the morning.

581
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,860
It's kind of fucking, you know, you know,

582
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:46,320
creepy and mellow and all
that type of stuff. You know,

583
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,130
I guess I knew I was going to get
on the fucking s scale, but um,

584
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:55,410
I never heard of them. And Josh, Adam
Meyers from the goddamn comedy jam,

585
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,810
the actually when I was
on the road he goes, Hey,

586
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:01,470
I'm going to go see this band
tonight. Uh, all Jay and Mike, what?

587
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,940
I thought it was a Typo.

588
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:08,250
It's a l t lowercase dash capital j.
Uh,

589
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,600
I really enjoyed them.
And once again,

590
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,830
you math has a new album coming out
next month. Alright, that is it.

591
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:14,930
Please listen to the music.

592
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,630
Little interlude here before we give you
another half hour of greatest hits from

593
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:20,820
a Thursday afternoon
podcasts from a Thursday,

594
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:25,320
from a Thursday that went by on a Thursday
that you didn't even pay attention to.

595
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,370
All right. That's it. God bless you.

596
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,820
Thank you for not being a Nazi and a,

597
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:37,440
I'll have a good weekend. You can
sit. I'll talk to you on Monday.

598
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:47,870
And the Nice

599
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,390
[inaudible] far
trumpets,

600
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,130
the suit of Patty,
they say

601
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,390
your son.
No

602
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:14,270
cause no body is

603
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,410
dry
walleyes.

604
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,680
Hey,
what's going on?

605
00:37:31,681 --> 00:37:35,460
It's Bill Barr and this is the
Monday morning podcasts from Monday,

606
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,370
August 17th,

607
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,050
2007 2009 why can't I have a decent date,
right?

608
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,161
I actually,

609
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:49,161
this is the second time I started the
podcast because I always just start it and

610
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:53,130
then I go to say the date and I
realize I don't know what the date is.

611
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,990
So I'm sick of doing that.

612
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,570
Like I just did that and I fucked
up the date and I was like,

613
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:00,000
I do this every time.
People are gonna think it's a gimmick,

614
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:03,780
like always deliberately fucking
up to date. So I just hit stop.

615
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,900
I hit a race and I started over again
and I fucked up the year something wrong

616
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,960
with my brain. You know what
it was? Cause it was the 17th.

617
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,430
Then my brain was thinking seven. So
then when I went to say, the year,

618
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:21,810
I say said 2007, in case you're
wondering case you're wondering,

619
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,780
I'm anyways, I'm actually, uh,

620
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,380
it's Sunday when I'm doing
this podcast because, uh,

621
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,720
if you listen to this east
coast time in the morning,

622
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:34,980
I'm on an airplane right now. And
uh, I just got a bunch of shit to do.

623
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,880
So I figured, uh, I'm not doing anything
today. Why not bang out a podcast,

624
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,403
you know,

625
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,840
anybody can go out and Atlanta and hang
out with another human being. You know,

626
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:51,580
it takes a real secure fucking loser,

627
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,260
okay. To, uh, you know,

628
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:57,830
still being his fucking hotel
bed at what the fuck time is it?

629
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,710
1220 in the afternoon.
Ah,

630
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,250
Jesus Christ watching the,
um,

631
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,920
whatever the fuck golf major.
This is the PGA.

632
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,570
I'm actually betting against tiger
woods kind of have this ongoing a bet.

633
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,660
I keep betting against tiger
woods with a another comic,

634
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:21,700
a friend of mine who is of
African persuasion, you know,

635
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,960
basically, cause I've kind of not
been watching baseball lately. Uh,

636
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,220
I've been trying to pick up new sports
and the only way for me to get into golf

637
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,640
is to have stupid ass bets. So I
figure I'll bet against not only while,

638
00:39:34,641 --> 00:39:36,070
I bet against tiger woods,

639
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,540
I will bet against tiger
woods with another black dude.

640
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,460
And I will, uh, you know, just
to make an interesting, you know,

641
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,180
say dumb shit, like golf's a white man's
game. Um, I'm betting on Ernie els.

642
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,340
You know what?
I actually won in the fucking masters,

643
00:39:55,341 --> 00:39:59,700
I bet on Phil Mickelson and I won that
one cause he beat tiger woods. And then,

644
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:02,130
I don't know, I got busy and I
could've won another, you know,

645
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,750
we bet like 25 bucks a major,

646
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,280
I could have won the US Open and I
also could have won the fucking, uh,

647
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,450
that went over there in
England and I blew those off

648
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,650
and I think I'm going to lose today.
It's weird. I'm betting against tiger,

649
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:20,680
but you know, my money is, but I'm
actually rooting for him, you know?

650
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,650
Is that exciting now? I don't think
it is either. Anyways, let's, uh,

651
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,320
let's plow ahead here.
I'm going to fucking bad mood.

652
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,740
I had a really had a
really bad show last night.

653
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,720
Now I had a bad show.

654
00:40:35,721 --> 00:40:40,320
I went up there and I did this whole
bit on Michael Vick coming back and it

655
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:43,830
killed and everybody was having a great
time. And then at the end of my set, this,

656
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:47,700
this woman comes up to me and,
uh,

657
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,990
you like when someone's going to insult
you, you know, rather than have an,

658
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:54,820
I'm going to insult you.
Look on their face.

659
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:58,480
They come up and they have an ear to ear,
like Erik Estrada Grin on their face.

660
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,150
That's what she was doing. And she was
just going to like, hi. Hey, how are you?

661
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,080
Yeah, yeah. That whole thing
about Michael Vick. Yeah. Yeah.

662
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:12,650
Did you really believe that? Is that
really how you feel? Yeah, and I,

663
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:15,880
I immediately knew. I'm like, Oh
God, this is a dog lover. Here we go.

664
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,930
So I was just like a, okay
ma'am. All right. I'm sorry.

665
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,600
I'm sorry I didn't like the show.
Uh, you know, they're just jokes.

666
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:24,850
If you want to take them seriously,
go ahead and take them seriously.

667
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,550
And then she just gave here.
Yeah. Yeah. Cause you stayed.

668
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:29,350
Me and she statements are really ignorant.

669
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,900
I just say you should know that
she was like nodding and smiling.

670
00:41:31,901 --> 00:41:36,200
You stay me through really ignorant. It's
like first of all, why are you smiling?

671
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:42,020
You know, I I, that was the most annoying
thing. Not that she came up to me.

672
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,760
I mean it's my own God damn fault.

673
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,890
I fucking not only do I go on stage
and I say a bunch of stupid shit,

674
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:50,320
but then I stand there
like an idiot selling DVDs.

675
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:55,150
I'm opening myself to somebody coming up
to me and telling me to go fuck myself.

676
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,620
I don't have a problem with that.

677
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That comes with being a fuck can shit at
who sells DVDs at the end of his show.

678
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,390
All right.
So I totally could have avoided that.

679
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,010
So I'm not complaining about that.

680
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:11,510
What I'm complaining about is people
who are telling you to go fuck yourself,

681
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,010
but they're smiling. Like, is that
supposed to like mind? Fuck me.

682
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,880
Like I'm gonna like I'm not even going
to notice what you're saying. Okay. Like,

683
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:23,380
wow, it sounds like she's telling me
to go fuck myself, but she's smiling.

684
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,350
Maybe I'm hearing this wrong.
And then she's like,

685
00:42:26,351 --> 00:42:30,010
your statements are really ignorant. And
she's nodding like, you know what I mean?

686
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:34,180
Like that bugs bunny shit. Like remember
that when he, when he would be like, no,

687
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,250
you know they've gotta be
like, yes, no, yes, no.

688
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,710
And then at some point
he would switch and go,

689
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,830
he would switch over his fucking
argument than the other guy would end up

690
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:45,010
arguing bugs bunny's argument. That's
what the fuck she was trying to do to me,

691
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,400
you statements are really ignorant and
she's like nodding like I'm going to be

692
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:52,730
like, yes, my statements were
ignorant. So I said, lady,

693
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,600
so basically what you're telling me is
because I don't agree with your point of

694
00:42:56,601 --> 00:43:01,310
view, that that makes me ignorant. And,
and then she pulls this, this thing.

695
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:05,510
She goes, I'm actually a member
of the humane society. All right.

696
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,000
You know,
first of all,

697
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:12,530
who the fuck breaks out credits during
an argument? You know what I mean?

698
00:43:12,531 --> 00:43:15,770
She says it right. I'm, I'm a
member of the humane society, right?

699
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:19,190
Like it's supposed to be like this.
Dun, Dun, Dun fucking moment. Oh Shit.

700
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,950
Are you a member of the humane society?
Good Lord.

701
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:26,000
How many years of college did
it take to get that Holy Shit?

702
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,110
Did you have to go through medical
school to become a member of the fucking

703
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:33,710
humane society? I actually, if
I have the second was like, wow,

704
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,940
I actually thought that she was on the
board of the humane society. First of all,

705
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,890
I don't even know what the
fucking humane society is.

706
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,260
Humane sounds like Humana to me,

707
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,460
like you're into people and evidently
it isn't. You're into fucking animals.

708
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,630
So I'm sitting here later on tonight,
I'll fucking annoyed with this lady.

709
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,020
This lady is Jerry Lewis would say,
right?

710
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,610
I'm all fucking annoyed with this
lady thinking like a man. I'm like,

711
00:43:58,611 --> 00:44:02,480
wait a minute.
She's a member of the humane society.

712
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,760
You know, I was a fucking
member of, uh, the fuck is that,

713
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:09,440
that that day.
Now of course I can't remember.

714
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,020
You know what I'm taking right
now is how fucked up my brain is.

715
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,730
I'm thinking a apocalypse now.
Amnesty International.

716
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,910
I know it was an a because I,
for some reason I thought there was a pa,

717
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,690
I was a member of Amnesty International
for like, like two, three years,

718
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,040
you know, that was against torture
and people around the world.

719
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:31,530
And he and I became a member.
I gave him 25 bucks.

720
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,180
I went on the Internet
and I gave him 25 bucks.

721
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,820
I have no fucking idea what
they did with the money.

722
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,190
I don't know if they stopped
someone from getting tortured.

723
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,900
I don't know if they just took
that money and they both, you know,

724
00:44:42,901 --> 00:44:47,450
a couple of them went out to a movie.
Yeah. 25 bucks. We go to the matinee can,

725
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:51,410
I was probably eight bucks each set up
for some popcorn to two tickets and a

726
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:56,120
popcorn. Come on and do it. We're
not going to stop torture. Um,

727
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,120
so that's what I did. So go, let
me go on the fucking Internet.

728
00:44:59,121 --> 00:45:03,400
Let me look up this, this, uh,
this humane society. And uh,

729
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,280
so I went to it humane
society.org and sure enough,

730
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,410
this is all you have to
do to become a member.

731
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:13,670
It's $19 a month or
whatever you can afford.

732
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,040
So I could give these fucking people a
dollar a month and then I too could walk

733
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:23,510
around and be a total fucking cunt and
then throw out my credit that I am a

734
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:25,970
member of the humane society.
And you know what?

735
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,090
I'm going to fucking join
the humane society at $1.

736
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,460
So the next time I do
this Michael Vick bit,

737
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:35,900
when one of these fucking psycho people
comes up to me having memory of the

738
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:40,460
humane society, Oh shit. You
know what? So Am I. Holy Shit.

739
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:43,070
I can't believe I didn't see it,
the meeting. Oh, that's right.

740
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,390
Neither one of us go to him.

741
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,170
Yeah,

742
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,320
there is no fucking meetings.
A member of you made society.

743
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,360
You want to fucking,
I can't put,

744
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:56,620
she threw that out like she was on fucking
like she just did the tonight show.

745
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,320
I'm the head of NBC.
You will never get a show on my network.

746
00:46:02,321 --> 00:46:07,180
That's the way the fuck she was saying it.
God dammit.

747
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:11,270
It got worse. It got worse. So you
know me, someone's being a con to me.

748
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:14,030
No one can out count me.
So you know,

749
00:46:14,031 --> 00:46:17,510
I'm actually upset with myself
because I allowed her to make me mad.

750
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,620
As you can tell, considering it's
fucking 12 hours later and I'm still on,

751
00:46:21,621 --> 00:46:25,940
I'm talking about it alone in my hotel
room with the drapes, pulled clothes.

752
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,940
This is how I always do it on the road.
Fucking sit around like Howard Hughes. Um,

753
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,040
yeah. So then she goes, uh, you know,

754
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:37,550
I remember the human or humane society and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said,

755
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:38,384
look,
okay,

756
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,733
okay.

757
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:44,320
You know, I just, I don't want to do,
why do people take comedy seriously?

758
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,650
Those are stand up comedy
show. I'm not doing it. I'm,

759
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,650
I can't even begin to tell you
guys how many times am I act.

760
00:46:50,651 --> 00:46:54,850
I say that I'm a moron. You guys listen
to my podcast. You know I'm a moron.

761
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,320
Actually,
some people don't.

762
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,370
I had some guy send me this fucking email
this week on bill for the love of God.

763
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:03,880
Stop talking about banks. You
sound like a moron. Read this shit.

764
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,690
What do you mean read this shit?
That is goes against everything that I am.

765
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:13,060
I don't fucking read. And Like I love
how you talked about those banks.

766
00:47:13,061 --> 00:47:16,090
You sounded like a moron. And what?
When I talked about the other shit,

767
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:17,470
I sounded intelligent.
Yeah.

768
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:24,840
So fucking podcast. Just
stand up back. I don't,

769
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,270
I don't, ah, all right. You know
what? Look at it. Here I go again.

770
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:31,120
I'm allowing myself to get fucking
worked up about this shit. So anyways,

771
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,390
couple more back and forths go.

772
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:37,270
And then she just realizes
that I don't give a fuck.

773
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,900
I said something like, well, you
know what you should do ma'am,

774
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:44,800
is what I always say when somebody just
says that they don't, uh, you know,

775
00:47:44,801 --> 00:47:48,640
enjoy me and they just want
to keep telling me how much
they don't enjoy my act.

776
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,030
What I always say to him, I was like,
well, you know what you should do.

777
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:56,170
You should never come to one of
my shows again. That'll show me.

778
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,940
So then she finally realized is that
I don't give a shit about our humane

779
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:08,530
society fucking credit that she
basically purchased, you know,

780
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,020
it's, you know what a, again,

781
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,710
being a member of the humane society is
less respectful than when they give some

782
00:48:14,711 --> 00:48:16,690
famous person an honorary degree,

783
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,230
because at least the celebrity didn't
fucking pay for it. He didn't go,

784
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,740
didn't go to Syracuse university.org
and give $19 so he could be like,

785
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,610
I have an honorary degree from
fucking Syracuse University, you know?

786
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,990
So anyways, so that's why I say so.
Well, this lady, all right, you know,

787
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:37,330
you know what you should do. You should
never come to one of my shows again.

788
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,130
That'll show me.

789
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,510
And at this point there's kind of some
people around me that are starting to

790
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:43,210
laugh. So then this girl just, you know,

791
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,020
who's a member of the humane society
because she cares so much than just,

792
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:50,950
she just starts going from my juggler.
She goes, yeah, well, you know,

793
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:55,570
smiling and nodding, right. This is creepy
fucking smile. And this whole time too,

794
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,330
she's got a clump of
lipstick on her upper lip.

795
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,830
She's one of these girls you could tell
was hot when she was in her twenties and

796
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,071
now she's doing,

797
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:06,640
the worst thing that you can do is
you're trying to hang onto it, you know,

798
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,140
so she looks like,
you know,

799
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,950
one of the real housewives
of fucking Tupelo,

800
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:15,550
Mississippi or wherever the fuck she's
from. Right. And she's calling, uh,

801
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,880
she's gone out. Yeah, yeah. Well you're
doing great, right? You're doing great.

802
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,120
You're here at the punchline. Hi, you're
doing great. And I'm like, yeah, you know,

803
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,840
shows kind of seem to be selling well,
she goes, now, yeah, it's great. You know?

804
00:49:25,841 --> 00:49:29,650
Yeah, you were on Hbo and
now you're here, you know,

805
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,560
and it's like, lady, so
are you your ear too?

806
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,810
And you fucking paid to come here to
watch me. What is your fucking point?

807
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,990
And she's like, and I didn't
pay, I didn't pay whatever.

808
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:47,280
And then she'd said something to the,
if she started talking really,

809
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,650
then she did that, that, that,
that thing. You know what,

810
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:53,350
how women have confrontations.

811
00:49:53,351 --> 00:49:56,440
Like that was what they do is they
stop talking to you and then they start

812
00:49:56,441 --> 00:50:01,230
talking to their friend really loudly
about you and she starts getting that guy

813
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,860
a fucking piece of shit.

814
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,490
The funny thing was was she couldn't have
been more than five feet away from me.

815
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:13,420
And she's yelling at
[inaudible] pizza is yet,

816
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,750
and then that's when I told
her, you know, lady, you know,

817
00:50:16,751 --> 00:50:18,790
I really didn't want to tell you this,
but you got a big,

818
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,090
he got something on your upper lip
and I didn't want to bring it up,

819
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:25,970
but now you're being a jerk. And
she goes, it's lipstick. I Dunno,

820
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:30,200
I don't even what happened after that,
that point I was actually mad.

821
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,400
And, um, and I dunno,

822
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,360
I kind of blamed the whole evening on a
not drinking if you can fucking believe

823
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:42,670
it, you know, cause I
usually enjoy doing the road.

824
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:47,440
And now this is my third weekend that
I've done where I have not had a drop of

825
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:48,274
alcohol.

826
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:53,370
And now I finally understand why
comedians want to get off the road.

827
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,450
I never realized how many fucking morons
there are out here because I was drunk

828
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,700
and I was part of the problem.
But now, now I'm sober.

829
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,940
I'm like, God, I'm talking about myself.
Like I'm actually a fucking alcoholic.

830
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,850
I'm not. I'm just so fucking
lonely loser. And that's what I do.

831
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:15,850
I have a couple of beers,
talk a little shit.

832
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,460
That's it built denial. That's the
first fucking stage of it, VJ saying,

833
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,260
oh, what a shot. Jesus
Christ from the French.

834
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,990
Oh,
you know what that was from yesterday.

835
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,020
Don't you fucking hate like when you
do that, when you're watching sports,

836
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:36,230
you ever done that in a sports bar?
You looked away for a second.

837
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,890
He didn't realize it was a replay from a
month. Again, somebody hits a home run,

838
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,870
you're like, ah, fuck it. And
you're like the only guy, not dude,

839
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:48,080
that was from my last Tuesday, they were
playing the rangers. They're like, oh,

840
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:49,800
I thought, I thought there
was, I thought that was so,

841
00:51:49,801 --> 00:51:53,240
now you want another case at dia.
Um,

842
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,430
you know what I like about Vj Singh?

843
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,680
Ali's fucking douchebags nowadays a days
they're trying to bring back that rat

844
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:03,890
pack swagger and you can't,
you can't do it all right.

845
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,510
And the only guy,
I dunno why,

846
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:09,230
I dunno why he can't wear shirts
the way they wore shirts back then.

847
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:13,430
You can't wear that fucking little
bing Crosby hat the way they wore it.

848
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,900
I don't know why.

849
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:21,040
I have no fucking idea why frank and why
Dean and Sammy and all those guys look

850
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:26,270
so low, so fucking smooth. I have no
idea why, but I was watching this,

851
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:31,250
uh, golf the other day. I got
to admit fucking Vj Singh,

852
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:35,540
he's got a little swagger to him,
you know, plus he said that, uh,

853
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,450
that hateful shit against women,
you know,

854
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:40,520
which really lines up
with their generation.

855
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,210
Remember that back then once they just
like beating their women with a mop

856
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:48,860
handle every time they didn't have
their raw roast beef and mashed potatoes

857
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:52,640
ready or some shit. I Dunno
what's, so anyways, I've had a uh,

858
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,520
yeah,

859
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,890
I'm trying to figure out why that
lady bug me so much. Last night

860
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,370
I, you know, she was just, I dunno, I,

861
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,560
I felt I was pissed at myself that I got
mad and then I was also mad at myself

862
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:09,280
die stand there like a
fucking idiot selling DVDs.

863
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:12,493
MMM.

864
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,590
You know, I don't know. It really
just made me want to be like,

865
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:18,011
you know what,

866
00:53:18,011 --> 00:53:23,011
why don't I just go to the green room
after shows and I'll do my shows and then,

867
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:28,060
you know, whatever. I'll get
an email and you know, I dunno,

868
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,180
you fucking sit there dance around like
a monkey boy for 50, 50, 55 minutes.

869
00:53:33,181 --> 00:53:35,250
I bet you even did an hour of that show.
I can't remember.

870
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,980
Then they have somebody come up to you,

871
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,740
just talk and say that you're a
piece of shit because of a joke.

872
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,490
And then there are a woman,
so you can't like, you know,

873
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,460
you know it was funny
was she was with a guy.

874
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,160
So the whole thing time
she's given me shit.

875
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,740
It's like I don't want to lose
so I'm giving her shit back.

876
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,980
But at the same time I got to keep my
eye on the dude and also like not go too

877
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:02,830
far because then I got like a
physical confrontation with the dude,

878
00:54:02,831 --> 00:54:04,720
which I don't want to have.
I'm 41 years old.

879
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:10,690
Last time I had a fight 35 that was
when my brother and a red roof inn.

880
00:54:10,691 --> 00:54:12,070
That's an entirely different story.

881
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,890
And that doesn't count either because
your brother's going to stop at some point

882
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:19,750
cause he has to answer to your dad.
You know, I can't fucking remember.

883
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:24,130
Right. I ain't not tough
sky. I tell jokes. Right.

884
00:54:24,131 --> 00:54:25,470
So I don't want to get into this guy.
You know,

885
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:29,620
it was funny the entire time the guy had
his back to me and he was trying to get

886
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,100
the woman out of the club.
Okay.

887
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,840
And that's the exact kind of guy
who goes out with a woman like that.

888
00:54:35,841 --> 00:54:38,540
And vice versa.
If it's a loud mouth Douche bag guy,

889
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,620
they always have a little mousy girl
because nobody who actually would speak

890
00:54:42,621 --> 00:54:47,370
their mind would ever tolerate dating
somebody like that man or a woman.

891
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,670
They will be like, are you out of your
mind? Are you out of your mind right now?

892
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,660
You know, it's a joke. This guy's telling
jokes or whatever. You made your point.

893
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:59,050
Now you're just gonna stand
here screaming. I Dunno.

894
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,520
I Dunno. It was a fucked up
night. Then I had the next show.

895
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,920
I'm onstage and I'm doing my act and
I'm having a great time. And you know,

896
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:14,050
I told the story about the woman I call
direct contact and I felt like I got

897
00:55:14,051 --> 00:55:17,830
that out and everything was going great.
Then all of a sudden this, uh, this, this,

898
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:23,130
uh, this lady just walks up to the
stage. I'm in the middle of my acts.

899
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:27,670
She's like, can you, can you, can you say
happy birthday? And my friend had there,

900
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:32,861
it was like,
lady,

901
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:37,480
could you act like maybe I'm fucking in
the middle of doing a show at some point.

902
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:42,430
I know it was just, it was a fuck. It
was a weird, it was just a weird night.

903
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:46,420
And then after that, then I went
over to the club to 90 next door.

904
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,200
Um, as I always end up
doing, and this time,

905
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:54,670
this is the first time I went in there
and I wasn't drinking and I realized how

906
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:58,330
fucked up that place was. It was
just, dude came up to me, right.

907
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:02,080
And this whole week I've really been
having a difficult time understanding some

908
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:05,020
of these, uh, who, people
who live outside of Atlanta,

909
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,900
they're fucking accents this,
uh,

910
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,940
I'm standing there talking to a couple
of people from the club and this guy just

911
00:56:12,941 --> 00:56:14,620
comes up to me. He's like, we'll,

912
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,470
yeah.

913
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:20,490
I'm like, what? He's like, will
he sticking his hand down? And um,

914
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,100
I thought he was saying like, will you
like, he was starting to sentence like,

915
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:27,460
will you stop standing there?
Will you buy me a drink?

916
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:30,100
I know what the fuck he was going to.
Evidently he was saying his name,

917
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:35,980
he was introducing himself, his
name was William, but he's got will,

918
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:43,300
will, and I was like, what? I don't,
but this is one of those bars.

919
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:47,050
Everybody's, every other person seemed
like they were on fucking coke. And uh,

920
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,280
I don't know. This is just
Peter and out. I don't know.

921
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:53,223
I'm just fucking,

922
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,950
I've had enough and I usually do Thursday
through Saturday and something fucked

923
00:56:56,951 --> 00:57:00,070
up happening this weekend when I'm
doing Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

924
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,130
And somebody asked me this
question last week, like, uh,

925
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,790
asked me if Sunday was a
depressing day on the road. Um,

926
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,060
I don't know if you listen to my past
podcasts, I think I answered that.

927
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,020
Yes it is. Sunday is the
fucking worst. You know,

928
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,430
two shows Friday,

929
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:20,431
three shows Saturday in know the big peak
and you want to fucking leave and then

930
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:25,150
you got to hang around the entire fucking
day to do one more 50 minutes set.

931
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,170
And then you've got a fly in on Monday,
which is the fucking worst. You know,

932
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,520
I like flying on Sundays, you
know, flying across the country,

933
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:37,720
everybody's still asleep.
They go into church, you know,

934
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,190
they're waking up from a hangover
finishing that last slice of dominoes.

935
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,350
I don't know what they're doing,
but they're not on the road driving.

936
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:48,160
So when I land at the airport,
I just grabbed my shit at,

937
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:52,150
jump in a cab and I'm fucking
back at my place. You know,

938
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,700
you fly back on a Monday, the ups trucks,
the Fedex guys are out there, right?

939
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,200
Fucking homeless people laying in the
streets. It's just fucking horrific.

940
00:58:02,201 --> 00:58:05,800
So anyways,
I had such a great week too.

941
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,120
I had a great week. You know, one
of the people listens to my podcast,

942
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,340
works over at Cap,
the capitol records place,

943
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,660
and they invited me over there to go
on a tour, which I did this past week.

944
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:18,360
And I got to tell you was it is the,

945
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:23,370
was the the greatest tour of
anything I've ever taken ever.

946
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,720
Do you remember if Geraldo Rivera,

947
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:29,380
when he did al Capone's vault and
everybody thought it was going to be the

948
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,950
greatest fucking thing ever. I remember
how great you thought it was going to be.

949
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:35,500
Like what the fuck is
going to be in that safe?

950
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,140
And you're like there's no
way this is going to suck.

951
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,210
And it just didn't live up to it.

952
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,420
Whatever your expectations of that
where this was 20 times that it was

953
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:49,330
unbelievable. The guy
basically explained it. Uh,

954
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,540
and I'm saying the guy,
cause I don't use people's names on this,

955
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,230
he was basically explaining that the
capital records building is basically a

956
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:57,640
functioning museum,

957
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:03,430
meaning that there's a bunch of shit that
they're still using that really should

958
00:59:03,431 --> 00:59:05,890
be in a museum.

959
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:12,010
I walked into the room where Frank
Sinatra sang all those songs.

960
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,310
Luck be a lady, Dean Martin, all them,

961
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,720
they had nat king Cole's piano and they
had this little metal chair like yeah

962
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:22,070
that's Frank Sinatra's
chair and I'm looking

963
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,830
at it and I'm like that's not fucking
Frank Sinatra's chair that looks like it

964
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:26,330
should be in an ips class.

965
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,010
That was like one of those science room
classes and later on in the tour he was

966
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,440
showing all these black and white photos.
Cause I guess back in the day,

967
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:36,620
the capitol records label had their own
photographer and they took all these

968
00:59:36,621 --> 00:59:38,480
fucking pictures.
And by the way,

969
00:59:38,481 --> 00:59:41,660
frank and dean never
looked bad at any moment.

970
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,690
They want a picture of Dean Martin eating
a bowl of soup and he looked like a

971
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:46,790
fucking million bucks.
But anyways,

972
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:50,090
then you look at the photos
and there's that fucking chair.

973
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,400
They had a microphone over
there that said Frank. Oh yeah,

974
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:56,930
that's Frank Sinatra's microphone.

975
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,440
And then they just use it.
You know,

976
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:07,260
I gotta just fight.
Absolutely fucking blew me everything.

977
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,760
And I can't even like they had like
the masters of like a, the band,

978
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,800
you know that group.
Like they just had them laying,

979
01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:16,770
not like laying in the corner. They were
going to be doing something with them.

980
01:00:16,771 --> 01:00:19,830
And then I fuckin actually got to hold
it in my hand. A master. It was, it was,

981
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:21,990
I don't know if you're a music geek,
that is the,

982
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:27,150
that it was the place to go. And not
to mention later on that afternoon,

983
01:00:27,151 --> 01:00:29,130
one of my favorite drummers of all time,

984
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:33,720
Steve Jordan was recording with,
uh,

985
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:35,220
some huge artists.

986
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,673
Okay.

987
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,250
And they actually,
you know what sucked was,

988
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:41,310
they had already recorded his drum shit.
So he was going to be doing, I get some,

989
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:46,020
some percussion shit and all I
wanted to see was his kit set up in,

990
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:48,330
in the, uh, in the studio.
That's all I wanted to see.

991
01:00:48,331 --> 01:00:51,300
But I fucking missed it by a day.
But other than than that,

992
01:00:51,301 --> 01:00:53,730
then I got to go on top of the building,
you know,

993
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:59,220
like I was fucking dice clay and
Ford Fairline unbelievable view.

994
01:00:59,221 --> 01:01:03,490
It was, it was the greatest fucking
thing I've ever done. Um, and I know it.

995
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:07,830
And if I was more articulate, I could
explain how awesome it was. So, uh,

996
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:11,430
I want to thank everyone over at capitol
records for being so fucking cool.

997
01:01:11,431 --> 01:01:15,450
That was the greatest tour of
anything I've ever taken. And, uh,

998
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,660
do you ever want to come to one of
my shows? If you bring 40 friends,

999
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:23,220
I will still hook you up. That's how
great that tour was. So there we go.

1000
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,530
Look at me. I'm bringing it
around to something positive.

1001
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:31,100
Half the fucking Twat from the
humane society. Oh wait a minute.

1002
01:01:31,101 --> 01:01:34,940
I can donate by phone.
You want to hear me do this?

1003
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:40,510
Let's see how easy it is to fucking
join the humane society of America.

1004
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,820
You think they answer on Sunday?
Do they make their people work on Sunday?

1005
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,440
That's not very humane.
Is it? Three, nine,

1006
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:55,970
three nine. Alright, let's
see if we can do this.

1007
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:56,871
Oh wait,

1008
01:01:56,871 --> 01:01:59,540
I'm gonna have to give my credit card
number over and you guys can hear this

1009
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:09,190
wedding. Oh wait, they're saying the
number has been changed or disconnected.

1010
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,020
Oh fuck you. Computer woman.
I'm joining the humane society.

1011
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:19,950
I cannot fucking wait for the next dog
lover to come up to taking that joke.

1012
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:23,250
Seriously. I'm a member of
the humane society. So Am I.

1013
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:25,800
I have your credit too,
ma'am.

1014
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:30,390
And I got it in the time that it
takes to write a check. So stand down.

1015
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:31,980
All right.

1016
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,820
And why don't you blot your fucking
lips before you walk out of the fucking

1017
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:40,620
house? I'm good. Phil Mickelson.

1018
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,730
[inaudible] got love about Phil Mickelson.
That guy always goes for the pin.

1019
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:48,270
You have an order set shit.
He just doesn't give a fuck.

1020
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,990
And then he for Putts, the guys
aren't into. And then e four plots.

1021
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:55,980
I don't know. So anyways, let me,

1022
01:02:55,981 --> 01:03:00,360
let's get to the podcast questions
this week by phone is vibrating.

1023
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:01,770
Um, you know, it's weird.

1024
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,160
I have not drank and so long and I still
feel hung over cause I stayed up till

1025
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:08,940
four in the morning last night. I couldn't
go to sleep. I was so fucking pissed.

1026
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:13,470
All right, here we go. Let's get to some
of the stuff. Okay. A youtube videos.

1027
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:17,580
If you would like a laugh this week for
some reason, I only have one of them.

1028
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,080
I don't know why. I know I got
more, I don't know. I get busy.

1029
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:26,770
I fly around sometimes I fuck up. This
is actually a cool video watch. Ah, it's,

1030
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:31,770
it's snuff box boyfriends scenes,
s n u f,

1031
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:35,910
F snuffbox boyfriends scenes.
And uh,

1032
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,730
I think you'll enjoy that.
I got a couple of other ones,

1033
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:42,240
but people will kind of send me stuff
that I just feel like they're just classic

1034
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,180
, um, youtube videos. Like who
hasn't seen that woman who you know,

1035
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,950
who she stomps the grapes,
you know,

1036
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:53,610
she's having that competition and then
she falls out of the thing and then she,

1037
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:58,150
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

1038
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,300
You know, cause you've got
the wind knocked out of her.

1039
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,390
And I know that sounds like I'm
doing a fucked up impression,

1040
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,920
but that's exactly what she sounds like.
And if you don't believe me a let's,

1041
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:10,470
let's fucking bring up that
video right now. Shall We?

1042
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,800
Let's see a stomp stomping grapes.

1043
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:22,380
Let's see if that'll work. Did that
just fucking work? Of course it didn't.

1044
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:28,340
I really don't like typing
with one hand stomping grapes.

1045
01:04:30,091 --> 01:04:31,200
And I'm telling you it's literally,
yeah.

1046
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,450
Oh, oh, oh

1047
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:38,680
here we go. Here we go.
Listen how she does it.

1048
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:43,550
Oh, that's done is right here.
These buckets are filled with grace.

1049
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:47,850
Jess, fall off the fucking
thing. Shut up. Shut up.

1050
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,113
All right,
here they go.

1051
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,940
It's like a tight, here we
go. So what's The dip? Sorry,

1052
01:04:55,941 --> 01:05:00,410
I'm trying to fast forward to this.
Shut up.

1053
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,540
Why can't you fast forward these videos
better and now it won't fucking play.

1054
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,410
God dammit.

1055
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:13,540
You know what am I gonna have to
start this podcast over again?

1056
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:16,000
This is so fucking horrific.
Go play.

1057
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,640
Here we go. There we
go. Uh, you know what?

1058
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:26,270
Go Fuck yourself a plate later on.
Why the damn thing's to load up.

1059
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:28,520
All right.
You don't,

1060
01:05:28,521 --> 01:05:31,040
I feel like right now I feel like one of
those news guys who I just threw it to

1061
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:34,700
the field and then the story's not there
and I got to stand there smiling and

1062
01:05:34,701 --> 01:05:39,270
I'm like, oh, okay. Now there's nothing
on the teleprompter for me to read,

1063
01:05:39,271 --> 01:05:43,320
so I feel like a fucking moron. All
right, let's go to ask bill. Hey Bill,

1064
01:05:43,321 --> 01:05:45,900
I want to be a standup.
My friends say that I am funny.

1065
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,730
I wrote down about five minutes of Shit.

1066
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,880
I thought it was funny and I did a
little stand up back to my brother.

1067
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,410
He laughed and said it was great.

1068
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:56,160
I have dangerously low
self esteem in myself.

1069
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,470
And the fact,
uh,

1070
01:05:58,471 --> 01:06:03,000
that I don't usually like to laugh at
myself when I'm writing jokes by myself.

1071
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,960
I usually laugh at a joke I tell when
I say in front of people and I realized

1072
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:08,070
how crazy it sounded.

1073
01:06:08,310 --> 01:06:11,280
I live in a small town so there's
not really any standup clubs.

1074
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:14,850
There is a place called the coffee
connection, which has an open Mike.

1075
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:18,120
There I am a little nervous to go because
I don't want to bomb and completely

1076
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,970
destroyed my confidence.
I have to actually become a comedian.

1077
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:23,160
I'm not afraid to talk in front of people.

1078
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:26,610
I just don't want to fuck up in
front of other people. But um,

1079
01:06:26,611 --> 01:06:30,270
here is where a bigger problem
comes in at my high school.

1080
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,270
They have a talent show around
the end of the school year.

1081
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:37,290
If I got up there and did shit
and didn't make anybody laugh,

1082
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,010
everyone that didn't know me at the
school would think I'm some dusty cunt.

1083
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,790
That just was up there for
the attention. I think. Uh,

1084
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:48,360
I would just use the classic,
I was just fucking around.

1085
01:06:48,361 --> 01:06:51,660
I wasn't even serious line,
but inside I would still feel like shit.

1086
01:06:51,661 --> 01:06:56,310
Do you have any advice that could
help me? Yes, I do. All right.

1087
01:06:56,311 --> 01:06:59,820
First of all, having low self esteem
and can sort of hating yourself.

1088
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:04,680
You have the foundation for
becoming a comedian. Um,

1089
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,600
you got to give yourself permission
to suck and you got to give yourself

1090
01:07:09,601 --> 01:07:11,460
permission to grow in the beginning,

1091
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:16,410
which means you have to go out and you
have to perform in front of people that

1092
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:19,860
you don't know. The last fucking
thing that you want to do,

1093
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:25,640
not knowing how to do stand up would be
to go on in front of your entire high

1094
01:07:25,641 --> 01:07:26,630
school.
I mean,

1095
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:28,233
okay,

1096
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,630
that, you know what maybe at
that takes that right there.

1097
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:34,280
The fact that you're even
considering doing that,

1098
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:39,320
you have way more balls than
I ever had at your age. Okay?

1099
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,790
So you're already fucking ahead of me.

1100
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,880
And not to mention that you're still in
high school and you're already starting

1101
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:47,150
it. So I didn't start doing stand
up till I was 23, almost 24.

1102
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:48,980
So you're way ahead of the game.

1103
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:54,490
There's no fucking reason to put yourself
into that situation unless you feel

1104
01:07:54,921 --> 01:07:58,520
confident. You know, if you
feel confident, you feel
like you're going to destroy,

1105
01:07:58,521 --> 01:08:02,270
who knows? You might bang one of them
fucking cheerleaders there. But, uh,

1106
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,940
but then that would probably boost
yourself confidence. It'd be like, well,

1107
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:08,330
maybe I'm not a Douche and then you just
get some regular job and you'd never

1108
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:10,790
get into show business.
Um,

1109
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:15,530
but I digress now you've gotta give
you gotta Oh, um, you know, something.

1110
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,040
I did stand up and for the first year I
didn't tell and none of my friends even

1111
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:19,940
knew I was doing it.

1112
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,780
I think one of them knew and
nobody saw me for the first year.

1113
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,420
I wouldn't let anybody cut my,

1114
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:28,700
my family knew that I was doing it and
I would not let any of them come out to

1115
01:08:28,701 --> 01:08:31,430
see me do it. And, um,

1116
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,670
I didn't let my parents first saw me.

1117
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:39,671
I started in March of 1992 and my parents
first came out to see me in March of

1118
01:08:40,401 --> 01:08:44,570
1993 and I've always been
blown away by comedians.

1119
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:46,993
Um,

1120
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:51,650
they'll go there first time ever on
stage and they invite everyone from their

1121
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:56,651
office to come down to the place where
they work to watch them do stand up.

1122
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:58,730
And I'm just like,
dude,

1123
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,780
do you realize what it's going to be like
if you fucking bomb and you have to go

1124
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:07,430
to work the next day? I mean,
why would you set yourself up?

1125
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:12,200
I mean it's just, I dunno. So what
I would do, my advice to you is,

1126
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,250
is first of all,

1127
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:16,910
don't worry about having a low confidence
or low self esteem or whatever the

1128
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:18,540
hell it is. You don't have
to worry about that. You'll,

1129
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:23,330
your confidence will build as you do it.
But what you have to do is just,

1130
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:27,110
you just go out and go do open mikes.
You'll,

1131
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,040
you'll get in the click
of other open makers,

1132
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:33,350
you'll make some friends and then you
become like this little platoon, you know,

1133
01:09:33,351 --> 01:09:36,650
and it's like you against the world.
Okay.

1134
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:39,320
And everybody's going to bomb all every,

1135
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:41,870
all your Oprah micro friends are
gonna bomb. You're going to bomb.

1136
01:09:41,871 --> 01:09:44,180
You're all going to fucking do it.
It sucks.

1137
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:48,380
But it's the best stories you'll ever
tell in your life and later on in your

1138
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:52,010
career, you're gonna look back and tell
some stories. I mean, I'll tell you,

1139
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:52,250
you know,

1140
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,490
it would be a hell of a fucking story is
if you went up in front of your entire

1141
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,440
fucking high school
and you ate your balls.

1142
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:01,310
I mean that's some shit like later
on in your career if you, you know,

1143
01:10:01,311 --> 01:10:06,311
if he was starring in a movie and you
needed a panel story to tell on Letterman

1144
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:10,190
or fucking Conan, I mean that
would be a hell of a one to tell.

1145
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,440
So that's,
I mean I,

1146
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:18,080
it's hard for me to tell you what to
do as far as whether you should do that

1147
01:10:18,081 --> 01:10:21,440
high school show or not. All
I can go is with, with my gut.

1148
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:24,680
The fact I got like
scared reading your email,

1149
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:29,681
thinking of just putting myself in your
position of like just picturing myself

1150
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:36,371
at 1718 if I ever went on in front of
my high school and try to tell jokes,

1151
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:38,360
I mean I probably,

1152
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,320
that would have been a bucket of blood
above me and would have poured down on me

1153
01:10:42,321 --> 01:10:45,770
just like in that movie, Carrie
would have been bad. You know,

1154
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,990
I got to met halfway through that.
I wouldn't, I just thought like,

1155
01:10:47,991 --> 01:10:50,150
what if I killed the,
you know,

1156
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,890
say you're like a junkie. He just
keep fucking chasing it. All right,

1157
01:10:54,891 --> 01:10:57,920
so don't worry about it man.
Just fucking have fun. Go Out,

1158
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:01,490
sign up for some open mics and just do
it in bars where show in football games

1159
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:05,690
and no one's looking at you and
you just learn, get tough that way.

1160
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,660
That's what I would do. You know? And
if you want to do the high school show,

1161
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:12,890
by all means fucking go for it.
Personally, I wouldn't do it, but that,

1162
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,950
but coming from a place of fear,
so you know, if you got the balls,

1163
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:18,420
go ahead and do it.
But if you do it,

1164
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:21,780
I want to hear the results so
please email me back. All right.

1165
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:23,730
But other than that, don't
worry about, you know,

1166
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:27,180
second guessing your material and all
that stuff and thinking stuff sucks.

1167
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,520
That's just a part of it in the beginning.
Okay.

1168
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,190
If you think you're awesome
when you first start out,

1169
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:36,270
you usually end up being a hack,
you know, and you're out there,

1170
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:40,960
you know what's deal with local jerks
and I'm fucking great. All right.

1171
01:11:40,961 --> 01:11:45,580
I hope that helped you out. Okay. All
right. Any, uh, next question, Bill. Um,

1172
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:50,620
I want to ask you about how you felt
about parents taking their kids on planes.

1173
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:54,970
Recently I had a flight to Denver back
from Los Angeles. Not a long flight,

1174
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,960
but I was absolutely exhausted and
looking forward to the two hours of not

1175
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:01,900
talking to people and
hoping to maybe catch a nap.

1176
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:06,550
I had no such luck on young couple with
their two year old Brat set behind me.

1177
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,290
And proceeded to let their kid kick the
back of my seat and screamed repeatedly.

1178
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:16,000
It was awful. I don't blame the kid. Two
year old kids, they, they kick and scream.

1179
01:12:16,001 --> 01:12:16,900
That's what they do.

1180
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:21,640
But the kids' parents did nothing to
control the child other than saying,

1181
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,540
you shouldn't do that. What really
pissed me off was that we were,

1182
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:30,460
when we were landing, they were asking
their child what he wanted for dinner.

1183
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,580
And this is written in capital letters.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1184
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:37,750
Two year olds don't get options.
12 year olds don't get options.

1185
01:12:38,170 --> 01:12:41,410
20 year olds don't get fucking options
if they're living in your house and

1186
01:12:41,411 --> 01:12:44,830
you're paying for everything.
As we were getting off the plane,

1187
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,000
I was hoping these people would have
the decency to apologize for their kid

1188
01:12:49,001 --> 01:12:51,190
kicking the back of my seat.
But of course they didn't.

1189
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:54,490
I've thought about telling these
people that they ought to both get a,

1190
01:12:54,491 --> 01:12:58,570
they ought to both get fixed because
they were absolute assholes and all they

1191
01:12:58,571 --> 01:13:02,050
were doing was raising another absolute
asshole and adding one more to the

1192
01:13:02,051 --> 01:13:04,420
fucking population.
Um,

1193
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:08,890
but I kept my mouth shut because people
like that see nothing wrong with their

1194
01:13:08,891 --> 01:13:12,730
behaviors. So what's the fucking
point anyway? Have you ever,

1195
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,420
have you ever experienced, had an
experienced slice like this? Um,

1196
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:20,890
did you think about saying something? Did
you actually say something? All right.

1197
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,320
Uh, great question. I
gotta be honest with you.

1198
01:13:23,321 --> 01:13:25,650
When I'm on it plane
and a kid starts crying,

1199
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,660
I don't know why I can't explain it,

1200
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:32,340
but it makes me laugh and it makes me
laugh watching other people get fucking

1201
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:35,220
annoyed because, uh, I don't know.

1202
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:38,340
Somewhere along the line I just sorta
let go of that. It's like, look,

1203
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:43,110
these people, they have kids just like
you said, they can't control them. Um,

1204
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,510
and that's it.
But I will tell you this,

1205
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:49,260
if you have a kid and
it's in the fucking thing,

1206
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:52,620
cause it two year old, it's not a
person yet, it's a fucking thing.

1207
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:56,970
The fucking thing is kicking the back
of the seat of the person in front of me

1208
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,120
in front of you. You have to do
something about that. All right?

1209
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,210
They got little short little
fucking legs at that point.

1210
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,180
All you gotta do is just scoot him
back and they won't be able to,

1211
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,090
they won't be able to, to,
to kick the back of the seat.

1212
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:12,880
Now I might be fucking ignorant here cause
never had a little two year old thing.

1213
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:17,890
And I might be over simplifying this
because I really have sympathy for,

1214
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,160
uh, for, for people in that
situation. Man, I don't what,

1215
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,560
what are you supposed to do?
I mean, in a perfect world,

1216
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:26,650
you could just knock the kid out, but
you wouldn't want to do that. It's a kid.

1217
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,720
You can't punch your kid.
I mean you can,

1218
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,530
but then you'd have to talk to somebody
from the fucking humane society. A wow,

1219
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:35,890
I didn't know what the fuck I'm saying.
You know what I mean? Perfect world.

1220
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:38,230
You could just tie him to the seat.
They would move,

1221
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:40,690
but you'd psychologically
damaged with them, um, you know,

1222
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,240
damage the kid and then you've got to
live with them for at least another 16

1223
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:48,070
years before he fucking moves
on to community college. So, um,

1224
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:52,060
have I ever said anything? No, I
have never said anything. I wouldn't,

1225
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:56,700
I would never say something
like, you know, you know,
tick. Do you understand that?

1226
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:58,150
I also like when the planes landing,

1227
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,950
you know like when you ears
a pop and like little kids,

1228
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:02,050
they don't know what to do.
They don't know what to do.

1229
01:15:02,260 --> 01:15:04,060
But I've definitely given some people,

1230
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:08,290
some not even like what the fuck
I give him that look like really?

1231
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,740
You just kind of let the kids sit there.
And this is another thing too,

1232
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,740
if your kid is freaking out,
if you're just making a fucking effort,

1233
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:19,120
even if you can't stop the
kid from freaking the fuck
out, just make an effort.

1234
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,850
This is weird. I'm gradually agreeing
with this person more and more.

1235
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:24,850
Just make a fucking effort.
That's all.

1236
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:28,150
When people are just sitting there
and letting the kid cry. I mean,

1237
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:32,440
I don't know if they're
doing an experiment because
I've heard like if you pick

1238
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:34,600
a baby up every time it
cries and it learns, okay,

1239
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,690
all I have to do is cry and
then I get this comfort. Um,

1240
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:41,200
if you're trying to retrain them, I don't
know if you're going to retrain him.

1241
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:42,070
Could you do it at home?

1242
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:48,430
I think they should sedate kids. There
you go. Yeah, I just said that, you know,

1243
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:49,510
just come in with the fucking,

1244
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:53,740
have one of those fucking world war two
psycho doctors just come in with an old

1245
01:15:53,741 --> 01:15:54,574
fashioned needle.

1246
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:58,930
You just drug them up or maybe they could
have like a fucking a glassed in area.

1247
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:01,930
Do you guys ever have that?
Like the crying Roman church,

1248
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,430
you'd put your kid's way in the back
and they just be behind glass, you know,

1249
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,220
so they wouldn't interrupt the priest
scaring the living shit out of you that

1250
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:10,130
you're going to be going to hell.

1251
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:14,260
Maybe they should have that
down by the luggage. Um,

1252
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:19,780
anyways, uh, so no, I've
never said anything. Yes, I've
wanted to say some things,

1253
01:16:19,781 --> 01:16:22,930
but um, you know, by the end of it,

1254
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:25,870
you know when you're actually going to
say something, the flight's over anyways.

1255
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:31,240
And uh, I had some part of flying,
isn't it? Some kids screaming anyways.

1256
01:16:31,241 --> 01:16:35,950
All right. Um, what am I moving on
to the next part of the podcast?

1257
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:41,470
Oh wait, is this video loaded up yet?
Remember my impression? Oh, oh, oh,

1258
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:44,600
okay.

1259
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,570
Here we go.
Here we go

1260
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:47,713
on a whole day.

1261
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:57,110
Oh Wow. I was up. I was,

1262
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,250
oh,
I can't read.

1263
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:07,860
See, I told you. Oh, oh, oh.

1264
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:09,891
You know what that was,

1265
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,070
that's the first time she ever
got the wind knocked out of her,

1266
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:14,840
so she didn't know what to do. That's
what I sounded like when I was five.

1267
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:16,220
The first time that happened to me,

1268
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:19,700
and the first thing you learned is when
you get the wind knocked out of view,

1269
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:23,780
is to shut the fuck up. Because
every, anyone, if you try to talk,

1270
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:26,510
when you get the wind knocked out of you,
that's what the fuck you sound like.

1271
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:31,290
So you learned afterwards. Once you
get your breath back, you're like, wow,

1272
01:17:31,291 --> 01:17:35,720
I really sounded like a fucking
idiot as I was going. Do you know,

1273
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:39,290
you just fucking,
can anybody explain that phenomenon?

1274
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,860
What is that and why?

1275
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,350
No matter how hard you're
trying to breathe in,

1276
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:50,480
does your breath keep exhaling
or just pushing out? You know,

1277
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,090
it's like when you,
when you, uh, he's like,

1278
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,390
you're having a dry heave but you're not
puking, you know, just for those of you,

1279
01:17:56,391 --> 01:17:59,570
like, you know, I dated a girl one
time, she was like 27 years old.

1280
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:02,570
She'd never had the wind knocked
out of her in her life. Um,

1281
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:06,280
which I thought was one of the most
adorable things I'd ever heard. Yeah.

1282
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:10,610
It was like she was living under glass
or something. But anyways, uh, why is,

1283
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,900
you know, do you, how many fucking
times that happen to me as a kid?

1284
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:17,270
That was like what we did. Me and
my boy, you know, had four brothers.

1285
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:19,430
That's what we did as a kid.
That's, that's what you did.

1286
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,490
And your brother wasn't paying attention.
You didn't have to do it hard.

1287
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:26,150
That was great. You just
give him a fucking rep right
in the stomach and the kid,

1288
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:31,370
fuck this. Ho, um,

1289
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,370
does all the wind literally
go out and why can't you just,

1290
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:39,890
why can't you just breathe in?
Why am I acting like you guys,

1291
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:43,040
a fucking doctors? Why this isn't just
a bunch of truckers. Just forget it.

1292
01:18:43,190 --> 01:18:44,720
Don't even, you know what,
I want somebody to attempt,

1293
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:48,140
you know what half the people who are
going to fucking answer this question.

1294
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,870
I'm going to do exactly what I'm going
to do at the end of this fucking podcast,

1295
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:54,290
which is just look it up and then give
me the Wikipedia reason. All right,

1296
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:58,820
here we go. Here's some questions
for the week. Um, Bill, um,

1297
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:02,300
on a different not that's
what someone just wrote.

1298
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:04,550
I think they wanted to say
no to on a different not,

1299
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:08,660
I was wondering what did you think
of the song Baba O'reilly by the WHO?

1300
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,810
I recently started listening to rock
music and I thought that this song was

1301
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:15,860
incredible. Is it? Or I am or am I
just some dumb fuck no, you're not.

1302
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:20,030
You're a young kid and you're discovering
the WHO and they are the shit. Um,

1303
01:19:21,260 --> 01:19:26,060
I would get who's next? I would get a
live at Leeds. Start with that. Just,

1304
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:30,650
just surf the Internet. They've got
some great shit. Um, dear bill. Ha.

1305
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:33,900
How much drinking do you
typically do during the week? Um,

1306
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,330
you're out on the road all of the
time working places that serve booze.

1307
01:19:38,331 --> 01:19:42,170
And it seems like it would be tempting
to drink pretty often out of boredom,

1308
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,620
boredom and loneliness. I think
I already, to answer this,

1309
01:19:45,621 --> 01:19:48,470
at least I could see myself doing
that if I were a traveling comedian.

1310
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:52,100
Is it tough to avoid being a
lush? Ah, yeah. It kinda is.

1311
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:56,330
You basically become an alcoholic out of,
uh,

1312
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,030
like proximity, you know, it's just there.
It's one of those deals where, you know,

1313
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:04,790
I don't know, if you weren't a
bar four nights a fucking week,

1314
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,600
I would think the odds of you would,
would go up exponentially. Yes.

1315
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:14,240
I just said that. So, yeah,
it is, it is hard to not, uh,

1316
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:20,160
to not drink. I already answered
this shit, you know, I dunno,

1317
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:24,720
but I gotta tell you it's fucking
boring as hell to be out here. It,

1318
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:27,960
this does not,
drinking is actually put me on edge.

1319
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,910
MMM. I mean, you should.

1320
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:35,340
The way I've lived this
week out here in the road.

1321
01:20:35,490 --> 01:20:37,230
If I live my entire life like this,

1322
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:39,780
I could run for president and
I wouldn't have to hire the,

1323
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:42,900
I wouldn't need any hush money.
Okay.

1324
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,590
I've worked out the first day I went
to the grocery store, I bought food.

1325
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:49,020
I've got a little fridge here.
I've been eating healthy.

1326
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:51,180
I went to the gym every single day.

1327
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:57,960
I even brought my little practice drum
pad thing with me fucking around learning

1328
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:00,530
some rudiments.
I wrote jokes,

1329
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:05,090
e okay. I looked at some internet
porn. All right. Right there. That,

1330
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:09,480
that would fucking lose governatorial
fucking race gubernatorial or whatever the

1331
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:12,850
fuck they say it. But you
know, that's the last thing.

1332
01:21:12,851 --> 01:21:15,610
If I could just cut out
the fucking internet porn,

1333
01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:18,563
mmm.

1334
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:22,880
I would be completely
bored. That's, you know,

1335
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:24,560
I gotta tell you that's
what I am right now.

1336
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:26,870
I am sober right now and
I am not feeling this,

1337
01:21:26,871 --> 01:21:30,320
this unbelievable fucking high of like,
wow,

1338
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:34,970
I can't believe all this shit.
Um, I, I was missing. All
I'm thinking right now is,

1339
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:37,940
I can't believe how fucking
long the day is. You know,

1340
01:21:37,941 --> 01:21:40,550
thank God I stayed up until
four in the morning last night,

1341
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,240
so I didn't wake up until 11,
you know,

1342
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:46,790
but then you end up feeling like a loser
because now it's already fucking one.

1343
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,270
I Dunno. I think I'm done.
Everybody. If I don't drink,

1344
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:52,490
I don't think I can do the road anymore
and I don't think I'm going to be

1345
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:56,090
fucking selling DVDs after
my show. I decided I'm not
fucking doing this anymore.

1346
01:21:56,091 --> 01:22:00,770
I'm going to be stones fucking sober
and just seeing a mirror image of what a

1347
01:22:00,771 --> 01:22:04,520
fucking Moron I've been all these
years. All right. Overrated. Underrated.

1348
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,390
Um, I didn't, I don't know that
I actually got any this week,

1349
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:12,210
so I actually throw in a couple of mine.
I probably got some and I just, Oh,

1350
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:12,681
it's tough.

1351
01:22:12,681 --> 01:22:15,830
During the weeks I traveled to try to
save all these fucking emails between my

1352
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:19,970
blackberry and this, this, uh,
computer here. So a overrated,

1353
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,620
I say expensive jeans. I
remember when, you know,

1354
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:29,050
if you had a pair of Levi's, you were
cool. You were in the club, right?

1355
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:33,190
And what were they? 30, 40 bucks. And
then people, all of a sudden diesel jeans,

1356
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:35,020
that was the first expensive
jeans I remember in this,

1357
01:22:35,021 --> 01:22:38,200
this girl was talking me into buying
them and they were like 180 bucks,

1358
01:22:39,470 --> 01:22:42,880
hundred and 60 bucks. This is, you
know, this is like eight years, seven,

1359
01:22:42,881 --> 01:22:46,050
eight years ago. I remember like, how do
I need $80 for a pair of fucking Jesus?

1360
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:50,080
Ridiculous. I can buy four or five
pairs of Levi's. And she says like, no,

1361
01:22:50,081 --> 01:22:52,600
but you'll see the quality's better.

1362
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:55,780
They last longer and you
know what they don't,

1363
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:01,110
I think they look a little better.
I think nice jeans look better.

1364
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,130
Like at this point then like,
you know there's,

1365
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:08,830
I mean I think we can all agree there's
nothing worse than gap jeans, you know,

1366
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:12,700
and they have like that sort of, not quite
stonewashed look to them, but you know,

1367
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,890
they just look,
you just look broke.

1368
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,580
I notice a lot of white
dudes and like their,

1369
01:23:18,581 --> 01:23:23,560
their 30s and forties will be wearing
those and they'll have like a button down

1370
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:24,970
sort of like,

1371
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,800
I'm going to go see Jimmy Buffet shirt
on and they'll tuck it into that and then

1372
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:34,801
they'll have a pair of dirty white all
white Seinfeld sneakers on and it is just

1373
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:36,401
like,
wow dude,

1374
01:23:36,401 --> 01:23:40,960
you are fucking married
with children because uh,

1375
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:44,980
that is if ever,
if there was the anti pussy,

1376
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:48,040
that is the anti everything that is
just the asexual outfit that you could

1377
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:51,100
possibly be wearing. So I've been one of
these guys who get sucked into buying,

1378
01:23:51,101 --> 01:23:54,670
you know, more of these expensive jeans
and these fucking things they wear out.

1379
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,580
They wear out. Just like,
you know, you don't want to,

1380
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:58,840
you want to make your jeans last,

1381
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,050
you've got to buy like fucking five
pairs and you've got to revolve them.

1382
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,450
That's how you make them less. But
if you're wearing them, you know,

1383
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:09,470
every two to three days, like I
do like a fucking, I'll tell you,

1384
01:24:09,530 --> 01:24:13,120
he knows the most filthiest
motherfuckers out there are musicians.

1385
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:16,020
I can't believe I forgot to
tell this story. Right? Uh,

1386
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,610
last week when I was flying back
from Providence, Rhode Island,

1387
01:24:18,611 --> 01:24:22,870
I decided to upgrade to first class.
I just said, fuck it. You know,

1388
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:27,900
I'll deal with the fucking credit card
bill who was one of those deals where I

1389
01:24:28,291 --> 01:24:32,560
just didn't want to fly and I'm so sick
of fucking flying. And they were like,

1390
01:24:32,561 --> 01:24:36,640
Hey, do you want to upgrade to
first class? And I was like,

1391
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:40,300
of course I do. And they go, well, we're
just going to put our virgin island,

1392
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:44,650
fucking airline Dick in your ass.
And I was like, you know what?

1393
01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:48,310
I don't give a Shit Gad and raped me.
I want to fucking sit in a lazy boy,

1394
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:51,580
the entire fucking ride across
the country. So that's what I do.

1395
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,760
So I'm sitting down and on the plane
comes to skinny dude with his big titted

1396
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:57,940
girlfriend and they're like,

1397
01:24:58,030 --> 01:25:00,910
is there anyway you could switch seats
with that so we could sit together and I

1398
01:25:00,911 --> 01:25:05,200
was like apps or fucking locally,
if I was in coach right now,

1399
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,010
I'll give you a dirty look and get
may give you some sort of bullshit.

1400
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:11,980
I'm superstitious, I'm not changing my
seat. Fuck you and your love affair.

1401
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,630
But I was in first class and now
I'm affable. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1402
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,020
So I walked over and I sat in my seat
and they will fucking sit in there.

1403
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:24,370
The first thing is dirty ass musician
does. He's got these flip flops on, right?

1404
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:27,190
And His fucking toes,
it looks like you know.

1405
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:31,900
Now I know why people wash Jesus's feet.
That's all I can fucking tell you. Okay?

1406
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,350
This fucking guy, he looked like
he looked like a bird of prey.

1407
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,990
That's the only way to describe his
fucking toenails and everything.

1408
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:43,170
And he did the most disgusting fucking
thing I've ever seen a human being do.

1409
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,040
Halfway through the flight.

1410
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:50,041
This mother fucker gets up to
use the bathroom on the airplane.

1411
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,600
And I'm going to say that airport airplane
bathrooms are some of the dirtiest

1412
01:25:55,601 --> 01:25:59,080
fucking bathrooms ever,
just from turbulence alone.

1413
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:02,950
And the fact that it's so fucking cramp,
this dirty motherfucker,

1414
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:08,080
he got up in his bare feet and just
walked into the bathroom and his fucking

1415
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:14,910
bear faith. I couldn't believe it. I,

1416
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:19,820
I was just as does this, no fuck, there's
no fucking way. There is no fucking,

1417
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:23,870
and he just walked right in there.
I mean,

1418
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:28,370
he should've got a tetanus shot when he
came out. I couldn't fucking believe it.

1419
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:33,140
How filthy is that? And you know what
kills me? Women love fucking love.

1420
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,960
Musicians absolutely love him.

1421
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:41,420
CanNot get on their knees quick enough
to jump down into their crab infested

1422
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:45,770
pubes and stick that fucking
read in their mouth. You know,

1423
01:26:46,530 --> 01:26:49,130
could give a fuck,
could give a fuck about comedians.

1424
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,170
What are women doing after
the end of the comedy show?

1425
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,240
They come up and they'd say,

1426
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:55,760
you're a loser for the place
you're fucking working in.

1427
01:26:55,761 --> 01:26:59,630
And then talk about what a piece
of shit you are really loudly,

1428
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:04,400
which brings me to my underrated,
underrated for the week.

1429
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,470
Learning how to play an instrument.

1430
01:27:07,490 --> 01:27:11,030
Unbelievably underrated. You know,
cause if you really stick with it,

1431
01:27:11,031 --> 01:27:13,280
you can get in a band.
And I see even if you suck,

1432
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:17,870
you're going to get some pussy
and a, and if not, it's just,

1433
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:21,770
it's so much better than reading and
it's better than, you know, you read,

1434
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:23,810
what are you doing? You
know, you're getting smarter.

1435
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:27,590
So what are you making the person's
day next to you better you're not,

1436
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:28,880
but you actually learn how to play guitar.

1437
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:32,000
You can play drums or something like
that. I Dunno. I just think it's,

1438
01:27:32,001 --> 01:27:35,480
I think it's a great
fucking thing. Um, you know,

1439
01:27:35,481 --> 01:27:37,310
I'm actually excited because I actually,
you know,

1440
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:41,420
I told you guys I bought this Les Paul
Guitar and by the way, God rest his soul.

1441
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,180
You know, Les Paul died this
weekend. I'm really bummed.

1442
01:27:44,181 --> 01:27:45,680
I never got a chance to see that guy.

1443
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:49,790
That guy was still playing shows
every Monday night in New York City.

1444
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,820
And when I was back in New
York for the month of June,

1445
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:55,490
I actually tried to go see the guy.
And um,

1446
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,140
unfortunately the night I was open
where I could go see him, he was a,

1447
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:03,770
he wasn't performing that night, so I
didn't get a chance to see him. And uh,

1448
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:08,420
I'm really sad about it
because, um, I dunno,

1449
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:12,380
that guy is legendary

1450
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:16,630
and I'm trying to see who I would
put that guy up with. I mean, he,

1451
01:28:16,631 --> 01:28:20,960
he's right up there with, for
me anyways, all the inventors,

1452
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:25,040
I'm so stupid, Jesus Christ. But you're
gonna put them up there with Einstein,

1453
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:27,470
the light bulb because the guy
fucking did something with a guitar.

1454
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,010
You know what I'm going to hit my world
is important. If you guys, if you're not,

1455
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:34,640
if you're not into a, if you don't play
an instrument or anything like that, just,

1456
01:28:34,641 --> 01:28:39,641
just Google images for a Gibson Les
Paul and just look at how beautiful that

1457
01:28:40,970 --> 01:28:43,250
Qataris. It's literally, it's
literally a fucking work of art.

1458
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:48,200
And even if I didn't attempt to play
guitar, I think I would still own one.

1459
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:50,570
Rather than going out
and buying a painting,

1460
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:55,600
I would actually buy a Les Paul because
that's how fucking beautiful they are.

1461
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,810
But anyways,
I'm actually learning how to play guitar.

1462
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,840
And a last week I discovered drop d
tuning and it might've been the greatest

1463
01:29:05,371 --> 01:29:09,810
sound I think I've ever produced
as a human being on that Les Paul.

1464
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:12,480
It's just fucking sounded unbelievable.
And uh,

1465
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:17,400
I can't wait to get back to my
apartment to take out that guitar,

1466
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,660
to not read, to not watch TV and be
informed on what's going on in the world.

1467
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:25,800
So I can continue to sound like a moron
on this podcast so some people can

1468
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:29,220
continue to take me seriously and
tell me how fucking dumb I am,

1469
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:34,440
even though that is my point of view.
What am I talking about? All right,

1470
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:36,570
let's wrap up with this.
Now. You know, we have to do,

1471
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:41,190
we actually have to hype some of my
shit. Okay. And by we, I mean me,

1472
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:44,270
I need to get better at this type of
stuff. All right. And this is what I'm,

1473
01:29:44,271 --> 01:29:48,180
I am going to be hyping for the rest
of the biggest date that I have on the

1474
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:50,490
horizon for me,
believe it or not,

1475
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:55,650
is my Improv Gig in
Ontario, California. Okay.

1476
01:29:57,060 --> 01:30:02,060
I live in Los Angeles and I'm not able
to perform out in the La area because I

1477
01:30:02,221 --> 01:30:06,720
have not shown to the
clubs that I am a draw.

1478
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:10,680
You know, it's a, it's a weird,
I gotta I gotta get on the, the,

1479
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:15,090
the Latino radio stations out
there so I can get, you know,

1480
01:30:15,091 --> 01:30:19,470
a significant portion of the population
to at least kind of know who the hell I

1481
01:30:19,471 --> 01:30:24,120
am. Because, you know, I don't want to
get on a fucking plane every other week.

1482
01:30:24,121 --> 01:30:26,580
I just don't want to do it.
Um,

1483
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:30,060
I just don't want to hear every once
in a while I would like to fucking,

1484
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:32,550
you know,
just be able to get in a car and drive.

1485
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:36,720
Like I did when I lived on the east coast.
I drive down to Philly,

1486
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:40,920
I drive up to Boston,
I take the fucking train down to DC,

1487
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:45,630
you know. So anyways, I have this Gig
at the Improv in Ontario, California.

1488
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:50,430
It's a from September 17th through
the 20th for the love of God.

1489
01:30:50,431 --> 01:30:54,360
Can you and 58 of your closest friends
buy some tickets and come out to that

1490
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:57,980
show? I never beg people to come
out to my chefs. Maybe I do, but I,

1491
01:30:57,981 --> 01:31:01,530
I don't gravel right now.
I'm groveling for the love of God.

1492
01:31:01,531 --> 01:31:06,531
Please show up to that show so I can
somehow just have one weekend during the

1493
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:12,150
year when I don't have to fucking,
you know,

1494
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:18,200
just be sitting there in row
33 Gandy attention please.

1495
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:24,060
This is a very full flight. All of the
overhead spaces going to be used up.

1496
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:28,700
So if you have one of your smaller,
smaller containers,

1497
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:33,450
if you could just put it underneath your
seat and please don't put your jackets

1498
01:31:33,451 --> 01:31:37,380
in the overhead compartments. This is
a very full flight and you know what?

1499
01:31:37,381 --> 01:31:41,910
Everybody fucking blows it off and they're
sticking lunchboxes and for length,

1500
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:46,911
fucking full length fucking
coats as the ladies say in that.

1501
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:53,010
So just once I flying Tang
is four hours in 58 minutes.

1502
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:55,860
Um, I would just, you know,

1503
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:59,440
every once in awhile we'd like to not
have to fucking listen to that so I could

1504
01:31:59,441 --> 01:32:03,940
just perform. And a in California,
so for the love of God,

1505
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,370
could you southern California people,

1506
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,610
I know you got a lot of options for the
love of God. Can you come out to my show?

1507
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,990
Thank you.
All right,

1508
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:13,780
other dates I have in September
I'm going to be in Philadelphia,

1509
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,860
the city of brotherly love.
Do you guys beat the Braves last night?

1510
01:32:17,861 --> 01:32:22,570
I know that shit was going on. And what
do we got here? A helium comedy club.

1511
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:27,571
I'm going to be there from September 10th
through the 12th and I got a big date

1512
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:29,560
coming up in a, the Improv, Addison,

1513
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:34,561
Texas September 24th through the 26th
possibly the 27th because I think I'm

1514
01:32:36,821 --> 01:32:40,720
hanging around on Monday night because
the cowboys got a football game and my

1515
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,960
life is awesome and I'm going to go to
the fucking game and I'm going to look at

1516
01:32:43,961 --> 01:32:45,070
those fucking blonde,

1517
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:49,780
big titted fucking Dallas whores
with their Mary Kay cosmetics.

1518
01:32:50,830 --> 01:32:55,090
You know who likes those broads? Is
that guy from the playboy, the playboy.

1519
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,720
Ya what the fuck's his name?
That Hugh Hefner, you know,

1520
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:04,000
he's really into that Tex Mex. Not text
messed up. Fucking Texarkana, Oklahoma,

1521
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:09,001
that big round pie face fucking
bleach blonde looking girl.

1522
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:12,820
You know,
you know those girls I'm talking about.

1523
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:16,810
Hey you, how are you doing? How
y'all doing those fucking girls.

1524
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:19,990
Do you guys watch that show, that show
when he had those three girlfriends,

1525
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:23,500
I only thought one of them was hot. The
other two were kind of a mess. You know,

1526
01:33:23,501 --> 01:33:25,740
the athletic ones,
she was fucking smoking.

1527
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:29,830
That girl was hot and those other two
girls, I had absolutely no use for them.

1528
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:30,760
You know,

1529
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,360
just cause you dye your hair blonde and
you're in shape doesn't mean you're good

1530
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:36,510
looking. Um, all right.

1531
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:40,000
I know I got a lot of fucking nerve
balding redhead fucking throwing down like

1532
01:33:40,001 --> 01:33:42,160
that. All right, let's, let's
fucking get on with it. All right.

1533
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:46,600
That's the a podcast for this week that
I did on a Sunday and I'll be uploading

1534
01:33:46,601 --> 01:33:50,560
this thing, um, as I always
do right around midnight.

1535
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,590
Just to make sure that I,
I never post them on a Sunday.

1536
01:33:54,210 --> 01:33:55,570
If I posted it on a Sunday,

1537
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:59,080
then it would be a very
special Monday morning podcast.

1538
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:01,120
And this one isn't special.
This was sort of me bitching,

1539
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:04,660
which is sort of the standard. So anyways,
I hope you guys all have a great week.

1540
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:07,180
Once again, thanks to everybody
over at Capitol records.

1541
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:10,330
Let me take a tour of that
building. I had an I, you know,

1542
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:15,780
one of the greatest things I've ever
gotten to do all seriousness and uh,

1543
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:20,830
please come out to my shows. Uh, the next
show I have coming up is in a Stockholm,

1544
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:24,460
Sweden. So if anybody
overseas is listening to this,

1545
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:27,100
if you live in Copenhagen,
Denmark,

1546
01:34:27,101 --> 01:34:31,690
evidently you can get in your car
and drive to fucking sweep now. Huh?

1547
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:34,040
Or least I just discovered you.

1548
01:34:34,041 --> 01:34:36,610
Could you go over that bridge and then
to the island and then into the fucking

1549
01:34:36,611 --> 01:34:39,730
tunnel. So why don't you come on
over and watch me talk. My Shit.

1550
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:44,650
That is all the data's October,
August 29th when I'm doing
it. All right, I'm done.

1551
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,770
Well, you guys have a good
week. All right. Take it easy.

1552
01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:49,050
We have taken to the streets.

1553
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:56,010
We are dancing. No
black. Walt's bad parents

1554
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:15,880
rose to this ladder.

1555
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,920
There's a picture black and white for your

1556
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:22,733
snitcher

1557
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:28,870
sticks and stones app made me smarter.

1558
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:35,610
Squirts that car under my arm. Did I say

1559
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:41,433
no?

1560
01:35:43,570 --> 01:35:45,990
Cause no body is,

1561
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:04,760
we are waiting on a town
camp.

1562
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:08,970
I'm sorry to report.

1563
01:36:13,230 --> 01:36:17,210
We have taken to the streets. Great. John.

1564
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:20,790
We are dancing on black walls.

1565
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:28,973
Oh.

1566
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:43,603

1567
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:35,320
