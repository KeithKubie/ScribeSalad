00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We've learned that the faster the ball is moving to the right,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the farther it goes to the right. That's pretty intuitive. Good. This should be intuitive.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Galileo didn't just measure Î”x though.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He could also measure the time it took these balls to hit the ground.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What he found was truly remarkable.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Give this data, I want you to tell me what's the best relationship between horizontal velocity

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the time the ball spent in the air.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Are they equal, proportional, or totally unrelated?
