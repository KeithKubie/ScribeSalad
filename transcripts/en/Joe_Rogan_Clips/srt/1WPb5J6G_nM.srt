1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
A one 80 88 to one 90 believe it or not.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,680
Like for most people that are listening
to this that's on the light side. Yeah,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,090
no, absolutely. I know it is,

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,610
but the thing is I'm solely and I'm on
80 and I'm walking around below 6% body

5
00:00:13,611 --> 00:00:18,420
fat. You are. Wow. Who Do you use to cut
for weight? For the last couple of fights,

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:20,370
man, I've been working with uh, Clint,

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,680
Clint Wittenberg up at the Pii and
Trifecta. Yeah. And truly a lot.

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,450
Yeah. And Clinton make tremend trifecta
food system try effect essentially,

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:34,830
you know, the meal delivery, meal prep
stuff and they do a phenomenal job.

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,180
Phenomenal.
And Clint,

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,500
the reason I chose to go with him
is I've always did it by myself.

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,580
I like to cook, I cook for
myself. I always, you know,

13
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,850
when all those fights earlier fights
in the UFC, every one of my fights,

14
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,460
I was in charge of my own diet.
I cook for myself.

15
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:55,380
I do this because I've done it so many
years in wrestling, all the wrong way.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,960
I can look at myself,

17
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,450
I can wake up in the morning and look at
myself in the mirror and tell how much

18
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:05,451
I weigh and I'd be right on just because
I'm so used to my body so I know what I

19
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:09,180
can or I can't eat what can hold food
or it can hold water and it's just,

20
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:13,410
it's a discipline thing for me as well.
And so I, so I decided, you know what,

21
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,450
I'm getting higher up now.

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,150
One thing that I don't understand is
that I haven't done the research is,

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,170
is what foods to eat before a certain
practice at certain times to feel me to

24
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:26,070
best to make me help,

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,420
help me feel the best because I'm
getting older and things aren't the same.

26
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,070
They use the way they see me.
I'm 31 and I'm gonna be 32 in May.

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,290
And I'm like, man, I just
don't fit differences.

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,270
Have you noticed a lot of difference?

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,070
Like at 24 I just fucking wake up at
6:00 AM and I can go for a freaking five

30
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:47,870
mile run like that with nothing.
Now I can do that anymore.

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,760
Do you think that his age or
do you think that is miles,

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,360
like all the hard training come into
combination because 31 year in your

33
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:57,730
athletic time? Yeah, it's a combination
of both because in wrestling years I,

34
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:02,250
I gotta be in late forties. He's
wrestling years. Am I late for it? I mean,

35
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,840
back is, are shot my, you
know, my shoulders are shot,

36
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,210
my knee, my knees. Oh my God, my knees.

37
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,690
I've had five knee surgeries and Jesus
Christ. Yeah, I saw you Olympian.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,550
Did you have one recently?
I just had surgery actually.
Um, had surgery on Tuesday.

39
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,910
Oh, that's her. Susan had
a double hernia. Jesus.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,450
Did you fight with a double hernia?
I tore it before.

41
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,050
I like five weeks before
the fight and I'm,

42
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,530
but I don't know if it was completely off.
You had a hernia and a broken foot.

43
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,830
Yeah. Fucking crazy.
The funny thing is, um,

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,780
Ollie makes fun of me about this.

45
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:41,400
My manager is like all fight week.
Like if you saw me,

46
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,730
you would think this guy was like
a Zombie. Like I, I limp around,

47
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,890
I freaking Lidacain patches
on me and I'm in a boot or,

48
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:53,200
or sleeve and all I do all day is I go
do the media around or whatever I need to

49
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:57,510
do training, come back and I'm just in
my room. I had a game ready on me or,

50
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,040
or something on me.

51
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,460
But when I walked through that door
to fight the 19 or nightmare wakes up,

52
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,320
I flipped the switch. And a
lot of people would, would,

53
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,280
if they'd go back and look at
videos of when I walk into the cage,

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,780
I stay separate before the cage.

55
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,781
I press him my prayer for protection and
when I walk in I just freaking don't,

56
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,810
if it's like a flip that switch
prayer that you say every time. Yeah,

57
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,940
the exact same thing. Yeah. What do you
say similar along those lines? I just,

58
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:25,840
I basically just a prayer for protection,

59
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,350
prayer for me to be able to
display the best of my abilities.

60
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,340
It's never, I, cause I'm not selfish.
It's not, I'm not getting in that prayer.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,420
Please let me win. No, it's
please protect me in here.

62
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,830
So I can go back to my family safe and
sound and protect my opponent as well,

63
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,130
and give me the strength to be able
to display the best of my abilities.

64
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,320
And that's it. And once I
freaking walked through that door,

65
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,910
I'm the freaking Nigeria nightmare.
I just feel like a different person.

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,740
I am. I am. And you see it in
my face. Um, I'm good and dandy,

67
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:07,090
but when I walk in and it goes away, I've,
I just, I transform into that person.

68
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:07,451
Yeah.

69
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,780
I think a lot of people would be surprised
at how friendly and easygoing you are

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,250
outside. People can't tell. And that's the
thing now is there's really, I haven't,

71
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,870
I don't, I don't, there's no change in me.

72
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,710
I'm still the same freaking guy since
I haven't done anything since a fire,

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,930
nothing.
People were like asking me,

74
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:27,010
how have you gone on party in this
now with the bell and not have a dish?

75
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,810
He's like, no, my daughter, I bought
it from my daughter, my daughter.

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,030
But I didn't, I didn't do anything.
I just sit on the couch, watch TV,

77
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,800
go back, maybe go to the,
uh, the shop that I like to
take my daughter to get, uh,

78
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,000
get French toast. She loves this one
place. So I take her there, come back.

79
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,580
That's it. Or maybe take
her to a date. Nine.

80
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,960
The only difference is now people are
starting to recognize me more so like I'm

81
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,270
walking out the movies and people will
stop me. Hey, can I get a picture?

82
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:59,200
Can I get a picture? Yeah, of course.
You know, but nothing changed.

83
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm the same freaking guy.
I haven't got a chance to do anything.

84
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:04,570
I had surgery last Tuesday.
I've been in bed for weeks,

85
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,810
so I haven't done anything, but I don't
think anything is going to change.

86
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,130
I'm the same guy. Well, you sound
like you have the perfect attitude.

87
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,880
Like the idea that you're having,

88
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,920
making a prayer to just do your best and
not be hurt and none of your opponent

89
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,790
hurt and protect you and your opponent.
That's, that was a beautiful attitude.

90
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,750
And the fact that the way you're
approaching this, I mean, you're just,

91
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,710
you're just here to compete and
to do your very best, all of you.

92
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,980
You're free of the burden of a lot of
bullshit that some people carry around

93
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:40,930
with them. You know, and I was thinking
about this on the way up as, um, a lot of,

94
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,780
a lot of those fighters, a lot of those
champions, like after a while you,

95
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:48,790
you there,
they feel this certain pressure to,

96
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,710
to be able to do this or that.

97
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,300
And some of the examples that I gave is
there's so much pressure. Edison silver,

98
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,640
I almost felt like he couldn't wait
to those. Yeah. He was just like,

99
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,540
it's like a pressure the way you
just want to put it down. Yeah.

100
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,090
When Bj Penn beat him. Yeah. It was just
so much want to get out is actually on,

101
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:08,060
I feel like you received,

102
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,150
it was so much pressure at Georgetown
peer ran away from the sport because of

103
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,630
that pressure. Yeah. You know, some
people, for me, I don't feel shit.

104
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,570
I was just, I was just thinking,
I was like, I don't care. Like,

105
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,100
look at this fight now that come in to
fight, right? Everyone's already bringing,

106
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,720
making a big deal out of it.
It's another fight for me.

107
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,050
I don't even think of myself as, oh,
you're the champion. I don't care.

108
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,390
I just want to beat this guy up.
