&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.520
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
It is now pleasure

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.520
to introduce our distinguished
authors.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.190
To my right is Victor
Hazan, who is an authority

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.380
on Italian food and wine.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.740
He is a life-long collaborator of
Marcella Hazan, who is the queen

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.140
of Italian cuisine in America.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.410
She unfortunately passed away
in 2013, but her spirit and,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.190
of course her recipes and ideas

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.160
about Italian food
will live forever on.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.750
It was Marcella Hazan, together
with Victor who brought us

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.710
"The Classic Italian Cookbook",
a book that introduced Americans

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.220
to classic Italian cuisine.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.680
Whenever you have a dish
of classic Italian food

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.230
such as spaghetti bolognese or
veal saltimbocca you have Marcella

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.850
and Victor Hazan to thank for their
dedication to educating Americans

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.680
on what real Italian food is and
about using authentic products.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.370
Today he will discuss his

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.270
and Marcella's new book
called, "Ingrediente".

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.320
And to my left is our other
author Alessandro Frassica,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.150
who is the author of
"Veggie Panino".

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.940
Like Victor's book,
"Veggie Panino" focuses

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.470
on the importance of
good ingredients.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.830
As both of these authors
would agree,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.470
all ingredients are
not created equal.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.880
Your finished product
can only be as good

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.200
as the ingredients
that went into it.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.600
By the way we call in American
an Italian sandwich a panini,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.240
but in Italy panini
is actually a plural.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.050
The singular is a panino and, thus,
the books title, "Veggie Panino."

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.510
Please join me in welcoming Victor
Hazan and Alessandro Frassica.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.500
Victor I understand you have a
short film about Marcella Hazan.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.800
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Yes.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.320
It is a short film taken

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.990 position:56%
when Marcella was given the
Lifetime Achievement Award presented

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.280
by the James Beard Foundation.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.580
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Okay.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: And Marcella picked

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.370
up probably every single
award available-

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.670
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Right.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.970
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: In
food in her lifetime.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.160
And if we have a couple
of minutes do you-

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.460
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Yes.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.760
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Think we could.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.060
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Could
we see that please?

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.360
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Yeah,
is that the one.

&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: "Master classes."

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.750
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: I'm sorry.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.050
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
There are two films.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.350
One's called "Master
Classes", is that the one?

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.650
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: It could be.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.950
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: It could be.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.250
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Master.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.550
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
Why don't you start it

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.550
and we'll see if it's
the correct one.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.630
Start the "Master Classes."

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.510
Let's see.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:49.110
[ Silence ]

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.410
Is this the right one?

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.210
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: It looks,
it looks like it, yeah.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.040
[ Music ]

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.340
There is no sound with it?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.370
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Is there sound?

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.330
&gt;&gt; Julia Child always called
her her "Italian Counterpart."

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.360 position:56%
And years back Americans didn't
know about northern Italian cooking.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.650
And this woman Marcella is
instrumental in teaching Americans

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.990
about norther Italian cooking.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.850
And she's such a kick,
let me tell you.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.200
&gt;&gt; We're going to ask why the
world's most accomplished chefs

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.220
to work with her magic on
the most basic kind of meal.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.550
She is the remarkable Marcella
Hazan and welcome to you.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.280
&gt;&gt; And she is known as
Italy's national treasure.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.370
Even our friend, the
great Julia Child,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.440
considers her a mentor
in all things Italian.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.470
For more than 25 years she's
been teaching Americans

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.020
about Italian cooking.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.430 position:56%
You probably didn't know about pesto
until Marcella told you about it.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.150
&gt;&gt; Italian cuisine is a
favorite in this country.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.900
And its popularity is due
in part to Marcella Hazan

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.780
who is a cookbook author and many
times she is called the godmother

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.580
of Italian cooking in America.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.440
And here is the queen of
Italian cooking Marcella Hazan,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.060
who has produced this
book "Essentials

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.820
of Classic Italian Cooking."

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.320
&gt;&gt; Marcella, your first book
was a revelation for me.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.190
It was the first time I saw
in print the kind of food

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.160
that I was raised with,
with my Italian family.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.160 position:56%
But the thing that I think I will
be eternally grateful to you for was

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.300
when I came to study
with you in Bologna

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.860
in the mid 70's you introduced
me to what was to become one

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.820
of the great loves of my life,
the region of Emilia-Romagna.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.610
As you know, it is the main
love of my life professionally.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.850
Of course, my Tuscan family
still doesn't understand this.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.300
Well, Marcella, thank you and thank
you for all you've given all of us.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.520
&gt;&gt; Okay. I was not the
one to make you happy now.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.820
&gt;&gt; A little more, yes.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.290
You're with me now Marcella.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.860
&gt;&gt; You didn't set out to
be a famous cook, right?

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.160
I mean, you're a biochemist.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.460
You have two doctorates.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.760
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.360
&gt;&gt; But I use it.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.660
I'm crazy almost like this.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.960
&gt;&gt; This dish is called.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.260
&gt;&gt; Pesce all'acqua pazza.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.640
&gt;&gt; And in English that
translates to.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.510
&gt;&gt; Fish with crazy water.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.910
&gt;&gt; Fish in crazy water.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Brian, this is a good
example of Italian cooking,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.800
because we have a way
of saying in Italy

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.760
that has the same importance
what you keep out of them

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.710
and what you put into them.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.440
And here actually you put salt
and pepper and lemon, that's it.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.740
&gt;&gt; That's it.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.040
&gt;&gt; Marcella arrived on
the scene like a comet

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.960
and nothing was the same again.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.150
The food that we thought
of as Italian turned

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.970
out to be more American
than Italian.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.560
For many of us, Marcella was
the beginning of the real thing.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.010
La Vera Cucina, "The True Cuisine."

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.490
Thank you Marcella.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.890
When we think of pesto,
we think of you, Marcella.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.190
Thank you.

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.540
And when we think of pork simmering
in milk, a dish so succulent

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.650
that one only has to think
about it to taste it.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.950
We thank you.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.930
And when we think of Vinicia,
the place that you gave

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.080
so many cooking classes to so many
people, we thank you, Marcella.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.030
&gt;&gt; There are so many
different Italian items

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.870
that you introduced to
this country, right.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.170
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.470

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the extra
virgin, balsamic vinegar.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.480
&gt;&gt; Well, unfortunate, because
now they use it for everything.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.360
&gt;&gt; We're drinking it like wine now.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.610

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.660 position:56%
She's uncalculating, unpremeditated.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:32.660
She, she cooks as she breathes,
you know, as she walks.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.690
It has become a reflective
act on her part.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.590
She, she is part to a ingredient,
to its color, to its shape,

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.080
to its freshness or
lack of it, to its bulk.

And out of her [inaudible]
comes, comes a dish.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.560

to herself in this.

This is the second
one, Panino Veggie.

to talk about the food
with or without meat,

It's for me great opportunity
to explain this.

starts from the ingredient.

do what I want to explain.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.700
This is my philosophy.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.970
And here you can see some pictures
of the book, different recipes.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:15.860
Because I think that they, they
get word it's so interesting.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.020
When we think of panino we think
always of salami, prosciutto,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.660
mozzarella, picolino cheese.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:28.340
But this is very important,
but it's very important even

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.270
to explain how there is a
word, a [inaudible] word,

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:37.990
and even the panino can be a way
to taste, to understand this word.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.640
Not only for who is vegetarian,
but even for everybody

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.600
because it's very important

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.200
to understand what there
is behind these words.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.910
In this book my recipes,
but even different recipes

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.030
of friends, famous chef in Italy.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.750
And each of them have done
one recipe for my book

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:14.980
and it's a great honor for
me, for me to have this.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.280
Okay.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.580
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Thank you.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.450
Tell us about a panino and
what makes it different

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.550
from just an ordinary sandwich.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.580
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica:
First thing that when we talk

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.380
about panino we have to
talk about the bread.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:38.130
Because usually when I see,
even in Italy, not only outside,

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.300
we never talk about the bread.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:46.920 position:56%
We always talk about what we put
inside but we forget the first thing

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.930
that for me is the
first important thing.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.500
In the book there is,
I want to talk about,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:04.740
about flour because it's
very, very important

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.520
to say what is or meal
or other things.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.220
I don't want to do too
difficult to explain.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:18.390
But there are some simple things
that is very important to know.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:21.730
And after, if you want
to develop this

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.810
but everything starts from here.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:29.490
This is very, very important
not only for the taste okay,

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:34.690
but even for the healthy,
because we cannot think

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:40.170
when we eat something it's
only for tasting flavor,

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.020
but even to stay well,
to stay better.

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:53.070
Panino is important but even the
way with which you to, to mix,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.450
to combine this ingredients.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:13:01.620
For me a panino is very, very
important harmony, the balance.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:09.080 position:56%
I see that many people that more
things you put the panino is better.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.680
Many people can't,
especially sorry, from USA,

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:18.240
and they tell me put prosciutto,
mozzarella and you have this icons

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.860
and pesto, mozzarella, prosciutto
and they want to put everything,

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:26.440
because they think that more
things they put, this is better.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.520
It's not, no.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.580
Simplicity is the really truth.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:40.690
Simplicity to do this you must have
with quality of the ingredients.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:47.690 position:56%
And how to combining them and always
I look forward to find harmony

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:52.820
and balance when you have to feel,
to taste the different ingredients,

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.890
but they together are
something more.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:04.120
I always say you know one, one
must two, not 1.50, always and then

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.780
to have something is
to became it better.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:14.390
This is the difference for me
from a panino and a sandwich.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.690
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Okay.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:16.990
Thank you.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.290
Victor you have a chapter
in your book

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:21.380
where Marcella writes how I
fell in love with ingredients.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.920
Can you tell us about that?

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.220
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Yeah.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.570
This was Marcella's
introduction to, to her book,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.830
the book that representing
today is called, "Ingrediente",

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.880
which is Italian for ingredients.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.100
And too this was Marcella's
summation,

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.140
the last work of her life,
for her last years into.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:49.350
And too much of the
essence of cooking,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.600
the whole purpose of
cooking is taste.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:15:00.360
And taste depends on getting to
the essence of the ingredient,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.630
the essential quality
of the ingredient.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.170
And as Alessandro was saying
the more ingredients you put

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.590
into something, the more
muddled the taste becomes.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:18.680
And Marcella fell in love in a
sense with the central character

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.160
of the material that
she was working with.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.160
If she was working with artichokes,
you know, she would prepare a dish

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.660 position:56%
and put, the star was the artichoke.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.940
You tasted the artichoke.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.960
There weren't four or five
other things along with it.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:40.810
And to Marcella cooking to taste
not of the person who produced it,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:46.360
but of the material that was on
the plate, as simple as possible.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:51.520
And Marcella became
celebrated for producing recipes

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.290
with only two or three ingredients.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:16:00.770
She has a tomato sauce with only
three ingredients that's become one

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:05.790
of the most widely used
tomato sauces in the world.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.350
And the interesting thing that
I saw, I saw an article in the

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:13.920
"Wall Street Journal",
not too long ago.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:25.280
And it said that industrial food
companies have hit on a new thing.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.630
Food with very few ingredients,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.600
with no more than two
or three ingredients.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.440
And I said, "Well, if only
Marcella were around."

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.170
Really because she would enjoy it.

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.380
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Yeah, she
would set them straight, I'm sure.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.300
Okay. I, there's one place in your
book where you talk about a woman

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:47.170
who talked about pasta and
she said I only used fresh.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.860
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Oh, I
remember the incident very well.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:55.470
And this happened not
infrequently in Marcella's preps.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.070
This was on a book tour and
it was the local food editor

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.290
of a city in the north.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.970
And the first thing she said
after greeting Marcella, said,

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:13.750
Marcella I want you to know that
the only pasta I ever use is

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.050
fresh pasta.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.980
And, of course, she meant pasta
that she made herself at home.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.310 position:56%
And Marcella said, oh you poor girl.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.090
You don't know what you're missing.

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:30.450
Because you know to us, yes,
fresh pasta we are from Romagna.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.790
We spent much of our
life in Bologna.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.160
We loved [inaudible],
tortellini, lasagna,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.750
but there is so much
else that is different.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:48.060
The pasta you buy in the stores,
penne, rigatoni, spaghetti,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:54.770
spaghettini, they have a, a
character or quality they marry

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.640
with sauces in a way
that fresh pasta doesn't.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.960
So, if you eliminate all of
that you're eliminating, like,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:09.300
80% of the flavors that
Italian pastas can deliver.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.600
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Okay.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.690
Alessandro, I was looking at
some of the recipes in your book

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.540
and I couldn't believe some
of things you were using,

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.380
like brussel sprouts
like in a panino.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.520
How do you get your inspiration
for doing things like that?

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.030
In fact, I see that
on your cover there.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:31.170
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: It's
very easy because I said before,

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.550
for me a panino is like
a plate, is a recipe.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:44.910
I learned many things with my
friend's chef that when they come

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:53.550
to find me they told me when
you do one panino do exactly

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.710
like we do when we think a plate.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:02.610
And then the balance like I said
before with the salty, bitter,

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.890
the different flavor, no.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:10.200
And then the inspiration is
when even I go in a restaurant,

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.230
when I go to find a producer,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:21.150
I think with this ingredient what
can be the intelligent combination

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.450
to do this.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.580
And our menu is always
traditionally,

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.760
because the tradition is
a treasure that we have

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.490
that we cannot forget this.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:37.270
But I think that we must
be even contemporary,

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.650
because the world is changing.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.790
Our way of life is changing.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:50.380
For example, in Italy now we use
as before to come back home to it,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.610
we say, with the legs
under the table, you know.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.670
No, no, even we stay out.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.080
We go to eat, but even if
I don't come back home,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.230
if I don't have my wife or
my mother that cook for me,

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:09.320
now this is only what we call
it, we don't do this anymore.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.960
But I have to find
something good, healthy.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:22.080
And even if it is fast the time,
the quickly, and then I have

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:28.720
to think something of good, of
healthy, quick, contemporary.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.300
This is for me the word
of what, what I do.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.730
And then tradition, but to think
what are the, our way of life

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.740
of today and we don't have
to forget the quality,

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.880
the taste and the healthy.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.300
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: You
have a recipe in your book

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:51.360
for what's called a hamburgerino,
but yet it's a vegetarian panino.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.420
What is that?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:21:00.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: It's a, it's
a game because in Italy we use it

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.460
to do a Miranda, is like,
I like to call it Miranda

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.600
because [inaudible] is not
the same things in our mind.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:15.050 position:56%
And Miranda, panino con la frittata,
panino con la frittata put on plate,

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.540
but even when you are a child

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.100
and all your mother gave you
these you know when you go

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.210
for [inaudible] the school, no.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:30.730
Give you panino con la frittata and
[inaudible] and this I have done.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:37.060
This contemporary veggie and
then I have done this game.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:44.330
Use one omelette but to a disc no,
like if it was in a [inaudible]

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:51.890
to put some in this recipe
you put some kale inside.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.540
And there is like an omelette,
the bread, the tomato, the cheese.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:01.350
I use picolino cheese, usually a
sheep cheese that we have Tuscany.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.730
And I add my own ketchup
with a good tomato

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:14.080
and a good red pepper
[inaudible] and some salad in this.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.670
So it is a game like if
it was a really hamburger.

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:28.960 position:56%
And then it's a way to explain, like
even with a joke you can do quality.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.260
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Thank you.

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.640
Victor, your book has all
these various chapters

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.380
about different ingredients
and one, of course,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.650
is on parmigiano-reggiano.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.310
How is that different from that
stuff you buy in the green can?

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:49.750
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Oh, the difference
again is in the raw material.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:56.600
And the raw material that goes into
parmigiano-reggiano is a product

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:03.020
of a specific environment and
of the reaction of milk produced

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.360
by cows to that environment.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.770
Milk is one of the most
sensitive products in the world.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:15.990
When there was the
explosion in Chernobyl

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:22.910
and there was a fall-out all
over Europe and food stuff began

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:29.210
to taken off the market because of
the exposure to possible fall-out.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:35.730 position:56%
The first product in Italy to be
taken off the market was fresh milk.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.650
And I say this to indicate
how sensitive it is

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.930
to the place where it is produced.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:47.700
So the milk for parmigiana-reggiano
is limited

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.470
to a few provinces
in northern Italy.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.550
Part of them in them in
the province of Bologna

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.980
but mostly the provinces
of Parma and Modena.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:06.770
It is also a procedure
that is 800 years old

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:12.740
and hasn't been changed except
for the source of heat that heats

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.040
up the milk in the, in the kettles.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.500
Originally the heat would
have been fire, firewood.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.750
Today the heat is better
controlled; it's gas.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:31.520
But otherwise the milk produce,
is created exactly the same way.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.580
There, part of the milk come
from the evening milk and part

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.730
of milk come from the morning skim.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.410 position:56%
It is cooked in these large kettles.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:51.340 position:56%
Each kettle produces exactly as much
cheese necessary to make two wheels.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:59.400
And then those wheels are subjected
to salting, to brine, to aging.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:05.770
And only after three years may
be called parmigiana-reggiano.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.420
So it's a little bit different
than the stuff you buy in the can.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.200
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's quite different.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.800
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: One
of the things, of course,

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.100
that Marcella wanted to do

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.790
in America is educate
us on Italian cuisine.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.670
How far do you think
we've come in the process?

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.590
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Well,
I think as far as access

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:27.470
to ingredients the
change has been enormous.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.030
Because when Marcella first
started cooking in this country

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:36.760
when we were married and came
over, there was virtually nothing.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:42.690
And through her books, through
the respect and curiosity

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.240
that she aroused in people

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:50.970
about Italian cooking I think we've
come today to virtually everything

00:25:50.970 --> 00:25:54.670
that is available to
Italians in Italy.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.210
Almost everything is
available someplace,

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.270
somewhere in this, in this country.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.540
The only thing I must say

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.940
that is still lacking the
quality of agriculture.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:15.350
In Italy we have vegetables
that have extraordinary flavor.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.650
I find it difficult in America to
get that flavor in the vegetable.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:29.710 position:56%
The vegetables are either overgrown,
overwatered, they may be beautiful

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:34.640
but they don't have that
intensity or flavor,

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.260
that quality that made
Marcella fall in love-

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:38.560
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Right.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.060
&gt;&gt; Victor Hana: With
ingredients in the first place.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: How about you
Alessandro have you tried making any

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.900
of your paninos in the
United States and what kind

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.140
of success have you had with that?

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.440
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: No, no,

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.160
but even here you can
find good ingredients.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:02.590
I think that when I do something
here many immigrants come

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.820
from Italy, okay.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:12.360 position:56%
But if you can find something of
good here for me is even interesting

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.650
to use is what you
can find in the place.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:26.370
Because for me my philosophy is
even what my parents told me,

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.470
when you come back home
you open this [inaudible]

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.420
and you always find
something, always.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:43.900
And if you're creativity and the,
your what you feel to do together,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.910
you always find something.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:52.560
That to say, here in USA if you
want you can do a great quality

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.970
of panino if you want.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.950
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: What about
the bread that we have here?

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.620
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: In USA the
bread are, there are good flour.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.070
I have tasted many
good things and I,

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:11.130
I think that we can do very
good things if we want.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:17.080
The problem is very often
people doesn't want to do.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.750
We see the cost, you know.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.330
It's normal that some
products cost much more.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.960
For example, we talk
parmigiana-reggiano, to do one kilo

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:34.340 position:56%
of parmigiana-reggiano you need 15
liters of milk, one kilo, 15 liters.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.840
Parmigiana-reggiano need, when
you to have 24 months of aged

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.100
and even more, but you need to
have a product that stay 24 months

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.950
in your warehouse it have a cost.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.990
Then what I tell you is
it's okay to see the price.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:57.830
But it's, you have to
one question to yourself,

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.760
more if one thinks cost too less.

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.740
Because you have to do
this kind of why it cost?

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:11.350
So it's so cheap, not only
when it is so expensive,

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:17.220
because this is the question
that is important to do ourself.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.860

here in this country?

questions form the audience?

Please go up to the

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:49.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Carlotta and
I have the privilege of being

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.740
from the same hometown of Marcella

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.400
that is Cesenatico on
the Adriatic Coast.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:01.960
So as such I love Italian
food and food from Romagna.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.350
So I have a question for Victor.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:10.260
I have tried multiple times to make
pidadina, but I'm not quite able

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:11.720

I can make in Italy.

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.310
So I'm really, really curious

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:21.120
to know whether Marcella was
really able to make piadina

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.500
and whether it was the same
that she would in Cesenatico.

&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Piadina.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.000
She's asking if you could make,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.580
if Marcella made piadina
here in the US?

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.610
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Marcella
made piadina.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:41.540
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Maybe we
should tell people what that is.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:45.050
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Piadina
is a, is a flat bread.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:54.010
It's an unleavened bread and
in Romagna it's flattened out

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.930
and it used to be cooked
on an earthenware.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:02.100
We called it a testo,
an earthenware disc

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.590
that was put directly over fire.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.600
And it was slightly charred.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.870
It came off the testo and it
was slightly charred, very thin.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:20.790 position:56%
And we would either eat with a
little bit of, cut into, into wedges

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.300
and make panini out of it.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.480
There was prosciutto, mozzarella,
but other panini we made was

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:37.950
with grains, wild grains a
little bit that were wild grains

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.090
that were sauteed with
garlic and olive oil.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:45.400
You'd put it on the piadina
and that made it wonderful,

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.660
a wonderful panino.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.330
I, Marcella made piadina at home.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:32:00.460
I must, however, that in our many
returns to Cesenatico the quality

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.380
of the piadina there
has sadly declined.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:09.700
It's no longer rolled out
with a rolling pin by hand,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.670
but it is rolled out
through big steel rollers.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:21.020
It is cooked on a steel griddle
and somehow the composition

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:27.900
of it doesn't have that flavor and
that, that crackly texture it used

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.470
to have and that Marcella
could get at home.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:49.840
that fennel grows like
wild, like weeds everywhere.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.180
But when you want to get fennel
to put in your ingredients to put

00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:01.780
in your dishes here in the US
it's like out of sight cost wise.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.430
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: And the
question is, I'm sorry.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:12.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, for Victor is what he feels
about fennel as an ingredient.

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.500
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: What
do you think about fennel

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.570
as an ingredient in
the United States?

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:25.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: Well, as a
vegetable it's perfectly acceptable.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.460
We can get very good
fennel [inaudible].

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:32.950
Marcella talks about it in
the book, "Ingrediente."

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.640
But if you're talking about fennel,

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:44.110
wild fennel [inaudible]
there are very many varieties

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.670
of wild fennel available in Italy.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:50.930 position:56%
But they're also available here,
except they don't come to the market

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.030
and in Italy you can go
to the produce market

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:59.320
and there may be an old lady with
just a few things in the store.

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:04.790
But she will have some
wild, some wild arugula

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:10.800
and maybe some wild fennel and
that has a different purpose.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.470
That has, that is for flavoring.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:18.270
Fennel the kind you buy in
the market here is a vegetable

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:23.510
that you can eat either
raw, or fried, or braised,

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.400
or baked, and it's excellent.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.700
It's a wonderful vegetable.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.340
&gt;&gt; Do you use fennel
in any of your panino?

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.790
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: There
is on recipe there is fennel,

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:42.150
because there is a typical Sicilian
recipe, the orange with fennel, no.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:47.010
And then I have done one panino
using what I said before,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.420
the tradition but contemporary.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.720
&gt;&gt; I get it.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.740
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: And
then fennel is a nice ingredient

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:59.150
and fennel seeds is, are inside one

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.070
of the most famous
[inaudible] salami

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:07.140
that we have is fennel
[inaudible] like a salami,

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.100
but inside there are fennel seeds.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:15.770
And this flavor is
very, very interesting.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.190
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: May I
add something to that,

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:20.860
because Alessandro reminded me.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:26.500
One of the things that we find very
peculiar is that Italian sausages

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:29.840
in this country by default,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.460
Italian sausage contains
fennel seeds in America.

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:40.990
And Italy we have places that
have sausages with seeds.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:47.750
But you go to Venice or Bologna or
Piedmont or anywhere in the north

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:54.180
of Italy and you have these
marvelous sausages, wonderful pork.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.250
There is no fennel in them.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:40:01.250
They all they taste of is
meat and it's very peculiar.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:08.680 position:56%
Have you ever found a simple Italian
pork sausage in the United States

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:12.470
that did not contain fennel seeds?

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.780
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: No.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.950
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: It's frustrating.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.250
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica:
So the problem is

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:22.850
that when I can you say another
country I see some recipe

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.200
ingredients that we
don't use in Italy.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.700
I say if I have to say one
recommendation, the first thing is

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:41.310 position:56%
to look for the authenticity because
many, many things that are here,

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:47.930
many restaurants, many places sell,
like, Italian and not Italian,

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:54.780
but we don't eat this
[inaudible] and then it's better

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:58.500
to know less things,
but true things.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.660
This is what I recommend.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:05.220
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Who else
would like to ask a question?

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.190
&gt;&gt; I wanted to thank Victor
for all of the cookbooks

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.490
that you and your wife did.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.390
They were very welcomed
by me and my family.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.690
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
She said thank you

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:15.990
for all the books you've written.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.670
&gt;&gt; And I have enjoyed
your son's books

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.450
as well, Juliana, his cook books.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.670
And Alessandro, I personally
prefer pecorino too and I wondered

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.040
if you could discuss
your preference for that.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.340
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica:
The question.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.640
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Do you have
a preference for pecorino?

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.680
&gt;&gt; Well, you, he said
that he did over-

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Not that you did.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:41.260
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: I
come from Florence, Tuscany.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.950
And the cheeses that in Tuscany
you produce are always sheep cheese

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:52.670
because the tradition is that
many a story from [inaudible] came

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:59.640
to Tuscany and the, we have sheep.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:06.080
It's difficult to find
cow, goat cheese.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.900
And pecorino is a simple one.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:14.710
I like so much the fresh one,
the marzolino, for example.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:19.490
But even if it's a
little bit more aged,

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.220
because in this word
there is a world.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:26.460
Sorry, for the mistake on words.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.860
And yes, I love pecolino
cheese, yes.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.580
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Thank you.

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:36.180
I'm really enjoying this.

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.540 position:56%
I had a question because my
relatives are from the southern part

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.920
of Italy and they use some
spinach and things like that.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:47.300
Is that common up north to put
that kind of ingredient into a meal

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:53.270 position:56%
and they combine, like, spinach with
raisins in a dish that I know of.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:54.900
So I'm just curious.

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.840
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Do you
know of any Italian dishes

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.690
that combine raisins with spinach?

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.380
She's from the southern, her
family's from the southern part

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.910
of Italy and that's
something they do down there.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.210
So you know of that?

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.430
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: The kind of
dishes that combine spinach.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:09.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.030
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: With raisins.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.330
&gt;&gt; Victor Hazan: With raisins.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:16.880
Well, not spinach with
raisins, but raisins are used

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:20.140
in the cooking of Venice.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:29.050
And we use raisins and onions
and a dish uses sardines and used

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:33.530
to preserve the sardines.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.980
It was made originally
for those Venetians

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.900
who were traveling
very far away on boats

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.630
and they would take local
homemade food with them.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.980
And one of the dishes
was sardines fried

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:56.290
in vinegar and onion and raisins.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:02.030
And they, they lasted
for a very long time.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.360
But raisins with vegetables
I don't know Alessandro.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:13.920
I, if in Tuscany you serve raisins
with vegetables like spinach.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.600
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica:
[inaudible] in Italian.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.300
Okay right understood, yeah.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:26.620
In Sicily there is one
recipe here in one place

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.920
where we use moscato raisin.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:37.970
It's very sweet and usually
a typical combination is the

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.270
scarolla [phonetic].

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.570
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Escargot.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:44.800
&gt;&gt; Alessandro Frassica: It is a
little bit bitter with the raisin

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:50.710
because a little bit sweet and
even anchovies because it's salted.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:54.530
What I said before, no the
different kinds of flavor

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:58.470
but together gave you
harmony and balance.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:03.980
And then I have used in the
book one without anchovies

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.150
because it's veggie, but I
have said this in the recipe

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:13.260
that usually scamorza cheese,
it's cow cheese with scarolla

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:18.310
with the raisin and
anchovies if you want to

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.980
and the veggie version without it.

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.220
It's very interesting.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:31.170
In south Italy we use braising
[inaudible] we say, no.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:34.600
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Sweet and sour.

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.920
Anyone else.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:43.510 position:56%
Well, please thank our guests Victor
Hazan and Alessandro Frassica.
