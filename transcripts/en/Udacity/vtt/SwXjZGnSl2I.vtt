00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Up to this point, we've been using mgh for gravitational potential energy.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But in the previous video, I discussed how this formula is actually more accurate.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But it's strange because these formulas actually looked quite different.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, the distance away from the ground h here is in the numerator.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Whereas in this equation, the distance away from the center of the earth R down here

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is in the numerator and that seems awfully strange.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This one is positive and this one is negative. There are quite a few differences.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The question is, can these values really be similar?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We're going to do a problem where we're going to have to use both these formulas

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we're going to see if we get similar results over small distances.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And then we're going to calculate the percent error by using this equation instead of this one.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Let's imagine that we have a person here who's dropping a 1 kg ball off a 50 m tall building.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now it turns out that this 1 kg mass doesn't actually matter to the final calculation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but we'll just throw it in there just to make our lives easier.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I want you to solve for the kinetic energy of the ball at the bottom of this building

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
using both of these forms of gravitational potential energy.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then once you calculated the final kinetic energy using both of these formulas,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I want you to tell me what's the percent error using mgh instead of this more general formula.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You should put your answer in this box.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And in order to solve this problem, you may need a few of these constants down below.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here's the value of G, here's the radius of the earth in km,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and here's the mass of the earth in kg.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And just as a hint to get you started in the right direction,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
when you're using this formula this R should be the radius of the earth

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
when the ball is at the bottom of the building and should be equal to the radius of the earth

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
plus 50 m when the ball is at the top of the building.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Remember that this formula is from the ball to the center of the earth

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so we have to include the radius of the earth in our calculations.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Also, when you're solving this problem, be sure to use g = 9.8 m/s²

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
rather than 10 m/s² just to make our answer a bit more accurate.

00:01:46.000 --> 99:59:59.000
All right. Good luck finding that percent error.
