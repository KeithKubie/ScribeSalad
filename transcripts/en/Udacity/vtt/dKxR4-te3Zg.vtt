00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.880
Single letter changes in the genome are referred to

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.600
as single nucleotide variations or SNVs. Some of you

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.960
may have heard of SNVs before, but maybe under

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.930
a different name. Single nucleotide polymorphism or SNPs. SNVs and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.470
SNPs are the same thing. But the convention is

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.320
changing, and SNV is a newer abbreviation. It's one we're

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.370
adopting in our course because it's technically more accurate.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.710
But for all intents and purposes, it means the same

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.340
thing as a SNIP, if you've heard of one before. Now,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.060
SNVs or single nucleotide variations, are one of the most common

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.220
forms of mutations in humans, and it represents a lot of

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.020
the variation in the human gene pool. When you have an

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.330
SNV, the effect it can have depends entirely on whether it's

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.540
in the coding region or the non-coding region of your genome.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.670
So I want you to tell me where do you think

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.080
a bigger effect would be had for an SNV? The coding

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.950
region or the non-coding region? Pick one of them

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.863
and then justify your answer in the text box.
