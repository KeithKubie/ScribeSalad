00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.900
Welcome to the presentation
on quadratic inequalities.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.660
Before we get to quadratic
inequalities, let's just start

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.945
graphing some functions and
interpret them and then we'll

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:13.880
slowly move to the
inequalities.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:26.360
Let's say I had f of x is equal
to x squared plus x minus 6.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.210
Well, if we wanted to figure
out where this function

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.070
intersects the x-axis or the
roots of it, we learned in our

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.210
factoring quadratics that we
could just set f of x

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.735
is equal to 0, right?

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:39.460
Because f of x equals 0 when
you're intersecting the x-axis.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.990
So you would say x squared
plus x minus 6 is equal to 0.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.800
And you just factor
this quadratic.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:57.470
x plus 3 times x
minus 2 equals 0.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.270
And you would learn that the
roots of this quadratic

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:11.600
function are x is equal to
minus 3, and x is equal to 2.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.970
How would we visualize this?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.970
Well let's draw this
quadratic function.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.510
Those are my very uneven lines.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.200
So the roots are x is
equal to negative 3.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.180
So this is, right here, x is at
minus 3y0 -- by definition one

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.790
of the roots is where
f of x is equal to 0.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.370
So the y, or the f of
x axis here is 0.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.600
The coordinate is 0.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.130
And this point here
is 2 comma 0.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.360
Once again, this is the x-axis,
and this is the f of x-axis.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.270
We also know that the y
intercept is minus 6.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.800
This isn't the vertex,
this is the y intercept.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.710
And that the graph is going to
look something like this -- not

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.640
as bumpy as what I'm drawing,
which I think you get the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.180
general idea if you've ever
seen a clean parabola.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:16.200
It looks like that with x minus
3 here, and x is 2 here.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.080
Pretty straightforward.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.480
We figured out the roots, we
figured out what it looks like.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.170
Now what if we, instead of
wanting to know where f of x is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.960
equal to 0, which is these two
points, what if we wanted

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.290
to know where f of x
is greater than 0?

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.200
What x values make f
of x greater than 0?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.050
Or another way of saying
it, what values make

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.410
the statement true?

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.740
x squared plus x minus 6
is greater than 0, Right,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.730
this is just f of x.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.470
Well if we look at the graph,
when is f of x greater than 0?

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.010
Well this is the f of x
axis, and when are we

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.910
in positive territory?

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.360
Well f of x is greater than
0 here -- let me draw that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.890
another color -- is greater
than 0 here, right?

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.980
Because it's above the x-axis.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.830
And f of x is greater
than 0 here.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.070
So just visually looking at it,
what x values make this true?

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.580
Well, this is true whenever x
is less than minus 3, right, or

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.440
whenever x is greater than 2.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.560
Because when x is greater than
2, f of x is greater than 0,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.910
and when x is less than
negative 3, f of x

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.430
is greater than 0.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.460
So we would say the solution to
this quadratic inequality, and

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.910
we pretty much solved this
visually, is x is less than

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.970
minus 3, or x is
greater than 2.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.890
And you could test it out.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.990
You could try out the number
minus 4, and you should get f

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.800
of x being greater than 0.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.890
You could try it out here.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.110
Or you could try the number 3
and make sure that this works.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.820
And you can just make sure
that, you could, for example,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.410
try out the number 0 and make
sure that 0 doesn't work,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.790
right, because 0 is
between the two roots.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.030
It actually turns out that
when x is equal to 0, f

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.040
of x is minus 6, which is
definitely less than 0.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.400
So I think this will give you a
visual intuition of what this

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.000
quadratic inequality means.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.510
Now with that visual intuition
in the back of your mind, let's

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.090
do some more problems and maybe
we won't have to go through the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.600
exercise of drawing it, but
maybe I will draw it just to

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.190
make sure that the
point hits home.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.140
Let me give you a slightly
trickier problem.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:49.120
Let's say I had minus x squared
minus 3x plus 28, let me

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.190
say, is greater than 0.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.600
Well I want to get rid of
this negative sign in

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.350
front of the x squared.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.420
I just don't like it there
because it makes it look

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.080
more confusing to factor.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.140
I'm going to multiply
everything by negative 1.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.780
Both sides.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:08.210
I get x squared plus 3x minus
28, and when you multiply or

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.160
divide by a negative, with any
inequality you have

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.440
to swap the sign.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.860
So this is now going
to be less than 0.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:25.130
And if we were to factor this,
we get x plus 7 times x

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.880
minus 4 is less than 0.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.460
So if this was equal to 0, we
would know that the two roots

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.400
of this function -- let's
define the function f of x --

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.540
let's define the function as f
of x is equal to -- well we can

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.670
define it as this or this
because they're the same thing.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.080
But for simplicity let's define
it as x plus 7 times x minus 4.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.390
That's f of x, right?

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.260
Well, after factoring it, we
know that the roots of this,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:05.600
the roots are x is equal to
minus 7, and x is equal to 4.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.900
Now what we want to know
is what x values make

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.000
this inequality true?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.060
If this was any
equality we'd be done.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.650
But we want to know what
makes this inequality true.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.600
I'll give you a little bit of a
trick, it's always going to be

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.160
the numbers in between the
two roots or outside

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.120
of the two roots.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.810
So what I do whenever I'm doing
this on a test or something, I

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.510
just test numbers that are
either between the roots or

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.610
outside of the two roots.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.660
So let's pick a number that's
between x equals minus

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.360
7 and x equals 4.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.560
Well let's try x equals 0.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.660
Well, f of 0 is equal to -- we
could do it right here -- f of

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:57.360
0 is 0 plus 7 times 0 minus 4
is just 7 times minus

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.280
4, which is minus 28.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.100
So f of 0 is minus 28.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:08.800
Now is this -- this is the
function we're working with

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.790
-- is this less than 0?

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.140
Well yeah, it is.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.090
So it actually turns that a
number, an x value between

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.470
the two roots works.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.940
So actually I immediately
know that the answer here

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.340
is all of the x's that are
between the two roots.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:29.170
So we could say that the
solution to this is

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.720
minus 7 is less than x
which is less than 4.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.460
Because now the other way.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.240
You could have tried a number
that's outside of the roots,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.460
either less than minus 7 or
greater than 4 and

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.650
have tried it out.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.820
Let's say if you
had tried out 5.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.140
Try x equals 5.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:55.780
Well then f of 5 would
be 12 times 1, right,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.690
which is equal to 12.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.570
f of 5 is 12.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.300
Is that less than 0?

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.110
No.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:04.060
So that wouldn't have worked.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.000
So once again, that gives
us a confidence that we

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.260
got the right interval.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.750
And if we wanted to think about
this visually, because we got

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.920
this answer, when you do it
visually it actually makes, I

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.640
think, a lot of sense,
but maybe I'm biased.

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.770
If you look at it visually
it looks like this.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:40.890
If you drive visually and this
is the parabola, this is f of

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:52.580
x, the roots here are minus 7,
0 and 4, 0, we're saying that

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.230
for all x values between these
two numbers, f of

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.390
x is less than 0.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.770
And that makes sense, because
when is f of x less than 0?

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.420
Well this is the
graph of f of x.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.570
And when is f of x less than 0?

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.480
Right here.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.880
So what x values give us that?

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.140
Well the x values that give
us that are right here.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.410
I hope I'm not confusing
you too much with

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.960
these visual graphs.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.140
And you're probably saying,
well how do I know

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.180
I don't include 0?

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.116
Well you could try it out, but
if you -- oh, well how come

00:09:23.116 --> 00:09:24.690
I don't include the roots?

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:28.030
Well at the roots, f
of x is equal to 0.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.640
So if this was this, if this
was less than or equal to 0,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.290
then the answer would be
negative 7 is less than

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.230
or equal to x is less
than or equal to 4.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.620
I hope that gives you a sense.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.460
You pretty much just have to
try number in between the

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.250
roots, and try number outside
of the roots, and that tells

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.300
you what interval will
make the inequality true.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.640
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
