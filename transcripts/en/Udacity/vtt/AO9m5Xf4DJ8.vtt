00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, what we're going to talk about next is the idea that there're are some problems

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
such that if we could solve them fast, we could solve all problems in NP fast,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we call those problems the NP hard problems.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I don't find that to be a particularly useful name, but it's the name that everybody uses

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so I will use it as well.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
How can we say that some problem X is at least this hard,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
at least within polynomial factors, as some other problem Y.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
To phrase it anyway--if X is at least as hard as Y, what can we do with an algorithm for X.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Well, we could use it to solve Y.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In fact, that's maybe what we mean by saying that X is at least as hard as Y

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that we can use as solution to X to solve Y.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The basic picture that you can have in your head is something like this,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Imagine that we want to solve an instance of problem Y, we can imagine building a solution

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
algorithm, an algorithm for Y, that what happen inside is instance of problem Y gets transformed

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in some way between instance of problem X or may be multiple instances of problem X.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then we run an algorithm for solving problem X to get solutions to those and maybe that generates

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
more instances but after polynomial number of calls to this algorithm, what comes spitting out

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is a solution to the original instance of problem Y.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We basically have solved problem Y by bringing to to bear our solution to problem X,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or to say it another way, problem Y has been reduced to problem X.
