have been 1996 or 1997 I found online
some places where you could download the

quality for how big they were and this
 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.860
quality for how big they were and this
was something that I had played with

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:22.870
was something that I had played with
 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.850
was something that I had played with
before like in high school and and never

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:26.860
before like in high school and and never
 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.400

got really never got that whole sort of
 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.240
got really never got that whole sort of
CD quality sound out of the computer

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250
CD quality sound out of the computer
 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.400
CD quality sound out of the computer
before so when I when I found these it

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410
before so when I when I found these it
 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.770
before so when I when I found these it
was pretty interesting and so I started

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780
was pretty interesting and so I started
 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.049
was pretty interesting and so I started
playing around with it and one of my

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059
playing around with it and one of my
 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.899
playing around with it and one of my
friends in college at the time started

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909
friends in college at the time started
 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.649
friends in college at the time started
making a Mac mp3 player and on Windows

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659
making a Mac mp3 player and on Windows
 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.079

there was there were a couple pieces of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089
there was there were a couple pieces of
 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.959
there was there were a couple pieces of
software available but they were kind of

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969
software available but they were kind of
 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.160
software available but they were kind of
limited they didn't really have a good

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170
limited they didn't really have a good
 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.540
limited they didn't really have a good
experience when you were listening to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550
experience when you were listening to
 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.649
experience when you were listening to
music with them it was sort of very

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659
music with them it was sort of very
 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.880
music with them it was sort of very
functional and that like hey it's

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890
functional and that like hey it's
 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.500
functional and that like hey it's
playing it back but there was very

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510
playing it back but there was very
 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.869
playing it back but there was very
little of the sort of environment that

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879
little of the sort of environment that
 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.330
little of the sort of environment that
actually made listening to music on a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340
actually made listening to music on a
 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.249
actually made listening to music on a
computer different from listening to it

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259
computer different from listening to it
 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:08.870
computer different from listening to it
somewhere else

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
somewhere else
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.859

things like you know showing
 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.139

randomly being able to build playlists

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200
randomly being able to build playlists
 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.859
randomly being able to build playlists
all of this sort of stuff that's very

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869
all of this sort of stuff that's very
 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.590
all of this sort of stuff that's very
commonplace in music playing saw for now

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600
commonplace in music playing saw for now
 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.649

so so my friends started doing a Mac

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659
so so my friends started doing a Mac
 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.109
so so my friends started doing a Mac
version of the software called the Mac

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119
version of the software called the Mac
 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.550
version of the software called the Mac
amp and I hadn't really done very much

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560
amp and I hadn't really done very much
 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.529
amp and I hadn't really done very much
programming for Windows and Windows 95

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539
programming for Windows and Windows 95
 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.380
programming for Windows and Windows 95
had been out and it was starting to be

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390
had been out and it was starting to be
 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.539
had been out and it was starting to be
used by a lot of people so I figured hey

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549
used by a lot of people so I figured hey
 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:40.889
used by a lot of people so I figured hey
this would be a good way to learn how to

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899
this would be a good way to learn how to
 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.120
this would be a good way to learn how to
program windows application software and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
program windows application software and
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.160
program windows application software and
so I made when I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.660
I was pretty gradual there was an IRC

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
I was pretty gradual there was an IRC
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.969
I was pretty gradual there was an IRC
channel that I was hanging out on and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
channel that I was hanging out on and
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.130
channel that I was hanging out on and
had friends on and these were people all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
had friends on and these were people all
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.780
had friends on and these were people all
over the world who would just hang out

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
over the world who would just hang out
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330
over the world who would just hang out
and talk about random things it's kind

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
and talk about random things it's kind
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.060
and talk about random things it's kind
of like Co many online communities are

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
of like Co many online communities are
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.809
of like Co many online communities are
an app but and so you know I I posted

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
an app but and so you know I I posted
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.370
an app but and so you know I I posted
early versions and people would play

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380
early versions and people would play
 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.170
early versions and people would play
with them and they like hey this is good

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
with them and they like hey this is good
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.910
with them and they like hey this is good
and you know it should do this it should

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
and you know it should do this it should
 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.430
and you know it should do this it should
do that and so is this gradual thing of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440
do that and so is this gradual thing of
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.309
do that and so is this gradual thing of
people were starting to use it and

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319
people were starting to use it and
 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.430
people were starting to use it and
giving feedback and as that happened

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
giving feedback and as that happened
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.890
giving feedback and as that happened
like you get like people get excited by

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900
like you get like people get excited by
 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.150
like you get like people get excited by
it and they tell their friends and it

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
it and they tell their friends and it
 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.380
it and they tell their friends and it
sort of grows it grows in its own way

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390
sort of grows it grows in its own way
 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.229
sort of grows it grows in its own way
that way which is very exciting but it

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239
that way which is very exciting but it
 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.610
that way which is very exciting but it
kind of happens over a long period of

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620
kind of happens over a long period of
 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.559
kind of happens over a long period of
time so you you know time goes on and

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
time so you you know time goes on and
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.380
time so you you know time goes on and
and each day isn't really that much

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
and each day isn't really that much
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.090
and each day isn't really that much
bigger than the previous so you don't

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100
bigger than the previous so you don't
 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.130
bigger than the previous so you don't
really notice it that much

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140
 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.320
I tunes probably started out very

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330
I tunes probably started out very
 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.780
I tunes probably started out very
similar to Winamp other than some

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
similar to Winamp other than some
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.790
similar to Winamp other than some
obvious differences it was acquired from

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800
obvious differences it was acquired from
 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.730
obvious differences it was acquired from
from another company but I think since

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740
from another company but I think since
 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.980
from another company but I think since
then it's probably then it's been

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990
then it's probably then it's been
 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.230
then it's probably then it's been
designed a by people who actually

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240
designed a by people who actually
 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.390
designed a by people who actually
weren't the programmers on it so you'd

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400
weren't the programmers on it so you'd
 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.040
weren't the programmers on it so you'd
have people making decisions who don't

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050
have people making decisions who don't
 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.280
have people making decisions who don't
even know how those those things that

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290
even know how those those things that
 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.480
even know how those those things that
are decided and you have to get

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490
are decided and you have to get
 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.300
are decided and you have to get
implemented which is often a mistake and

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310
implemented which is often a mistake and
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.190
implemented which is often a mistake and
then also I think it's just been very

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200
then also I think it's just been very
 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.270
then also I think it's just been very
dumbed down like when working on went

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280
dumbed down like when working on went
 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.720
dumbed down like when working on went
out we always tried to make things

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730
out we always tried to make things
 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.740
out we always tried to make things
straightforward enough so that someone

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
straightforward enough so that someone
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.360
straightforward enough so that someone
who didn't who wasn't very technical

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370
who didn't who wasn't very technical
 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.810
who didn't who wasn't very technical
could use it and not be confused but

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820
could use it and not be confused but
 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.390
could use it and not be confused but
also exposed tons of power so that if

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400
also exposed tons of power so that if
 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.430
also exposed tons of power so that if
someone wanted to just completely

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440
someone wanted to just completely
 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.120
someone wanted to just completely
customize it to be exactly their own and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
customize it to be exactly their own and
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.199
customize it to be exactly their own and
change the behavior to be what they

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209
change the behavior to be what they
 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.470
change the behavior to be what they
expected they could do that of course

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480
expected they could do that of course
 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.030
expected they could do that of course
iTunes is very much you fit into the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040
iTunes is very much you fit into the
 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.080
iTunes is very much you fit into the
iTunes mold that's just how it works
