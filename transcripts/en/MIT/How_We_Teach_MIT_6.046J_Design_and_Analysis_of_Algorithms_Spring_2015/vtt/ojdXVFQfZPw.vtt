ERIK DEMAINE: To me, the key
to teaching algorithms well

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.160
is just be excited
about the material.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.890
I think if you personally think
these algorithms are really

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.090
cool and like, wow, how
did they come up with this,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.870
and wow, I mean, look how this
thing interacts with this thing

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.997
and magically it
all runs super fast,

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:24.580
I think communicating
that excitement,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.260
students pick up on
it really quickly

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.500
and themselves get engaged in
the material and care-- care

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.570
more about it.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.580
So I just try to have
fun with the material

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.660
and encourage the students to
similarly have fun learning it.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.770
So it all comes together.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.260
Occasionally, we'll
do a demonstration.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.180
But a lot of the
material in this class

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.160
is pretty theoretical.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.580
So it's mostly board
work and trying

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.650
to draw representative
figures and things like that.
