00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
What's up guys?

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.700
Check it out, we finally got a fairly nice day of good weather.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.700
So for this video, we're back outside.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.600
Now for the last couple of months my comment section has been blowing up with people asking me to do something with fidget spinners.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.400
Make my own fidget spinners, modify fidget spinners.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
So I've been gearing up to do that however,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.400
On yesterday's video the most popular comment was from Jo Deon who said: "Can you please not do anything fidget spinner.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.260
I find they are overdone, and they would ruin  you.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.940
And apparently this has become the most popular comment so i'm switching strategies.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.120
in this video rather than making fidget spinners, I'll be destroying them

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Now, a couple of months ago when I realized fidget spinners were a thing, I reached out to a few different companies

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.360
to get some prototype samples and brand them "king of random" style.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.760
the problem is, not all fidget spinners are created equal and I went trough bucket-loads of samples trying to find some that I like.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.100
and after months of going back a forward these are the only two that I settled on because they are both made of metal and I like the way they look.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.720
I also noticed the spinners that only have two sides seem to wobble...

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.300
when you turn them back and forward, which is no good

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.140
and a lot of spinners seem to have problems with their bearings, they just dont work the way they should.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.220
So I finally have a product here that I'm proud of and ready to sell but, I feel like I'm a little late to the game.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.900
However, I will put a link down in the description if you want to get the "king of random" brand fidget spinners.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.880
Not sure how long they will be here, because the purpose of this video is really to take all the extra samples, fire up the metal foundry

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.240
and see what happens when we melt them all together.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.980
Now for this experiment, I'm going back to this backyard metal foundry we made with the kale wool, and I have various sized crucibles here.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.740
and uhh, I don't think were going to need this huge one, so I'm just going to use this middle sized one here.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.300
do you remember how this worked? we just stick a couple of gas jets from the sides, fire it up, let it get nice and hot

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.640
and then we will start adding our fidgets in one-by-one

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.220
YEAHH!

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.300
*Exclamation sounds*

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.340
That is awesome

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.940
Now looking at these spinners, most of them seem to be made of aluminium, some seem to be made of brass,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.040
but in either case im going to be using this "roach away" as a flux.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.000
It's just 100% boric acid, and thats going to help the metal melt down a little quicker, and keep it a little bit cleaner.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.360
Alright, our foundry is heated up and is ready for melting, I think im going to start the melting off with this spinner here,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.220
I call this my ninja spinner because it looks like a little throwing star.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.960
This thing is made of aluminum, you can see that because I shaved down the side here, and I think the whole thing is aluminum

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.280
except for the steel bearings on the inside

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.640
lets go ahead and toss it in!

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.680
Whoo! Thats toasty!

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.380
Here we go!

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.920
That's gotta be getting pretty toasty!

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.140
That's holding up pretty good so far.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.660
Look at the tip of the spinner here, you can see thats starting to melt!

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.240
ohhh wow

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.040
Im gonna give it a little stir

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.420
ohh its gone, look at that!

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.460
fidget spinner has just become a blob of molten metal!

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.720
so the first one has been taken down, here comes fidget spinner number two.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.000
Here we go!

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.580
3

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.120
2

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.660
1!

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.340
oh yeah thats the money shot!

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.940
whoo doggie!

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.060
*Metal splashes*

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.100
ohh! Ouch!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.140
oh my god! That just exploded all over my face!

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.800
I think the battery in those LED's just exploded and went all over my shirt, my skin and the camera!

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.480
Dude your lens! Check it out!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.940
That right there is why we wear safety glasses.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.400
Molten!

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.720
cool!

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.920
Yeah!

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.880
Roach Killer!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.560
Check it out!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.900
So update guys, our aluminum spinners are gone!

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.420
They're completely liquified.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.040
So were moving up to brass!

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.060
Oh dude look at the colors!

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.060
What the crazy heck is going on?!

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.700
We've got like teal blue flames shooting out of the top here

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.160
Oh my gosh! and the metal is boiling!

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.500
It's bubbling, its boiling, it looks absolutely insane!

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.760
We've got to take this lid off and have a look!

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.840
Alright check this out

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.980
woaah!

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.400
wow!

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.540
Im pretty sure that's the zinc burning off right now

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.900
Lets throw a little bit of our roach killer in there

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.180
to suppress the oxygen

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.840
Whew! There we go see

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.700
roach killer to the rescue!

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.080
and thats what the flux does, it prevents the oxygen from getting down there and burning off the zinc.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.680
So who knew? Burn a brass fidget spinner and you get teal blue flames

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.760
and a bright yellow explosion.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.240
Glad nobody got hurt!

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.840
we've got our trusty mini metal muffin tray and were gonna gear up for the pouring now

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.260
as soon as I can cool down these gloves!

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:01.460
smokin'!

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.100
alright

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.900
can't even see where the pour spout is on this thing

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.080
so I guess it doesn't matter

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.460
check out down there! Look at that crucible

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.120
You can see its still so hot the zinc is burning off

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.560
Toasty!

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.760
Clean crucible is a happy crucible.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.020
Quick update guys, we made the pour, it was successful  and we ended up with 5 fidget spinner ingots!

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.840
Now were just going to let them cool down for a minute, then knock them out of the tray and then quench them in water.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.740
and then set them on a shelf where we can use them for some future project.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.160
They look perfect!

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.040
Alright, let's flip this over

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.640
and give it a little bang on the ground,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.120
Ugh! Thats what I was afraid of!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.040
They are actually so hot they are melding with the steel in the muffin tray,

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.920
which means they are going to be really difficult to take out.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.620
...and we did it.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.860
Woah! You can see some of the crystal structure left on the inside! That looks really cool!

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.960
So we successfully did it guys! We took all of our rejected samples and melted them down together and this is the alloy we created.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:08.720
It's some kind of aluminum brass alloy, I'm not sure what ratios, but it does look very brittle, so much to the stuff that we tried in the previous experiment

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.440
Now what I'm actually going to end up doing with these, I have no idea.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.900
They will probably just sit on the shelf until I can think of some purpose for them in a future experiment

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.180
but apparently that's what happens when you melt down together a bunch of metal fidgets

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.820
and of course if you still want to jump on the craze and get yourself a metal fidget,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.000
I put a link down in the description to these "King of Random" brand

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.980
These ones are metal and they spin really, really nicely and from all the samples that I tested,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.540
these are the only ones that I really like.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.620
and they come with these cool little zip-together cases, which I think are very neat and have never seen before.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.460
So if you want one of these bad boys, just click the link in the description,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.100
[and] that will take you to where you can find one of these metal fidget ninjas or the classic version as well,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.760
as long as they are still available.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.780
as for these, well I've got 4 boys of my own so I think im just going to pass these on

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.480
and see what kind of havoc they cause at school.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.140
and of course a big shoutout to Jo Deon for leaving a comment getting the popular vote.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.400
Go ahead and check your YouTube inbox Jo, ill send you 25 bucks!

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:01.600
Well thats it for this experiment guys, you now know what happens when you throw metal fidget spinners into a backyard metal foundry

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.580
Thanks for joining me in this video, and I'll be looking for you in the next one!

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.640
Talk to you then!

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.140
3... 2.... 1... Oh! I missed!

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:10.600
We've invented a new element.... "Randinium"

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:25.440
