and I just need some other ships that

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500
and I just need some other ships that
 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.230
and I just need some other ships that
kind of occupy some space in the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240
kind of occupy some space in the
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.390

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400
background and stuff like that so I'm
 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.640
background and stuff like that so I'm
going to be just using some regular

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650
going to be just using some regular

around the house kind of items and I
will be using some model parts and stuff

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930
will be using some model parts and stuff
 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.200
will be using some model parts and stuff
like that I don't have any specific

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210
like that I don't have any specific
 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.700
like that I don't have any specific
design that I'm working off of I just

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710
design that I'm working off of I just
 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.740
design that I'm working off of I just
need to build some generic ships to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750
need to build some generic ships to
 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.380

so they don't have to have a ton of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650
so they don't have to have a ton of
 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.800
so they don't have to have a ton of
detail you can definitely apply a lot of

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810
detail you can definitely apply a lot of
 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.540
detail you can definitely apply a lot of
these same techniques to building your

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550
these same techniques to building your
 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.270
these same techniques to building your
girl props you can make even you know

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280
girl props you can make even you know
 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.040

something so this the amount of detail

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
something so this the amount of detail
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.530
something so this the amount of detail
totally depends on you and how much time

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540
totally depends on you and how much time

you want to put into it if you're going
 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.830
you want to put into it if you're going
to build a hero prop and the more detail

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
to build a hero prop and the more detail
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.630
to build a hero prop and the more detail
the better if you're building some

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640
the better if you're building some
 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.490
the better if you're building some
background stuff you know I need to

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500
background stuff you know I need to
 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.110

of time and with no money so I'm just

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
of time and with no money so I'm just
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.660
of time and with no money so I'm just
going to use whatever items I kind of

to look like joists and stuff like that
 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.260
to look like joists and stuff like that
you can get them already kind of

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270
you can get them already kind of
 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.010
you can get them already kind of
prefabbed and different elements but you

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020
prefabbed and different elements but you
 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.410
prefabbed and different elements but you
can just cut them up and these different

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420
can just cut them up and these different
 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.880
can just cut them up and these different
you know layers and layers of this

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890
you know layers and layers of this
 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.430

different stuff will give the ship a

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440
different stuff will give the ship a
 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.410
different stuff will give the ship a
texture and everything and then add some

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420
texture and everything and then add some
 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.390
texture and everything and then add some
model parts to it and stuff like that

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400
model parts to it and stuff like that
 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.729
model parts to it and stuff like that
and it'll hopefully kind of give it all

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
and it'll hopefully kind of give it all
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.050

just going to kind of play around with

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769
just going to kind of play around with
 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.080
just going to kind of play around with
the different elements and see what kind

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090
the different elements and see what kind
 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.560
the different elements and see what kind
of happens but yeah let's do it

applesauce containers and I glued a
 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.820
applesauce containers and I glued a
couple thing together and I thought this

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830
couple thing together and I thought this
 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.060
couple thing together and I thought this
was kind of a cool possibly cockpit or

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070
was kind of a cool possibly cockpit or
 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.700
was kind of a cool possibly cockpit or
something something like like this or

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110
little bit with PVC and it looks kind of
 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.520

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:16.670
model pieces on this I actually just
 

00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.829
model pieces on this I actually just
used a few model pieces here and there

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839
used a few model pieces here and there
 

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:23.740
used a few model pieces here and there
most of it is just diamond pieces or zip

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:23.750
most of it is just diamond pieces or zip
 

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.019
most of it is just diamond pieces or zip
ties I cut up zip ties favor really kind

00:10:26.019 --> 00:10:26.029
ties I cut up zip ties favor really kind
 

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:28.300
ties I cut up zip ties favor really kind
of a cool texture and so a lot of the

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:28.310
of a cool texture and so a lot of the
 

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.329
of a cool texture and so a lot of the
different elements around the back of it

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:31.339
different elements around the back of it
 

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.230
different elements around the back of it
and stuff like that are just zip ties

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240
 

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.819
you know the different paneling and

00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:36.829
you know the different paneling and
 

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:39.550
you know the different paneling and
stuff like that from a distance it looks

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560
stuff like that from a distance it looks
 

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.439
stuff like that from a distance it looks
pretty cool or it will look nothing

00:10:41.439 --> 00:10:41.449
pretty cool or it will look nothing
 

00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:45.309
pretty cool or it will look nothing
pretty good but up close it's definitely

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:45.319
pretty good but up close it's definitely
 

00:10:45.319 --> 00:10:46.840
pretty good but up close it's definitely
going to notice all the mistakes and

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:46.850
going to notice all the mistakes and
 

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.319
going to notice all the mistakes and
stuff like that so yes you know

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:50.329
stuff like that so yes you know
 

00:10:50.329 --> 00:10:53.290
stuff like that so yes you know
definitely not a hero prop the the

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.300
definitely not a hero prop the the
 

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.129
definitely not a hero prop the the
cockpit or front end I guess or whatever

00:10:57.129 --> 00:10:57.139
cockpit or front end I guess or whatever
 

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:05.199
cockpit or front end I guess or whatever
has kind of gotta go like this and yeah

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:05.209
has kind of gotta go like this and yeah
 

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:09.340
has kind of gotta go like this and yeah
I kind of deliberately I kind of looked

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:09.350
I kind of deliberately I kind of looked
 

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.189
I kind of deliberately I kind of looked
at it as kind of like a space

00:11:12.189 --> 00:11:12.199
at it as kind of like a space
 

00:11:12.199 --> 00:11:14.110

recreational vehicle you know it's kind

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120
recreational vehicle you know it's kind
 

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.030
recreational vehicle you know it's kind
of like you know Winnebago or something

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040
of like you know Winnebago or something
 

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.929
of like you know Winnebago or something
in space you know or like the family

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:19.939
in space you know or like the family
 

00:11:19.939 --> 00:11:22.090

truckster or something so I I kinda

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.100
truckster or something so I I kinda
 

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.790
truckster or something so I I kinda
literally put like a grill on the front

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800
literally put like a grill on the front
 

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.610
literally put like a grill on the front
of it there to kind of give it the look

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:27.620
of it there to kind of give it the look
 

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:32.420
of it there to kind of give it the look
of like a family sedan I guess

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:32.430
 

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.579
and then the different you know the two

00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079
rocket boosters are going to grow on the
 

00:11:38.079 --> 00:11:40.710
rocket boosters are going to grow on the
side somehow it's going to have a very

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720
side somehow it's going to have a very
 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.139
side somehow it's going to have a very
generic kind of retro 80s look which is

00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:46.149
generic kind of retro 80s look which is
 

00:11:46.149 --> 00:11:47.160
generic kind of retro 80s look which is
what I'm going for

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:47.170
what I'm going for
 

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.999
what I'm going for
I wanted to have a look like it's sort

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:51.009
I wanted to have a look like it's sort
 

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:54.059
I wanted to have a look like it's sort
of cobbled together using other parts of

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:54.069
of cobbled together using other parts of
 

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:57.989
of cobbled together using other parts of
ships and stuff like that so yeah once I

00:11:57.989 --> 00:11:57.999
ships and stuff like that so yeah once I
 

00:11:57.999 --> 00:11:59.220
ships and stuff like that so yeah once I
start gluing all the elements of stuff

00:11:59.220 --> 00:11:59.230
start gluing all the elements of stuff
 

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.139
start gluing all the elements of stuff
like that together I think it and throw

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:01.149
like that together I think it and throw
 

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:03.530
like that together I think it and throw
the paint job on I think is a low look

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540
the paint job on I think is a low look
 

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.769
the paint job on I think is a low look
fairly decent so yeah I think that's it

00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:07.779
fairly decent so yeah I think that's it
 

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:11.309
fairly decent so yeah I think that's it
for today tomorrow we'll glue all the

00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:11.319
for today tomorrow we'll glue all the
 

00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:14.069
for today tomorrow we'll glue all the
components together and throw a paint

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079
components together and throw a paint
 

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:17.249
components together and throw a paint
job on it and see how it looks so we're

00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:17.259
job on it and see how it looks so we're
 

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:19.710
job on it and see how it looks so we're
back everything is pretty much all the

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720
back everything is pretty much all the
 

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.629
back everything is pretty much all the
glue is dried and stuff like that so now

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639
glue is dried and stuff like that so now
 

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:22.920
glue is dried and stuff like that so now
we're just going to glue everything

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:22.930
we're just going to glue everything
 

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.069
we're just going to glue everything
together and I'm probably going to glue

00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079
together and I'm probably going to glue
 

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:28.439
together and I'm probably going to glue
it mostly with hot glue just to hold it

00:12:28.439 --> 00:12:28.449
it mostly with hot glue just to hold it
 

00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:33.150
it mostly with hot glue just to hold it
together so I know it's pretty sturdy

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160
together so I know it's pretty sturdy
 

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.629
together so I know it's pretty sturdy
all the pieces are extremely lightweight

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:35.639
all the pieces are extremely lightweight
 

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:37.889
all the pieces are extremely lightweight
because I just made out of lightweight

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:37.899
because I just made out of lightweight
 

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:39.689
because I just made out of lightweight
plastics and bottles and stuff like that

00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:39.699
plastics and bottles and stuff like that
 

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:43.919
plastics and bottles and stuff like that
so it should be pretty easy to do all

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:43.929
so it should be pretty easy to do all
 

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:52.030
so it should be pretty easy to do all
the components together a little

here's my space family truckster yeah

here's my space family truckster yeah
like I said right now looks like crap

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.730
like I said right now looks like crap
 

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.819
like I said right now looks like crap
but I think once we start to paint it

00:13:29.819 --> 00:13:29.829
but I think once we start to paint it
 

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:33.539
but I think once we start to paint it
it'll start to look like something as

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:33.549
it'll start to look like something as
 

00:13:33.549 --> 00:13:34.859

and the cockpit and the body and stuff
 

00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:46.919
and the cockpit and the body and stuff
and then we'll go back and do like some

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:46.929
and then we'll go back and do like some
 

00:13:46.929 --> 00:13:49.289
and then we'll go back and do like some
washes and stuff like that kind of make

thought it was pretty good and then I

thought it was pretty good and then I
 

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:43.030

kind of like we dusted the the back of

kind of like we dusted the the back of
 

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.579

kind of just a few light passes to look
 

00:15:57.559 --> 00:15:59.139
kind of just a few light passes to look
at what make it look kind of like the

paint is wearing off I'm just going to

00:16:01.359 --> 00:16:01.369
paint is wearing off I'm just going to
 

00:16:01.369 --> 00:16:05.280
paint is wearing off I'm just going to
do it on one side I think so sort of I

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:05.290
do it on one side I think so sort of I
 

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.210

know I just like when things are a
little off set or the law balance makes

00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:10.429
little off set or the law balance makes
 

00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:11.499
little off set or the law balance makes
it look a little more interesting and

00:16:11.499 --> 00:16:11.509
it look a little more interesting and
 

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:14.590
it look a little more interesting and
then I'll probably go back we'll do a

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600
then I'll probably go back we'll do a
 

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.730
then I'll probably go back we'll do a
wash over all the parts and I'll do

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:17.740
wash over all the parts and I'll do
 

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.590
wash over all the parts and I'll do
probably some random color some like

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600
probably some random color some like
 

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.559
probably some random color some like
dark Browns and reds and stuff like that

front area are just aluminum tape that I
 

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:14.080
front area are just aluminum tape that I
cut into patterns and stuck on there and

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.090
cut into patterns and stuck on there and
 

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.450

that kind of gives it a raised area an

different model parts and stuff like
 

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:35.869
different model parts and stuff like

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:47.519
amount of that kind of stuff the model
 

00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:51.919
amount of that kind of stuff the model
parts and the styrene then just use that

00:21:51.919 --> 00:21:51.929
parts and the styrene then just use that
 

00:21:51.929 --> 00:21:53.720
