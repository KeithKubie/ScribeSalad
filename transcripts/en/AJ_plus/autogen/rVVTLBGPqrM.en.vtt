 [Music] 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.770
 I insist a lot on the advantages of 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.140
 the shelter 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.470
 that will give you more guarantee and that 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:01:03.080
 the past is difficult

 will come to the United States but as 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:24.490
 the father brought them here and then 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.329
 from here he was told we could 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.569
 fix papers or ask the shelter myself 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:35.829
 I asked for shelter and they told me that Kim 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:43.770
 jong put my sister studied if she 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:43.770
 I went for four years 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.880
 I was very afraid to live there because in 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.869
 front of our house we had a 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.409
 cantina and jumped once accept one and 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.420
 they again assaulted a neighbor who 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.140
 we had how she did not want to give 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.690
 money to the stab wounds and then I 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.840
 I screamed when they stabbed her 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:11.549

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.700

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.700
 Boys 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.560
 we overcome a difficult stage of 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
 conductivity and the attitude is incredible 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.840
 positive that dreams have 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.150
 continents 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.150
