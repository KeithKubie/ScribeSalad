00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.950
Let's do some slightly
more complicated

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.110
fractional exponent examples.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.690
So we already know
that if I were

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.910
to take 9 to the 1/2 power,
this is going to be equal to 3,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.030
and we know that because
3 times 3 is equal to 9.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.446
This is equivalent
to saying, what

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:16.890
is the principal root of 9?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.020
Well, that is equal to 3.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.400
But what would happen if I took
9 to the negative 1/2 power?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.010
Now we have a negative
fractional exponent,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.600
and the key to
this is to just not

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.630
get too worried or
intimidated by this,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.210
but just think about
it step by step.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.709
Just ignore for the second
that this is a fraction,

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:36.250
and just look at
this negative first.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.980
Just breathe
slowly, and realize,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.630
OK, I got a negative exponent.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.190
That means that this is
just going to be 1 over 9

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860
to the 1/2.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.380
That's what that
negative is a cue for.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.880
This is 1 over 9 to the 1/2,
and we know that 9 to the 1/2

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.200
is equal to 3.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.165
So this is just going
to be equal to 1/3.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.180
Let's take things a
little bit further.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.970
What would this evaluate to?

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.680
And I encourage you to pause
the video after trying it,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.660
or pause the video to try it.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:21.539
Negative 27 to the
negative 1/3 power.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.080
So I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.160
and think about what
this would evaluate to.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.820
So remember, just
take a deep breath.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.111
You can always get rid of
this negative in the exponent

00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.590
by taking the reciprocal and
raising it to the positive.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.340
So this is going to be
equal to 1 over negative 27

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.330
to the positive 1/3 power.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.580
And I know what you're saying.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.020
Hey, I still can't
breathe easily.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.250
I have this negative number
to this fractional exponent.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.700
But this is just
saying what number,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.570
if I were to multiply
it three times--

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200
so if I have that number, so
whatever the number this is,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.820
if I were to multiply it,
if I took three of them

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.050
and I multiply them
together, if I multiplied 1

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.010
by that number three
times, what number would I

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.930
have to use here
to get negative 27?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.140
Well, we already know
that 3 to the third,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.130
which is equal to
3 times 3 times 3,

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.890
is equal to positive 27.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.080
So that's a pretty good clue.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.770
What would negative 3
to the third power be?

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.210
Well, that's negative 3 times
negative 3 times negative 3,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.130
which is negative 3 times
negative 3 is positive 9.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.104
Times negative 3 is negative 27.

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:35.270
So we've just found this
number, this question mark.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.390
Negative 3 times negative
3 times negative 3

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.300
is equal to negative 27.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.910
So negative 27 to the
1/3-- this part right over

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.660
here-- is equal to negative 3.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:54.080
So this is going to be
equal to 1 over negative 3,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.460
which is the same
thing as negative 1/3.
