[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Guys, Grant and I are going
to be at a Mini Maker Faire.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Guys, Grant and I are going
to be at a Mini Maker Faire.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.100
It's at Electric Park in Thanksgiving Point,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.660
which is in Lehi, Utah.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.740
It's going to be going
down September 15th.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.270
We're going to be bringing
some of our favorite projects.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.120
We're going to have a stage show.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.660
We'll have a craft table where
you can make your own Sky balls.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.440
It's going to be awesome.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.740
Check the link in the description
for 20% off of admission price,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.590
which is only like $8 to start with.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.540
So if you can make it out there,
would love to see you.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.870
[Music]

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.420
YouTube user Ricky Alvarez
wanted to see what would happen

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.760
if we put a smoke grenade
inside of a watermelon.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.640
We're pretty sure it would just
make smoke inside the watermelon,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.329
and leak out wherever the hole is.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.999
So we wanted to upgrade this
idea to something even cooler.

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:44.359
We want to turn the watermelon
into the smoke grenade.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.370
So we've got all our chemicals
for making our smoke powder.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.440
We're going to mix up a batch
in six different colors,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.280
layer them inside the watermelon,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.600
add a pull-tab fuse,
and see what happens.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.700
The idea here is simple.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.220
We've got a great recipe for making
smoke powder in several different colors.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.940
We'll mix up a batch of each color,
layer them inside our hollow watermelon,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.960
light it off, and see what the result is.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.760
The first step is going to be mixing up
a whole bunch of our smoke powder base.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.780
That has four different chemicals,
all of which are a white powder,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.480
and we then go ahead
and add the colored powders later.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.580
But we're not going to do that here.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640
We're going to take this up
to the Dome and light it off

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.000
because it's a much better area.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.920
We're not bothering people with the smoke.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.360
So let's mix up, I don't know about
that jar full of smoke powder base.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.740
We'll take that up to the Dome,
mix up the individual colors,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.980
and fill our watermelon.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:59.240
[Music]

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.240
Once we've got all of our smoke
powder mixed up inside of a watermelon,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.120
we're going to want to add one
of those little pull tab fuse igniters,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.960
because those are by far the most fun.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.240
So, we've got a book of matches,
we've got some fuse,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.280
and I have this steel straw that I'm going
to use to sort of guide the fuse down

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.460
into the watermelon into the powder.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:53.140
[Music]

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.940
We've got a watermelon,
we've got our smoke powder,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.020
and we have our pull-tab fuse.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.100
Let's head up to the Dome,
hollow this thing out,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.150
fill it with smoke powder, and light it up.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.079
Here we are out of the Dome, so now
it's time to hollow out this watermelon,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.620
and fill it up with smoke powder.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:17.980
[Music]

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.800
Not bad.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:40.080
[Music]

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.440
Our watermelon is carved out.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.200
It's got holes added into it.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.719
It's got a spot for our fuse straw.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.580
Let's finish mixing up the
smoke powder and fill it up.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:04:13.680
[Music]

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.220
One caveat I should explain
before we light this off.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.900
All of the chemicals that we're
using for this are like 10 months old,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.840
and I'm not entirely sure
if they go bad or not.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.720
So we're hoping that this
ignites the same way as other

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.940
smoke stuff we've done.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.520
But we don't know.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.280
[Music]

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.070
Here we go.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.350
A watermelon full of smoke
powder, and I mean like that is

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.500
a lot of smoke powder in there.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.480
Here we go.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.680
Pull tab.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:05:00.640
[Music]

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.360
We have ignition.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.300
[Music]

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.340
So much ignition.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.020
Uh...

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.060
That's amazing.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.300
[Music]

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.600
Little piece of fuse flew out.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.740
Holy cow.
That is a lot of smoke.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.180
[Music]

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.760
Oh, it's working really well.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.180
Remember how I was worried
that maybe it wasn't going to work.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.860
I'm not worried anymore.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.720
Yeah.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.840
[Music]

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.620
It's getting more energetic.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.800
[Music]

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.740
I don't know how the lid has separated
from the rest of the watermelon.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.240
I think the body of the watermelon
got so hot that it just kind

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.080
of contracted and curled down.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.100
The lid just stayed up on top.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.900
That right there is the remnants
of a whole lot of smoke powder.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.980
Oh, that worked great!

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.200
There's like little bits
of every color that didn't quite burn.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.120
We're just getting
plumes of different colors.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.600
I love how divided up the colors are.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.470
Like it's not just all swirling
together to make one gray mist.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.960
You really seeing a bunch of different
colors coming out at different times.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.360
When the smoke cleared, I half
expected this garage door to just

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.400
be completely multicolored,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.570
like someone had
just graffitied all over it.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.200
But amazingly, it didn't
really seem to do much.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.380
That was the largest amount of
smoke powder I've ever set off at once,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.920
and the effect was really, really cool.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.240
There was so much smoke that was
so thick and so vibrantly colored.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.070
I was honestly a little worried that it
wasn't going to work in transition colors.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.560
I thought we might just get a grayish
brownish plume coming out the top,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.700
but it did a really good job of just
going through the whole rainbow order.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.400
I love how it turned out, and then
just the extra that I poured out has

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.660
just been going and it keeps finding
little bursts of more smoke to ignite.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.670
Overall, very cool idea.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.140
