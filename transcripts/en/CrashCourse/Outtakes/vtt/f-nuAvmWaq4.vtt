00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.740
It was time for George Melies!

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.800
-Boom!
-(crew) Introoo

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.880
(crew) Bo doo doo do do do

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.480
Boo doo doo do do do do!

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.580
No?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:26.120
(intro)

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.200
This powerful medium sits in a sweet pot --

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.820
Sp-sp (crew laugh)

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.540
-Sweet pot.
-Sweet pot.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.720
As filmmakers started to experiment with narrative film they began to establish a language through different editing techniques and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.760
camera movements, I'm gonna do that again.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.640
The Lumiere brothers had lots of experience in business, engineering, manufacturing, and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.920
Photography. Okay.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.020
He thought of mo--he thought of motion pictures as--as an add-on to phonograph. Which is -- (clicks tongue) he thought of mo--

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.800
We're gonna get this guys so everybody settle down, everybody just calm down. We're going to get this.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.180
It's inescapable like FBI--

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.980
It's inescapable like bluhlbluh

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:04.760
Not many films are shot

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.760
Bluhbluhbluh woo mi mi mi.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.360
In 1894 a Canadian entrepreneur named Andrew Hollen opened the first

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.940
kinetoscope parlor in New York City, charging 25 cents, ha!

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.720
(crew laughs) Ha! Yeah.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.190
-Then, holy (beep) he reverse engineered the anomanograph
-(crew laughs)

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.880
So it worked as its own camera too- not many films are actually filmed on film these days, anymore.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550
Even though Edison and Dixon originally

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.669
hoped to synchronize the sound from a phonograph to the images in the kinetoscope (breath in)

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.949
They never quite figured out how to do it. Now at the very beginning of history before all these

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.530
Innovations existed film started--hubluhbluh--started out of the collective still images viewed one after another in rapid succession

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
Which creates the illusion of motion.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.600
One take wonder.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.871
The camera was hard to move and they--and only one wadawah

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.340
A single viewer exhibition device that you would

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.140
use to watch the kineto--kine oo nam oo--kinetograph films.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.000
The idea was to create a coin-operated

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.800
entertainment machine that produced images to go along with music or speech that played from a

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.296
I want to do it again.

00:02:02.296 --> 00:02:06.580
...and from that trick came an art form that the blend of literature drama--fah fah fe fu!

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.640
and music
-(crew) Fah fah fruit?

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.840
That's french.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.940
If another frame appears within that fifth of a second your brain won't register the black space between them

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.880
You'll just perceive that im--blah hoo-hah. Hey!

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.089
Before Edison and his lab had even built their viewing machine he applied for two preliminary

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.479
claims with the U.S. patent office. One for the plans for the device. One for his plans for his device--for the device and one

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.320
For his na--for its name

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.520
You've probably experienced this concept at some point. A new technology comes out and at first

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.549
we're all marveling at what it can do ooh, I can--I got camera in my pocket

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.500
It's a phone and a camera at the same time, wow!

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.340
Bah ben ta be hmm.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.960
Edison ever the money

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.980
hog (chuckles)

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.240
The guy that invented--the guy with the chronophotographic gun.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.960
Which gives you some idea of how they felt about working for a guy like (mutters)

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.300
Defined in 1912 by the Czech born flahah psychologist Max Wertheimer.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.020
-I nailed it, right?
(crew)Yes

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.300
The five phenomenon is an optical illusion that lets you see the--leheh

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.149
Series of images in rapid (quick mutter) succession as in any one moment.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.200
Moving on. (clears throat)

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.399
The idea was to create a coin-operated entertainment machine that produced images to go along with music or speech that played from a ph--phono--

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.169
Phonograph, huh! Inventors were working independently all over Europe and the United bleh

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.860
But that's not all once the film has been developed the Lumiere device could reconfigure into a projection ma--machine as well

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.860
It does so many things. It's great.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.280
Love it. Perfect.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.420
Let's move on.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.169
(sing-song) When is the last time you heard a really good story?

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.769
Now people have been telling stories since we've had language and they've been using

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.620
pictures even animunimum. You know, those images of animals, trees, and human figures painted on stone walls. Fr--

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.700
(breathes out)

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.560
Think of these as a bowl or a deep cylinder or just look at it.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.680
(crew laughs)

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.480
Niups--niups used bleh (crew laughs) niups neused a namera and knee obscura... Scientists now believe it took a couple days of

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.760
exposing the light for a--oo hmm bah

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.590
Hmm, hey guys, how are you?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.260
How we doing? We good? ... who invented a way of taking pictures on paper rather than metal or (quickly) glass plate.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.580
Marey invented what he called the chronophotographic gun. (crew laughs) Chrono.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.169
I only said half of the se--the line

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.880
I probably say the whole thing. No

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.850
What did I do wrong? One of those engineers was a young man named William also known as WKL Dixon. (crew laughs)

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.025
His assignment was to create something that would animate photographs, something Edison would--blahblahblah pow pow!

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:30.570
How do we feel this is going?

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.270
We doing--we doing alright? Things like grammar, syntax, punc--punctuation.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.809
So it makes sense that his films as impressive and influential as they were

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:39.800
(makes bubble sounds and chomps teeth)

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.940
Per--performative spec--ca--spectacles.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.119
Moving on... I think I sounded a little drunk

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.880
(crew) Let's try it again.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.619
Okay, I probably shouldn't be so drunk... or the novelty of film itself- is the novelty itself a film is enough to keep people buying

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.780
tickets. (clears throat)

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.720
(crew) Do that again.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720
-No, I think I
-Really?

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.730
Okay
-I conveyed it, people know what I mean.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.460
-That's true.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.460
Not the Hellraiser puzzle.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.260
Oo! (Piece thuds)

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.460
(piano music)

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.340
(music stops)

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.800
-Calm- everybody calm down 
-(crew) I'm sorry

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.440
-Just (Breathes in and out)

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.840
(clears throat)

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.200
Got to get ready to say this line. It's going to be good.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.400
Yup.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.240
(clear throat) Well the Lumiere Brothers devol--

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.320
(crew) No!

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.320
(everyone laughs)

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.660
Nice one.
