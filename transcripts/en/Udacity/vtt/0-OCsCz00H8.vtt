00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.550
So Anchor, I was thinking that there
are so many game apps out there already,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.790
why would I look for

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.130
another game to play when there's
already Bejeweled and Fruit Ninja?

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.340
&gt;&gt; That's a great question, because even
if a new game is a lot of fun to play,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.650
it won't necessarily be profitable.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.160
And its popularity may fade with time.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.835
Luckily, that's what
this course is about.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:22.720
We'll talk about three main
topics that'll help your game

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.970
keep its players coming back and
help you make money.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.640
What are those topics Suzanne?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.520
&gt;&gt; Well, the first lesson
will be about engagement.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.560
Which is how to design your game so
that people play it often and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.830
stay interested over time.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.310
The second lesson will discuss
the different models for

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.180
monetization, like using ads and
in-app purchases.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.530
And our third and last lesson will
be about publishing best practices,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.150
like testing your game and
getting your game noticed.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.484
&gt;&gt; As you go through this course,
keep in mind that the best and

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:56.421
the easiest way to make your game
profitable is to start thinking about

00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:57.969
monetization right away.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.310
As you're building your game,
don't leave it as a last step.
