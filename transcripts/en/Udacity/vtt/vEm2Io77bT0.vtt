Let's start with the ones that we already know. We've seen the getMonth method

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.689
before, it's part of the day class. Looks like addDays is also part of that day

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.250
class we've been using. This length method you maybe haven't seen yet, but I

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.740
can look in front of it and I can see hello world, which I know is a string.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.520
And down here, I've got something called lolcatsPic. And it's drawing, which

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.640
sounds sort of like methods which should go with a picture.
