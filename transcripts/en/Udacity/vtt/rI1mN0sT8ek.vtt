00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.350
I am Eric Durand. I'm a computational

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.530
biologist here at 23andMe. I've been with the

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.940
company for about two years now. And I'm

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.660
mostly working on their ancestry products which range

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.560
from a variety of different problems. before that, I was a, a post doc at UC

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.120
Berkeley for another two years. And even before

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.910
that, I was a PHD student in France.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.560
Well, so, a computational biologist, I think,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.150
is always someone who's trying to develop

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.430
or at least to implement computational methods

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.120
to analyze biological data. So in, in my

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.930
field, in genetics. Even in my field, there is a wide variety of different data

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.360
and a wide variety of different applications.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.984
So, a computational biologist could be someone developing

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:52.480
pipeline to analyze origin of sequences, for

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.870
example. Just from the raw data, to the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.530
alignments, to culling the SNVs from the raw

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.110
data. And just process the data so it's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.750
ready for statisticians for example, to try

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.060
to further process it. Could be someone like

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.300
me, who's, for me, a very bag, very big part of my job is machine learning.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.450
So it could be someone who is

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.920
really interested in machine learning. And trying to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.540
extract sense from the data directly. it comes

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.160
from the from the realization, I think, that

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.720
amount of genetic data is huge and growing

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.930
really fast. And even maybe more problematic is

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.010
the complexity of the data. Like any single

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.420
phenotype is going to be influenced by not

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.790
any single but many, many phenotypes is going to

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.970
be influenced by a lot of different genes. It's

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.770
very, very hard to find exactly the structure in

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.393
the data. So machine learning is one way to,

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:55.175
to tackle the problem. I and I think it's

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.620
a way that's proved successful already. So here at

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.584
23andMe, I think it's safe to say that all

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:06.900
the computational biologists came from the computer side of things.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.280
They are of training either in computer science or in math or in

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.974
statistics. And they learn biology later as fascinating

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:20.560
application field for data scientists basically.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.670
&gt;&gt; And so as you know, biology and genetics grows, you think there will

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.830
be a an opportunity for many more

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.220
computational individuals who are interested to sort of

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.090
learn genetics and biology and apply that.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.120
&gt;&gt; Yes. Definitely. I think. I honestly think that biology is the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.710
science of the 21st century, nothing less. And it will change everything

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.375
for most people. It will revolutionize

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.810
medicine being preventive or, or personalized.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:57.392
It will, Yeah, it will basically change the daily life of, of everyone

00:02:57.392 --> 00:03:02.342
I guess. And we need more people and I think many, many more jobs are

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:07.639
going to be created around, around in the computation of biology. So I

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.841
developed another features that 23andMe called ancestry

00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:17.635
composition which goal is to find the origin of, of

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:22.410
segments. Not as precise as finding who you share

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.300
it with but where does it come from. So

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.800
it could come from some part of Europe. It could

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.190
come from some part of East Asia. Or some part

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.960
of Africa. so my undergrad was in applied math and

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.820
computer science. And then I went on to do a

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.570
PhD in Statistics. And because the way that was in

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.070
France and because the way it works in France, I

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.320
had to choose a field application for statistics. And that's,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.820
only then, that I began to think about genetics. Because my PI was very

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.000
interested in population genetics, which is this field in genetics where we try

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.120
to learn about human evolution. So natural

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.460
selection, demography, ancestry, identity by descent. Then

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.470
I became interested as well, and I

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.610
developed statistical learning method to learn about

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.178
the, the genetic structure of such populations. After my PhD, I decided to do a

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:21.170
post doc here at UC Berkeley. Because I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.120
had a very good opportunity with someone very

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.400
famous in the field of population genetics. And

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.680
there I was lucky enough to work on

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.260
the first draft of the neanderthal genome. So

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.710
I actually had the first full neanderthal genome

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.980
sitting on my hard-drive and I could just

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.240
do my, my stuff with it, anything I wanted.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.250
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.817
&gt;&gt; And I contributed to develop methods that, that

00:04:46.817 --> 00:04:51.895
estimated amount of neanderthal DNA that modern humans have today.

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:56.310
&gt;&gt; if there was somebody watching this interview right now and

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.120
they're really intrigued about how biology and computer science and math,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.120
statistics work together in, in a particular job, what advice

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.640
would you give them to, to study in school? What would

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.820
you recommend that they do, and maybe where would you recommend

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.300
that they seek you know, career advice or, or, or work

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah. so as I said, I do believe there is needs for

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.230
specialists or I do recommend they keep studying math and computer

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.550
science and statistics a lot. But they still need

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.340
to take some biology at the very least to figure

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.260
what are the problems that we need to solve

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.010
today in biology. And how to relate, you know it's

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.612
not enough to get out of school and know

00:05:42.612 --> 00:05:46.190
a list of the ten fastest algorithms for each specific

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.350
problem that you learn in school. You also need

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.250
to be able to relate those great class of algorithms

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.730
to different problems in biology. How you will need to

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.060
adapt them, how sometimes you will have to realize that

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.080
there's nothing that exists already. And you need to develop

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.490
something that's not going to be optimal probably. But you need

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.520
to do a first pass of the problem. So you

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.060
do need to know enough biology at the very least

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.080
to understand the problems. Otherwise, for example, for ancestry, if

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.820
you don't have a very clear understanding of the recombination

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.220
process, there is nothing you can do. You need, you need to

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:26.820
understand exactly what probably stick model you can put in meiosis. How

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.734
often it's going to break a chromosome, all these things. So you, you,

00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:33.632
you do need to know it enough biology to understand the problems.

00:06:33.632 --> 00:06:34.840
&gt;&gt; Definitely.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.208
&gt;&gt; So you need to take at least an

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:38.830
intro to biology class or something at the very least.
