00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.040
GINA CLINE: Just called in.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.040
We're half a click
inside Chechnya.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.830
Not too late to turn back.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.000
US military operating on Russian
soil constitutes an act of war.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.670
We've been ordered to trade
Nasry for the president's guy.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.880
Those are our orders.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.500
We will complete them.
Understood?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.830
Clear.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.880
Nothing better to do.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.040
You're the boss.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.380
Delta 3?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.330
I'm here, aren't I?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.880
Yes, you are.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.580
[gunfire]

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.880
Time.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.170
You beat your time
by a full second.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.880
I'm really happy for you.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.540
Yeah, well, we still
have half a second to go,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.420
but the tide is turning.
- What?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.250
Alex?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.750
We're here, beautiful
downtown Kishnet.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.210
[speaking russian]

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.920
He said welcome.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.540
They've been expecting us.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.710
Anzor, welcome to Kishnet.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.420
Joe, you got any more
men of fighting age here?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
We're all fighting age here.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.460
Prince's men came at night.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.620
Told me we agreed
to host exchange.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.040
They gave us money.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.460
We don't.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.120
They gave us trouble.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.790
How many of them?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.540
Two.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.790
Hmm.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.620
It's enough when
you are the prince.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.040
Well, I mean no
disrespect, Anzor,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.540
but I don't think I'd
be taking that deal.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.920
Hmm.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.080
[sighs] When this is
over, you will leave,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.920
and we'll still be here.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.210
Can Chloe come
over for dinner?

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960
That girl you just met?

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.960
I know you're scared, Mom.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.960
But I made a new friend.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
She's really nice.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.920
OK.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.380
You must be Chloe.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.620
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Ortiz.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.120
Oh, please, call me Jackie.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.620
And act normal.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.120
No more guns.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.920
When you see the
prince, you're going

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.790
to tell him about
a mid-level career

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.620
used by the Uma movement.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.960
He handles small-time
errands for one

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.420
of the prince's lieutenants.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.080
He's a CIA asset.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.670
Convince him you're
still valuable.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.790
You'd sacrifice
your own asset?

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.460
When necessary.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.000
MAN (ON RADIO): Delta 1,
we might have something.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.620
Six armed unknowns
approaching the village.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.830
Delta 1, this is Delta 6.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.580
Two pickups just pulled up.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.170
It's at least six
men with small arms.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.460
Yeah, a local warlord.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.500
But they'll know who I am.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.000
Let me see what they want.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.540
[speaking russian]

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.330
[gunfire]

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.170
Usha, we got our answer.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.880
It's an ambush.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.880
Delta, I got hostiles
coming from the south.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.790
[gunfire]

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.880
Delta 1, this is Delta 6.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.170
We are rolling in from the east.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.210
[gunfire]

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.210
We can't hold them back.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.540
[gunfire]

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.670
I'm letting Nasry go.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.120
We let Nasry go,
and we game it out.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.330
He makes his way
back to the prince,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.210
and we buy Andrew
Hall more time.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.380
It goes one of two ways.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.250
The prince kills Nasry.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.750
You get what you want.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.250
That's option one.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.710
What's option two?

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.040
Tables get turned.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.250
Nasry kills the prince.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.330
And I get what I want.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.880
But if we bring Nasry
back, neither happens.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.580
And Hall dies.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.580
Bear, we put two bullets in
the back of Nasry's skull right

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.580
now, and we end this.
OK?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.580
I hear what you're saying.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.580
An eye for an eye, brother.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.080
We're not going to do that.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.000
I know you think you're right.
But you're wrong.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.920
Well, right or wrong,
this is my choice to make.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.500
Pretend you
escaped the attack.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.920
The prince's men
own these mountains.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.750
OK, here's your alternative.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.670
I take you back.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.710
The prince kills Hall.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.080
And you're worthless.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.250
The agency sends your
away, account closed.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.380
You disappear,
this time for good.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.460
Your family, the treatment
for your father stops.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.790
You can forget about him.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.540
And yeah, you may survive
the torture to live

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.580
out your life in a hole.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.250
But what kind of life is that?

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.880
I'm giving you an opportunity.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.460
How is this an opportunity?

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.540
You give me the prince, and
I'll give you his kingdom.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.210
You don't have the
power to do that.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.460
Michael, it's
what the CIA does.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.620
You need to see a
specialist about your head.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.210
Well, if I see one
of our Navy docs,

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.460
it'll end up on
my medical record.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.920
I can't afford
that, not if I want

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.290
to make it back on the team.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.500
Well, my friend Bridges said.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.000
He's a neurologist.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.170
He's not in the military.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.000
He'd keep it private.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.580
Mr. Calder, you have
a serious brain injury.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.000
I was shot in the hand.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.670
Your hand isn't the problem.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.750
The level of brain bruising
and bleeding you suffered

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.580
is excessive.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.830
My guess is this wasn't
your first concussion.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.080
We're done here.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.580
The next one could be fatal.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.920
Maybe not immediately.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.330
You could feel the
effects the next day,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.330
or the next week, or next year.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.960
But you will feel the effects.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.790
There's something
I need to tell you.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.500
No matter what happens to
you, no matter where you go,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.880
I will kill you.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.380
You will pay for what you did.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.960
You memorize the
number I gave you?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.210
Tell them you used
this to escape.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.540
It's unloaded.

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.170
You have two rounds.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.170
You got 10 seconds to get
the [muted] out of here

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.380
before I shoot you.

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.540
[music playing]
