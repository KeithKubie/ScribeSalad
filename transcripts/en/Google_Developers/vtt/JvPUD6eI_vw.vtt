Hi, Greg

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:08.699
Hi, GDC attendees

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.000
You're looking great today.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.830
So I'm here with Ben from the
Google Play Game Services Team

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.080
and we're going to be
playing a multiplayer game

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.724
of Beach Buggy Racing

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:18.834
But we only have one controller

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:20.530
and a whole bunch of Android phones

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.509
So Ben, how we're going
to make this work?

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.755
So fortunately, the developer
of "Beach Buggy Racing" factory unite

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.645
has implemented something called
a nearby connections API

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:32.220
That allows us to connect our
Android devices to the Android TV

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.510
and use them as controllers

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.570
And it's broadcasting a signal
behind the scenes saying,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.385
"Hey, all the phones nearby,
I'm available to connect"

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.149
And now, the race begins!

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.599
- Go, go, go!
- I press power!

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.680
So I've noticed now 
that we've started playing...

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.800
your phone has changed!
What's going on here?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.320
As my hands tilt back and forth

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.090
you can tell that
an accelerometer now

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.940
is being used to drive

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.030
But more importantly, there's a couple
of really neat things that are going on...

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.595
that I can do now 
with an Android device as a controller

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:07.630
that are difficult to do
with a standard controller

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.640
And so the first thing is there's these
extra annotations on the screen here

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.430
like in the upper right-hand corner

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.620
you can see I have
this Nitrous booster icon

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.630
which I can press.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.380
Then on the left-hand side,
I've got my special powers

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.530
We've got some brake
pads down at the bottom.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.060
So I can take these
corners a little better

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.890
And of course, there's some animated dials
in the middle

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.630
indicating how fast I'm going

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.810
- Let's play again!
- All right

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.440
We're going to do a rematch here.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.320
Greg, we're going to let you take over.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.000
- Bye, Masconi!
- Ciao!
