00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.585
[music playing]

00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:04.129
NARRATOR: The use of
such enormous blocks

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.715
is the main reason many of
these ancient structures,

00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:12.429
like the walls at Thera,
have survived until today.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.224
But why was it so important that
they remain standing thousands

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:20.019
of years into the future?

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.232
There was an architect here
who had complete understanding

00:00:24.232 --> 00:00:27.068
of stone, of
masonry, and that you

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.196
can do extraordinary things with
it that would last a lifetime

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.199
and forever.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.495
Not only did they actually build
things which were guaranteed

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:42.417
to last, often they're
working with unusual angles,

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:45.879
and they're so tightly fitted,
that earthquakes find it very

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.589
difficult to break them apart.

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.340
In fact, they are
earthquake-proof.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.390
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorists point out

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.351
that other common design
elements were incorporated

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.395
in structures
throughout the world

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:07.859
to ensure their longevity,
including the widespread use

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.863
of metal braces inserted
into keystone cuts

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:15.158
to reinforce ancient
constructions.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:20.288
This unusual way of
fitting large stones together

00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:22.665
is found in ancient Egypt.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.001
It's found in ancient Ethiopia.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.297
It is found in India and
Greece, and in Italy.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:32.550
It is found at Angkor
Wat in Cambodia.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.805
It's found at the
Composites in Vietnam.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:42.769
And we find it in Peru, at
Ollantaytambo, and at Cuzco.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:49.150
And we see it also at Tiwanaku
and Puma Punku in Bolivia.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.362
FREDDY SILVA: The two stones
essentially have a channel dug

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.782
in between them, and there's
a certain slot into which

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:58.117
is poured molten metal.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:01:59.786
Now, this brings up
all kinds of questions,

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.913
because, one, alloys
were not supposed

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:05.583
to have been discovered
until about 2,500 BC.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:09.003
The fact that these stones
go back to at least 13,000

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.506
BC creates a huge problem.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.509
We have here, again, sheer
technology crossing huge span

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.971
of time in order to make sure
that the stones never ever

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:18.513
fall apart.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:25.520
Now, people working on
different sides of the world,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.565
trying to build similar
things, are not necessarily

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.151
going to think of the
same way to build it,

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.863
in certain respects.

00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:37.949
The similarities in the way
some of the stones were cut,

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.870
the keystone, other factors
that people wouldn't necessarily

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.374
think of, for them to show up,
and for them to be used to give

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:49.168
greater duration to
these structures,

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:51.796
way beyond any
reasonable expectation

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:55.341
that the people living then were
going to continue to use these,

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.720
tells us that there's somebody
maybe with a longer time span

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.931
was behind the design
of these things.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.267
Whoever was behind the
design wanted these things

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:08.104
to last a really long time.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:12.567
Who were the teachers of
these engineering styles?

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:16.404
The only conclusion
there is is that aliens

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:21.451
had a hand in these
creations a long time ago.

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:24.412
They're all human made,
but with the assistance

00:03:24.412 --> 00:03:28.583
or the technology provided
by extraterrestrials.
