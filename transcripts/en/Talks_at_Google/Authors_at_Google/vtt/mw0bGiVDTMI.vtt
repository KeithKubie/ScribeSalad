00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.830
SPEAKER: Now I'm very excited
to welcome to Google Mark Z.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.110
Danielewski.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.874
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:11.670
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Hello.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.690
I thought I would read a
couple of short passages

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.660
from the familiar Volume
Three, and then we

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.360
can talk, have a conversation.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.700
If no one wants to talk
or have a conversation,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.580
I have plenty to
read here, so we

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.509
could fill the hour that way.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.610
Some of you know this
is a 27-volume novel

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.130
about a little girl
who finds a cat.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.810
And to avoid spoilers, I'm
going to read a little bit

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.970
from Xanther's
father's perspective,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.010
and then-- actually, from
Xanther's mother's perspective,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.570
and then I will
read a little bit

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.420
from her father's perspective.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.190
So Astair is up
in a place called

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.140
Oceanica, where she is
training to be a therapist,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.250
and she's in a class.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.180
"'Is good thinking
terrifying?' Sandra D. Taylor,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.540
their doula of Oceanica, asks
a room of 70 on Saturday,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.060
August 9.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.560
'Good thinking, I
like to think, is.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.740
And I like to think about
it a great deal, too.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.730
Though whether I manage any of
it is another story completely,

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.420
contested perhaps too
frequently by my grandchildren,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.940
and gratefully by you.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.040
Good thinking, I like to
think, is hard thinking.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.680
And what makes hard thinking?'
Again, a genuine question.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.680
'Consider this definition.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.370
Hard thinking is
when we don't merely

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.310
apply preexisting rationales
to routine patterns.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.450
For example, in the
way we might observe

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.940
events, note interactions,
evaluate emotional responses.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.220
But instead acquire
a completely new set

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.180
of values and parameters to
reencounter and reinterpret

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.080
these common events,
interactions,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.040
emotional responses.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.450
'That's then one model
for hard thinking.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.090
Hard because acquiring a new
set of values is hard work.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.750
But is it terrifying?'
Astair has an answer,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.790
but not the confidence
to voice it.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.740
Her hangover isn't helping.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.070
'Because our sense of
self, our identity--"

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.200
Did Sandra D. Just stare
directly at Astair?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.650
Even linger there?

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.600
'Frequently find stabilization,
if not outright resolution,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.910
in rationales inculcated
at an early age.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.410
Examples, please.'

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.050
Hands shoot up,
though not Astair's,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.110
followed by a clatter of voices.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.660
'Catholicism,' 'Mormonism,'
'Judaism,' 'Islam,' 'party

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.830
affiliation,' 'sexual
orientation,' 'racial bias,'

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.240
'scientific method,' 'trbal
ritual,' 'taboo.' 'Good.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.570
Religious rubrics, political
praxis, clan morals,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.480
parental jurisprudence,
gender habits.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.860
A long list, as we can
all agree, incomplete.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.570
Changing any of those
modes of engagement

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.080
must necessitate a departure
from the original self, which

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.990
by the renegotiation can go so
far as to displace the self.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.310
'And whether the
response is fatigue--

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.010
getting drowsy-- or boredom--
getting antsy-- or anger--

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.420
getting just that-- that is
most certainly terrifying.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.690
Though isn't the
alternative worse?

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.370
To live many lives in heaven.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.340
Hell is not to live even one.'

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.310
And that's just the beginning
Sandra D. Taylor speaks

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.290
for another 90 minutes, though
today for some reason Astair

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.910
stops taking notes.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.420
There is a difference between
work that is constructive

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.570
and work that is compulsion.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.100
Note the difference.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.160
Beware the consequences
of not noting.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.830
Working hard is not
the same as hard work.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.370
Good work, good thinking,
even good living-- this

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.274
is what we pursue.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.390
Which Astair remembers
perfectly, she thinks.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.885
Even if her hand collapses
into some private,

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:29.190
inkless fugue of heaviness.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.010
Her lids also engage
in the same heaviness,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.050
even as some kind of
internal lid begins to open.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.730
Somehow Sandra D.'s
talk demands it.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.740
She says things like, 'Life
would be so wonderful if we

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.680
only knew what to do with it.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.110
But why wonder?

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.180
Remember, no choice is
rendered any less significant

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.650
or impactful if made with
an even greater application

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.460
of kindness.'

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.860
Or, 'Think before you act,
then act without thinking.' Or,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.560
'To find yourself again, go find
yourself in this world where

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.510
you are not of this world.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.390
In other words, see new
places, meet new faces,

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.100
travel.' That one earns
much laughter and applause,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.790
as many of her remarks do.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.560
'Why keep escaping
from what makes us us?

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.430
As we are in a vocation
rooted in feelings,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.250
let us not forget that
immaturity is frequently

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.610
reflected in the belief
that strong feelings ratify

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.500
every action.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.290
In other words, and to be
prescriptive, let us be mature.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.480
Remember, you future counselors
and bringers of relief,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.270
there will never be a
cure for life's problems,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.430
because so many of tomorrow's
problems will be new.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.240
Good words like good
work and good thinking

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.330
help, even if good words are
a lot like highway paint--

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.400
they can keep plenty
of heavy things moving

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.450
at 70 miles per hour
from going the wrong way,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.020
but that doesn't mean life
won't cross over if it has to.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.050
Learn to avoid the collisions.'

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.630
'Find other directions.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.060
Often a new yes is the best no.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.370
Life lived well doesn't get
easier, but it does get better.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.800
Learn to let things go by,
and don't be reluctant.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.200
Life is always surpassing us by.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:50.110
Enjoy it.'"

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.160
This is from
Anwar's perspective.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.340
They are at a baseball game.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.870
"Far below, a dodger,
number 10, swings his bat.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.760
Even up here, the sound of
that wallop reaches them.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.750
Anwar and Xanther rise
together with the whole stadium

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.150
it seems-- their
sections, at least.

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.170
Everyone's cheering.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.940
Xanther and Anwar
sure are cheering.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.400
It feels good.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.250
The ball flies deep
into left field,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.790
and with the peculiar magic of
a home run, seems to keep going,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.070
during the night sky.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.410
Xanther jumps up and down,
excitedly waving her Dodgers

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.470
hat, up on her seat, until
she jumps into Anwar's arms

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.282
with such big, excited hug.

00:07:40.282 --> 00:07:43.880
And Anwar, lifting Xanther
up, holding her tight,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.900
is suddenly missing his mother.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.420
Out of nowhere, terribly,
she comes upon him

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.340
with all she ever
was-- her smile,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.530
her kindness, her goodness.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.640
How Anwar would have loved
to have seen Fatima here,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.130
now with Xanther.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.540
Would they have hugged too?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.920
What would they have
said to each other later?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.350
How would they have
teased and laughed

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.010
and sparred, together wondered?

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.920
Do we miss not only the
past, but every feature

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.210
the lost past describes?

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.070
Is that just the nature
of missing, all the lost

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.830
might-have-beens?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:25.070
The certainty that those
uncertain futures are gone.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.620
If we can't embrace uncertainty,
do we miss the point of love?

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.390
Thank you.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.809
SPEAKER: So one of the
reasons I'm particularly

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:39.600
excited to have
you here at Google

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.740
is that-- you don't
really get a sense of it

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.130
from that Anwar section,
but there's actually

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:49.180
a lot of programmers and tech
people in "The Familiar".

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.170
I was just interested
what it was

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.060
like writing for the voices
of programmers and the tech

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.717
industry, whether you did any
sort of research for that?

00:08:56.717 --> 00:08:57.800
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Sure.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.080
Well, one of the things is
that like, "House of Leaves"

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.130
is all about film, and
"Only Revolutions" is really

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.770
about music, and "The
Fifty Year Sword"

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.300
is about the campfire
tale, the oral tale.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.870
"The Familiar" is very much
about a television series.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.760
So every five volumes
makes up one season,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.320
and there's a little
extra at the end.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.720
And very much like
a television series,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.180
it requires a great
deal of people.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.570
So if you turn to the back
of any of the volumes,

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.390
you'll see a long
list of credits.

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.320
And that includes
engineers and people

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.180
that I've been-- that I reach
out to, to discuss code,

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.330
to discuss the environment
of tech companies.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.980
And a lot of the book is about
getting outside of myself,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.160
you know, of moving beyond that
authorial need to say, "I, I,"

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.310
all the time, and really
embrace-- empathize,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:57.191
if you will-- mind read what a
very different perspective is

00:09:57.191 --> 00:09:57.690
like.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.810
So Anwar is
originally from Egypt,

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.590
and that history is slowly
beginning to open in the book.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.992
But he's also a game developer.

00:10:06.992 --> 00:10:10.150
And so it's really been great
hanging around with gamers,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.220
hanging around with people
that are seeking VC money

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:21.140
to develop their latest
bit of entertainment.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.290
But the fun part is that, as
I'm sure everyone in this room

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.740
can relate to, programmers
aren't just programmers.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.730
They have a wonderful
sense of the world,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.180
of the philosophical challenges.

00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:40.860
And so as I begin
to sort of describe

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:42.760
what Anwar is up
against, and what

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.630
is beginning to change his
life, that sort of influences

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.590
the conversation.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.670
So the coding then
begins to take

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.840
on a certain vocabulary that
is more than just functional,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.550
it can have a symbolic value.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.660
So even if we're
commenting out something,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.360
those things can
not only resonate

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.270
on a sort of a literary
level, but they can also

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:13.160
contain obscure codes that
need to be sort of rendered

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.220
in a different way.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.040
And if they are, if they
are looked at with that eye,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.490
they can reveal more things.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.337
Not only about the code,
but about the story itself.

00:11:22.337 --> 00:11:24.920
SPEAKER: I'm going to have to
go back and reread some of those

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.790
now.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.000
But in addition to
the tech characters,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.210
there's also a lot of other ways
that technology finds itself

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.260
into the way a lot of
the sections of the book

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.210
are presented.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.280
It can be introductory material.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.070
We've seen sort of like a
YouTube video slowly playing

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.570
out.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.460
We see parts of the
book told sort of

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.350
through messaging applications.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.475
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Right.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:48.300
SPEAKER: So I'm interested
if the technology around us

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.710
today you feel
influences the way

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.455
you want to present
stories as a writer,

00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:53.830
if it influences
the way you want

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.027
to communicate as a writer?

00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:56.110
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Sure.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.750
I think it's-- I think my
attention has always been

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.040
there.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.350
When "House of Leaves" came out,
there was very little emphasis

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:10.940
in the at least formal literary
world on typography and image

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.450
and graphics.

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.420
And yet that's something
that was already happening.

00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:22.150
It preceded Instagram,
and Flickr, and Tumblr,

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.650
and all these things that
were sort of image-based.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.360
And I think I grew
up in a time where

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.750
I watched this amazing,
kaleidoscopic shatter

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.720
of platforms that
one could invest

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.500
their creative or
social energies.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.610
And I think the thing
that's exciting,

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:43.090
even though people have
their own domain, really,

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.250
of where they hang
out digitally,

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.290
they also sort of like to
experience other areas.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.890
And those areas begin to kind
of influence their personality.

00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:57.940
So the book itself encompasses
various perspectives

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.425
that aren't merely just
these characters, but also

00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:03.950
the voice of technology
itself, the voice

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.480
of these various applications.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.650
Whether it's the coding
within certain chapters,

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.130
or like you pointed out,
these YouTube moments.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.150
They begin to sort of
create in one place

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:23.300
the sound of all of these
different views and voices

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.685
and hieroglyphs, I
guess, coming together.

00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:26.560
SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.320
Neat.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.120
By the way, if anyone
has any questions

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.140
they'd like to ask Mark, we've
got two microphones set up

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:32.970
in the aisles.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.150
You're free to line
up there if there's

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.080
anything you want to know.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.890
We can keep chatting
in the meantime.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.660
So this is maybe more of an
abstract connection to Google,

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.660
but our mission is sort of all
about information, organizing

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.860
information and
collecting information.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.720
And the way you
write your books,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.660
there's a higher information
density than in typical books.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.600
You find a way to
incorporate more information

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.420
on a word-by-word,
page-by-page basis.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:03.920
Almost in the sense
that each book,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.864
you have to learn to
read it in a new way.

00:14:06.864 --> 00:14:08.530
Are you thinking
about, as you write it,

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.170
how someone is going to learn
to take in the information

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.630
that you're putting down,
that sort of learning process?

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.130
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI:
Yeah, actually,

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.110
and that's something I did
from the very beginning.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.140
In "House of Leaves" it was
sort of seen unapproachable.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.210
But in fact, the way
the typography works

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.510
is there's a didactic
element, that it slowly

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.570
teaches the reader how
to embrace these turns

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.310
and changes.

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:40.000
And then by the end, the reader
is fluent in that language.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.760
The same is true for
"Only Revolutions".

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.350
If you read it slowly and try to
read it like "House of Leaves",

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.990
or any other book,
you'll be miserable.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.769
But if you embrace the speed
that Sam and Haley move

00:14:50.769 --> 00:14:52.310
through history,
and read it quickly,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.250
then you begin to
play that music,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.150
and you begin to hear it.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.230
"The Familiar" is very similar.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.310
People struggle a
bit with Volume One.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.730
And I was very surprised
on this book tour,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:08.230
because here this 880-page book
just came out on June 14th,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.710
and every city I went to,
those who'd read One and Two

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.330
had ripped through Volume Three
in like two days, because they

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.540
had already learned how to
read it, and it moved quickly.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.470
There was enough familiarity
there, if you will,

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.240
that they could process
it much more rapidly.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.250
And that's always been
the point, in a way,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.940
is that every novel
requires an investment

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.650
of initial imagining.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.110
Probably like any
platform, in a way,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.240
establishing this foundation.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.230
And that takes a lot of work.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:46.280
But once that's there, then
you can move much more quickly

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.460
and adeptly around themes.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.577
And so that's very
exciting, to see that work.

00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:51.160
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.700
And now that you're
on Volume Three--

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.010
and you've written ahead, right?

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.730
So you've sort of--

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.938
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Four
is being proofed right now.

00:15:56.938 --> 00:15:59.610
It will be finalized
by September 15th.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.610
And then I get married
on September 17th.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.670
It's going to be an
intense couple of months,

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.240
let me tell you.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.212
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:09.280
So do you find that your
approach to writing now,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.290
as the series has
progressed, has

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.500
changed from the first book?

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.334
Are you sort of learning
more about the story itself,

00:16:16.334 --> 00:16:18.250
or has it sort of all
been plotted out already

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.702
and in stone?

00:16:19.702 --> 00:16:22.160
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Well, I
started work on "The Familiar"

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.310
in 2006, even though
there are many things that

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:30.470
even predate "House of Leaves".

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:36.470
But Volume One, for example,
had 100,000 words cut out of it.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.980
So that's basically two
Great Gatsby's, you know?

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.560
And Volume Two was probably
about 60,000 or 50,000

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.240
that were cut.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.700
And this one, you know, 30,000.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:49.500
It would be great if I could
get it just right, but you know.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.510
Yeah, it's a learning process.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.340
Some things come easier,
then some things are harder.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:17:00.050
Some of those details or whatnot
that need to be enhanced,

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.920
researched more, or whatnot.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.510
But it's an exciting process,
as familiar as it all

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.430
is, it's still 10 years out.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.594
And there's all
sorts of changes.

00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:14.510
I think Google is kind
of is involved in that?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.450
Isn't it about information,
preservation, the Long Now

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.200
movement?

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.950
Is that what it's called?

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.040
Anyone familiar with that?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.619
Just how do we
preserve information

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:29.410
that can be viewed 10,000
years from now, or 100,000.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:30.550
How will it be read?

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:37.270
And how can we prepare for
even an extraterrestrial

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.920
intelligence?

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.200
Even if that is our
intelligence that's radically

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.610
changed in thousands of years.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:51.170
SPEAKER: Yeah, and I guess kind
of along with that, a new way

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.470
that your novels are
now being preserved

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.780
is through e-book format.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.700
Which if someone were
to name any author who

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.990
I said their books could
never be done as an e-book,

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.180
you're probably right
at the top of that list.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.789
So why was that choice made?

00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:06.580
Or what was interesting
to you about trying

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.227
to adapt these things
into e-book format?

00:18:10.227 --> 00:18:11.810
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI:
Well, it's also--

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.560
part of it's an exploration.

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.210
I've backed a little away
from turning just-- creating

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.457
sort of enhanced versions.

00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:22.790
Because it's such a lot of work.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:24.164
And I've often
said that it would

00:18:24.164 --> 00:18:27.000
be great to have
directors who were really

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.990
responsible for transforming
books into electronic versions,

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.850
because it's its own art form.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.920
There's many ways that
one can present it.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.520
The e-book for all
of these volumes

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.690
is exactly what the
page is, so there's

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.540
no-- there hasn't been any
sort of radical modifications.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:53.480
But as I understand it,
even with that availability,

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.300
it's a small percentage
of readers who tackle

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.610
"The Familiar" on an iPad.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.510
People like the book.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.600
They like the technology
of what's there.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.665
I mean even as I was
doing various readings,

00:19:05.665 --> 00:19:07.290
people would come up
and they would go,

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.530
I know where you were.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.160
I knew it was an Anwar chapter.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.110
I know what Anwar's
dog-ear colors are,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:15.720
so I could approximate
and find the place.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.640
And so they've
already learned how

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.510
to use the book to quickly
move, to navigate through it.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.680
And that's also exciting.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.670
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.530
It was very interesting hearing
that, both of those chapters

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.830
read out, Anwar and
Astair's, verbally.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.560
Because on the page,
things are set up

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.502
very differently than you
hear them as they're read.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.350
I've also-- I read stuff online.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.390
It seems like it's been one
of the hotly debated topics

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.860
of the book, is
sort of the nesting

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.530
of the parentheses and stuff.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.806
So I'm interested where
that idea came from,

00:19:53.806 --> 00:19:56.430
what interested you about seeing
these thoughts within thoughts

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.240
within thoughts?

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.364
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Right.

00:19:58.364 --> 00:20:03.870
So Astair's thoughts are nested
with all these parentheses.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.700
It's very difficult to write.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.030
And Anwar's are nested with all
sorts of-- with some computer

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:12.010
coding, but also
a lot of brackets.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.250
But they're similar
in many ways.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.720
They're a
hyper-intellectual couple,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.720
and they want-- or their
children carry that out

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.990
to a certain degree.

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.620
But at the same time,
they're also restrained.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.100
So it's about how
thoughts can get caged,

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.030
how they can open cages
by becoming more specific.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.210
And when readers
first encounter it,

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.130
they're like, oh,
this is a nightmare.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.090
And then they hear me read an
Astair bit, and they're like,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:50.370
oh, all those parentheses
are just commas.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:53.700
It's like, that's the
way she experiences

00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:00.340
those momentary pauses,
but another person

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.970
may just experience what could
be a total meltdown of thinking

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:07.040
as just a pause, as a breath.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.870
SPEAKER: Any questions from
you Googlers out there?

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.416
Oh, cool.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.739
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:22.780
So I didn't realize when
I started reading Volume

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.520
One that it was 27 volumes.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.940
Maybe I just skipped over that.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.910
And it sort of
quixotically, maybe-- I

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.610
think that is the
right word-- now

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:35.490
makes me want to
read all of them

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:41.170
more, because I know that
when Volume Three is over

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.970
there's still 24 left, right?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.550
So that's exciting.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.710
I've also noticed, because
I read a lot of books,

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.640
and I shop for a
lot of books-- I do

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.350
tend to use an
application on the iPad

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:57.800
to do it-- that that seems
like a direction that

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.255
is more commercially viable
these days, to sort of-- you

00:22:01.255 --> 00:22:04.120
know, you're looking through
the best-sellers on Amazon

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.120
or whatever, in the e-book
section, and about half of them

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.880
will say like, Book Two of
the Shadow Pets Tetralogy,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.700
or whatever.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.750
So I'm just curious how
much of your motivation

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:24.160
was commercial, or is
it purely ambitious?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.430
Just like a desire to make
something that's really huge,

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.584
or what went into that?

00:22:28.584 --> 00:22:30.000
How did you know
that it was going

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.110
to be 27 books, et cetera?

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.650
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI:
Great question.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:37.950
I did-- I mean again, I was
working on this in 2006.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.160
I started wearing cat t-shirts.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.320
Cats were not that
popular online, you know?

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.740
I was envisioning this
long, long series.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.220
The series hadn't
really taken hold yet

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:54.090
the way-- "The Sopranos"
was sort of in the air,

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.690
and then "The Wire" was coming.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:23:00.410
But now we have
just all stations

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.040
are flooded with these
kind of chaser series.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.300
So I'm either right on time,
or I'm a little too late.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.560
We'll see.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.430
But you can't undertake
a book like this,

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:17.970
which really is
without precedent--

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.760
I mean you can point
to serial novels,

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.050
you can point to series--
but a book that embraces

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.070
a real-time pacing
and that is set out

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.960
with a very specific
narrative arc-- it's not

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:37.260
a performative bit of
invention-- is very risky,

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:37.780
really.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.770
Because the series, like
a television series,

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.844
could get canceled
at any moment.

00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:47.010
But what really holds me
is I love these characters.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.270
I love this family.

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.260
I love the story.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.870
I love giving voice to
those who I don't know,

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.230
and getting to know them.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.590
And then moving
beyond voice to begin

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:04.560
to allow into the sphere of the
way we understand the world,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.700
the way the world
understands itself.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.900
The conversation between
storm fronts and mountain

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.680
ranges, where is
that in how we live.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.600
We can't be blinded
constantly by ourselves.

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.800
And as soon as you
really open up,

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.490
when you let these
walls dissolve

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.430
into the atomic
miracle that it is,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.030
that we can be so aware
of it momentarily,

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.275
then 27 volumes
seems pretty paltry.

00:24:35.302 --> 00:24:36.510
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:42.025
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:24:42.025 --> 00:24:43.110
It's a quick question.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.540
So before-- this goes back to,
I guess, "House of Leaves",

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.289
and I think you just
answered the question

00:24:47.289 --> 00:24:49.800
that I had in my mind just
now for "The Familiar".

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.130
But early on, before I actually
read "House of Leaves",

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.230
I had heard the book described
as one of the scariest books

00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:58.317
ever written.

00:24:58.317 --> 00:25:00.150
So I went into it with
that sort of mindset.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.380
And I'm curious as to if
that was your intention,

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.880
or what was the mood that you
were trying to convey when you

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.379
were writing that book, or when
you thought the reader would

00:25:07.379 --> 00:25:08.790
actually absorb it?

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:09.840
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Do
you remember who told you

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.170
it was the scariest book?

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.420
AUDIENCE: It was on some online
thread, probably on Reddit.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.900
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: We have
to wonder about that person.

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:25.020
The book is designed,
I guess, to give room--

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.670
to provide room for
the reader's fears.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:32.570
So really, it's-- I meet
people who were just very happy

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.930
in that house,
and I thought, oh,

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.720
you're really happy
with yourself.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.650
So in many ways, as with all
my books, it's really about,

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:47.260
where is the reader's
place in this relationship?

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.440
And I think as much as there
is something scary about "House

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.382
of Leaves", it is
really about a journey.

00:25:56.382 --> 00:25:58.090
And I'll tell you,
one of the things that

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:05.540
just keeps coming up, and it is
strange and kind of wonderful,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.720
is that I get so many
notes from people

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.130
who have been going
through hard times

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.670
and find that this book
offers them relief.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.520
People who've actually
tried to kill themselves,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.850
and said that this
book offered them

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.640
a way through the darkness.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:27.000
So I think maybe the
intention-- and it's

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.840
complicated to talk
about an intention

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.660
when you worked on something for
so long, that is so complex--

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:38.150
but it was actually about
that, the journey of the self,

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.975
and how we do
parse the darkness.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.050
And yeah, so I think of--
I think of all my books,

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:54.230
but they're like my
children, and they grow up,

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.540
and they have these
very intimate relations

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.210
with strangers.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.140
And I'm like the dad, and
I've got to kind of stay out

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.860
of the picture, because no
one wants the dad hanging out.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.960
I think one of the best
compliments I ever got

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:12.400
was there was a class in
the Midwest, I think it was,

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.840
and it was, Faulkner,
David Foster Wallace,

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.270
and "House of Leaves".

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.150
And that was great, you know?

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.110
I don't need to be
in that picture.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.450
And so the relationship that
people have with the book

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:34.130
is what I'm proud of, and
so I think it's a good kid.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:39.760
So you know, I'm sorry it
scared your online friend,

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.480
but maybe he or she needed it.

00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:45.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.850
I had a question
about mechanics.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:51.260
I know "House of Leaves"
comes with a set of mechanics

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.120
that you learn as you read
through it, one being like,

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.835
trust the footnotes that they're
not going to misguide you,

00:27:56.835 --> 00:27:58.730
you'll find your way back.

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.060
And you even mention with "Only
Revolutions" the speed of it,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.660
getting you into the story.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.162
As somebody who's not yet
dove into "The Familiar",

00:28:07.162 --> 00:28:08.620
is there some advice
that you could

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.500
give on the mechanics of
actually reading the book?

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.250
And as a slight
follow-up to that,

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:15.940
I know "Only Revolutions" had
a lot of fun little Easter

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:20.290
eggs that were stuck in, word
count per page kind of thing.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.520
Are there some Easter
eggs for "The Familiar"

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.420
that a new reader
should look out for?

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.490
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI:
Great question.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.090
You know I'm not
going to answer it.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:32.140
Why would I want to deprive you
of all that fun of uncovering

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:33.560
the mechanics for yourself?

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.690
I mean we've got 27 volumes.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.830
We might as well just sort
of settle back and go, huh,

00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:40.750
wait a minute,
maybe Volume Four,

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.300
suddenly there's a
certain kind of symmetry

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.980
that presents itself, and
then you figure that out.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.590
If I were Will
Shortz-- and I'm not--

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.760
I wouldn't be up here telling
you all those answers.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.330
But let's just
say that you won't

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.630
be disappointed if you look.

00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:07.640
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
earlier about working

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.160
with a lot of other
people on the book,

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.970
and just what that
collaboration was like.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:12.519
But I know on
"House of Leaves" it

00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:14.810
was a different kind of
collaboration with your sister,

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.172
how her music overlapped
the book and the book

00:29:17.172 --> 00:29:18.110
overlapped the music.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.040
So I'm wondering what
that process was like,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.664
and whether you had any plans to
do something similar like that

00:29:22.664 --> 00:29:23.620
with "The Familiar".

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.745
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Right.

00:29:27.216 --> 00:29:31.200
When we were working
together, it seemed obvious

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.320
that we would do that forever.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.450
I mean it was so incredible
how everything aligned.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.902
She was working on
her CD, "Haunted",

00:29:39.902 --> 00:29:41.360
I was working on
"House of Leaves".

00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:47.540
She would read parts, and that
would influence her music.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.894
I would listen to
her tracks and that

00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:52.310
would influence
"House of Leaves",

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:55.730
and it went back and forth,
very much like the Escher hands

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:57.120
drawing each other.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.180
Some people say that
"Haunted" is Poe's soundtrack

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.535
to "House of Leaves".

00:30:02.535 --> 00:30:04.520
That is not at all correct.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.630
It was as much a progenetor
as it was an offspring.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:14.180
We were both in this
curious, creative orbit.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.110
And it was fantastic.

00:30:18.442 --> 00:30:20.650
Even the way they
were both finished,

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.220
that came out at the
same time, in essence,

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.970
that they were launched
in the same way.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.511
I mean I don't even
know if you could

00:30:26.511 --> 00:30:31.180
launch a musical work like
hers in the same way today.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.500
It was a different industry.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.960
Like a book, the CD
came out, and then there

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.900
was a tour, and all of that.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.960
And it was really special.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.890
It would be amazing to do
something like that again,

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.030
but who knows.

00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:51.930
To get all those stars
to line is complicated.

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.220
And I guess we got a
little sense of it,

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.850
and I hope this doesn't
happen at Google,

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.510
but my book had just
come out in Japan.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:07.230
And I think it was maybe
a-- it was a smaller house,

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.660
but it was owned by Sony.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.590
And her CD was being
released by Sony.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.170
So this was a perfect
opportunity for Sony

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.680
just to take a look at
both these works in Japan.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.052
They could not coordinate that.

00:31:22.052 --> 00:31:23.750
It was so strange.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.600
It was this huge
company that kind of

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.560
couldn't get one hand to
interact with the other.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.700
And I think that's just the
reality, just where our lives

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.150
are and what we're
pursuing, to actually get

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.770
all of that to align.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.500
But she did have
some tracks that

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.920
were very influential
on "Only Revolutions",

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.840
and if she releases
them one day,

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.820
then there might
be that little aha

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.000
moment for readers out
there, when they go,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.550
oh, that's where he got that.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.740
She really is the
smart one, isn't she?

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:03.560
SPEAKER: Anyone else?

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.060
Awesome.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.050
Well, Mark, maybe
before we wrap up,

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:09.077
do you have time for one more
passage from "The Familiar"?

00:32:09.077 --> 00:32:10.160
MARK Z. DANIELEWSKI: Yeah.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.951
I was almost thinking
I should reread them.

00:32:11.951 --> 00:32:14.112
It was such a disaster.

00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:16.800
You could edit it, or something.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.635
Yeah, let's read another one.

00:32:18.635 --> 00:32:19.260
SPEAKER: Great.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.250
All right.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:24.166
One last passage from Mark
Danielewski, everyone.

00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:26.562
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:42.220
"Astair doesn't even realize
how tight her chest has gotten--

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.930
like a man's fist,
she imagines--

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.590
until she steps outside.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.540
Something about the
dinginess offends her.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.930
Astair isn't even thinking of
the jeans and the boxers hucked

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:56.900
over the hair-matted sofa, or
the muddy boots on the coffee

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.200
table.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.220
She's thinking about all of it.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.770
The stink, for sure.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.390
For sure.

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.040
"She sneezes now twice more.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.180
Her throat itches.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.570
Eyes, too.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.280
Allergies?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.290
"Still better than the
way she felt inside.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.050
Flushed, envious.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.300
Something's at her feet.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.940
Can she even call it a cat?

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.390
What a grizzled thing.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.140
Gray with just a glint
of green in one eye.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.640
The other eye is marble white.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.340
Ick.

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.511
"The ear above the ick?

00:33:26.511 --> 00:33:27.010
Ick.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.050
It's no more than
a hole surrounded

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:31.320
by spidery threads of flesh.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.740
The whole left side is
nothing more than a few tufts

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.950
of ashen hair, except where
there is no hair at all.

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.080
A substantial trench
digs alongside the spine

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.450
through the ribs and
down into the rear flank,

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.210
rendering a back
leg pretty useless.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.820
The tail is just gone.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.840
"Nonetheless, this
tortured thing rubs

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:53.940
against Astair's ankle,
even after she recoils.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.260
Its mew, or is a purr, a harsh
grate of improbable survival,

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.210
only stops when nearby--
very nearby, just up the hill

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:07.050
crowned in brush-- something
else unleashes its thunder.

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:12.600
"Astair feels gripped
by the bones, the teeth.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.050
'What the fuck was that?' What
Astair has every intention

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.870
of asking Kochelle as she's
letting herself through the big

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:24.100
gate, only to freeze at the
sight of the three Australian

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.929
shepherds, Gus and
Vito and Juneau,

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.239
frozen before that
last big cage.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.620
Something about that
cage now beginning

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.790
to dawn on Astair, along
with, 'Where is Kochelle?

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.530
Where is Xanther?'

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.639
"Dark shapes moving inside.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.500
Way, way bigger than dogs.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.150
Not dogs at all.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:45.040
Astair is sprinting,
breath quickening,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.030
already breathing way too hard,
until she's not even breathing.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.040
Another fist in her chest, this
one of a much different kind,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.750
as Astair reaches the fencing
to discover yellow eyes

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.880
and swirls of black
fur, and teeth clicking

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.250
in a low guttural growls.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:01.450
Wolves, five of them.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.060
And all circling frantically,
and shaking their heads,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.990
repeatedly lunging
out suddenly to snap,

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:11.580
before withdrawing just as
fast to continue circling.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.380
"And the center of
their attention?

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.510
The object of these attacks?

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.570
Her baby girl, sitting
cross-legged, alone.

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.950
Until adrenaline sharpens
Astair's perceptions--

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.750
Kochelle's in there,
too, with a baton,

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.580
but cornered by
the biggest wolf.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.705
"No, not the biggest.

00:35:26.705 --> 00:35:29.770
The biggest has just clamped
its jaws on her daughter's arm,

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.870
twisting to rip it away, rip
it off, tear Xanther apart.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.980
'Mom!' Xanther cries.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.200
"Which is when
everything goes messy.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.820
Adrenaline misplaced,
gushing for nowhere now,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.580
against conflicting
sights and tones.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.490
Saliva returns to
Astair's mouth.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:49.100
The beating in her chest slows
as her body starts to relax,

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.810
even if her mind persists in
trying to command all of her

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.690
to keep tensing, tense still
more, do something more.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:55.800
Dammit.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.780
"'Mom,' Xanther cries again.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.300
'Come in!' Kochelle
looks just as happy.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.620
That second biggest
wolf before her,

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.170
a blur of charcoal
and snow, has just

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.570
rolled over, wanting something
from Kochelle-- to play with?

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.190
While the biggest
wolf with Xanther,

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.220
a blonde billow of heavy
shoulders and bright eyes,

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.020
continues to rip away at
what's only a frayed blanket,

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.830
red, which Xanther
playfully withholds until,

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.790
overpowered, she lets
go with a squeal.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:24.830
'Aren't they amazing?'

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.010
"They are.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.400
But they think
she's more amazing.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.400
Kochelle notices it,
too, especially when

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.770
Xanther stands up.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.940
Immediately Kochelle's
attendant, attendant wolf

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.290
wheels around to
rejoin the pack, fallen

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.180
behind the blonde alpha, who
pays no mind to the rest,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.730
paying close attention only
to every move Xanther's

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.280
12-year-old makes.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.110
"Only Xanther is
oblivious, practically

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:49.160
skipping across the cage
to meet Astair at the gate.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.470
The blonde alpha drops
his prized blanket

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.670
to keep close to Xanther-- too
close-- teeth nearly knicking

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.410
those fragile heels, even as the
pack hangs back, if still tuned

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.560
to the flitting motion
of Xanther's hands,

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.460
her bobbing head
and dancing knees,

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:07.780
as if they soon might earn
some anticipated reward.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.990
"'She's special,'
Kochelle says later,

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.000
after Xanther goes off
to find the bathroom.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.890
'I'm partial,' Astair
responds, her practiced tone

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:18.280
of neutrality in effect.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.250
'You start together,' Kochelle
continues in her tone leaking

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.870
with confession,
or just curiosity.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:25.620
"'That's the way you're
supposed to start,

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.200
because I mean they know me.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.760
And then you sit
down so you're lower

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.039
than them, or the same
height but not higher,

00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:32.830
which would make you
maybe more leader-ish,

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:34.712
and definitely more
of an outsider.

00:37:34.712 --> 00:37:36.170
But when you're
down low, then they

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.600
treat you like part of the pack.

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.510
And they come around
and sniff you, and even

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:41.600
pull at the blanket I
let your daughter hold.

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:44.030
"'And then you stand up like
I stood up, to be leader-ish,

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.530
see?

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:46.696
And I kind of moved away,
which is when they usually

00:37:46.696 --> 00:37:47.350
all follow me.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:51.250
Except this time only
Montana followed me,

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.370
and it was like--'
Kochelle's smile changes.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:56.830
'Huh.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.960
It was like he wasn't
really following, but more

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.440
trying to separate me and,
you know, keep me away.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.870
Kind of like the way
someone might do at a party,

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.380
pull someone away
so the rest can

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.540
have a private conversation.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.100
Actually, now that I think
about it, it was really weird.'

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.660
"Astair's heart is at it
again, adrenaline back, too,

00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:16.500
except this time,
instead of confusion,

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.970
it's all about anger.

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.600
Kochelle has no clue.

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.420
'They just took to her,'
the young woman continues.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.790
'I mean took to her.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:26.620
Did you see at the
end, how she got up

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.530
and they fell back
like all at once,

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.690
and Montana left me quick, and
like even Quasar, the alpha,

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:33.190
healed behind her?

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.940
I've worked with them
for three years now,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.320
and they never do that for me.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.950
Not even toys,' Kochelle
whispered that last part.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.330
"'Not in that way.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.990
It's like they knew her.

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.850
Like she was one of them.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.530
Or all of them.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.420
I mean but in charge, you know?'
Kochelle suddenly chuckles,

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.180
loud and abrasively.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.640
'Man, I must be beat.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.690
Sounds like I'm calling
your kid a werewolf.'

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.420
"Before Kochelle
leaves, still clueless,

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.920
she again announces
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.150
is only minutes away.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:06.030
Traffic.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.510
Xanther and Astair are welcome
to hang out with the dogs

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.980
or kick back in
mini barn office.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.400
With Xanther out of earshot
back by the monkeys,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.580
Kochelle also asks,
soto voce, too,

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:17.476
that Astair 'not
mention, you know,

00:39:17.476 --> 00:39:19.640
that thing with the wolves.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.530
There's supposed to be all this
release of liability paperwork

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.140
to fill out, and anyhow, you
know your daughter, right?'

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.930
"Astair tries to crush
every answer, only one

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.260
between her teeth, grinding away
like she so often tells Xanther

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.470
not to do, though
something in her expression

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.420
still betrays her.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.050
Kochelle's eyes widen,
her youth suddenly

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.640
too evident on
her soft features.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.250
'You do know I didn't
take her in there, right?

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.740
I was feeding Havoc.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.450
She was talking to them and
then she just walked in.'

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.840
"Later, long after Kochelle's
dirty white Corolla

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.720
left in spectres of dust,
what Astair keeps turning over

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.340
in her head is not
this revelation,

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.000
but a different warning.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.840
Xanther had returned from the
bathroom slightly spooked.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.810
'What's up the hill?'
'Yeah,' Kochelle untensed.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:08.790
'Don't go up there, OK?

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:12.610
Please, don't.'" Thank you.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:16.260
[APPLAUSE]
