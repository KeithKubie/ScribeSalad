Welcome to native link.com course
on using the IPA to help you with

3
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:15,510
pronunciation in a foreign language
or any language you're learning.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,670
When we talk about vowels in
the context of IPA or phonetics,

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,180
we don't tend to say things like the
letter a or the letter u or the vowel you

6
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:32,331
even instead we break down valves by
their features and features are kind of

7
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,040
like the component parts of vows.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,740
Each val has multiple features.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,130
The first of these features is val height.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,950
If you want to think
about it anatomically,

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,720
you can distinguish different val heights
by considering the position of your

12
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:52,200
job when you make a certain
vowels. So for instance,

13
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:57,201
when I make the open sound or my jaw is
in a different position than it is when

14
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,510
I say the clothes val e,

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,520
so my jaw opens up between e and. O.

16
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,340
You can also relate height two how
close your tongue is to the roof of your

17
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:15,990
mouth. It's closer when you say the
sound e than it is when you say,

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,663
aw,

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,890
we can distinguish open
mid and close vowels.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,680
Backness is the other feature we
should distinguish at this point.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,900
Backness involves instead,

22
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:35,670
what we can think of as how far forward
and how far back our tongue is in our

23
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,120
mouth. That's the anatomical
way of thinking about it.

24
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,210
So if you again, say the vowel e,

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,760
your tongue is fairly far forward
in your mouth, but if you say all,

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,740
you pull it back. So that's the feature.

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,240
Backness we can distinguish
three levels of backness.

28
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,890
The first one is going to be
back. The second one is central,

29
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,840
and the third is front.
Using those two features,

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,950
backness and height,

31
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,370
we can lay vowels out on the table with
the x axis being backness and the y axis

32
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,780
being height.

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,310
This will allow you to lay out all of
your basic values on a chart and to be

34
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:19,470
able to pronounce them in
relation to each other.

35
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,940
Let's take a look at one of those charts,
and I'll pronounce the sounds for you.

36
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,880
E Eh, Eh, Eh, ah,

37
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,080
ah, ah, oh, oh, oh,

38
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,160
oh, oh

39
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,170
