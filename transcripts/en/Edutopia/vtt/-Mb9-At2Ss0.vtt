00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:09.116
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: We're going to
pretend the whole class is one group,

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.666
and we want to see how
well you work together.

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:17.316
You need to get in line by the day
you were born, without talking.

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:20.236
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: Because we
teach group work to our students,

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:22.816
they know they have a
piece to contribute.

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:24.116
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: No words.

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:27.616
&gt;&gt;They know how to use their
resources in other people

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:30.526
and they know how to
build ideas together.

00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:32.746
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: Now we're going
to say the day you were born.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:33.266
&gt;&gt;Seven,

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:33.936
&gt;&gt;Nine,

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:34.496
&gt;&gt;Nine,

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:34.786
&gt;&gt;Ten.

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:35.566
&gt;&gt;Eleven.

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.976
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: Whoo-hoo, we got it!

00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:48.596
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: We are an
all honors curriculum here,

00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:52.056
which means we're providing high level
instruction from grades seven to twelve.

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:55.656
Given that, however, we have
entirely heterogeneous classes

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.636
where you've got kids of all different
previous levels of achievement.

00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:01.096
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: At University
Park, you're going to see group work

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:03.886
from grades seven all
the way to grades twelve.

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:07.726
We start in seventh grade with
roles and responsibilities.

00:01:08.036 --> 00:01:10.536
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: You want to make
sure you understand what are the

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:14.396
responsibilities of each of the
roles that you've been given.

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:16.676
&gt;&gt;I don't think group
work comes naturally.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:19.186
I think it's something
that they have to learn.

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:20.686
&gt;&gt;Student: One plus eight.

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:25.336
&gt;&gt;Today we were learning about
integers, positive and negative numbers.

00:01:26.036 --> 00:01:30.236
Now it's time to take the
basic skills and transfer it

00:01:30.236 --> 00:01:33.056
into real world solving problems.

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.636
&gt;&gt;The person who's the questioner,
you will come up and get the problem,

00:01:37.816 --> 00:01:40.416
because you have to read the
problem to your group partners.

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:43.196
&gt;&gt;For this particular
activity, we give roles.

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:46.696
There would be a questioner,
a summarizer and a clarifier.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.396
&gt;&gt;The clarifier will set up the problem,

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:51.736
make sure each group
member agrees with the plan.

00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:55.286
&gt;&gt;One side of the paper that
I gave them would be prompts,

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:58.886
so that it helps them take away
that nervousness because it says,

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.246
oh, you have to say something.

00:02:00.246 --> 00:02:03.066
&gt;&gt;If you're not sure how
to start the conversation,

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:04.976
if you want to say something,
use those sheets.

00:02:11.176 --> 00:02:12.656
&gt;&gt;J.J.: Teachers want us to
like, learn with each other,

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:17.116
so we can all know like, what different
ways you can solve the problem,

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:18.876
and not just like, the teacher's way.

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:23.406
I personally really love that,
because I like to like, experience,

00:02:23.406 --> 00:02:25.496
like how other people
solved the problem,

00:02:25.496 --> 00:02:27.986
so see if I can have a
strategy for that too.

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:29.886
&gt;&gt;Kathy Murphy: Is it done
by the end of the year?

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:31.486
By no means, no, no, no.

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:34.376
I mean, it's a struggle day
in and day out for sure,

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:35.976
but they definitely get better at it.

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:37.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.216
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: We're not just
pushing desks together and thinking,

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:44.666
that's group work now, but really
giving challenging assignments

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:48.206
that require multiple voices,
that require people to have a role

00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:49.846
in building knowledge together.

00:02:49.846 --> 00:02:51.656
&gt;&gt;Kaitlin Kelley: And
so we built it that we.

00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:55.636
We'll kind of pull away some of the
scaffolds as the kids get older,

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:58.956
and then you can really see them
working together in a collaborative way.

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:02.496
&gt;&gt;Student: So it's seven point
five by seven point five.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:11.736
&gt;&gt;Shannon Hammond: We're
starting a unit on polynomials.

00:03:11.886 --> 00:03:13.846
&gt;&gt;It will be similar
to what you did here.

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:17.336
&gt;&gt;When you're dealing with polynomials,
you're dealing with dimensionality,

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:20.826
so they're all building eight
shapes with an outer box.

00:03:21.286 --> 00:03:24.826
Hopefully, to tie together
the symbolic and the spatial.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Which one do you want to do?

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:28.746
&gt;&gt;Seven point five,

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.596
&gt;&gt;By seven point five cube,

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:31.976
&gt;&gt;Yeah,

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:33.976
&gt;&gt;All right, then I'll do one of the
twelve point fives by seven point five.

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:35.256
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:39.426
&gt;&gt;Shannon Hammond: A good group
work problem, it's got to be so big

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:45.606
that you need your partner to
help decide on the organization,

00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:47.976
to try this while you're
trying something related to it.

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:54.026
&gt;&gt;Trinity Starting this
project I was really confused

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.846
because this class is fairly difficult.

00:03:56.846 --> 00:03:59.866
But I find that when you go to other
classmate, it helps tremendously.

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:04.316
&gt;&gt;Shannon Hammond: Then they can be
talking to the other groups around them

00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:07.626
and seeing maybe a different
way to tweak their process.

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.796
&gt;&gt;Trinity: So what he
did was, he came up here

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:14.946
and drew each box that this group had.

00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:19.176
&gt;&gt;Although we're in our own individual
groups, it's very helpful to go

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.846
to another group and ask questions.

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:23.716
When you finally get to the
answer, it sticks with you longer

00:04:23.716 --> 00:04:25.756
than the teacher just
telling you the answer.

00:04:27.086 --> 00:04:27.846
&gt;&gt;Oh, I see.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:32.106
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: The world, more and
more, relies on people being able

00:04:32.106 --> 00:04:35.076
to work together, to
collaboratively solve problems.

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.876
&gt;&gt;Student: Hannah could do
counting how much money we have

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:39.976
and then you all can do how
much everything is in total.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.726
&gt;&gt;Dan St. Louis: You know, I have
kids come to me every single day.

00:04:42.936 --> 00:04:44.856
I had four seventh graders
come to me the other day.

00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:46.816
They want to do a bake
sale to raise money

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:48.496
for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

00:04:48.576 --> 00:04:50.306
&gt;&gt;Student: So all the money we
make in the bake sale is going

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:51.366
to go towards this charity.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:53.946
&gt;&gt;So you've got some people
on board already to help out

00:04:53.946 --> 00:04:54.936
and you're going to stay after today?

00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.956
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, but
they just need to know

00:04:57.076 --> 00:04:58.756
when they have to have it by, so that--

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:01.556
&gt;&gt;They see the value in teamwork.

00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:03.196
&gt;&gt;Well, you can go put
Friday on that announcement.

00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:04.793
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:05:05.046 --> 00:05:06.976
&gt;&gt;Yay,

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:07.306
&gt;&gt;Thank you!

00:05:07.686 --> 00:05:07.876
&gt;&gt;You're welcome.
