00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.070
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2l + 2w.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.420
This is because the perimeter
is the sum of all the sides.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.987
If we add up all the sides
we get l + l + w + w.

00:00:14.987 --> 00:00:19.938
l + l + l together is the same
thing as 2l or 2 times l.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:25.343
Likewise, w + w is the same
thing as 2w or 2 times w.

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:29.060
And so we get 2l + 2w.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.954
This formula is useful, but the
important thing to remember is that to

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:35.734
get the perimeter,
you just add up all the sides.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.509
