00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.780
What's up guys?

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.260
We're back in the lab today with a water bottle a blowtorch a box of matches

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.120
and an oversized Martini glass

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.820
Because DhArshan [Mizuki] wants to know

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.060
what would happen if we tried freezing gasoline than lighting it on fire

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.200
Freezing gasoline and liquid nitrogen is [one] of my highest requested

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.000
videos right [now]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.740
and this comment got over 418 likes in one hour

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.440
that's why we're doing it today.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.140
Will frozen gasoline burn?

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.820
That's the question we're here to answer today.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.700
I want to tell you about my water bottle.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.560
Yes, this actually is my water bottle, but just a few minutes ago

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.000
I ran down to the gas station

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.160
and filled it up with 91 Octane Premium Gasoline

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.220
The Octane rating refers to how much pressure

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.940
the gasoline can take before igniting

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.400
and I got the highest stuff we get

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.840
Now we know that gasoline in its normal state is a liquid and it's highly combustible

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.719
It's extremely flammable and it's what we use to run our vehicles

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.469
If we pour a bit of it onto my brick here and light it off, you can see it goes up in flames

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.900
The question though becomes what will happen to frozen gasoline?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.020
Gasoline has a freezing point anywhere between

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020
-40 to minus -50 Fahrenheit and Celsius

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.620
So we could probably use liquid propane liquid butane or anything else like [that] to freeze it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.750
but for quickness and convenience in this project

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750
[I'm] going back to my old friend liquid nitrogen

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.400
So first things first we need to transfer our liquid nitrogen into our giant Martini glass and hopefully it doesn't break as we do

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.050
[alright], that's enough to make [you] feel [uncomfortable] here comes, the boil. This is my favorite part whoa. Oh

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.669
If that glass let's go to spill all over the workbench. It's cracked like crazy on the bottom there

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.910
It's working its way up like [spiderwebs]. Oh, no, oh

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.949
It's [all] spilling down the side here. Look at this look [at] this. We've got a leak

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590
That's not good

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.309
Our martini glass has turned into a spiderweb of cracks that didn't really take very long and honestly I wasn't expecting anything different

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.470
But that is [$13] down the drain

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.849
Okay, I am going to see if I can salvage any of this nitrogen here

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.489
So liquid nitrogen in a Martini glass not so much

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.049
[alright] at Em number two ceramic Ball

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.789
Look at the way it boils up around the edges. It's jumping to get out of the Bowl

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.279
[all] [right] guys. It looks like our liquid nitrogen has sufficiently cooled

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.399
What's really interesting it takes so much nitrogen to cool the dish down?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.970
We lose more [than] half of the ball just in the cooling process alone now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.859
You know that nitrogen itself is not flammable you can demonstrate that by dipping and match into it here

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.569
You can see the match goes out as soon as it hits that top layer of nitrogen

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.519
The time has come to add our [gasoline] and what I'm thinking [is] we'll just pour a few drops in there and see what happens

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.799
Here we go. Oh

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.470
Wow

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.089
Interesting look how dense that vapour is it turned white and came out like a mushroom cloud and if I push that away you can

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.450
actually see

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.190
The Gasoline is floating on top of [the] nitrogen right there that's interesting. [it's] still liquid it hasn't frozen yet

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.340
It's almost like it's got a protective coating around it

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.459
But there, it's starting to get hard now perfect. We've got a very small sample size here

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.159
I'm pretty comfortable with [let's] go ahead and pull that out and light it off

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.690
There we go my friends that is frozen guessing. I'm actually going to pour a little bit more in there

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.619
That is so cool. I've never seen this before. I wasn't expecting such a rich white fog

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.910
Look at that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.389
It's like a gasoline slushy well

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.330
It's actually like solidified in to a bunch of globs of gasoline

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.349
The thing that's really interesting to me about this is how white the gasoline is

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.548
I thought it would have more of a yellowish tinge to it, but that's pretty clear pretty white

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.029
Very impressive, what happens if I pull one of these pieces out?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.250
The Gasoline Melts extremely quickly, so I'm dipping my tongs in here to cool them down

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.519
And that'll give us a little bit more time to [work] [with] this stuff

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.729
Well hold them in the tongs light the edge and see [what] happens here we go

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.590
Frozen gasoline versus fire in three two one

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.310
whoa

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.870
interesting

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.848
So I don't know if you noticed that but the second the two made contact it's piddled and almost exploded

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.489
I saw kind of like almost look like white flames that happen very fast

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.669
But it definitely lit off and as the flames grew it melted all [the] gasoline and just burn much normal that was interesting

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.569
Let's do some more

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.569
three two one

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:50.389
Amazing so [we'll] frozen gasoline burn apparently it does and takes off with a very very vigorous ignition

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.550
So for this next experiment thinking let's just scoop up a bunch of chunks on a frozen spoon like this and touch a match to

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.870
The top and see what they do when they're all congregated together hMM gasoline super

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.599
Cool here we go

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.799
Holy heck that was bigger scoop my bench [workbenches] on fire

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.350
here's the best part little nitrogen Vapor Waterfall

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.020
Battle of the Elements hot versus cold hot is winning. Let's try at the base

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.670
Our nitrogen fire extinguisher. It's pretty cool

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.730
So did you see how vigorous that reaction was like the second I put the flame into the spoon it would just pop crackle Pop

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.259
Crackle and it just went crazy almost explosive. Which is very interesting so I think at this point

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.520
It's pretty much confirmed frozen gasoline does burn even at the temperatures of liquid nitrogen?

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.129
[what's] really interesting is how much energy it still has that those cryogenic temperatures? Let's do it again

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.540
It's [spitz]

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:15.158
And then the rest turns to gel gel gasoline quick use the nitrogen fire extinguisher. [oh]

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.479
Look at that

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:23.559
We got a river of nitrogen flowing through the center of a valley of fire

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.868
I'm just playing with it a little I could put it out if I wanted to

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.239
Whoa, that's [clean]

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.629
wait again, sit down

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.199
That's some [nudes]

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.079
So for this last experiment I going to try pouring a whole bunch of gasoline in at once to see if we can freeze one

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.080
Big Giant Solid chunk

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.589
That's quite a bit

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.079
You can see little bubbles and spats of gasoline freezing. It almost freezes like ice

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:04.359
And that looks really cool. You know one thing

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.819
I'm thinking what would happen if you took a match and threw it in

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.278
To the [gasoline] and nitrogen combined would it even light off but with the nitrogen vapor suppress the ignition?

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.308
If it does go off it's going to be a pretty dramatic display I

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:21.009
Don't know what's going to [happen] my guess is the flame will go out, but if it doesn't this is going to be spectacular

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:23.709
[here] we go. [aah]

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:25.339
[Aah]

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:27.259
Nitrogen barrier

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:30.699
Let's see that again. I'm a little more confident this time here comes the flame

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:33.579
Can't even get to the gasoline

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.579
Okay, let's do this. Let's light a little bit of gasoline up here and then put it down into the mix

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:43.539
And it goes out

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.810
oop

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.729
That's pretty cool

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:56.299
All right guys for one grand finale. We're going to light a match and throw it into this container with gasoline and nitrogen combined

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:01.639
There's a lot of gasoline in there, and the Pillars are just high enough. I think we can actually get them to ignite here

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:03.639
we go

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:09.419
whoa

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:11.729
Whoa, thanks

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.039
whoo

00:08:15.039 --> 00:08:17.039
craziness, [oh] that's hot

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:23.038
Well, I do have a fire extinguisher. I don't really want to use it. I don't want to use my fire extinguisher

00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:28.559
I'm just gonna put this out manually

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:36.719
Stop drop and roll, [right]. We got smother that fire. I need a wet rag. [oh] wait never mind. I'm doing okay

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.968
Hit it. Holy. Oh my goodness

00:08:43.569 --> 00:08:50.339
[all] [right], sweet lesson learned. Well, it's actually really impressive. How well my workbench held up to all that

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:53.290
Super-Impressed

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.829
Might think that was stupid, but I was actually expecting that

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.769
So let's talk about what just happened here today

00:08:58.769 --> 00:09:02.549
We start out with the purpose of trying to see whether or not frozen gasoline was night

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.500
And not only did we find that it does ignite

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.809
But it actually bursts into a very energetic flame

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:12.690
Next we tried freezing a spoon and scooping up multiple chunks of gasoline and placing a match down in the middle where we found that

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.690
It burst into flames spattered around all over the place

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.940
Eventually liquefying the gasoline and returning to burn like normal

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:22.829
We found that if you take a lit match and place it into a container of liquid nitrogen. It will go out every single time

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:28.139
But we also found out that if you have enough frozen gasoline in the container it can take off with such a vigorous

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:33.179
[reaction] that it can bypass that nitrogen layer sucking all the air that wants and caused a massive explosion

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:36.809
Which almost resulted in an insurance claim so in conclusion?

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:42.959
I [think] we can confirm that frozen gasoline will burn not only that but it burns in a way that completely blew my expectations

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:49.289
