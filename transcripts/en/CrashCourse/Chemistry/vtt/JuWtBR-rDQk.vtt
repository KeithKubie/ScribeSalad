00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
Hydrochloric Acid: every chemist's frenemy,
as terribly dangerous as it is terribly useful.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.700
It'll burn your skin, your eyes, even your mucus membranes if you breathe in its fumes for too long.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.580
But HCL as an acid gives up its hydrogen
pretty easily,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.280
which makes it good for making things like
fertilizers and dyes and even table salt.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.640
Then, there's sodium hydroxide, another substance
that I wouldn't wish to be on my worst foe,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.060
although I'm glad we have it.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.410
You may know it as lye, an extremely caustic
substance that's used for

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.050
everything from clearing clogged pipes to
purifying drinking water.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.230
It's a base. It readily accept the protons
that acids release.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.620
So what do you think will happen when I mix
solutions of these two things together?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.440
Will they just cancel each other out and do nothing, or will they explode, or maybe they'll travel through time?

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.859
Well, if you've been paying attention, you
already know what's going to happen.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.460
They're going to undergo a neutralization
reaction, which we've talked about before.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.530
These two potentially deadly substances will
form harmless salt and water.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.129
But the reaction will also have an effect
that you can actually feel.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.120
It will release heat, and not just a little
heat.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.590
Mixing concentrated acids and bases releases
so much heat that it can result in an explosion.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.640
But I will show you how to produce a safe,
but noticeable amount of heat with this reaction.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.190
To me, the coolest part of this is where the
heat actually comes from.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.160
The energy used to exist as part of chemical
bonds in the acid and the base.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.320
Just like a ball at the top of a hill, the molecules always move towards a lower energy state if they can,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.280
and that's just what they'll do.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.460
High energy bonds will break and lower energy
bonds will form.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.700
The change in energy between those states you can actually feel the effects of, and that's pretty dang cool.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.640
And what's even more awesome, if you ask me,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.760
is that we can actually figure out exactly
how much heat will be released by this reaction.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:52.260
[Theme Music]

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.980
Remember that measuring heat change is closely
related to enthalpy,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.410
which we defined as the internal energy of
a system

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.400
plus the energy it uses to push the surroundings back and make room for its own pressure and volume.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.220
And in a constant pressure, like we have here
at the surface of the Earth,

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.530
that works out to be exactly the same as the
heat that's absorbed or released by a reaction.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.319
Naturally, it can be very useful to know how
much heat a chemical reaction absorbs or releases.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.420
In addition to the exothermic hand-warmers
that we have out there,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.519
there are also endothermic chemical ice packs
for treating injuries.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.680
The ability to calculate change in enthalpy
is also what tells pilots how far the fuel

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.040
in an airplane's tank will allow it to fly,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.340
which I personally am very interested in making
sure they get right.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.269
One of the ways we can calculate the change
in enthalpy of a system is with Hess's Law,

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.590
which you'll recall states that the total
enthalpy change for a chemical reaction doesn't

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.909
depend on the pathway it takes,

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.730
but only on its initial and final states.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.650
It's often expressed in terms of Standard
Enthalpy of Formation,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.999
that is, the amount of heat lost or gained when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements.

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.209
That's how we figured out exactly how much
heat my hand-warmers release.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.420
But that's not the only way that Hess's Law
can be used.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.480
The law itself says nothing about the standard
enthalpy of formation.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.709
Any way that we can figure out the change
of heat between the products and the reactants

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.060
will work just as well, and that's where calorimetry
comes in.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.040
Calorimetry is the science of measuring the change in heat associated with a chemical reaction.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.459
And this may look like a plastic bottle inside
a koozie, but it's actually a calorimeter.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.670
A calorimeter can be fancy and an expensive
piece of hardware, or it can be simple.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.980
But no matter what it looks like, it's basically
an insulated container that contains a thermometer.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.840
And it can be made out of stainless steel
or Styrofoam cups,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.700
but there really are no fundamental differences
in how they work.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.360
And you know the general setup by now:

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.140
the chemicals in the calorimeter make up the
thermodynamic system

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.739
and everything else is the surroundings.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.639
The insulation minimizes the amount of heat
that leaks in or out of the system,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.719
so that we can be fairly confident that any heat transfer is part of the system, not the surroundings.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.820
The thermometer tracks the temperature change, which is part of the calculation we have to do.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.419
And there's usually some way to stir the solution
to make sure that the reaction occurs fully.

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.650
Alright everybody, safety first, though I
really should be wearing gloves...

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:10.550
I'm gonna put 100 mL, also 100 grams, of HCL's one mole of HCL solution into my calorimeter here...

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.800
(mumbling)

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.100
And now I'm going to put the same amount of
sodium hydroxide solution.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.229
Before I do the reaction, I have to know our
starting temperature,

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.180
so I'm going to stick my thermometer in there
and wait for a second to see what it does.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.740
It should be room temperature, it's been in
the room for a long time.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.449
So, we are currently at, like, 20.8 degrees
Celsius.

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:45.060
So that's like, 294 Kelvin, and now I shall
add my 100 mL of sodium hydroxide.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.840
The temperature, unsurprisingly, is rising
very rapidly.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.639
And I'm doing something right now that you should never ever do, which is stir with the thermometer,

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.440
because if this happens in schools across
the world,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.640
then there will be a million billion broken thermometers and the stuff inside these thermometers is not good.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.960
So never do what I'm doing.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.080
All right, the temperature should be stable
by now, we have 28 point like 2 degrees Celsius.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.050
Now there's a simple formula that allows us
to calculate the heat change of a reaction,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.220
simply by measuring the change in temperature
that occurs in a calorimeter.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.400
It says that the change in heat equals the
specific heat capacity of the substance

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.640
times its total mass times the change in temperature.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.259
Let's examine the parts of this.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.340
First of all, the heat change in the calorimeter
is normally represented by a lowercase "q,"

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.220
but it can also be represented by change in
enthalpy, or delta H,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.940
because remember that constant pressure (delta
H) equals q,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.759
and constant pressure is almost always a good
assumption for the duration of an experiment,

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.580
or at least as long as we stay at the surface
of the earth.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.520
For reasons that will become clear later, we'll sure delta H to represent the heat change for this experiment.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.580
Specific heat capacity, represented by
a lowercase "s",

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.110
is the amount of heat required tp raise the
temperature of one mass unit,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.759
like a gram or kilogram, of a substance by
1 degree Celsius.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.139
So it turns out that different amounts of
heat create different temperature changes,

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.039
like metals get hot really easily and cool
down really easily.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.289
Others like water require a lot of thermal
energy to raise the temperature,

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.400
and therefore have to release a lot of heat
to cool down.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.009
I'm always wondering though, like, what does
that really mean?

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:23.180
Like, physically in the molecules, shouldn't heat raise the temperature of all substances equally?

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.180
And why does water in particular have such
a high specific heat capacity?

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.780
Heat energy can do a lot of things besides
just increase temperatures.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.569
Temperature, or the speed at which molecules
bounce around,

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:36.780
is just one way that atoms or molecules can
absorb energy.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.759
Heat energy can also be absorbed by the breaking
and formation of bonds between molecules,

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.900
and as we'll learn in another episode, the
extremely high specific heat capacity of water

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:51.419
is due to the breaking and formation of hydrogen bonds that are associated with relatively small changes in temperature.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:53.669
And how do we know the specific heat capacity?

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.530
Well, I am happy to report that some noble
chemists have worked hard to determine the

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.070
specific heat capacities of hundreds of substances
so that we don't have to.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.099
We just have to look up the numbers in a table.

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.870
Okay, so specific heat capacity times mass
times the change in temperature.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.950
The mass is important because the more mass of a substance we have, the more chemical bonds are present,

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.420
and because energy is contained in chemical
bonds,

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.030
they have a big effect on how much energy
we're able to absorb or release.

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.099
And finally, there's the change in temperature.

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:25.819
When doing calorimetry, we calculate a change
in heat by measuring a change in temperature,

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:30.419
but as we've said a billion times before,
heat and temperature are not the same thing.

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:34.969
But please do not think that this thing is
measuring heat because it's not!

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:40.669
It's just that luckily, in this specific case, they are related by our handy little calorimeter formula.

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.749
Now you might not have noticed, but we are right at the interface between chemistry and physics here.

00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:48.259
Each science could claim ownership over this
phenomenon,

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:53.099
but the truth is humans made up the difference
between chemistry and physics anyway.

00:07:53.099 --> 00:07:58.219
Thermodynamics, the study of heat, energy,
and work, doesn't care about our little rules.

00:07:58.219 --> 00:08:02.569
Thermodynamics itself makes the rules of the
universe. It is the ultimate law.

00:08:02.569 --> 00:08:06.229
So now you know, even though you might not
have cared, but you should!

00:08:06.229 --> 00:08:09.379
Because it's good! It's all wiggly-wobbly
bondy-wondy.

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:12.919
All right! Enough talk, let's get out there,
actually do some math here.

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:15.360
Remember that the formula is delta H, s, m,
delta T.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.520
The solutions we're using here are so dilute
that almost all of their mass consists of water.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.280
Therefore, we can use the specific heat capacity
of water.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.979
If we look that up on our table, we'll see
that it is 4.184 Joules per gram degrees Celsius;

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:31.659
I used 100 grams of each chemical for a total
mass of 200 grams.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:33.610
And finally, we need the temperature change.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.950
If you remember, the temperature rose from
294.0 Kelvin to 301.4 Kelvin;

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.969
the difference between these two is 7.4 Kelvin.

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:43.940
It's a positive value because the temperature
increased.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:50.340
Cancel out all the appropriate units and then bang on the calculator to get a final release of 6192.32 J,

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.680
or 6.2 kiloJoules of heat from the reaction.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.040
Because this formula is based on temperature
change,

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.260
and since the temperature increased, we end
up with a positive result.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.740
But most importantly, it tells us the magnitude
of the change in heat energy.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.769
So, I wonder how that compares to the amount
we would predict using Hess's Law

00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:12.160
and the standard enthalpy of formation?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.350
Remember that we can look up the standard
enthalpy of formation for all the products

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.260
and reactants in the back of a textbook or
online,

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.780
the chemical reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide produces liquid water and sodium chloride.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:29.370
The standard enthalpy of formation for hydrochloric
acid is -167.2 kJ per mole;

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.330
for sodium hydroxide it's -469.15 kJ per mole;

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:40.360
for liquid water it's -285.8;
and for sodium chloride it's -407.27.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.780
I'm not gonna do the mole calculations on-screen,

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:48.240
but trust me when I say that we used 0.100
mole of HCL and the amount of NaOH.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.620
Because everything in the equation balances
out, it's just a 1:1:1:1 ratio,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.000
we can assume that they all have the same
amount of each product as well.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.200
If we plug these into Hess's Law and do the
calculation,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.519
we found that the change in heat or enthalpy
of the reaction is -5.67 kJ.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:08.149
The system is releasing or losing energy,
so the number is negative,

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.790
but again it's really the magnitude that we
wanna know.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.430
So there you go, the calorimetry formula gave
an absolute enthalpy change of 6.2 kJ,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.060
while Hess's Law gives a change of 5.67 kJ.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.769
So, why the difference?

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:25.300
Well, the greatest factor is probably that we used the specific heat capacity of pure water

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.180
instead of the salt water that we actually
created.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.660
We also didn't include the heat capacity of
our calorimeter itself.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.680
The calorimeter walls and the thermometer
were heated too,

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.470
resulting in some of the produced heat not
being accounted for.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.000
The insulation of the calorimeter is obviously
a bit light,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.500
which allowed some heat to escape entirely
and that's another major factor.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.560
Even so, I'd say we did pretty well, the important thing is that it showed us what we needed to see,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.860
even though it was just a little plastic bottle
in a koozie.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.250
For a quick simple method, the calorimeter
got us pretty close to the calculated value.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:57.060
If we were calculating the amount of a particular
fuel we would need to travel to Mars,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.760
or inventing a cold pack that won't give you
frostbite,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.660
we'd wanna use a more sophisticated system and work more carefully, but this was pretty cool for our purposes.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.940
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.649
If you paid attention, you learned that we
don't necessarily have to use standard enthalpies

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:13.519
of formation to solve Hess's Law,

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:14.829
you learned what a calorimeter is,

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:19.079
that calorimetry is another way to investigate
heat changes in chemical reactions,

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.920
and that specific heat capacity tells us

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.660
how much heat energy affects the molecules
in a substance without changing its temperature.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.970
And finally, you learned some potential sources
of error related to calorimetry.

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:32.690
The episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzalez.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.110
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino and our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko Langner.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.699
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.550
Our script supervisor was Caitlin Hofmeister,
and our sound designer is Michael Aranda.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.650
And, of course, our graphics team is
Thought Cafe.
