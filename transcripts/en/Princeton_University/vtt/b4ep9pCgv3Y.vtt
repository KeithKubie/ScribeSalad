00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.089
My name is Lisa Jackson. I was at Princeton
from '83 to '86. I got my Master's in Chemical

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.139
Engineering, and now I serve as the administrator
of the United States Environmental Protection

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.199
Agency. My engineering background is extremely
important to the job I do every day. It gives

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.090
me a different perspective from others. Engineering
is about problem solving. A lot of the issues

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.110
we deal with here at EPA are technical in
nature. And one of the things I said from

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.043
day one is that our entire work has to be
based on the best science we can muster from

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:45.750
the American people. Probably the biggest
adjustment has been the move and the pace

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.540
of work here in Washington. It's great because
there's a huge expectation that we're going

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.770
to bring this agency back. That we're going
to restore EPA to its place as the protector

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.670
of air, water and land. But that means a huge
agenda. And so we're working awful hard here.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.860
You know, a little bit later today I'll be
speaking to students -- high school students

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.750
in an organization called Jack and Jill. They
are African American kids and they're coming

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.679
to D.C. as part of a leadership program. It's
so important for us at EPA to build and continue

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:24.850
to build our recognition of our mission with
youth. The youth have always cared about environment

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.210
and pushed our issues, and this generation
is all about being green, and we want to encourage

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.880
them. I speak about the devastation for America
in Katrina often. My mom lost her home. She's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.899
actually sold what's left of it back to the
state of Louisiana and moved up to Ocean City.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.200
Katrina was not only a tragedy; it was an
environmental catastrophe as well. And I remind

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.070
people that when those wetlands were being
torn up, the people who suffered most from

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.200
the damage in the low-lying areas of the city
who happened to be people of color, had nothing

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:03.380
to do with the decisions made on those wetlands.
So making gumbo and making Washington policy.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.619
Gumbo, of course, even the word is all about
a mixture, and bringing together these ingredients

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.580
and letting them simmer, and coming out with
something really good. And obviously policy

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.670
and politics is very much the same thing.
If we're going to be successful in environmental

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.650
policy, it's about bringing all the people
who care about it, all the stakeholders we

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.480
call, together and coming out with the best
solution. You know my time at Princeton in

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.390
the Engineering School certainly influenced
where I am today. At that point, I worked

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.050
on environmental issues. And Princeton had
a history of being involved in some of the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.850
first environmental studies that were done
up in Woburn, Mass. on groundwater. And I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:49.361
worked with folks who did that research. It
certainly influenced and enhanced my interest

00:02:49.361 --> 00:03:04.819
in the environmental field. My name is Lisa
Jackson and I'm a Princeton engineer.
