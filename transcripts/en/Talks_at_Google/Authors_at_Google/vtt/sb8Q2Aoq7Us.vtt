DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.010
Thank you having us.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.770
MALE SPEAKER: Of
course, welcome.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.436
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
This is awesome.

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:13.109
Awesomely, awesome.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.150
MALE SPEAKER: So welcome.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.460
Welcome.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.020
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Thank you.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.900
MALE SPEAKER: Now, I
just want to start.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.090
I brought my little
cheat sheet here.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.530
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Of course.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.530
All right.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.870
MALE SPEAKER: You
have done it all

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.037
You're a legendary musician.

00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:24.370
First rap group to appear on
the cover of Rolling Stone.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.360
First to appear on MTV.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.990
Rock and Roll Hall of Famer.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.050
Grammy nominations.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.000
Emmy awards.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.050
Founder of the nonprofit
The Felix Organization.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.966
You've spoken at the
White House, to Congress.

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.490
You're a best selling author.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.360
But now DMC stands for something
beyond Darryl McDaniels,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.570
beyond the devastating
mic controller.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840
Now DMC stands for
Darryl Makes Comics.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.442
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Yes, yes.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.900
MALE SPEAKER: How
did we get there?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.720
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
How did we get there?

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.750
What people don't realize is,
before music changed my life,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.780
before-- first it
was rock and roll.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.190
Then it was hip hop.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.300
But before music
changed my life,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.920
my whole existence was school.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.239
I went to Catholic
school my whole life.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.200
MALE SPEAKER: Me too.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.660
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Huh?

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.950
MALE SPEAKER: Me too.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.158
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Yeah.

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:09.750
Catholic school is cool.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.770
I was a straight A plus,
plus, plus student.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.340
I like to brag about that.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.730
I was always on honor roll.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.820
But at that time of Kenny
Garner in the eighth grade,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390
it was school and comic books.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.060
And the reason why comic
books were so important to me

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.230
is a couple of reasons.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.590
Going to Catholic school
in Hollis, Queens,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.400
the public school
kids thought this.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.045
Oh, you got a uniform on.

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:41.510
Your mother and father paid
for you to go to school.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.320
So you're rich.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.900
Run it.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.420
So I go bullied.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.620
I got my money taken weekly.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.320
To get from my house to
the school was terrible.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.740
It was just horror because
I knew I had to go outside.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.690
But once I made it safely to
school, all was incredible.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.450
I loved reading and writing.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.250
I loved the first day of school.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.700
I loved new pencils and pencil
sharpeners and book bags

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.080
and all of that.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.210
But when the school day
ended, I was terrified again

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.340
because I had to go back home.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.340
But when I got home,
after I did my schoolwork,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.160
Marvel comic books
empowered, educated me,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.360
gave me confidence to exist
in the so-called real world.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.460
It also helped me
with my studies.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.790
The reason why I believe
I was such a good student

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.550
was, even back in
the '60s and '70s,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.115
there's something wrong with
the nerdy little kids that

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:36.950
read comic books.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.190
Remember every educators was
like the comics is bad for you.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.930
But they didn't know about this.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.489
Because I was reading.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.530
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.920
Because I was reading.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.680
They wanted you to
read the World Book

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.180
Encyclopedia and the
Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.110
which I did.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.590
I read the World Book
Encyclopedia Volume One to Z.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.940
My mother thought I was crazy.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.490
But that was because
of comic books.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.830
And the reason why I excelled
and my school work was

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.200
so good, in school,
in history, you learn

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.000
about World War II, right?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.770
But Captain America
takes you there.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.537
In science, you learn about
the now eight planets.

00:03:14.537 --> 00:03:15.620
A little kid corrected me.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.690
There's only eight
planets now, Mr. DMC

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.940
because Pluto's not a planet.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.070
I say, good thinking.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.460
You know, you learn
about the galaxy.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.010
But the Silver Surfer
takes you there.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.330
So because I was
reading comic books,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.460
I was able to excel in school.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.920
But also, it just took me to
a place that where I was safe.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.220
And comic books was
my whole existence.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.122
Also I was a little kid who
grew up in New York City.

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:43.330
I was one of those kids that
when that light come on,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.420
you have your butt
in this house.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.070
So I was a little kid
living in New York that

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.450
didn't get to see New York.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.020
DC was cool.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.800
Gotham, Metropolis, right?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.100
We always talk about this.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.637
Well, Marvel was in New York.

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:58.470
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
It was in Queens,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.150
it was in Manhattan.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.483
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: I saw
the Empire State Building.

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:04.630
The first time I learned about
the Roosevelt Island tram

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.725
was in Spider-Man.

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:08.350
And then I remember the day, the
first time I went to the city,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.600
and saw it, I was shook.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.610
Oh, my god.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.270
That thing really exists.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.339
So comic books was my
whole real world as a kid.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.540
MALE SPEAKER: And in DMC
number one, you of course,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.230
are now DMC, the superhero
in New York City,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.780
1980s, New York City,
alternate reality.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.890
So what made us go there?

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.460
Is that--

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.490
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
Well, all right, we

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.790
talked about this a lot,
because the thing about Darryl

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.380
is that like he just kind
of like prefaced by saying,

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.490
it kind of like was all
part of his existence.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.560
And what he forgot to mention,
is that they were also

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.300
the gateway to hip hop for him.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.426
Like his brother actually
broke the bad news to him

00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:42.883
and told him,
they're going to have

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:45.180
to sell their entire comic
book collection because they

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.412
needed to get into this
new thing called hip hop.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.120
And they sold their
comic book collection

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.500
and bought their first
turntable and the mic

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.750
MALE SPEAKER: That worked out.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.930
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
and a microphone.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.340
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Everybody always say that.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.920
That is the first
thing people say.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.430
Good thing it worked out.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.888
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ: D
and I talked about this a lot.

00:05:00.888 --> 00:05:02.861
Because we were thinking,
well, what if we kind

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:05.110
of like look at it from a
science fiction storytelling

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.610
perspective?

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.540
We love alternate realities
and the concept of that.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.705
So we said, what if in this
alternate reality, D tells me,

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:13.080
I never picked up
the microphone.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.705
And what if, in this
alternate reality,

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:18.120
it's kind of like the presence
of supernatural forces do

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.800
exist and I'm imbued by some
mysterious superhero heroic

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.489
powers.

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:24.030
So then I thought,
well then, we have

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.363
to paint a whole other universe.

00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:27.900
It shouldn't be simply as
DMC, the superhero in 2015.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.630
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
That's corny.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.960
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Right,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.465
so we were like, well, what if
we go back to the height of Run

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:35.407
DMC's like, fame and
the height of Run DMC,

00:05:35.407 --> 00:05:37.240
and also the birth of
hip hop and everything

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.730
that was like fresh
in New York City,

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.850
even as recently as Madonna
on the Jimmy Fallon show

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.240
stated that New York City,
in terms of its flavor,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.070
was at its height in the '80s.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.951
And this is before shiny,
you know, condos existed.

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:50.700
There was hit pop.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.420
There was punk rock.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.086
There was disco.

00:05:52.086 --> 00:05:55.956
There were B-Boys, graffiti,
graffiti all over trains,

00:05:55.956 --> 00:05:59.789
from artists like Lee
Quinones even Basquiat.

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.330
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Keith Haring!

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.590
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: Why
don't we create a comic book

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.960
that kind of reflects this
kind of like very rich, raw--

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.260
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Powerful, creative,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.260
time period.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.020
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: So
we said, let's go back to DMC,

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.990
back in 1985, he doesn't
actually become an MC.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.800
He finishes at St. John's
and he gets himself

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.200
a master's degree in education.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.600
But by night, he's a superhero.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.100
And we said, and
New York City needs

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.840
to be the second
character in the book.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.282
And my background, I work
with a lot of graffiti writers

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:28.240
and comic book artists.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.198
So I said, well then we
need to actually inject

00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:32.930
some authentic graffiti
art into the actual book.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.654
We're not just going to get a
penciller to kind of like mimic

00:06:35.654 --> 00:06:36.820
or emulate the graffiti, no.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.825
We actually had the
penciller do the panels.

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.200
And then we will
pass the artwork

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.660
on to all these wildstyle
graffiti artists.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.640
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Real graffiti writers.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.810
EDGARDO
MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: I mean,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.143
the cover that you see right
now on the wall is actually

00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:47.740
like the vision of four
different artists, [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.680
directed it.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.630
Sal Buscema, who's a comic
artist who we both grew up on--

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.200
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Legend.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.658
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: drew it.

00:06:53.658 --> 00:06:55.630
Bob Wiacek inked it.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.570
Carlos Mayer, Mayer 139,
actually did the Wild Style

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.780
graffiti and they
all worked together

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.020
and then it was digitally
colored by Chris Sotomayor.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.370
So our book kind of like had
to embrace this kind of era.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.810
Because it was fresh for
us, and what we realized

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.290
is that in this age right
now, especially young people,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.804
there's this kind of like vibe
for reflecting an era before.

00:07:15.804 --> 00:07:17.220
And that's kind
of always existed.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.490
I mean we were growing up, in
the '70s and '80s for example,

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.290
people look back to
the '60s and '50s.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.650
So now, it's only like regular
that people looking back

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.901
to the '90s and '80s here now.

00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:27.400
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: And the '80s

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.965
was the best period of all.

00:07:28.965 --> 00:07:33.110
And old school
wasn't a time period.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.970
It was a consciousness.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.290
It was a way for
people, especially here

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.000
in New York City, to
creatively present yourself.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.860
Like when I do speakings at
high schools and middle schools,

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.920
hip hop didn't just
create rappers.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.260
It didn't just create a bunch
of DMCs and Chuck Ds and Jay Zs.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.990
It created people such as him.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.140
You know what I'm
saying, he's an activist.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.550
He's an art director.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.591
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.290
He's a writer that created
doctors, lawyers, designers,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.930
educators.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.390
So when we were young people,
growing up in this universe

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.640
was nothing.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.600
It's almost like all of
us in this room, all of us

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.530
back in the '70s and '80s,
regardless of how desolate

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.230
our lives were, we
all had a super power,

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.610
some of the kids got on the mic.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.420
That was the power.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.120
Some of the other
kids. they knew music.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.406
That was the DJ.

00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:23.530
Some of the kids that
couldn't even read and write.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.720
There was kids that
would say, I don't even

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.800
know nothing about music.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.190
I can not write a rhyme.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.204
I can't read and write.

00:08:28.204 --> 00:08:29.370
Hip hop didn't discriminate.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.990
It said, what could you do.

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.190
But what I hear that
guy recite his poetry,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.539
when that guy plays his music,
I feel like spinning on my head.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.490
We didn't, oh, we got to
save money for a lifetime

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:40.515
to build a disco.

00:08:40.515 --> 00:08:42.140
We were too young to
get in the discos.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.844
It was like, hey,
go cut that box up.

00:08:43.844 --> 00:08:44.760
Throw it on the floor.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.280
We had a dance floor.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.179
So it was very
innovative at that time,

00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:50.220
you know what I'm saying.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.232
And when we first started
out, even the powers

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:55.690
that be in the
music business, they

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.890
would say, oh, rap's a fad.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.650
It's going to be over
and this and that.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:01.670
Jay always something that
was really powerful to me.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.200
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Jam Master Jay.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.825
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: He said
or without the record business,

00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:06.589
there was always
going to be hip hop.

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:08.130
There was always
going to be artists.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.180
There was always
going to be writers.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.040
There was always
going to be DJs.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.700
And you know for me, like
I said, it wasn't just me.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.220
My neighborhood was the Bronx.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.190
It was Brooklyn.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.220
It was other kids all over
the world at that time.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.320
And what had happened
to me was, we

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.920
started hearing
Grandmaster Flash.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.610
We started hearing Afrika
Bambaataa, the break

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.450
dances, rock steady crew,
the way they dressed,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.400
the way they look.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.210
Grandmaster Flash and the
First Five and Afrika Bambaataa

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.310
used to dress like Run DMC.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.870
But when they got
into show business

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.580
and started making records,
because it was show business,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.310
they kind of changed
the representation of,

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.280
not who they were, but
their presentation.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.390
The first rappers didn't have
wrappers to look up to them.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.450
So when they got into
the record business,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.400
if you look at Grandmaster
Flash and Afrika

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.530
Bambaataa and those
first records,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.450
they looked like
the Rolling Stones.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.839
Rick James and
Parliament Funkadelic

00:10:00.839 --> 00:10:02.130
because those were their idols.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.860
When Run DMC came along, before
they were making records,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.250
Melle Mel and them
wore Pumas and Adidas

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.180
and sheepskins and gazelles and
track suits and all of that.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.180
So our idols were flashing them
before the record business.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.050
And me and Ed always
talk about this,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.380
the B-Boys were like
superheroes already.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.110
The DJs were like, they
had names like superheroes

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.300
and stuff like that.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.950
And what made me such a perfect
fit for Ed when he said,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.070
yo, we going to do this and
create this universe, actually

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.820
how this came about is, I went
to-- he couldn't be here today.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.780
I went to have a music meeting
with Riggs Morales, who

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.220
was from Shady Records, the
whole success of Eminem,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.020
he was there at
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.790
So I go to meet about
music and Riggs,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.890
in his professional
voice, he says,

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.450
yo, I ain't really supposed
to fan out right now.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.170
I usually keep it
real professional,

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.100
but you're DMC, man, and when I
was growing up, this and that.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.880
And it was like, you guys
were like my superheroes.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.864
And he just asked
me, D, how was it

00:11:00.864 --> 00:11:03.280
when you was-- what was it
like when you was a little kid.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.030
And just like I told you, I'm
sitting in this music meeting.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.700
Well, um, I went
to Catholic school

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.030
my whole life and all I
did was read comic books.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.860
And when I said the word comic
books, this light came on.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.820
The heavens opened
up. and the angels

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.530
started blowing their trumpets.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:19.892
We're supposed to be talking
about a music meeting.

00:11:19.892 --> 00:11:22.100
The artist that we was there
representing was pissed.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.460
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Poor guy,man.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.810
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
We sat there for two hours

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.145
and talked about comic books.

00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:26.520
And then he said,
D, did you ever

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.220
think about doing a comic book?

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.680
And I was like, you know, I
thought about it, but you know,

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.880
I don't want to be corny.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.390
I don't want to
be another rapper,

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.140
just because I'm successful,
trying to do something.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.350
I like to stay in my lane.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.740
And he looked at me
and he said this to me.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.890
He say, yo, what happened
when you put hip hop-- you

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.350
and your boys put hip pop
with rock and roll, huh?

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.960
You put the hip hop-- not
with "Walk This Way" first.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.690
You took "Rock Box," which
was the first rock rap

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.740
record to be on MTV.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.820
Something good, right?

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.730
Then you all did
"King of Rock," right?

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:00.397
Then you all actually
got with Aerosmith

00:12:00.397 --> 00:12:02.104
and did "Walk This
Way" and that changed,

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:03.390
that didn't just change music.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.725
Busta Rhymes said, they changed
everything, fashion, style,

00:12:06.725 --> 00:12:08.920
the relationship of black
people and white people.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.835
I would say, yeah,
that was good.

00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:16.260
He said, what happens when you,
with your boys, took hip hop

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.470
and talked about your sneakers.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.320
You launched this whole
sneaker culture, this and that

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.660
and the reason why
rappers get deals today

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.380
is because of what you did.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.890
I guess we kind of did that.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.390
He said, yo, the
only thing that can

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.720
happen if you
create a comic book,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.300
it could do the
same thing that you

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.810
did with your music, the same
thing you did with your hip

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.689
hop, your style, your fashion,
you could put all that energy

00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:38.230
in this book.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.688
Then he said this to me. this
is what really got me to say,

00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:41.490
OK, I'll try it.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.380
He said, yo, but don't do it
as DMC, the famous celebrity

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.400
rapper guy.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.130
Do it as little
Darryl McDaniels,

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.600
the kid who loved
comic books first.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.520
And I said, OK, cool.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.540
Then he just basically said,
next week, come to my office.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.230
I got somebody I
want you to meet.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.610
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
And then Riggs

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.730
brings me over to the meeting.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.220
He just started
as Vice President

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.340
over at Atlantic Records.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.070
And I bring my son,
[? Keyon ?] with me

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.770
and we think we're just
going to have lunch and all.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.269
And he says, you know, I can't
have this lunch because I

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:09.560
had a lot of stuff on my plate.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.643
But I'm going to walk you
down to this board room.

00:13:11.643 --> 00:13:14.600
Because there's somebody in
there I've got for you to meet.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.786
And we walk up to these gigantic
15 foot high cherry wood doors.

00:13:18.786 --> 00:13:20.160
And he grabs the
doorknob, and he

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.540
says, whatever you do, you
go in there, don't fan out.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.290
And I'm like, who the hell is
on the other side of this door.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.040
So I'm like, OK, I got
to keep my game on.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.730
I don't even know
what I'm talking about

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.750
and who I'm talking
about this with.

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.220
And we opened the door, there
is D with his big Kool-Aid smile

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.220
on the other side of the
door, like mad excited.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.886
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Cause he
was like this is the comic book

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:40.470
guy, right?

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.830
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
I had no idea what we were

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.670
about to talk about, right?

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.300
And then he goes into
this whole story.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.960
Catholic school kid, straight
As across my forehead.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.690
And he tells me the
whole-- my brother,

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.280
he made me sell my comic
books so we could get--

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.860
and it was just like
an amazing story.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.350
Two, three hours
later, literally, it

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.987
turned into like a
three hour meeting.

00:13:58.987 --> 00:14:01.320
And [? Keyon ?] is on the
side, reading his comic books,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.486
just kind of like tuned out.

00:14:02.486 --> 00:14:04.200
But that's our target audience.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.950
So we're kind of like
thinking about this.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.579
And we realized we
need to literally think

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:09.245
about this more.

00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:11.411
And I told him from the
beginning, I was like, look,

00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:12.922
I could help you
do this, but you

00:14:12.922 --> 00:14:14.130
need to do this for yourself.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.550
You need to stand on
your own two feet.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.400
Eric was there.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.510
He's our manager now.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.720
And I was like, Eric, talk
to your lawyer and stuff

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.220
like that.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.120
And set up your own LLC.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.494
Whether you work with me or
not, set up your own company.

00:14:24.494 --> 00:14:26.636
Because this is your
intellectual property.

00:14:26.636 --> 00:14:28.010
And it shouldn't
be that you take

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.420
this idea that somebody else--

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:29.940
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
DC or Marvel.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.250
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: that they

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.780
could take it and
take it from you

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.840
and reinterpret it
in their own vision.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.670
And at that point,
I asked Darryl,

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.212
I said, what would you even call
your own publishing company?

00:14:38.212 --> 00:14:39.419
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Ding.

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:40.670
Darryl Makes Comics.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.569
That was easy.

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.110
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: And
then like, even a month later,

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.776
a few weeks later,
we meet up because he

00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:49.430
was shooting a commercial
that was produced by A-Trak.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:50.930
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: With A-Trak.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.360
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Right, right.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.580
And he brought together Run and
they were doing a song together

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.371
for the commercial.

00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:56.460
And it was being shot
like a music video.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.730
And Darryl invites
me over and he says,

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.700
yo, yo, come down
to the video shoot.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.500
It's kind of cool.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.300
You check it out
and besides, I've

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.800
got to talk to you
about some stuff.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.380
We're in the green room,
just me and him talking,

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.940
and he starts doing,
yo, I can't sleep.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.732
My wife is worried.

00:15:10.732 --> 00:15:12.773
Man, I been thinking about
this comic book thing.

00:15:12.773 --> 00:15:15.060
And I'm thinking to myself,
he probably has so much

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.820
on his plate.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.140
He probably just wants
to tell me nicely

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.530
he's going to just dead this
project from the beginning.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:21.610
And he was like, so
I just need to let

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.100
you know that I can't
do this project,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.445
but I need to do it with you.

00:15:25.445 --> 00:15:26.300
And I was like what?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.760
And he was like, I can't
do this project unless you

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.610
want to be my partner.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.401
And we got to bring
Riggs as a partner too.

00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:32.745
And that's how we actually
founded Darryl Makes Comics.

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:33.620
And it was that idea.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.450
And then for the next
two hours after that,

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.500
we just geeked out and started
talking about comic books

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.040
all over again.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.706
We were like little
kids all over again.

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:41.960
I pulled out my phone and
I'm going to Google Images.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.460
Look at this cover
of a white tiger.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.580
Oh, my gosh,
remember "Iron Fist."

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.950
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Remember "The Defenders." stuff

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:48.580
that people don't
even-- everybody's

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.419
so caught up on
what's in the movies,

00:15:50.419 --> 00:15:51.960
not "Captain America"
and "Avengers."

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.251
But it was this whole universe.

00:15:53.251 --> 00:15:55.870
And the cool thing is,
all three of us sat there,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.990
and we said, if we're
going to do this,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.290
the most important element
of this publication

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.220
is it's done when integrity.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.736
And it's done as a
tribute and celebration

00:16:06.736 --> 00:16:11.020
of those things that could
change people's lives.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.040
And even deeper
than that, we also

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.880
created this to
make sure that we

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.730
gave all writers, anchors,
pencillers an opportunities.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.070
Even to the point
where I'm 51 years old.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:23.825
So there's probably
a guy who should

00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:27.654
have joined for Marvel or DC
and never got their chance.

00:16:27.654 --> 00:16:29.070
We want to give
them their chance.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.060
There's young people,
you know what I'm saying,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.760
there's kids and young
people, there's women.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.990
So we wanted to be
completely diverse.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.760
And Riggs was like, yo, this is
going to be easy for all three

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.170
of us, because we are the
people, all of the ideas,

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.670
concepts, images, all
the issues, Ed was like,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.900
we gotta deal with
the issues, politics,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.140
and religion is
afraid to talk about.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.200
Not in a negative
way, just to sell it,

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.480
like to really talk about it.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.060
We want to tell
people's real stories.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:01.470
In the first issue, when
all this stuff was going on

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.010
in the NFL, you know, with the
players fighting the women,

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:06.460
there's those elements in there.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.842
People actually thought we
saw the NFL thing and said,

00:17:08.842 --> 00:17:09.800
we're going to do this.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.550
No, we thought all this out.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.270
We want to talk
about these things

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:16.329
before they become big issues,
so we could prevent it.

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.780
Whether people know
it or not, when

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.920
rap was-- when hip hop was
first starting in the '80s,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.450
you had Run and
DMC saying be cool.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.099
Go to school.

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:26.807
Don't mess with drugs
and you'll be cool.

00:17:26.807 --> 00:17:29.390
You had Public Enemy
saying, fight the power.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.810
You had Paris One
saying teach yourself.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.290
The thing about our universe,
even though it was F'd up,

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.490
there was poverty, crime,
people killing each other

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.530
in gang fights and all
that, we were good.

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.200
We were using our style.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.150
He walk in there
with those sneakers,

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.570
and you going to look at him.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.560
Now is this attractive?

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.310
But then when you walk over
and talk to Ed as a young man,

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.270
you're not going to get the B
word and the ho word and this

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.050
and that, and what's
up [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.091
word and stuff like that.

00:17:56.091 --> 00:17:58.020
You'll be able to talk
about something good.

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:01.230
And it goes back to the point
where even those kids that were

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.420
in the gangs, even the pimps
and the pushers in our era,

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.790
if they saw creativity
and positivity--

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.916
You know, people used to
tell me and Run, you all

00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:10.040
got to get off that corner.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.040
You all going places.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.290
You don't need to be out here.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.140
I'm looking at this
world we live in now,

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.950
America celebrates stupidity,
ignorance, and illiteracy.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.960
The more trouble you
get, the more women you

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.820
sleep with, the more stupid
stuff you do, you celebrate it,

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.570
especially if it makes us money.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.160
Our world was kind of different.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.500
We've even made iced tea
and all these guys said, wo,

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.380
there's power in positivity.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.450
And that's what this
book represents.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.920
Use your creative.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.080
Use your mind.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.959
Use your soul.

00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:39.000
You know what I'm saying?

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.010
Enjoy what you're doing but
with that with your flavor,

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:44.620
you can really change the world.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.790
I mean Run DMC did it,
but there's no Run DMC

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.130
if there was no Grandmaster
Flash telling you broken glass

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.100
everywhere.

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.850
There's no vision if
[INAUDIBLE] see the message was,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:57.960
this is messed up.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.416
But then Afrika Bambaataa,
which was the biggest street

00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:02.540
gang in New York, right
they were the Black Spades.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.320
They changed their name to the
Zulu Nation to be positive.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.830
And they make the record
Planet Rock with the vision,

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.890
we know a place
where it's all right.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:13.506
So this place here
is that place,

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:14.630
even though it looks crazy.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.290
But here's the deeper question.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:18.240
We threw a wrench to y'all.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.865
Is it the '80s?

00:19:18.865 --> 00:19:21.031
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
Because one of the things

00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:23.390
we wanted to play with,
kind of like looking

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.180
at other comic
cultures, like you

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.610
had-- the best example
is Bruce Timm, who

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.080
created the entire
Batman animated universe.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.980
And here it is like,
you're watching the show,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.960
and you're like, am I watching
a show based in the 1930s

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.160
or is this right now?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.480
So what we wanted to do is kind
of like take a tip of the hat

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.744
to that, tip of the
black crown to that.

00:19:46.744 --> 00:19:48.910
Because we were like, well
you know, everyone always

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.670
feels that in literature or
even comic book, graphic novel

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.750
storytelling, that
the only period

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.640
you can actually pay tribute
to is the '20s or the '30s.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.010
It's the noir era.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.530
So we were like we'll
create-- F that.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.950
We're going to create our
own era to give tribute to.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.200
And it's going to be the '80s.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.690
So we're going to create a
universe that looks like 1980s

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.360
New York.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.850
And it turns out,
technology, only

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.390
if it's organically
woven into the story,

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.600
doesn't have to be, because
technology as we all

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.910
know in this room,
continually is evolving,

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.830
you know what I mean.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.735
So our universe is definitely,
like an homage, like Darryl

00:20:21.735 --> 00:20:24.580
was saying, to this era
that we all grew up in,

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.170
is a richer story.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.030
And also from a superhero
storytelling point,

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:32.280
it makes more sense than a
city that looks like this

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.480
and this era needs saving.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.640
When you look at a city
now, with like shiny condos

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.810
everywhere, it's like, you
know what needs saving?

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.880
Can you save me an
apartment with cheaper rent?

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.527
I don't know.

00:20:41.527 --> 00:20:42.860
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Exactly.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.640
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
And then one of the things

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.664
we did, obviously the
story is one thing,

00:20:45.664 --> 00:20:47.830
but one of the things that
we're doing and embracing

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.640
is-- and Riggs actually
coined this phrase,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.810
we're embracing what we're now
calling the B-Boy geek era.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.060
Because what a lot of
people don't realize,

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.110
there's a lot of individuals,
such as Darryl and myself,

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.220
we are where we
are in our careers.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.640
But there's still that nerd
side of us that is who we are.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.610
We were persecuted
for being different.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.770
We were persecuted for
liking different things.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.320
But yet here we
are, creating an era

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.390
and creating a kind of
like our own contribution

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.410
to pop culture with our
book in our own way.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.280
And we call it the B-Boy geek.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.929
You know, because it's is
something that we appreciate.

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:26.220
It's something that we respect.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.303
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
And those things are cool.

00:21:28.303 --> 00:21:31.380
It's cool to be a geek and
be creative and be smart.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.350
Not to be afraid to express
what you like in life.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.614
I'm proud that my son
and my wife are geeks.

00:21:36.614 --> 00:21:39.030
MALE SPEAKER: Probably a lot
of smart people in this room.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.910
So we're actually going to
open it up to some questions.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.750
We have microphones in both
the aisles if you guys--

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.510
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Superman
and Batman were having a fight.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.400
Giving me an inspiration
for a song I can write.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.150
Now when I came along as
the son of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.450
my physical form is
how I celebrate life.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.190
No, I don't need a preacher
and I don't need to preach.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.770
Just give me mellow Moe Dee
on the beat with the speech.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.720
I've got a good reputation
because I rep for the streets.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:05.550
And for your information
I am King of the Geeks.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:08.760
I get to speak hard because
I hit the beat hard.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.620
It's DMC, y'all and I'm
in the streets hard.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.040
You see this belt buckle?

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.930
I wear it all day, so
every time that you see me,

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.470
I am chilling with J.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:23.918 --> 00:22:25.960
Geeks rule.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.872
People are geeks.

00:22:28.924 --> 00:22:31.590
MALE SPEAKER: Step up to the mic
if you have a question, please.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.740
Thank you.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.360
That was awesome.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.080
AUDIENCE: So as
you're aware, Marvel's

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.724
coming up with a bunch of
crossover classic hip hop--

00:22:40.724 --> 00:22:41.890
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Yes.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:42.530
Album covers.

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.270
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.334
I was wondering if any
of your records are--

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:47.500
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Yes.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.120
Can't tell you which
one, but it's coming.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.750
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:50.660
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
I can't tell.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.680
AUDIENCE: Which one
would you like if it

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.214
wasn't the one that you wanted?

00:22:53.214 --> 00:22:54.630
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Excuse me?

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:55.640
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
He said which one would you

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.020
like it to be?

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.470
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Oh, yeah.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:59.430
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:00.630
That's not going to fly.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:01.410
Sorry, bro.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.910
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: All of them.

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:03.680
All of them.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.180
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
The thing

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.230
that it is-- can I
see the graphic novel?

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.850
The thing that's
dope about that is

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:12.609
that-- OK, we love and we
grew up on comics, Marvel, DC,

00:23:12.609 --> 00:23:13.650
and everything like that.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.266
So the fact that Marvel is
doing a tribute to hip hop,

00:23:16.266 --> 00:23:17.640
I think, it's
fresh, because it's

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.890
kind of like a full circle.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:21.920
And in the back of our
graphic novel, all we did

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.010
is give tribute in our
way to Marvel Comics.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.450
So it's like a
full circle for us.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.570
Like this is a Jim Steranko
Hulk annual number one

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:30.590
that we reinterpreted.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:33.190
This is a "Web of Spiderman"
number one that we interpreted.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.050
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
It's a "Wolverine."

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.301
We took all of their stuff
and did me as their covers.

00:23:36.301 --> 00:23:37.883
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: So the fact

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:40.650
that they're doing that, that
just shows us and shows them

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.810
that there's actually mutual
love and mutual respect

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.730
and you know what, its pop
culture loving pop culture.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:48.700
Because DC Comics did
it early in the year.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.000
DC Comics actually did
variance of all these movies.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.900
They redid "Superfly,"
"Superman."

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.820
They redid Bruce Lee's
"Enter the Dragon"

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.320
with Grayson, Dick Grayson.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.380
So I think it's fresh.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.130
I think it's dope that
they're doing that.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.380
MALE SPEAKER: What's up buddy?

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.510
AUDIENCE: Dude, it is
so cool to meet you man.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.860
I was born the year that
your namesake, album Run DMC

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.815
came out, and like to become a
fan once like, I could talk--

00:24:11.815 --> 00:24:13.440
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Where you from?

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.310
AUDIENCE: Originally Florida.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.640
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: OK.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.620
Right on.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.500
AUDIENCE: It was really
cool to like experience Run

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.790
DMC in the '90s when I was
like becoming a fan of music.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.040
So thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:27.824
That led to-- actually
I have two questions.

00:24:27.824 --> 00:24:29.365
First, was like part
of your contract

00:24:29.365 --> 00:24:31.823
that you have to wear Adidas
every time you're with Darryl?

00:24:31.823 --> 00:24:33.087
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:33.087 --> 00:24:34.920
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
It would be wise to.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.280
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: The
thing about Adidas and Run DMC

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.280
is that because of Run DMC,
Run DMC were the first group

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.710
to get an endorsement deal
with a sneaker company that

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.030
were non-athletic.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.546
And that happened
one day, was it

00:24:46.546 --> 00:24:48.170
when you guys were
doing a Philly show?

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:48.910
And it was like, 65,000--

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.285
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Yeah,
yeah, and we'd tell people,

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:53.890
hold your Adidas up and the
whole concept held up Adidas.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.431
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
So if that

00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:57.840
doesn't show the power of the
consumer to a corporation.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.673
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
This the first time,

00:24:59.673 --> 00:25:02.690
like usually when you do hip
hop, when you see hip pop

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.690
comics or cartoons,
they'll have a sneaker

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.910
with two stripes or one
stripe that looks like Adidas.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.730
This is the first time--

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:11.080
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Adidas

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.080
is on a comic book cover.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.360
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
On a comic book cover.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.340
That's crazy.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.804
That's how real we wanted to be.

00:25:16.804 --> 00:25:19.470
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: But D
does a lot of work with Adidas.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.928
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:20.928 --> 00:25:22.679
Adidas, three stripes for life.

00:25:22.679 --> 00:25:23.470
I can't go nowhere.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.200
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
Brand loyalty right here.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.449
AUDIENCE: That's amazing, man.

00:25:26.449 --> 00:25:31.734
That might be like the
longest shoe endorsement.

00:25:31.734 --> 00:25:33.400
And my second question,
you were talking

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.280
about how hip hop not only
gave rise to the music,

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.659
but to graffiti, to--

00:25:37.659 --> 00:25:40.200
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, writers, directors.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.658
AUDIENCE: Break
dancing, et cetera.

00:25:41.658 --> 00:25:44.955
And it also gave rise to the
fifth element of hip hop, which

00:25:44.955 --> 00:25:46.880
is beatboxing.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.570
In this very room, actually
won the talent show,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.370
the Google talent show
for the beatboxing.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.860
I do, "It's Tricky."

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.769
I also do "Walk This Way."

00:25:55.769 --> 00:25:57.602
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
You got to do it.

00:25:57.602 --> 00:25:58.590
You got to do it.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.566
[RAPPING "IT'S TRICKY"]

00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:52.743
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:52.743 --> 00:26:55.118
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Come
on up here and give me some.

00:26:55.118 --> 00:26:55.659
Give me some.

00:26:55.659 --> 00:26:56.582
That was bad, man.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.305
Darryl McDaniels,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.358
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
That was awesome.

00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:14.480
AUDIENCE: That was the most
fun I'm going to have all week

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.770
and it's not even
1:00 on a Monday.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:17.470
Thank you.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.345
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
You know, it's funny.

00:27:19.345 --> 00:27:20.990
If you know it's
funny too, I remember

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.650
when Ed and Riggs was
really trying to convince

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.030
me to do this comic book.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.010
And now, people that's
picking up the comic book,

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.650
they're a going back to
listen to the early records.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:36.260
In 1985, when we did "King
of Rock--" "King of Rock,"

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:38.030
if you listen, there's
a line in there

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.410
where Run knew he wanted
to be the best MC.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:44.590
If you all know the movie
"Krush Groove," Run,

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.822
he actually acted
that in the movie.

00:27:46.822 --> 00:27:48.030
But that was his personality.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.210
That was his drive.

00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.077
F you, Russel.

00:27:50.077 --> 00:27:50.660
This and that.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.280
I'm Run.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.530
I'm going to be--
Who's house is there?

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.571
All of that was in there.

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:56.770
Everything in the movie
is who Run is as a person.

00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:00.130
If you listen to the record,
Run used to be Kurtis Blow's DJ.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.870
He was Kurtis Blow's
disco son DJ Run.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.840
So he knew how to
DJ really good.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.650
He knew how to rap.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:07.660
Kurtis Blow would say,
ladies and gentlemen, I'm

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.654
going to bring out
my disco son, DJ Run.

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:11.820
And Run would come out at
12 years old, kick a rhyme

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.100
and get on a turntable.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.850
Cutest thing ever.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.780
So in King of Rock, there's
a rhyme where Run goes,

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:17.410
I'm DJ Run.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.560
I can scratch.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.300
I don't go, I'm DMC, I can rap.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.310
I'm DMC, I can draw.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:27.120
Even in 19-- it was almost
like it took 1986 for me

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.830
to put down my
pencil where I used

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.470
to draw all the covers of
Marvel and stuff like that

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.992
and go full time with the mic.

00:28:32.992 --> 00:28:34.450
But if you listen
the King of Rock,

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:36.450
if you listen to
all my records--

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.470
remember I was telling
you about my confidence.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.001
When I made my first
record, I didn't

00:28:41.001 --> 00:28:43.000
know you had to get up
in front of people to it.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.330
I was a shy little kid.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.100
that I'm thinking, OK, I'll
made this record with you, Joe,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.100
because if they play
a record on the radio,

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.750
nobody got to see you, right?

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.500
So they played the
record on Mr. Magic,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.230
and Red Alert every weekend.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.426
And they started playing
it during the week.

00:28:57.426 --> 00:28:58.800
And then the record
became a hit.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.460
So Run calls me, yo,
we got to go on tour.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:03.520
And this was '84 with
the first two singles

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.590
that we started making.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.090
Run was like, we're
going to make this album.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.810
And we're going to make another
album, whatever, whatever.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.970
If you listen to "King of Rock,"
if you listen all my lyrics,

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:15.300
my delivery, my style, my
presence, crash through walls,

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.120
come through floors,
bust through ceilings,

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.030
knock down doors.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:20.780
That's all superhero writing.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.130
Marvel Comics.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.570
The amazing description,
"Spiderman" title,

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:31.470
"The Incredible Hulk," the
devastating mind-controlling

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:32.545
DMC.

00:29:32.545 --> 00:29:37.770
My whole presence, my whole
delivery, my whole existence,

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.610
my whole confidence, came
from those sacred, beautiful,

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:45.930
artistic, ideological,
if that's a word,

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:49.080
to the point where, I think
it was like 15 years ago,

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.539
Rolling Stone
Magazine did a thing.

00:29:50.539 --> 00:29:52.996
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ: And
they interviewed Chris Rock.

00:29:52.996 --> 00:29:55.700
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Run DMC,
what's the big fucking deal?

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.380
So they asked journalists
and writers and everybody,

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.717
other MCs, you know, what
do you like about Run DMC?

00:30:01.717 --> 00:30:03.300
Why were they able
to do what they do?

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.320
Chris Rock said this.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.580
This is 15 years ago.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.260
He goes, Run and J were cool.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.670
But DMC, he was
like my superhero.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.060
The way he sounded, his
delivery, and the way he

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.930
looked and dressed.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.720
And my joke was, oh my
god, I've been discovered.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.540
Because I'm really a superhero.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.514
So don't let the book fool
you, it's just a cover.

00:30:25.514 --> 00:30:27.180
I was just about to
go down in the world

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.470
when Ed and Riggs is going to
release me to save the world.

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.020
But you know, all
of those elements

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.020
was there and that all
came from the comic book.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.570
That all came from,
you know, Chuck D, when

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.620
me and Jam Master
Jay, rest in peace,

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.010
when we first heard Chuck D
out at Adelphi University,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.110
people don't know that
Chuck D was a graphic art

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.450
student at Adelphi
University, high honors.

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:52.837
When we walked into
WBAU radio station,

00:30:52.837 --> 00:30:54.670
they have this little
college radio station,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.850
I just got to put this in here.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:56.975
This is the funniest thing.

00:30:56.975 --> 00:31:00.370
Our first interview ever was
with Hank Shockley, Keith

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:03.285
Shockley, Chuck D, Mr.
Bill, Bill Stephanie

00:31:03.285 --> 00:31:05.410
out at Adelphi University,
before they were public,

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.000
they were Spectrum City.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.440
So we get our first interview.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.595
We trot up from Hollis
to Adelphi University

00:31:10.595 --> 00:31:11.730
in Long Island.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:16.340
When we walked in there,
the first thing we saw

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.760
was this black dude with
a clock on his neck,

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:23.421
answering the phone, going, yo,
G. With a styrofoam of chicken

00:31:23.421 --> 00:31:23.920
wings.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.830
That was Flavor Flav.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:28.050
But I remember when we
heard Chuck D's music,

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.180
we heard Chuck D's voice, and
we ran to Rick Reuben and Russel

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.500
and we said, God has
come down from heaven.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.170
So there was always these
super powerful-- and the break

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.150
dancers with their
skills and the voices

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.930
of Melle Mel and Chuck D, all
of those things were relevant.

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:47.040
And it was just amazing
how Chris Rock felt it.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.170
Now people's going back
and listening to my music

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:50.880
and saying, oh,
we understand why

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:54.610
DMC was so devastating, because
it all came from comic books.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:56.110
AUDIENCE: I don't
know how I'm going

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.584
to follow on for the last act.

00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:58.500
You sabotaged me, man.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.355
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
You have to stand

00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:00.646
on your head or something.

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:02.890
[LAUGHING]

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.640
AUDIENCE: Thanks, first
of all for coming.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.260
This is amazing.

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:07.051
We get a lot of cool
people that come here,

00:32:07.051 --> 00:32:08.860
but this is definitely
right up there.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.560
So thanks a lot
for being with us.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.750
My question is around
one of the comments

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.590
you made around
negativity in America,

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.470
potentially the
world, celebrating

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.750
negativity and number
of-- all the bad things

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.911
you mentioned before.

00:32:22.911 --> 00:32:24.660
What does the sort of
artist that you guys

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.160
look at in today's era
of hip hop or music

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.560
on a broader perspective
that are actually

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.307
keeping it real to the essence
of what hip pop stood for?

00:32:34.307 --> 00:32:36.390
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
Well, I still look at--

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.140
AUDIENCE: Or people that
inspire you right now.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.890
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
In the hip hop,

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.330
I still look
outside of just MCs.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:44.440
Rock Steady Crew to me is still
like a model of positivity.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.060
One of my close
friends, Crazy Legs,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.700
he does international
work with Rock City Crew.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.760
He's taught B-Boy classes
from like Latin America

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.660
to countries in Africa.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.280
And I look at what
graffiti writers are doing,

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.225
like Mare 139 actually curates
a lot of art exhibitions

00:33:02.225 --> 00:33:04.920
where he actually
brings in children

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.484
and he shares the
culture in that way.

00:33:07.484 --> 00:33:09.150
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
And spoken word.

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:12.190
Like when you go to
a spoken word event,

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.230
you hear about
the issues, right?

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:15.660
And you hear from
people's heart.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.460
That's what hip hop used to be.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.450
Now don't get me wrong.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.840
You can get your money
and you can have your fun,

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.440
but hip hop is a little
different from any other part

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.720
of show business.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.680
I mean not too different
from rock and roll,

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.667
but it's a little different
from any other music business

00:33:30.667 --> 00:33:32.500
because hip hop is
different because there's

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.240
a responsibility.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.920
There's a responsibility.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:40.310
When you think of the term
so-called gangster rap.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.999
You know, Ginger Baker, I just
saw the documentary of Ginger

00:33:43.999 --> 00:33:45.040
Baker and it was amazing.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.490
Because he said,
the fucking music.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.190
You don't put my
fucking music in a box.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.330
I remember there was an
interview with Q-tip or Talib,

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.930
one of them.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.170
It was like, took it like, what
do you mean, backpack rapper?

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.170
I'm a rapper that raps
about positive stuff.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.230
So once we started doing
that-- and that only happened

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.019
to legitimize negativity.

00:34:05.019 --> 00:34:07.060
To give it a turn, it's
going to be gangster rap.

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.476
So if you do gangster rap,
you're making money, it's cool.

00:34:09.476 --> 00:34:10.670
No, it's wrong.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:13.270
And only thing that will
make a gangster record right

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.889
is, on that very
record, you tell

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.199
the kids, on that very record
of verse, the next verse

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:18.420
should be, don't use the gun.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.530
You could tell your story.

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:20.790
That was the difference.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.370
We cared about the audience.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.920
You know, right
now what I'm really

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.969
listening to is classic rock.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:28.500
Classic rock doesn't mean old.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.460
Classic means better
than everything that

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.350
comes after it for eternity.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.260
And the reason why I
was-- No, it's true.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260
I say that on the radio.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.531
They always go, turn it off.

00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:37.870
Say that again.

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.659
But the reason why it's
better than everything

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:42.080
after it, because
think about what

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.360
was happening in
the '50s and '60s

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.239
still happening now, right?

00:34:46.239 --> 00:34:47.050
All of the issues.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:49.400
The thing that was cool
about hip hop is, see,

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.670
it's a little different now.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:58.550
Somebody will hear, you
know Jeru the Damaja record,

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:01.500
and go, that Little
Wayne or T.I. is using,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.370
and go, why that guy
using Little Wayne record?

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:04.940
No.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.340
Little Wayne and
T.I. Got it from him.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.370
But Jeru got it from Miles
Davis or Grover Washington

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.090
or whatever.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.950
One of the things
that we did when

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:18.747
we were sampling and stealing
from the very institution that

00:35:18.747 --> 00:35:20.872
allowed hip hop to be
inducted in the Rock and Roll

00:35:20.872 --> 00:35:22.455
Hall of Fame, we
stole all your music.

00:35:22.455 --> 00:35:23.640
Made our own songs about it.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.910
But when we sample Lennon
or when we sample Dylan,

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.840
or when we sample Fogerty,
we didn't just say,

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:32.430
oh, these guys are
rich rock stars.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.530
Then we start reading,
oh, shit, John Lennon

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.870
slept naked at the protests
of the Vietnam War.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.960
We knew we had a
responsibility there.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.436
These kids now, they don't know.

00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:42.060
I'm telling you, you
can get your money

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.510
and go to all the
parties that you Well,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:48.600
when you make a full album
of throwing up gang signs

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.942
and saying negativity,
your audience

00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:53.080
is going to look
for what's next.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.710
Is hip hop
responsibility to give

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.820
When you listen to Geto Boy's
"Mind Playing Tricks on Me,"

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.610
Scarface wasn't saying-- I
don't want to say no names.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:05.370
Like the guys now, hip hop
is like stupid America,

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.290
just because they're selling
records and they're on TMZ

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.520
and they're on
Entertainment Tonight.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.920
You know, they take
names from Mafia figures

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.220
and [INAUDIBLE] and drug lords,
I always got to check the kids.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.489
I said, this guy
don't have an army.

00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:20.280
He not a drug lord.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.960
He don't own territory.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.440
He's probably selling drugs
in a five block radius

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.884
of your own neighborhood.

00:36:25.884 --> 00:36:27.550
He's the reason why
your mom is on crack

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:28.890
and your father's in jail.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.830
And the kids go, geez!

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.577
And then the don't
have nothing to do.

00:36:32.577 --> 00:36:34.660
But when you listen to
"Scarface" or "Mind Playing

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.270
Tricks on You," he said,
at night, I can't sleep.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:38.790
I don't want to
sell these drugs.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.180
I'm in church, Lord, I'm
looking for answers and stuff

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:41.860
like that.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.940
Nowadays, it's almost like I
hate when "Time Magazine," I'm

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.950
talking about the most powerful
publications and institutions,

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.580
they'll talk about successful
rappers from the hood.

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:57.770
And they'll go, former drug
dealer, former crack dealer,

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.760
now CEO of a record
company or liquor store,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:03.590
it makes them-- without
explaining this to them,

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.650
they go, wow, I could
sell crack and be famous.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:07.520
That's what our
kids really think.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:11.880
They see a rapper nowadays
on TV, how many times he done

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.290
got arrested.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.600
They drive a Lamborghini.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600
Here is the most
stupidest thing.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.350
Got a Lamborghini.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.685
You ain't got no license.

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:19.390
You ain't got no
license plates on it.

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.760
You got unlicensed weapons.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.140
And pounds of weed in there.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:25.020
But the kids are seeing that
because of who they are,

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.470
they thinking that's cool.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:27.300
And it's wrong.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.520
At least, you know
Scarface and the X-Clan,

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.915
even Ice-T had
morals to his story.

00:37:33.915 --> 00:37:35.625
And I remember
when I rapped, I'm

00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:38.910
DMC in a place to be, I
knew I had a responsibility.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.020
But I wasn't the first to do it.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.410
Here's something.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.500
Before rap records--
he lived in that era.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.541
You know what I'm saying?

00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:47.720
I'm the all powerful
mighty DMC, but one

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.550
of the things that makes
this publication work is he

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:52.740
comes from the Bronx.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:55.680
I grew up in suburban
lower middle class Queens.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.780
I had to walk three blocks
to get what he-- He told me

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.270
about getting evicted.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.030
The heat being off.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.340
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: I
walked through the broken glass

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.730
everywhere.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.040
People pissing on the corner
like they just don't care.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.262
The message was my reality.

00:38:07.262 --> 00:38:08.470
I walked through vacant lots.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.386
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
He saw that every day,

00:38:10.386 --> 00:38:12.260
but still we had
this creativity.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:15.780
I was in my little world
and I was identifying that.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.690
So one of the things
that happened to me

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.830
was-- and this goes along
with the whole responsibility

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.050
thing and the power.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.400
Before Kool Moe Dee, you
all heard of Kool Moe Dee?

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.060
Remember the infamous battle
of Kool Moe Dee and LL

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.594
in the '90s?

00:38:27.594 --> 00:38:29.010
That whole how do
you like me now?

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.710
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Google it.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:30.830
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: Yeah,
Google it if you don't know.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.190
LL and Kool Moe Dee
had a historic battle.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:37.650
Well, before Kool Moe Dee
was successful solo artist,

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.890
commercially
successful in hip, he

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.020
was in this group called
The Treacherous Three MCs.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.600
This is before rap records.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.160
And in my era, let's
just say that when

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.750
people ask me, who's better Jay
Z or Eminem, back in the day,

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:51.710
it was who better, Kool
Moe Dee or Melle Mel?

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:55.970
So Treacherous Three invented
the fast rap, all of this stuff

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:57.620
that our generations
don't know about.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:00.210
But here's this little
kid, Catholic school kid,

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:02.230
from lower suburban
middle class Queens,

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:07.520
I get this Treacherous Three
record and Obama's campaign

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.010
was called, yes, we can, right?

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.430
Remember when he first came,
it was called, yes, we can.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.920
In 1982, the Treacherous Three
made a record called, Yes, We

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.150
Can Can.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.680
And they took The Pointer
Sisters song, (SINGING)

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.080
I know we can make it.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.970
I know that we can.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.360
I know darn well.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.620
that we could work it out.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:25.710
Oh, yes we can can.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:26.756
Doobadoobadoob.

00:39:26.756 --> 00:39:28.630
And they was kicking
rhymes about everything.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.550
And the record
started like this.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:31.420
This is '82.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.380
(SINGING) Evil
destruction, tax deduction,

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.330
price inflation rocks the
nation and unemployment

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.110
is on the rise.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.240
It's hard to find a compromise.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.030
But if it lasts like this
for a long enough time,

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:48.810
won't lead to nothing but
a higher level of crime.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.510
So we say-- and then
they just went and talked

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.360
about the problems
that existed then.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.360
Go play that record now.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.196
Everything happening
there, happening now.

00:39:56.196 --> 00:39:58.570
But then I got to the point
where the MC break off and do

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.320
their freestyle.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:02.050
So Kool Moe Dee was
just known for being

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.320
the Eminem of our era.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.800
He'll battle you and
disrespectful you and make

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.480
you want to just leave New York
and never show your face again.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.580
But he knew he had
enough responsibility,

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.360
and this is the rap
that changed my life.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:20.787
And it's about, this is not
about censorship and censorship

00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:21.870
and what's the other word?

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.850
Telling people what they can
say or what they can't do.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:26.270
This is about genocide.

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.370
It's about genocide.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:28.620
So he says this rhyme.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:32.130
He goes, once a nobody
from the neighborhood

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.470
took a hop to the
top because I knew

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:38.210
that I would excel over the
rest because I make progress.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:40.770
I don't consider it luck
because I'm not blessed.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.760
He said, I've got my
life full together.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.270
Love the way that I live.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:45.660
Go to school, really cool.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.600
And I think positive because
this so right to have fun.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.250
Lots of pleasures
enjoyed but it's

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.830
brain that separates
the men from the boys.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.720
So here's this little
Catholic school

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.690
comic book reading
nerd hearing Kool Moe

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.820
Dee from the dirty, ill,
war torn Bronx saying

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.297
it's cool to go to school.

00:41:04.297 --> 00:41:05.880
Then I did more
research, found out he

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.980
was a straight A student.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.930
Found out that he was
in college and all that.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:11.760
So when I got my time
to shine with Run.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.330
And Run said, DMC and if you're
ready, people rock steady.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:16.330
Driving big cars.

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.057
Get your gas from Getty.

00:41:18.057 --> 00:41:19.640
I ain't going to
rhyme about no gangs.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.540
I was never in a gang.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.140
I ain't going to
rhyme about jail.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.940
I've never been to jail.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.398
And I tell kids,
I don't want to go

00:41:25.398 --> 00:41:27.184
to jail because I like freedom.

00:41:27.184 --> 00:41:28.600
I tell kids, I
ain't shoot nobody.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.641
I don't want to get shot
because that shit hurts.

00:41:30.641 --> 00:41:32.480
And the kids always laugh.

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:35.990
But when it was my time, I said
I'm DMC in the place to be.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.780
I go with that power
and the energy.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.200
I go to St John's University.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.076
Since kindergarten, I
acquired the knowledge.

00:41:42.076 --> 00:41:43.950
After 12th grade, I went
straight to college.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:45.710
Here's how I want to
answer your question.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.150
15 years later, 15
years later, I'm

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.170
just talking about the power
of taking that responsibility.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.090
Little steps do big things.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:56.510
15 later I'm at a
radio interview.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.490
Guy calls in.

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.156
You know how you go
to hip hop stations.

00:41:59.156 --> 00:42:00.610
You get calls, you take calls.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:00.810
Who this?

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.510
Yeah, this is Peanut
from Dallas, Texas.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.795
Yo, DMC, man.

00:42:03.795 --> 00:42:05.420
I just want to tell
you something, man.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:09.740
Just for you LL, Public Enemy,
Run DMC, Will Smith, Jazzy

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.595
Jeff, saying, what
you're saying,

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.970
just for-- you all didn't
preach it to us, you're saying,

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:15.310
you said it with conviction.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:16.920
He said, man, I was gangbanging.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.070
I was selling weed.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.440
So here goes my hero,
my superhero, DMC,

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.740
telling me school is cool.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.410
He said, I thought I had it all.

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:25.729
I had Adidas with no laces.

00:42:25.729 --> 00:42:26.520
I had the Gazelles.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.550
I had the big old chain.

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:28.550
I had the Mercedes Benz.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:29.600
I was selling weed.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.150
I had my girls and all that.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.970
DMC's talking about he went
to St John's University.

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.370
He said, just so he could
really have the total package.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.180
Not only with the
weed and the liquor

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.570
and all of that and the cars
and the Adidas and the stuff

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:43.620
like the Gazelle.

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:47.050
He said, man I went and got
a GED, just so I could say,

00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.650
man, I got a total package.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:49.430
That's hip hop.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:53.200
He's thinking, man, to be
that awesome, I need that.

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.100
The negative stuff,
that's the low stuff.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.891
I got to have that.

00:42:55.891 --> 00:42:57.960
He said, man, when
I got that GED, I

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.347
was able to take college courses
at the local community college.

00:43:01.347 --> 00:43:02.930
He said, when I
walked in those doors,

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.450
I saw a whole world of
possibility that I never seen.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:09.660
Now hip hop nowadays
is not showing the kids

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:11.382
the whole world of possibility.

00:43:11.382 --> 00:43:13.340
You know, and all of you
all know when you see,

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.920
when you look at Sports Center,
most of our kids either think,

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.090
I can be a drug dealer
or I can be a gangbanger

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.760
or I could be an athlete.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.610
Me and Ed want to
let these kids know,

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.020
I don't care if you live
in the dirt poor ghetto,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.429
you can go work at Google, dude.

00:43:28.429 --> 00:43:29.470
You know what I'm saying?

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.289
Don't be ashamed that
you like to color.

00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:32.330
You know what I'm saying?

00:43:32.330 --> 00:43:34.860
Don't be ashamed that you like
polka dots and all of that.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.290
That's what this
book represents.

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.210
That's what our art
represents about.

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:43.550
There's a lot artists out there
should be played on the radio.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.580
But they don't.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.160
In thinking about that, I don't
believe a conspiracy theories.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:50.770
But think about old school.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.009
And think about this.

00:43:52.009 --> 00:43:53.300
Thing about old school at noon.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:53.950
I go like this.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.424
I'd prefer that there wasn't
an old school at noon.

00:43:56.424 --> 00:43:58.590
The radio will go, no,
that's giving tribute to you.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.756
You should be proud of that.

00:43:59.756 --> 00:44:02.030
I say, I prefer if you
don't play my music at all

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.904
if you gonna do that.

00:44:02.904 --> 00:44:03.590
And they go why?

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.340
Think about this, you all.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:05.923
When they play the
old school at noon,

00:44:05.923 --> 00:44:09.750
I'm talking about kids,
when-- I'm 51 years old.

00:44:09.750 --> 00:44:11.240
But when I changed
the world, I was

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.580
the age of all the rappers
in the audience out now.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:14.300
Right?

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.370
So when you play me
old school at noon,

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:18.570
during the weekdays, two things.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:20.200
Where are the kids?

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.020
In school.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.180
Where the parents?

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:22.680
At work.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.040
When the kids get
out of school at 3:00

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.100
and they turn the radio
on, what do they hear?

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.220
All that stuff that they
shouldn't be hearing.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:34.400
They need to hear somebody 16,
17, 18, and 19 talking like PE,

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.240
Chuck D, Geto Boys and
Will Smith, but they don't.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:39.740
So I'm like, how
can I conquer that?

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:43.129
I could sit here all day and
curse out the radio stations.

00:44:43.129 --> 00:44:44.670
But I'm saying, I
could say tomorrow,

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.110
let's go to every radio
station in the United States

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.700
that play that crap
that's poisoning

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.982
the other part of the brain
that the kids can use.

00:44:51.982 --> 00:44:54.315
I'm not saying that they can't
have fun and go and smoke

00:44:54.315 --> 00:44:55.052
the weed.

00:44:55.052 --> 00:44:57.260
Cause the part of the brain
that's not being touched,

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.968
I could say that nobody
going to show up.

00:44:58.968 --> 00:45:01.460
So how me, Ed, and Riggs
going to counter that?

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:03.840
We're going to take them
to the universe that's

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.390
going to do something
when they open

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.070
the pages of the
book the same way

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.111
that it did something to
a little Catholic school

00:45:09.111 --> 00:45:11.770
kid, that not only
was successful in rap,

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.730
but was able to
change the world.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:16.286
The groups that need
to be on the radio 24/7

00:45:16.286 --> 00:45:20.000
and ain't, that's who I'm
saying we knew as young people,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.930
hip hop isn't just about--
you can be a rapper right now.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:24.140
You might not even get hurt.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.810
You've got the
best message ever.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.529
So I mean, we're part of that.

00:45:27.529 --> 00:45:28.570
You guys is part of that.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.461
You guys is part of telling
all these little kids.

00:45:31.461 --> 00:45:32.960
All right, it's
good that you've got

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.210
your mixed tape but come
over here and let me show you

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:35.940
something.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.330
People showed us stuff.

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:39.010
And we had to take
upon ourselves,

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.670
how are we going to present
ourselves creatively,

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.430
artistically, or, like
Ed, intellectually.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.680
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
So even with our publishing

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.899
company, we take a very
socially responsible approach

00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:50.190
to everything that we're doing.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.965
It isn't simply about
storytelling for profit's sake.

00:45:52.965 --> 00:45:56.070
It's storytelling
for posterity's sake.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:58.930
You know, I look at my son
and I look at my nephews,

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.580
and I want to tell stories that
I'm proud that they can share,

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.380
and they can read, and that they
can share with their friends.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.450
And my son, [? Keyon, ?] is
constantly giving me ideas.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:09.200
We should do this.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.280
You should lose this character.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.490
And it gives me
so much pride when

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:16.787
he can come into the studio and
actually see on the big screens

00:46:16.787 --> 00:46:18.370
all of the different
panels that we're

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:19.950
working out for the next book.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.570
Because it's not a
fad for us either.

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:23.470
This is our first
book, but we're

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.770
in knee deep production
for our second book.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.740
And again, like as
fans of the industry,

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:32.630
I get to work with a lot of
legends, a lot of young talent

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.880
that never had an opportunity,
like Darryl was saying.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.380
And a lot of like
talent in general.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.740
Like the next book
has talent that

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.160
ranges from artists
in their early 20s

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.077
to artists in their
40s, some of which are--

00:46:43.077 --> 00:46:44.660
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Amy's writing.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:44.920
EDGARDO MIRANDA
RODRIGUEZ: Right.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.480
We have like Amy
Chu, she's writing

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.030
the second graphic novel.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.390
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: Cause dudes

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:51.348
don't know, without women,
we wouldn't be here.

00:46:51.348 --> 00:46:52.597
We gotta come from somewhere.

00:46:52.597 --> 00:46:53.930
Where's that energy coming from?

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:54.730
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
That diversity

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.480
for us is organic
to our storytelling.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.910
So it's a socially responsible
approach to the books.

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:01.250
And in terms of what
we're listening to,

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.060
what I'm listening to,
it's not so much artists.

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:07.420
Occasionally, out I'll check out
a dope song, the Kendrick Lamar

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.670
song, the Black of the Cherry.

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:11.300
I mean that was dope.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.290
Lupe Fiasco has a
lot of dope stuff.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:16.440
My favorite group right now
consistently making music

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.700
is Calle 13 straight
from Puerto Rico.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.790
They're like the most
politically, lyrically amazing

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:22.650
lyricists out there.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.600
And they're like, I'm just
going to rhyme in Spanish.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.319
And I love it.

00:47:25.319 --> 00:47:25.860
That's like--

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.950
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Be who you are.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:28.830
Any more questions?

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:31.420
MALE SPEAKER: We have
time for one more.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.020
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
Short answer, bro.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:32.497
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: I got you.

00:47:32.497 --> 00:47:33.930
I got you.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:35.640
So, D, I have to
say, growing up,

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.680
you were one of my big heroes.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.175
I'm a Jersey boy, goes
to camp, somebody hits

00:47:40.175 --> 00:47:42.260
play on the boom box
and it's "Hard Times."

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.380
Almost knocked me over.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.610
No stopping there.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:48.550
And I hate to end
on sort of a downer,

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.830
but I have to say
that I'm not sure what

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:55.490
happened with Jam Master Jay,
but it was a very sad day.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:56.490
I don't know if--

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:57.370
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Yeah, I'll talk about that.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:58.078
Yeah, definitely.

00:47:58.078 --> 00:48:00.510
I mean people always ask me now.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.830
They go, man, Run DMC
never glorified violence.

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:05.600
You know, we ain't
big of negativity.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.600
We only said like, three curse
words out of all our albums

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.610
and stuff like that.

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.400
How could that happen to Jay?

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:18.030
Now the very thing that Jam
Master Jay made it away from,

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:21.331
he went back to his neighborhood
to deliver everybody else

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:21.830
from--

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:22.410
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
That was beautiful.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:24.826
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: He
could have had his studio in LA

00:48:24.826 --> 00:48:26.571
around the block from Dr. Dre's.

00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:27.320
We live in Queens.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.770
He could have had his
studio around the corner

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:32.556
from Diddy's house,
whatever it's called,

00:48:32.556 --> 00:48:33.980
he changes his name so much.

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:34.830
His studio, right?

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:38.140
I don't know, Diddy's house,
Daddy's house, Shawn's house.

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.810
His studio was five minutes
from where he grew up.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:43.446
He went back to say,
this is the door.

00:48:43.446 --> 00:48:45.320
I don't know how we
going to figure this out.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.042
I don't care if you can't rhyme.

00:48:47.042 --> 00:48:48.125
You going to be secretary.

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.400
You going to be accountant.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.560
He went back.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.630
I describe it like this.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:55.620
And this is what our
world has to understand.

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:58.700
I'm not mad at the guy that
shot Jam Master Jay in the head

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.970
and killed him.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.060
How could you-- man, I'm
not mad at that individual.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.670
I'm mad at the mindset
that would cause that guy

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.269
to shoot Jam Master Jay.

00:49:08.269 --> 00:49:09.560
That's what I'm going to fight.

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.840
That's what I'm
fighting against.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.423
That's why I wear
this belt every day.

00:49:12.423 --> 00:49:14.070
Jay came from the hood.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.240
One thing you could
say about Jay,

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:21.850
he was that dude in Hollis
that didn't let the thugs mess

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:22.915
with the nerd.

00:49:22.915 --> 00:49:24.515
If Jay was playing
ball in the park

00:49:24.515 --> 00:49:28.240
and he seen the nerd
about to get robbed,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.490
he saw prosperity in that nerd.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.120
Yo, yo, yo, no, man, come on,
put that-- yo, go home, man.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.500
He was that dude.

00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:37.770
So that was the physical Jay.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:39.339
So people need to understand.

00:49:39.339 --> 00:49:40.380
How could you not be mad?

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.820
Don't be mad at the people
that do what they do.

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.230
What could we utilize
to change that so we

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:46.450
don't think like that.

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:46.900
You know what I'm saying?

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.191
Because it was a crazy loss
because the first thing you

00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:51.160
think is, Jay never
said, I'm going

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.650
to get shot a million times.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:53.590
And I'm bang bang.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.880
None of that was in it.

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:58.070
The very thing that
he made it away from,

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.240
he took and went
back to deliver.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:06.890
So once we teach these kids
self-respect and vision.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.890
What Jay represents,
that with the gun.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.760
All Jay is that guy
that didn't use the fun.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.150
When me and Run came to
Jay, we said this to Jay.

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:17.920
Jay was the number one DJ
in Hollis, Queens, New York.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.070
He had the Hollis crew.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.010
Jay was in the gang.

00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:22.830
Our gang was, Jay
was in the gang,

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.570
but one thing Jay didn't do,
he didn't let the gang mess

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.249
with lesser forces
of something that

00:50:27.249 --> 00:50:28.540
had vision and stuff like that.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.180
So me and Run go to
Jay and go, yo, Jay.

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.690
Run goes to Jay and goes,
Darryl-- Jay knew of me,

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:34.800
but he didn't know me.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.860
He said, me and Darryl
McDaniels from 197th Street

00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:39.130
made us a record.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:40.010
We need a DJ.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:41.014
You want to be our DJ?

00:50:41.014 --> 00:50:42.430
We'll going to go
around the world

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.600
and we going to do some gigs
and we're going to get paid.

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.766
And Jay's question was this.

00:50:45.766 --> 00:50:48.120
He said, hold up, you mean,
because he was doing it

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.810
for free every day.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:52.060
You mean, you going to
pay me money to do what

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.890
I'm doing in the park for free?

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:55.100
I'm packing my bag.

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.740
Let's go.

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.320
And he was able to go.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.520
And one thing about Jay, when we
win city to city, town to town,

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:02.790
if we went to Kansas, if
we went to Germany, if we

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:05.850
went to Japan, we would
meet people in the mall.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:09.060
Or we would meet people at
sound check, that very night,

00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.140
because Jay loved video
games, those people

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.630
would be in Jay's
room playing with him.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:18.767
So that spirit is what
we're trying to keep alive.

00:51:18.767 --> 00:51:20.850
That's what my whole thing
is, hip hop didn't just

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:21.749
create rappers.

00:51:21.749 --> 00:51:22.790
You know what I'm saying?

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:26.760
Hip hop created people that's
up here in the beat box.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.260
You got a beat box
that work at Google.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:31.726
Doug E. Fresh would
be proud of that.

00:51:31.726 --> 00:51:33.850
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
And as a tribute to Jay,

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:37.110
what a lot of people
don't know about Run DMC,

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:40.750
it was actually Jam
Master Jay that actually

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:44.470
gave Run DMC their distinct
look, the shell toe

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:46.420
Superstars with no laces.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:46.780
DARRYL "DMC"
MCDANIELS: The leather.

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.170
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
Leather pants, black fedoras,

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.260
the fat gold chain.

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.130
And as a tribute to that, I get
chills just think about it--

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:54.800
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
Because people always go,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:56.341
why Run ain't in
the book and Jay is?

00:51:56.341 --> 00:51:57.860
I never meet Run
in this universe.

00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:59.040
Not a rapper.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.442
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
I came up with this idea,

00:52:01.442 --> 00:52:03.650
And I was like, Jay did that
for you guys in reality.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.630
So what if Jay is
our Quatermain?

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:07.750
What if he's Q?

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:08.740
What if Jay--

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.790
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
James Brown has a--

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:12.706
EDGARDO MIRANDA RODRIGUEZ:
gave you your suit.

00:52:12.706 --> 00:52:15.055
And in the comic book,
we see Jam Master Jay.

00:52:15.055 --> 00:52:15.930
Ooh, I get emotional.

00:52:15.930 --> 00:52:17.810
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: You're
going to get to that part.

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.643
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
It's our tribute.

00:52:19.643 --> 00:52:22.324
We love what he stood for,
and what he did for the group,

00:52:22.324 --> 00:52:23.490
and what he did for culture.

00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:25.380
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: He was
our style and he was our music.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.280
There there's no show if we
didn't have Jam Master Jay.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.863
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
And its Jay

00:52:29.863 --> 00:52:33.666
that actually gives a DMC his
superhero costume forever.

00:52:33.666 --> 00:52:35.540
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
So he's here with us.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:37.100
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ:
He's always with us.

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.840
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS:
And to sum it up.

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.780
Those are things that
we'll fight-- I tell kids,

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:45.120
we created hip hop to
go against everything

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.359
that's celebrated in it.

00:52:46.359 --> 00:52:47.400
You know what I'm saying?

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.860
It's crazy that you
don't need a gun.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.010
You don't need a posse.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:52.259
You don't need to go get high.

00:52:52.259 --> 00:52:54.840
I remember Chuck
D told-- there was

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:58.510
Run DMC, Eric B and Rakim, Jazzy
Jeff, and the Fresh Prince,

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:59.010
EPMD.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:05.570
Yeah, it was Eric B. and Rakim,
Run DMC, EPMD, and Jazzy Jeff,

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.310
and the Fresh Prince,
we was on tour.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:08.850
This was 1987.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.520
We was playing coliseums
and stuff like that.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:13.230
And Chuck said two
powerful things

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.550
and we can end on this note.

00:53:14.550 --> 00:53:18.750
He says, you know what's
the most powerful thing

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:20.540
about this hip hop thing?

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:22.160
What, Chuck?

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:25.221
He says, it's not the fact that
we're getting all this money.

00:53:25.221 --> 00:53:27.470
It's not the fact that we're
making all these records.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.761
It's not the fact that we're
making videos now, running

00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:33.622
them, setting it up so
we can get sneaker deals,

00:53:33.622 --> 00:53:35.580
and we can get endorsements
and stuff like that

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.225
and we could do movies.

00:53:36.225 --> 00:53:38.610
Because we did "Krush
Groove" and stuff, whatever.

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:41.647
He said, it's the power
of our communication.

00:53:41.647 --> 00:53:43.980
It's the power that there's
always a mic in front of us.

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.895
We're always on TV,
videos, and records.

00:53:45.895 --> 00:53:47.270
When that mic is
in front of you,

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.420
say something
that's going to make

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:52.920
the guy that loves you all's art
say, man, I could be something.

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:53.770
And this and that.

00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:55.770
And I remember I was
standing there with my 40

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.125
ounce of Old English.

00:53:57.125 --> 00:53:58.250
I didn't like smoking weed.

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.200
Run and Jay smoked more
weed than Bob Marley.

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.330
Weed made me get paranoid
and think too much.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:06.190
You know alcohol, I mean
I been sober 10 years,

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:08.720
was my serum, my
super strength serum.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:11.090
But then Chuck D--
something came up.

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:15.220
Chuck said, I'll never
forget the that DMC said,

00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:18.400
man, when I get rich, I'm going
to have a faucet in my house

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.526
that pours out Old English.

00:54:19.526 --> 00:54:22.150
And Joe would say, I'm going to
have a weed plantation and this

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.700
and that.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.260
And I forgot how
this came up, and I

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.612
remembered Chuck D-- and this is
good for nerds and clean minds.

00:54:27.612 --> 00:54:29.570
You don't got to drink,
you don't got to smoke,

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:31.361
you don't got to sleep
with a lot of women.

00:54:31.361 --> 00:54:34.130
You don't got to have more cars
than everybody and go to jail.

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.340
Chuck, we was talking about
weed and stuff like that

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:38.548
and he's going around the
room, and it came to Chuck.

00:54:38.548 --> 00:54:41.510
And Chuck is 22 years old.

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.500
He just basically
said, man, I never

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:45.530
got high a day in my life.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:47.500
Now this is how naive I was.

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.230
I'm standing with my 40 ounce.

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.680
Imagine if you could hear my
thoughts when he said that.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.490
How the fuck do you
rhyme that good?

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:59.050
And I went back to my room and
I said there for like a week,

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:01.630
trying to figure out,
how do you do that?

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:04.030
I mean now that I've been
sober, I understand now.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:09.220
But when he said that-- so we
want to remove misconceptions

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.890
about us nerds.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:11.499
Nerds rule.

00:55:11.499 --> 00:55:14.040
EDGARDO MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: And
I've been clean my whole life.

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:14.873
I never smoked weed.

00:55:14.873 --> 00:55:17.035
Never drank any
alcohol and stuff.

00:55:17.035 --> 00:55:19.610
DARRYL "DMC" MCDANIELS: I
think I'm attracted to you.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.145
Something very Chuck
D-ish about you.

00:55:22.145 --> 00:55:23.520
EDGARDO
MIRANDA-RODRIGUEZ: I want

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.170
to say that one thing that is
amazing about working with D

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:27.910
is, obviously he's this icon.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:29.970
I grew up listening to Run DMC.

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:33.770
I had the Run DMC Adidas apparel
when I was in high school.

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:35.690
There's no pretense
to this dude.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:36.840
He's the most humble guy.

00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.530
When we work together, it's like
I'm with 13-year old Darryl.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:41.870
DMC not even in the room is.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.760
It's 13-year old Darryl.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:47.240
And one thing that's amazing
about his transformative life

00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:52.640
is that at 35, when he
found out he was adopted,

00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.720
instead of like crumbling,
he took his power

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.500
and he focused within.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.390
He turned his life around.

00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:00.330
He gave up drinking.

00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:01.300
He gave up drugs.

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.460
He became straight.

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:06.260
He co-founded a foundation that
works with foster children.

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.670
He dedicated his life
to philanthropic work.

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:14.260
And Eric tells me this a lot,
when D put down the bottle,

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.510
his mind opened.

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:16.731
His mouth opened.

00:56:16.731 --> 00:56:18.980
And it was because of this
DMC that you see here today

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.646
that we started this
publishing company.

00:56:20.646 --> 00:56:23.810
Because the DMC that exists
now that is straight,

00:56:23.810 --> 00:56:27.070
does philanthropic work,
it's constantly making music,

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.640
and is an amazing storyteller,
and more than anything else

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.670
is an amazing friend.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.295
