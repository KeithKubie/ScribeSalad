00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.450
Okay, so what we are going to do in

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.640
this video is work together to get Twilio. Now,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.470
I don't know about you, but downloading and installing

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.370
software from the Internet can sometimes be a very

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.160
painful process. Although it's still a very important part

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.750
of building cool apps. So, what we have done

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.410
here is, we have provided some documentation in the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.560
instructor notes. And this documentation can guide you through

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.340
the installation of Twilio. By the way, after we

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.730
created these documents, we shared them with a whole bunch

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.500
of students and solicited feedback from those students. This

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.950
way, we were able to improve the quality of these

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.230
documents and now we feel really confident. That these

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.230
documents can help guide you through the entire installation process.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.750
If you still have questions about the installation process,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.860
however, feel free to ask us on the discussion forum.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.850
We are here to help. So, at this point, I recommend that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.770
you get these download instructions and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.810
then install Twilio on your own computer.
