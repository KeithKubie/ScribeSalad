PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.155
Welcome to beyond
payments with Android Pay.

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:07.530
I'm Prakash Hariramani,
Group Product Manager

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.010
on the Android Pay team.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:09.840
And with me is--

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.900
MAX KRISTOF: Max Kristof.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.030
I lead the Android
Pay engineering team.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.440
It's great to be here today.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.690
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So as
you saw in the last session,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.210
for those of you who were here
for Android Pay Everywhere,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.720
Android Pay is not
just about payments.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.570
It's about enhancing the
entire in-store experience.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.560
Sending your card,
your payment card

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.370
to the merchant or retailer
was just the first step,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.100
but there's more
to it than that.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.770
When I go and make a
purchase in-store typically,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.630
in addition to my
payment card, I also

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.620
enter a loyalty card, a
gift card, and/or an offer.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.250
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.240
So we're going to talk about
three key stakeholders today--

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.310
users, merchants,
and issuers or banks.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.170
Now for users we're
going to show you

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.320
how users can go beyond
payments, how easy it's

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.710
going to be for them
to sign up for loyalty,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.720
and most importantly,
use it in the middle

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.516
of an in-store experience
when they need it most.

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.099
For merchants, we're
going to show you

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.820
how they can engage with
their customers, how they can

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.030
contextually send
them reminders,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.930
and most importantly,
Max is going

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.950
to show you how easy it is
for merchants or developers

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.410
to add the functionality
to their apps.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.010
And then finally we're going
to talk about issuers or banks.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.440
We're going to show how easy it
is for banks to bring Android

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.630
Pay functionality to
their apps so they

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.060
can connect with their card
holders through their channels.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.890
So let's first start
with the pain points--

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.000
what are we trying
to solve here?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.250
So the average US household
has about 22-ish loyalty cards,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.200
but less than 45% are active.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.870
Only about 10 are active.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.500
That's pretty bad, right?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.829
It's bad for users because
you spend all this time

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.120
signing up for that membership.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.586
You fill out this long form, and
then you're standing in store

00:01:51.586 --> 00:01:53.210
and you don't have
it when you need it.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.050
You want to save money.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.020
You want to get points.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.820
And it's not there with you.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.330
It's also bad for merchants.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.930
They're spending
millions and putting

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.890
in a lot of effort trying to
engage with their customers.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.880
Continuing with pain
points, less than 1%

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.370
of all coupons or offers that
are issued today are redeemed.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.580
That's pretty staggering.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.880
That's pretty bad too.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.380
And why?

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.120
So it's bad for
users because they

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.570
are unable to save money, again,
when they're in line, in-store,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.270
for a purchase because they've
forgotten to cut the coupon,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.270
clip it, bring it with them
in the store and then eat it.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.560
And it's bad for merchants.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440
Millions of dollars
are spent every year

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.700
by manufacturers and retailers
to bring these offers

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.300
in front of users.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.700
So first we're going to
talk about users and how

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.320
we address these pain points.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.860
So fundamentally,
there's two things

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.910
that users are looking for--
saving time and saving money.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.770
So there's many things
Android Pay does to save time.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.940
First, during payment, you just
have to unlock your phone, tap,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.150
and you're done.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.765
You do not have
to launch any app.

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:57.140
You don't have to have the
app running in the foreground.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.800
You just set it up
once, and you tap.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.990
And the most important
thing is it doesn't just

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.200
send your payment credential.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.510
So as Pali showed in
the previous demo, when

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.660
he tapped on the
Walgreens terminal,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.840
it sent his Balance Rewards
loyalty card and his payment

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.506
card.

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:12.880
And that does save
time because I

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.610
don't have to fumble in my
wallet, find that loyalty card,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.030
find that offer, and then
present it to the cashier.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.380
Saving money is the
other thing users desire.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.530
So the best way to
demonstrate this

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.552
is actually to walk
through a few demos.

00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:28.760
So for those of you who were
in the previous session,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.440
Pali saved money with his
Walgreens Balance Rewards card.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.660
He bought a pack of almonds.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.190
He saved $2.00.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.827
I would also like to save money.

00:03:35.827 --> 00:03:38.160
s before I can do that, I
need to add my Balance Rewards

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.535
card to Android Pay.

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:40.910
So to talk through
this demo, I'm

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.880
going to invite Kate
Paduchowski, who's

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.493
Senior Product Manager from
Walgreens, up on stage.

00:03:45.493 --> 00:03:48.944
Welcome, Kate.

00:03:48.944 --> 00:03:50.710
KATE PADUCHOWSKI:
Thanks, Prakash.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.050
It's really great to be here.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.060
We're really excited
to have the opportunity

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.670
to team up with Android Pay
to introduce this new loyalty

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.510
experience to our Android users.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.210
We cannot wait to share the
Save to Android Pay e-mail

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.610
to our loyalty users who will
be able to take advantage

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.400
of our simple message--
tap, tap, done.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.650
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Excellent.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.816
So let's see this in action.

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:12.070
Can we cast this please?

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.890
Great.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.150
So here's my email.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.040
I'm a Balance Rewards member,
and I got this from Walgreens.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.656
I'm just going to hit
Save to Android Pay,

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:23.030
and it's going to show me a
preview of my Balance Rewards

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.700
card.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.030
I'm going to confirm
it, and I'm done.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.030
It's that simple.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.189
So now when I go
into my Android Pay,

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:32.730
I can see not just my AmEx card
but also my Walgreens Balance

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.370
Rewards.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.660
It's that simple.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.586
Now when I go and make
a purchase at Walgreens,

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:39.210
I don't even have to
remember anything.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.400
I just tap once.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.620
It sends the payment.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.800
Tap again, it sends a
loyalty card, and I'm done.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.685
Tap, tap, done.

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.902
KATE PADUCHOWSKI: Exactly.

00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:49.610
We're really excited
that Android Pay can

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.680
make it so easy for our users to
sign up for our Balance Rewards

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.370
program.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.740
Now even more customers
can save and earn points

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.250
as they shop at Walgreens.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.490
Android Pay and Walgreens will
be the first payment solution

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.790
and retailer to launch
instant loyalty enrollment.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:14.310
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Thank you again Kate.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.940
We're delighted to have
you here and delighted

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.940
with our partnership
with Walgreens.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.084
KATE PADUCHOWSKI: Thanks.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.000
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So
let's switch use cases.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.259
So that was a retailer use
case, an in-store experience.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.800
I want to talk about another
use case I'm very excited about,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.410
which is in-store dining.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.130
So what we're
going to do is show

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.390
how Android Pay can
go beyond payments

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.050
for an immersive
dining experience.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.760
And you're going to do
that through Ziosks.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.730
So you see these
Android tablets here.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.070
They are by Ziosk, which have
these Android touchscreen

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.030
tablets.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.890
And you can find these actually
on Chili's restaurants today.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.330
So to talk through
this demo, I'm

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.250
going to invite Viren
Balar, who is the CTO

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.650
and co-founder of the Ziosk.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.691
And I also want to
acknowledge Wade Allen-- Wade,

00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:53.760
can you wave your hand?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.490
He's the vice president
of digital innovation

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.990
at Chili's-- a great leader in
innovation and we're thrilled

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.126
to partner with you.

00:05:59.126 --> 00:06:00.550
VIREN BALAR: Thank you, Prakash.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.890
Hi, everyone.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.340
So at Ziosk, our mission
is to revolutionize

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.840
dining experience.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.140
And by partnering
with Android Pay,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.300
we're able to bring our
brick and mortar restaurant

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.240
partners into the digital age.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.180
And Chili's is a perfect
launch partner for us

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.170
because they really understand
the value of digital

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.710
in revolutionizing
dining experience

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.300
for the guest on the table.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.980
Today, we're going to
demo some use cases

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.900
that are core
functionality on Ziosk

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.030
and how this is all
simplified with Android Pay

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.190
even better than what
it is today, right?

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.560
So prior to Ziosk, if
you went to Chili's, you

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.330
would have to fill out
this E-Club-- first name,

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.800
last name, email address, zip
code-- pretty lengthy, pretty

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.154
inefficient as well.

00:06:47.154 --> 00:06:48.570
And then you would
have to give it

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.695
to the wait staff who would
put it in their pocket,

00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:53.520
and maybe it'll make
it to the manager.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.180
And maybe he will enter it
into their database system.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.580
It's not real time, right?

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.190
It's very inefficient.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.700
So when we launched Ziosk,
services at Ziosk we started

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.240
enrolling for the loyalty
programs at Chili's.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.835
And we see enrollment
go up by 10 times.

00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:12.860
It's a pretty staggering number.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.740
So when we do the
demo, you'll see how

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.430
easy is it with Android Pay.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.120
It's going to be even simpler
than what we have done today,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.810
which is live in
the restaurants.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.600
So Prakash, you want
to see a demo of how

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.455
to join a loyalty program?

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:26.330
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: That
sounds great, Viren.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.540
So if we could just focus on
the terminal on the right.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.630
So I'm sitting at Chili's.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.838
So the setting is I'm sitting
at Chili's at the table

00:07:32.838 --> 00:07:34.260
ready to order my food.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.310
And on this Ziosk
terminal, I see

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.760
an option to join the My
Chili's Rewards program.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.691
So I'm lazy.

00:07:41.691 --> 00:07:43.190
I'm not going to
fill out this form,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.330
so I'm just going
to hit Join Now.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.640
And all I have to do, as you can
see, is I'm just going to tap--

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.385
and as a security feature,
I will authenticate.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.400
OK, so we're going to tap.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.270
And as you can see, it sent my
information from Android Pay,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.910
and it's asking for
my consent to send

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.370
my first name, last
name, email address.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.790
So I don't have to do
any kind of typing,

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.250
and I just can continue.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.670
So I've given consent for
this information to be sent

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:15.400
to Chili's.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.310
So now you're seeing
the Chili's site.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.520
And all I have to do
is just enter a PIN,

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.280
and I'm registered.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.600
So now I have a My Chili's
Rewards loyalty card.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.730
And I'm just going to
save to Android Pay.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.240
And there you go.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.659
VIREN BALAR: It's always there.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:35.840
You don't have to worry
about forgetting it anymore.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.924
So you want to log in now?

00:08:36.924 --> 00:08:37.965
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

00:08:37.965 --> 00:08:39.390
So now I've signed
up for loyalty.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.956
And now I'm going
to login because I

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:43.039
want Chili's to know I'm
sitting at the restaurant

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.740
and I want them
to know who I am.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.760
So I'm just going to hit Login,
and then I'm just going to tap.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.485
[CHIME]

00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:52.380
VIREN BALAR: Boom.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.310
You got 60 points.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:54.460
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
I have 60 points,

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.340
and I'm getting a
little bit hungry.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.320
I did skip lunch today.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.028
VIREN BALAR: Yep.

00:08:57.028 --> 00:09:00.830
So let's order some-- what
can we buy for your 60 points?

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.160
Maybe a couple of bowls
of chips and salsa?

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.760
Won't be enough for
everybody, but I

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.894
think you and I can
definitely hog them up.

00:09:09.894 --> 00:09:11.560
All right, so we're
going to order that.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.217
We're going to add one plate.

00:09:14.217 --> 00:09:15.300
We're going to share that.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.883
We're going to send the order,
and have this feeling something

00:09:17.883 --> 00:09:20.550
amazing is going to happen.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.530
Click Yes.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.080
Order is going in the
kitchen-- I just confirmed it.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.345
And boom-- it shows up.

00:09:27.345 --> 00:09:28.595
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Oh my god.

00:09:28.595 --> 00:09:30.505
VIREN BALAR: Max,
you're amazing.

00:09:30.505 --> 00:09:33.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:33.304 --> 00:09:35.595
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Instant
enrollment, instant chips--

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:37.260
life doesn't get any better.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.040
By the way, I should
have mentioned

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.400
that if you see anything
that excites you

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.858
during this presentation, feel
free to applaud at any time.

00:09:41.858 --> 00:09:43.620
VIREN BALAR: Exactly.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.580
So Prakash, now we have to
show the payment piece of it.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.580
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Oh,
so you're looking at me.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.520
You want me to pay now?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.280
VIREN BALAR: Yeah, I know.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.363
That's why I reminded you.

00:09:51.363 --> 00:09:53.210
So one of the most
important things

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.312
that Ziosk does in a restaurant
is pay on demand, right?

00:09:56.312 --> 00:09:58.020
You don't have to wait
for your waitstaff

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.430
to bring in the
check on the table.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.290
So we're going to show how
that becomes a lot easier

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.350
with Android Pay.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.150
So Prakash, you want
to follow through?

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.191
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: Sure.

00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:08.830
So I'm going to select Pay.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.710
And all I have to do is tap.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.390
And as you can see, my
Bank of America MasterCard

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.450
payment was sent.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.200
And I'm going to--

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.490
VIREN BALAR: Hold on.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.080
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: I'm going
to select a higher tip because--

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.130
VIREN BALAR: Only 5% for Max.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:24.530
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: OK,
so let's go for generous.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.010
And we'll tip this amount.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.920
I'm just going to sign.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.600
And guess what?

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.110
For a receipt, I'm just going
to select the email option,

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.937
submit, and I'm done-- a
digital dining experience.

00:10:34.937 --> 00:10:36.270
VIREN BALAR: Thank you, Prakash.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:37.811
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Thank you, Viren.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.305
OK, so that covered
the user section.

00:10:44.305 --> 00:10:45.680
And now I'm going
to turn it over

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.681
to Max who's going to talk
about merchants and developers.

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:52.390
MAX KRISTOF: Great,
thank you very much.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.290
So last year we showed
you Save to Android Pay.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.110
We're excited to be announcing
some major enhancements based

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.650
on your feedback.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.230
So first, we heard you.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.080
We've added Save to
Android Support directly

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.880
from emails and SMS messages.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.860
We're allowing with
these mechanisms

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.300
to have brands have a richer
more immersive experience

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.670
helping you increase
engagement with your customers.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.400
Let's go back to
that Chili's demo.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.700
You saw that Android Pay
prompted Prakash to sign up

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.890
for that loyalty program
and offered to prefill

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.480
his data to make it super easy.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.650
How did they build that?

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.840
Well, it breaks down
to three easy steps.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.600
Step 1, Chili's set
up a loyalty program

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.330
in our merchant console.

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.260
That's where they
defined what data

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.280
they need to collect to enroll
a new customer-- name, phone,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.370
email address--
that kind of stuff.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:45.820
And they set up branding for
their program and their card

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:46.920
art.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.350
Next, they made a
few simple changes

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.820
to their existing
loyalty sign-up site.

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.360
Finally, they wrote
a few lines of code

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.619
to generate a Save to
Android Pay deep link.

00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:00.160
And at the end of
their sign-up flow,

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.847
they just redirect to that link.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:04.305
Android Pay takes
care of the rest.

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:06.480
And we'll show you what
this looks like in practice.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.180
So the key thing here is
that ultimately, we're

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.830
just going to create a link.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.860
And the link will
encode everything in it

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.520
that we need to trigger the
Save to Android Pay experience.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.210
So now here's the code.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.310
So this is the start.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.250
You saw that Android Pay
prompted Prakash to sign up.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.860
And where does that
prefill data come from?

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:30.430
Well, their sign-up
web page is going

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.470
to receive the prefill
parameters in the URL.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.360
This is just standard
HTTPS get type

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.190
of stuff that's
going to be encoded

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.297
in there-- HTTPS of course.

00:12:39.297 --> 00:12:41.880
Chili's is going to create the
loyalty account in their system

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.700
however they would
normally do that.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.410
And then we come
to the fun part.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.590
Chile's going to create
a loyalty object.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:54.490
Then they're going to turn that
object into a JSON web token.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:57.060
This gives us a signed,
serialized representation

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.580
of that loyalty object.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.400
And, finally, Chili's is
going to generate a deep link

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.030
from that token that they can
use for multiple channels.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.340
But let's go deeper.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.590
So this is what the loyal
object creation code looks like.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.190
All we really need from you
is about eight pieces of data,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.430
and we show you how
to plug them in here.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.070
Points, and balance,
your class ID--

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.000
this comes up when you
create this loyalty

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.450
class in our system, it's
an active loyalty state--

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.710
an account ID, a name.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.190
Again, just fairly
boilerplate stuff.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.849
You just drop the code
and the data in here,

00:13:35.849 --> 00:13:36.640
and then you build.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.656
And you have your
loyalty object.

00:13:38.656 --> 00:13:41.280
So now we're going to turn that
object into the JSON web token.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.880
So this is an expansion of
that second step I showed you.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.197
Again, we have some
simpler boilerplate here.

00:13:47.197 --> 00:13:49.530
I'm not going to walk you
through all of this right now,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.250
but you just drop
this in your code.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.824
And at the end of this, you have
a serialized, signed web token.

00:13:55.824 --> 00:13:57.240
Finally, the last
part of our code

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.460
is to turn that into a Save
to Android Pay deep link.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.690
And this is what the
format of that looks like.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.920
We're going to--
that jwt, the jot,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.430
is that web token-- so we're
going to create the link,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.170
add the token into it,
and that's the Save

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.420
to Android Pay deep link.

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.860
So to sum up, the first step
was create a loyalty program

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.870
in the system.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.170
Second, take the user to
my loyalty sign-up page,

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.590
whether triggered from a link,
a transaction confirmation,

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.320
a Ziosk terminal, and a Ctag.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.970
Possibilities are endless here.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.100
And the last step of my
loyalty sign-up web page

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.747
will simply redirect to
the link when I'm done.

00:14:31.747 --> 00:14:33.330
When I redirect to
that link, the link

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.039
will activate the Save to
Android Pay user experience.

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:37.580
And in a few instants,
the customer's

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.980
going to have her loyalty
card on her phone.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:44.780
Look how easy that was, and
then you can have chips.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.450
So that's great for getting new
customers signed up, but what

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.502
about the ones who've downloaded
my mobile app already?

00:14:50.502 --> 00:14:52.710
So the good news is I can
use the same basic approach

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.640
to save a loyalty
card into Android Pay

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.370
directly from within my app.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.359
We show you a rich preview here
to keep the users in your app.

00:15:00.359 --> 00:15:01.900
Here, we're showing
Plenti, a loyalty

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.358
partner who has
already implemented

00:15:03.358 --> 00:15:06.670
Android Pay with us.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.110
And here's what the
Android code looks

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.615
like to save this loyalty card.

00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:11.740
It's really the same thing.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.560
I'm going to end up creating a
deep link at the end of this.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.670
I'm going to append my JSON
web token to the end of it,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.076
and I'm just going
to intent over there.

00:15:20.076 --> 00:15:21.950
Let's take a closer look
at that link though.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.430
If your Android Pay is already
installed on the phone,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.240
you will immediately invoke the
Save to Android Pay experience.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.072
But what if Android Pay is
not installed on the phone?

00:15:30.072 --> 00:15:32.030
The user will simply be
redirected to the place

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.030
where to download.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.340
And as soon as the app opens,
the Save to Android Pay

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.640
experience will complete.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.520
So a lot of
marketing, of course,

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.700
is driven by SMS,
and emails, and we

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.080
heard that loud and clear.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.970
So we also made sure that
the Save to Android Pay

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:50.555
experience works great
through these channels.

00:15:50.555 --> 00:15:52.930
Here's a look at how that
experience would work with SMS.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.130
You can engage your customers
to save your loyalty cards,

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.140
offers, gift cards
directly via text message.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.660
Just create a shortened
version of the same Save

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.500
to Android Pay deep
link, and then you

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.586
embed the shortened link
into your SMS message.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.080
And then we've built a
first class save experience

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.370
from email, as you saw.

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.270
But it's the same code
behind the scenes.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.420
You just create that link.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.820
You stick it in your email.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.460
Done.

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.250
Finally, I want to
look at gift cards.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.250
Like loyalty cards and offers,
we can make these geotargeted

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.190
so that they appear
automatically

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:27.620
when they're
contextually relevant

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.279
and when the user
is in your store.

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:33.320
This way, they'll be
reminded they have something

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.545
to spend at your store.

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:36.920
There are some differences
here because it's a gift card,

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.450
but it is really the
same basic structure.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:42.500
We're going to
create a gift card.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.330
Notice here that when we're
creating the gift card object,

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.130
I've set the type to QR
code as my redemption.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.750
That's if I have one of those
old school QR code readers.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:56.044
But what if I have a cool
NFC reader in my phone?

00:16:56.044 --> 00:16:58.580
Or at my point of sale?

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.440
And what if I've integrated
with the Android Pay smart tap

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.400
technology?

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.800
Well, you could
simply say change

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.589
that here-- your redemption
type-- to smart tap.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:12.179
Then you get the benefits of
automatic redemption over NFC,

00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:13.970
complete with authentication
and encryption

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.514
to protect the data in transit.

00:17:15.514 --> 00:17:17.430
And we're excited that
Walgreens, for example,

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.952
has already launched NFC smart
tap for loyalty cards in five

00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:20.910
stores in the Bay Area.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.030
And I think as you heard
they'll be rolling out

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.650
to 8,000 stores in the next few
months, which is really cool.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.900
So, again, we said the
rest of the parameters--

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.120
those just eight pieces
of data to plug in here.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.987
We're going to generate
that JSON web token.

00:17:36.987 --> 00:17:38.570
Create a deep link
at the end of this.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.230
This should all be looking
pretty familiar to you now.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.816
And because a
lat-long was entered

00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:45.440
at the time of setting
up the gift card

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.590
class in the first place
back in that step 1--

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.690
the merchant console
set up-- no further work

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:52.830
is required to make these
gift cards automatically

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:54.832
surface when the customer
is in your store.

00:17:54.832 --> 00:17:56.540
This helps you drive
engagement and keeps

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.740
your brand top of mind.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.379
So this is just a
representative sample

00:18:01.379 --> 00:18:03.170
of all the great
merchants that are already

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.280
working with us in many
different verticals for loyalty

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.870
cards, gift cards, and offers.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.911
So let me hand this back to
Prakash to talk about banks.

00:18:12.911 --> 00:18:14.160
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: All right.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.350
Thank you, Max.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.920
So issuers of banks are
another key stakeholder for us.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.510
And I'm also thrilled
that many of our partners

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.218
are in the audience
like Bank of America,

00:18:21.218 --> 00:18:23.310
like Discover, like
American Express.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.090
So I just want to
talk about how we are

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.530
solving pain points for banks.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.530
So what do banks want?

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.640
Fundamentally, they want
to be "top of wallet."

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.740
And what we mean by that
is they want their card

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.210
to be used for
every transaction,

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.040
whether it's an
in-store transaction,

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.930
an in-app transaction, transit,
or an online transaction

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:42.100
on the web.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.647
They also want drive innovative
solutions for their users,

00:18:44.647 --> 00:18:46.980
and they want to go beyond
mobile banking in their apps.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.740
They want to be able to enable
their cardholders to use

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.134
mobile payments from
their apps, controlling

00:18:53.134 --> 00:18:55.300
the branding experience but
without writing millions

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.520
of lines of code.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.870
And that's what we're
trying to solve here.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.810
So how are we solving this?

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.650
Well, we make it very
easy for banks to add

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:04.240
mobile payments to their app.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.890
And I'll show you the user
experience on the next screen.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.830
But essentially once you
add a card to Android Pay

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.190
if you're a bank,
as a bank developer,

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:16.470
it's enabled for payment
in-store, in-app, transit,

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.430
online.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.630
And if you want to
know more about online,

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.130
we have two sessions on Friday.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.470
One is bringing seamless
checkouts to mobile web,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:25.550
and the second is turbo
charging app monetization

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:26.410
with Android Pay.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.892
So I'd encourage you to
attend those sessions.

00:19:28.892 --> 00:19:30.900
So what does the user
experience look like?

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.360
So I have my Discover Card.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.920
I've launched my Discover
mobile banking app.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.960
And I have an option to add my
Discover Card to Android Pay.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.360
And all I have to do is verify
a few details, and I'm done.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.320
That card is added
to Android Pay.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.600
So next time I go
and make a purchase,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.950
I can use that for in-store,
in-app, web, transit,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.670
everything.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.227
And I also have the option
to set it as the default.

00:19:54.227 --> 00:19:55.560
So let's go a little bit deeper.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.944
How did all this happen?

00:19:56.944 --> 00:19:58.860
It happened because of
this box that you see--

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.129
Android Pay API for Issuers.

00:20:01.129 --> 00:20:02.920
Now, it takes care of
a lot of the headache

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.300
and the pain point I talked
about because we handle

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.350
everything from tokenization
with the payment networks,

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.410
to generating limited use
keys, to storing them securely

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.750
on the phone, to performing
cardholder verification,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.930
to creating these
in-app cryptograms,

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:19.040
to handling the NFC
payment protocols,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.960
and also making sure it's
compatible with the thousands

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.520
of Android devices
that we have out there.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.310
And the most important
thing is we do all of this,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.150
but the banks still control
most of the branding and user

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.390
experience, as you saw
in the previous slide.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.400
And that's what we're
pretty excited about.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.264
The other thing I want to
echo-- and this was brought up

00:20:37.264 --> 00:20:38.680
in the previous
presentation-- was

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.160
we're really thrilled
that a number

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.330
of top banks around the world
have committed to this vision.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.090
They're very excited about the
Android Pay API for Issuers

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.080
and they will be
integrating into Android

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.820
Pay from their mobile banking
app over the next few months.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.670
So I'm going to talk
about one more thing,

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:55.211
and I'm going to
turn it over to Max,

00:20:55.211 --> 00:20:57.560
and that's about another API
we have for issuers called

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.800
Card Messaging.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.110
So in this example, I have
my American Express card.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.735
And I get a really
nice reminder saying

00:21:02.735 --> 00:21:04.330
I have offers
expiring soon, and I

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.769
should take advantage of that.

00:21:05.769 --> 00:21:07.310
So Max, let me turn
this over to you.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.750
MAX KRISTOF: Sure.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:10.560
Great.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.400
So I want to go back to
the code for a second

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.510
and talk about all
that stuff that Prakash

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:23.090
mentioned about how do I get
my card into Android Pay.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.759
This is the code--
startTokenization

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:25.550
TapAndPay.tokenize.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.232
That's pretty much it.

00:21:30.232 --> 00:21:32.190
Android Pay is going to
handle everything else.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:36.390
It's going to invoke that UI
and start a series of activities

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.220
that's going to walk the user
through what they need to do,

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.950
confirming the card details,
accepting the issuer

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.850
terms of service, getting
that token, cryptogram,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:46.866
all that stuff.

00:21:46.866 --> 00:21:48.240
And at the end of
this flow, when

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.340
we return from this method,
we're going to be done.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.220
That card will be
set up for payments.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.250
So I didn't have to
worry about any of that

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.010
as a developer,
which is awesome.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.300
And I can focus my efforts,
if I were a bank developer,

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.120
on building a great
mobile banking app

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.200
rather than worrying
about all the plumbing.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.264
So of course, as
Prakash mentioned,

00:22:07.264 --> 00:22:09.180
I'd also love it if
people are setting my card

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.430
as their default for payments.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.220
So I'll add a method
here to make that happen.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.428
TapAndPay.requestSelectToken.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.190
That's going to pop
up a quick dialog

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:21.280
to confirm that we have
user consent to set

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.210
this card as the
default. And now

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.019
my card will be used
whenever the user taps.

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:27.560
So there are also
a few other methods

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.018
that I'm not showing
here, like how

00:22:29.018 --> 00:22:32.080
to query the status of
your card, deleting cards,

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.040
and things like that.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.360
But they're all similarly
easy, and it gives you

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.460
an idea of how easy it is
to integrate Android pay

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:41.100
into your mobile banking app.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.210
Back to that second thing
that Prakash showed you--

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:46.340
the custom messaging.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.400
So this is a server-side
API that we have.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.300
And the key here is that
with the server-side API,

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.550
banks can dynamically
update messaging

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:59.740
in Android Pay that will appear
in the card details view.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.050
What you'll see here is title,
Double points at Whole Foods,

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:05.352
and body.

00:23:05.352 --> 00:23:06.810
"Earn double points
at Whole Foods"

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.090
or "Enjoy a one-time
bonus of 40,000 miles."

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.880
So that message can appear
directly in the Android Pay app

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.640
next to that card on
the card details view

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.550
through the server-side API.

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:19.850
So it's a great way to
reach out to the customers

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:23.900
and create a more immersive,
engaging experience.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.020
So what's next?

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.290
First, we want you to try
out the Save to Android Pay

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:30.300
experience yourselves.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.462
How do you do that?

00:23:31.462 --> 00:23:36.520
Go to g.co/paygift
on your phones.

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:40.240
If you do that and you come
over to our office hours, which

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.090
are conveniently enough, right
over there at table 1 and 2,

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.620
right after the
session at 4 o'clock,

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.242
you'll get a free
Android collectible.

00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:52.450
So you can try out the Save
to Android Pay experience

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.870
yourself, and then tap
and redeem it and see

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:57.190
the whole thing in action.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:58.560
Second, come talk to us.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.770
So talk to us at
the office hours.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.430
We also have office hours
on Thursday and Friday.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:09.490
2 o'clock on Thursday, and
2 o'clock also on Friday.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.240
And we'll be happy to answer
any questions of any of the APIs

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:17.370
that you saw here and
tell you all about it.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.350
So finally, we need you.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.490
We need you because
Android Pay is only

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:27.680
as amazing as all of the
uses that you create for it.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.450
So with that, I
think we'll wrap up.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:34.710
We do have a few minutes
for-- we'll take, I think,

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.660
about six questions.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.140
And we'll be able to answer
them right at the mic up here.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.582
So thank you very much.

00:24:41.582 --> 00:24:44.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:52.101 --> 00:24:53.475
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
No questions.

00:24:53.475 --> 00:24:54.330
Can you please
come up to the mic?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:55.038
MAX KRISTOF: Yes.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.087
FEMALE SPEAKER: When is
Android Pay hitting the gear?

00:25:04.087 --> 00:25:05.920
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
That's a great question.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.260
So we want to make a great
experience on watches

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.160
just like we have on phones.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.320
So all we can say is stay tuned.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.794
We don't have timelines to
be able to publicly release.

00:25:14.794 --> 00:25:17.460
But you're going to see the same
great experience on the watches

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.835
like you're seeing
on the phones.

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:28.900
MALE SPEAKER: I have a
question about data passing.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.274
And so there was a bunch of
examples where there was data

00:25:31.274 --> 00:25:33.660
that you had moving from
Android Pay to the device

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.427
to apply it, and vice versa,
from an app to Android Pay.

00:25:36.427 --> 00:25:38.760
Is there additional permissions
that need to be granted?

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.593
Or what data is allowed
to go back and forth

00:25:40.593 --> 00:25:41.370
between those two?

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:43.036
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Sure, I think as you

00:25:43.036 --> 00:25:44.210
saw first, user's consent.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.207
So users make a choice.

00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:47.290
And as you saw, when I was
signing up for loyalty,

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:50.570
it prepopulated the information,
but I had to explicitly consent

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.940
before it was sent
over to Chili's.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:55.430
So essentially, it's like--
as you saw in that example--

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.560
it was a name, email,
and other information

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.495
that I consented to.

00:25:58.495 --> 00:25:59.265
MALE SPEAKER: Is that infinite?

00:25:59.265 --> 00:26:00.900
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: That's
for the loyalty use case.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.295
FEMALE SPEAKER: And is
that consent required,

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:05.211
like if you don't have
a pin set up otherwise?

00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:08.412
Does it still prompt
you for consent?

00:26:08.412 --> 00:26:10.578
MAX KRISTOF: Sorry, the
question was is it required?

00:26:10.578 --> 00:26:11.453
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:26:11.453 --> 00:26:13.720
So if you-- you have
a lot of users that

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.850
just don't secure their phones.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.290
So if I walked up and
just swiped my phone

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.850
and it asked for PII, would it
be granted without my consent

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.940
if I didn't already
have a pin set up?

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.730
MAX KRISTOF: OK.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.220
Yeah, so there are two
different issues here.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.110
One is before we transmit
any PII to a merchant,

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.980
to a loyalty sign-up
page, for example,

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.250
we absolutely show that
box no matter what.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.990
And you absolutely have
to click OK, Yes I Agree.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.250
And if the user
doesn't click I Agree,

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.610
they can still be taken to
the loyalty sign-up page.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.310
It's just the form will
be blank and they'll

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.675
have the joy of entering
all that data themselves

00:26:51.675 --> 00:26:54.970
on a lovely mobile keyboard.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.910
The second part of
the question, though,

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.260
is Android Pay and screen locks.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.850
So Android Pay does require,
as part of its setup,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.090
a screen lock.

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:07.190
And that's fingerprint,
pin, pattern, password.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:12.110
Those are the recognized
secure screen locks

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:16.085
that are required
to use Android Pay.

00:27:16.085 --> 00:27:21.120
MALE SPEAKER: In a few countries
is supported Android Pay?

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.620
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
Yeah, so I think

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.760
what we have publicly
I think-- just

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.070
so I understand your question.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:26.830
You're asking for countries
where we support Android Pay

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:28.030
or where are going?

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are you
referring a certain country?

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:33.030
MALE SPEAKER: South America.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.750
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
OK, South America.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:37.597
So I think I want to echo
what was said earlier.

00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:39.680
Our aspiration is for
Android Pay to be everywhere

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.320
Android is.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.630
But a journey's going
to take a few steps.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:47.110
So what we've publicly
announced is the UK, of course,

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:49.880
and Australia, and
Singapore, besides the US.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.995
So we are looking constantly
at other countries,

00:27:51.995 --> 00:27:54.370
and you're going to see more
announcements going forward.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:55.210
That's all I can say.

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.459
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, thank you.

00:28:00.469 --> 00:28:02.260
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: No
more questions, huh?

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:05.152
MAX KRISTOF: We have time
for two more questions.

00:28:05.152 --> 00:28:07.610
Otherwise, we'll be happy to
talk to you in a more intimate

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.167
setting out at the office hours.

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:10.750
By the way, at the
office hours, we'll

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:13.950
have several members of
our team there as well

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.260
who can really kind of deep
dive into any of these areas.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:17.760
Yes?

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.737
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do
you plan to have

00:28:19.737 --> 00:28:21.320
Android Pay inside
of [INAUDIBLE] auto

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.990
for payments from
inside the car?

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.740
MAX KRISTOF: Payments
in the car, Prakash,

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.315
what do you think?

00:28:26.315 --> 00:28:28.600
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI: So again,
we're looking at all use cases

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.058
to make it a great
user experience.

00:28:30.058 --> 00:28:32.190
We can't get into specifics
about dates and times.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.620
MAX KRISTOF: OK.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.350
Looks like there's
one more question.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.720
Please come up to the mic.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.345
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
the devel you showed

00:28:44.345 --> 00:28:48.480
as specific tab-based
POS terminals, right?

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.130
So what happens to MSD-based?

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.725
Like merchants with
MSD-based terminals?

00:28:54.725 --> 00:28:56.560
MAX KRISTOF: Yeah,
and the question

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.760
is about loyalty cards?

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.260
Or?

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.635
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Regular payments.

00:28:59.635 --> 00:29:01.310
MAX KRISTOF: Regular
payments, right.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.830
So at the moment, for
in-store experience,

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:09.430
we require contactless
technology support.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.890
For loyalty gift card
offers, we have a variety

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.710
of different redemption methods,
including bar codes, QR codes,

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.110
as well as, of course, NFC.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.130
I think we're big
believers in NFC,

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:26.350
and we've really seeing great
traction in the ecosystem.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.300
There's a lot of
re-terminalization happening

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.258
right now at merchants.

00:29:29.258 --> 00:29:31.650
And we know this is
a journey, but it

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.100
looks like the journey
is in progress.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.020
PRAKASH HARIRAMANI:
All right, I think

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:36.730
we're going to wrap it up.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:37.860
So thank you again
for coming, and don't

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.420
forget to come to office hours
like we mentioned earlier.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.040
And enjoy the rest of IO.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.000
MAX KRISTOF: Thank you.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.350
