challenging is probably one word for it

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700
challenging is probably one word for it
 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.509
challenging is probably one word for it
I think this was mentioned in the

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519
I think this was mentioned in the
 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.020
I think this was mentioned in the
previous talk that that sarah did the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030
previous talk that that sarah did the
 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.539

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590
about two plus years ago and in that
 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.610
about two plus years ago and in that
time I have changed my business model

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
time I have changed my business model
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.339

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980
the as challenging as it is I think one
 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.800
the as challenging as it is I think one
of the things that that's great about it

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810
of the things that that's great about it
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.390

it's really gonna do this well and the
 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.550
it's really gonna do this well and the
answer nine times out of ten is yes at

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560
answer nine times out of ten is yes at
 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.990
answer nine times out of ten is yes at
least it's gonna do well enough to be

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000
least it's gonna do well enough to be
 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.850

worth the effort to put it out and in
 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.730
worth the effort to put it out and in
many of the cases it's well enough to to

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740
many of the cases it's well enough to to
 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.200
many of the cases it's well enough to to
generate a significant amount of revenue

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210
generate a significant amount of revenue
 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.490

capture a lot of success yeah I mean I
 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.560
capture a lot of success yeah I mean I
can kind of piggyback on that answer

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570
can kind of piggyback on that answer
 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.390
can kind of piggyback on that answer

working with so if it's something we
think is fun and cool we'll probably

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490
think is fun and cool we'll probably
 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.740
think is fun and cool we'll probably
figure out a way to work with you too on

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750
figure out a way to work with you too on
 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.270
figure out a way to work with you too on
it so it doesn't necessarily have to

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280
it so it doesn't necessarily have to
 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.140
it so it doesn't necessarily have to
fall into a single type of genre great

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150
fall into a single type of genre great
 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.710
fall into a single type of genre great
I think if I don't ask this some will

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720
I think if I don't ask this some will
 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.620
I think if I don't ask this some will
probably ask this during the QA so what

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630
probably ask this during the QA so what
 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.980
probably ask this during the QA so what

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280
every day I would say we're probably in
 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.700
every day I would say we're probably in
the range between 10 and 15 pitches of

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710
the range between 10 and 15 pitches of
 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.860
the range between 10 and 15 pitches of
games a day that throughout the week you

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870
games a day that throughout the week you
 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.850
games a day that throughout the week you
know we're telling up to over a hundred

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860
know we're telling up to over a hundred
 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.160
know we're telling up to over a hundred

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.170
pitches we see very wildly range in
 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.730
pitches we see very wildly range in
quality um but to stand out I mean

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740
quality um but to stand out I mean
 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.140
quality um but to stand out I mean
you're probably not as clever as you

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150

away because we see a lot so the big
 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.900
away because we see a lot so the big
thing for us is when we're looking for

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:29.910
thing for us is when we're looking for
 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:31.670
thing for us is when we're looking for
games I mean we obviously looking for

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680
games I mean we obviously looking for

something that we is gonna catch us from
you know it's something is it

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340
you know it's something is it
 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.650
you know it's something is it
interesting is it different you know if

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660
interesting is it different you know if
 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.750
interesting is it different you know if
it's very generic run-of-the-mill we've

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760
it's very generic run-of-the-mill we've
 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.100
it's very generic run-of-the-mill we've
seen it a million times it's probably

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110
seen it a million times it's probably
 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.380
seen it a million times it's probably
not gonna do that much for us so if it

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390
not gonna do that much for us so if it
 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:43.910
not gonna do that much for us so if it

different people so let talked to me
about how that looks for you and perhaps

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880
about how that looks for you and perhaps
 

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.580
about how that looks for you and perhaps
maybe how indie should be looking at

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:34.590
maybe how indie should be looking at
 

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.350

one to just say oh is it going to be
 

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:45.950
one to just say oh is it going to be
make money for us and the developer I

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:45.960
make money for us and the developer I
 

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.630
make money for us and the developer I
mean that's that's obviously the

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640
mean that's that's obviously the
 

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.980
mean that's that's obviously the
starting point the people are looking at

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:48.990
starting point the people are looking at
 

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.050
starting point the people are looking at
but what kind of money that makes

dollars and retire it's not probably
going to happen so you know if you make

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940
going to happen so you know if you make
 

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.790
going to happen so you know if you make
enough to make your next game that's

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800
enough to make your next game that's
 

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.330

kind of three three different

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:31.620
kind of three three different
 

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.230
kind of three three different
definitions there I mean the first for

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240
definitions there I mean the first for
 

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.610
definitions there I mean the first for
me and the most obvious was being able

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620
me and the most obvious was being able
 

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.590
me and the most obvious was being able
to generate enough revenue to reinvest

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:36.600
to generate enough revenue to reinvest
