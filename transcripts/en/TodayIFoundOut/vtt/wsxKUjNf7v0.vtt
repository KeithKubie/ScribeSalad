00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.050
Arising out of the peace and prosperity of
the post-war world, in the middle of the 20th

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.700
century Americans threw themselves into a
variety of weird fads, with goldfish swallowing,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.670
pet rocks (see: How Did the Pet Rock Fad Start?),
streaking, dance marathons, and sea monkeys

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.510
(see What are Sea Monkeys?) among the most
popular.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.350
One that received less attention internationally,
but whose participants and spectators ardently

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.779
loved, was the curious case of octopus wrestling.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.010
At the time, the general perception of giant
octopuses was that they were fearsome predators

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.010
of the deep.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.530
As such, wrestling one seemed the height of
manliness.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.690
As for the developed sport itself, it was
pretty much like it sounds, involving men

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.850
hunting out an octopus’ lair and then wrangling
the cephalopod out and up to the surface by

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.850
hand.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.790
That said, according to accounts from early
practitioners of the sport, it was inspired

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.910
by a much more bloody pastime- octopus hunting,
which was the subject of an apparently widely-read

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.810
story published in Modern Mechanix, “Octopus
Wrestling is My Hobby” (April 1949).

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.250
In the article, author Wilmon Menard describes
in great and brutal detail a hunting expedition

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.250
he took to the South Pacific, in which he
and his native guides found, caught and killed

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.670
octopuses, including one that Menard described
as “a huge monster with 25-foot tentacles.”

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.780
Per Menard, capturing an octopus first required
getting it sufficiently fearful, defensive

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.470
or curious to come out of its lair.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.750
Once they got it to emerge, the octopus would
often go on the attack, wrapping its tentacles

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.700
around whatever it could grab, inevitably
something essential or delicate – like a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.620
diver’s regulator or mask.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.410
Menard reported the “huge monster” began
its attack by lashing at the men with its

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.320
tentacles, which they began to hack off with
knives.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.040
Menard then states the octopus began “pulling
itself up the reef by its partly-severed tentacles.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.740
. . then it started rolling toward us.”

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.170
Eventually the men were heroically able to
drive spears into its head to kill the fearsome

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.170
creature.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.640
Menard also took the time to point out that,
at least according to him, an octopus would

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.130
make “a human-like moan” when it died…

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.190
So fast-forward about a decade later to Seattle,
Washington and the diving club, the Puget

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.120
Sound Mud Sharks, who also enjoyed tangling
with octopuses, in this case the Giant Pacific

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.159
variety (enteroctopus dofleini).

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.939
Unlike Menard, however, once they captured
one of the animals and took its measurements,

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.579
the diving club members just donated it (alive)
to aquariums in the area, or more often just

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.370
released it back into the wild after the fun
(for the humans) was over.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.659
Holding what they called the World Octopus
Wrestling Championships at Titlow Beach in

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.749
the late 1950s and early 1960s, the rules
were simple: three-men teams dived looking

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:46.659
for octopuses in two categories: scuba gear
and free diving.

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.519
The former received one point per pound of
any octopus they caught, while the latter

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.580
free divers received two points per pound.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.150
The octopuses caught typically ranged from
50-60 pounds (about 25 kg, though could be

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.159
as heavy as a little over twice that) and
usually measured from 7 to 12 feet across

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.919
(about 2-4 meters).

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.409
They were kept on shore in fish tanks while
they awaited weigh-ins and were later generally

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.579
released back into the water once the event
was over as previously noted.

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.700
One of the founders of the sport, Gary Keffler
(who incidentally was once Lloyd Bridges’

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.560
stunt double), described the “dangers”
of tangling with giant octopuses in a much

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.700
less exaggerated manner than Menard did in
his 1949 piece:

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.689
You had to be just a little bit careful about
them grabbing your mask or getting a hold

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.780
of your hose…they could crimple it – tighten
it up so air would be cut off a little bit…

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.499
Keffler also noted that, contrary to what
you might think, the Giant Pacific octopus,

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.959
despite being one of the world’s largest
octopuses, isn’t actually terribly strong,

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.779
certainly not enough to squeeze a person in
any damaging way, nor are their beaks of any

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:49.930
real concern.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.780
He also stated that it wasn’t actually that
hard to pull lose from the tentacles if things

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.099
got a bit too dangerous, like if it ripped
out your air supply and you needed a little

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.099
break.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.769
The hard part was simply coaxing the octopus
out of its den.

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.919
Apparently if it didn’t come out willingly,
it was somewhat difficult to pull its slippery

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.439
body out when it had all its arms suctioned
to the rocks.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:16.090
At the height of the sport’s popularity
in 1964, more than 100 divers competed before

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.449
a crowd of about 5,000 spectators.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.180
However, within a decade, people had moved
onto other hobbies.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.800
Even the aforementioned co-founder of the
sport, Gary Keffler, would later state in

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.380
an interview about his retrospective thoughts
on wrestling octopus, “There’s no reason-

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.860
unless you were going to get them for food-
to harm them or take them.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.800
So why bother hurting something that isn’t
hurting you?”

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.330
The shift in attitude was largely thanks to
the widespread perception of octopus as “dangerous

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.270
sea monsters” changing to the more accurate
label of “fascinating, mostly harmless (to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.270
humans) animals.”

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.870
This switch was helped in no small part by
the 1971 Jacques Cousteau documentary Octopus,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.030
Octopus (watch it here) which documented the
creatures in great detail, including their

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.830
relatively benign (to humans) nature.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.670
Needless to say, the general public, and the
divers themselves, quickly lost interest,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.700
starting to see octopus wrestling more as
animal cruelty than good fun and a fair fight.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.470
And so it was that in 1976, the state mostly
outlawed the sport, making it illegal to “molest”

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.780
or “harass” an octopus, although it could
still be fished for food purposes, meaning

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.720
one could choose to capture octopus by hand
with intent to eat, if the individual in question

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.060
had an appropriate permit.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.620
In fact, by 2010, octopuses in the waters
around Washington could only be harvested

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.500
without anything that would “penetrate or
mutilate the body.”

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.800
This brings us to one of the region’s last
publicly known octopus wrestlers.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.730
For reasons not entirely clear, in 2012 then
19 year old Dylan Mayer was inspired to hunt

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:48.360
an octopus with nothing but his bare hands,
training for the event in his parent’s pool

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360
with friends.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.170
Once he deemed himself ready, he was able
to get a permit for such a hunt.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:58.430
And so it was that on October 31, 2012, he
went into the water off Alki Beach to search

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.450
for his prey, which turned out to be a nine
foot Giant Pacific octopus that initially

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.600
retreated in its rock piling upon encountering
Mayer.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.730
However, after continued harassment, Mayer
reported it exploded out at him with a vengeance,

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.940
simultaneously grabbing Mayer’s leg and
wrapping its tentacles all over his torso

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.940
and face.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.300
At this point, Mayer stated the octopus pulled
the regulator out of his mouth.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.860
Panicking a little, he punched the octopus
in the head and the fight was on.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.901
The media reported it took approximately 25
minutes for Mayer to wrestle the octopus to

00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:31.130
the surface, though if you read the accounts
of veteran octopus wrestlers or just watch

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.160
the previously linked Octopus, Octopus, this
seems a bit exaggerated.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.050
As Jacques Cousteau himself notes (and demonstrates)
“matched in mid-water against a girl with

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.320
experience, even the largest octopus in the
world doesn’t stand a chance.”

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.591
So one has to wonder how much of this time
(if it really took that long at all) was simply

00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:51.070
Mayer needing to stop at appropriate depths
for a while to allow the nitrogen to off-gas

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.460
from his system, rather than a major struggle,
as was often described in news reports.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.810
Whatever the case, Mayer was successful at
bringing the octopus back to land, though

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.530
soon wished he wasn’t.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.550
When a group of divers saw him emerge, “punching
an 80-pound octopus,” they were outraged.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.090
Nevertheless, they were unable to stop him
from taking the octopus home, as he had the

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.320
proper permit and had captured it with his
bare hands with intent to eat it, making it

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.000
perfectly legal for him to do so.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.960
Subsequently, when he got home, he cooked
and ate the animal.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.700
But this is the age of social media and flash
internet mobs; so it’s unsurprising that

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.040
when the other divers, still aghast and having
taken photos of Mayer, posted them online,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.400
the public outrage was palpable, with people
eventually tracking down the young man’s

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.150
personal details to share among the masses.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.450
Thankfully for the embattled teenager, Mayer
was redeemed in the public eye in part by

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.650
showing up to a Washington Fish and Wildlife
Commission meeting with his parents and stating,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.660
“I was the hunter.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.790
I did not know that that place was so loved
by all the divers, or otherwise I would not

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.790
have done it…

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:48.040
I do agree with how that place should be off
limits [to octopus hunting], and it should

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.810
be clearly posted so that this mistake doesn’t
happen again.”

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.510
On top of that, the New York Times, among
others, pointed out the irony of some of the

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.220
same news outlets who were vilifying Mayer
one week singing the praises of a new restaurant,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.570
Bar Sajor, in Pioneer square the next, including
giving rave reviews for the restaurant’s

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.150
Giant Pacific octopus salad…

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.320
And, indeed, they noted commercially caught
Giant Pacific octopus is popularly purchased

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:14.050
and consumed at many restaurants around Seattle
without any of the outrage that had been directed

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:17.900
at Mayer, who’d perfectly legally caught
and prepared his dinner himself.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.420
Nevertheless, to address the public outrage
that emerged from Mayer’s hunting trip,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.420
and to conserve specific popular diving sites,
the state designated seven Octopus Protection

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.880
Areas, more or less putting the final legal
nail in the mostly long-closed coffin of the

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:49.350
practice of wrestling Giant Pacific octopus
in the region.
