- Hey, you guys buying my
stuff off my ex-wife on eBay?

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:15.148
- Um-Mm, no, no.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.851
- Nope.
- Yes.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.085
- Can you at least give back

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.620
the framed picture
of me and my niece?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.590
- I'm sorry but I really like
the sunset in the background.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.091
- Hey, this came.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:28.094
Due to budget cuts we've let
go of our first response team.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.296 align:start size:84% position:16%
Our insurance
providers require us

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:31.464 align:start size:81% position:19%
to have one weapon
on hand on hand

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.366
in case there's a break-in.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:34.834 align:start size:75% position:25%
(weapon cocking)
- Whoa!

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:38.571
Okay, let's keep it in
a safe place until...

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
Well, I guess considering
the people involved,

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.376
this technically won't
be considered tragic.

- Okay, since I'm the
hero, I get the gun.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.065
But I brought ya'll in
weapons of your own.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.667
Anita, you get nunchuks.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.271 align:start position:0%
- In the name of the Virgin
Mary's sweet untouched titty's.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.741
I don't want that Joy
Luck Club shit, nigga!

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.943
- More like, Out of Luck Club.

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:19.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
C'mon, the pun makes
it less racist.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.214
- Well, what did you bring me?

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:25.919 align:start position:0%
- Two issues of Redbook,
wrapped in a spooky biker chain.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.754
- Now, I'm not sure if
this is going to help me

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.656
with the fighting of the people.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.758
But I am interested
in which sundresses

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start size:97% position:3%
are flattering on oval-shaped
women, so thank you.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.096
- How 'bout me?

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.464
- A Jafar mask.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.631
- I should get the gun.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.466
- Why?

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:40.500
- I'm a Pisces.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.501
- That's not a thing.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.869
- OJ was innocent.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.903
- Thank you, Anita.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:45.872
But no one should get the gun.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:47.707
You're all emotionally unstable,

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.409
I've walked in on at least three

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.944
of you crying, since Monday it--

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.879
- I get emotional during Lent.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.315
What'd you give up for
our Lord and Savior,

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.717 align:start size:88% position:13%
you Elijah Wood-looking
Mother Fucker.

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.252
- Ladies, ladies.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.222 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's only one rational
way to settle this gunfight.

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:03.256
- What's that?

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.424
- Knife fight.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.062
Okay, whoever draws
blood first wins.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:10.597
- Lyle's already bleeding.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:12.031
- Stop making fun of me.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.299 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Why don't you
just share the gun.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.802
Everybody gets it
for a half an hour.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.970
- [Group] Ohhhhhh.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.805
- Well, who get's the gun first?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.407
- Well, only one
way to find out.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.442
- What is that?

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:23.443
- Knife fight.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:26.579
- [Group] Oh, ah, eh, oh, ouch.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.780
- Butter-Nofs!

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It was either that
or Crazy Straws.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.584
They don't trust us
with the real stuff

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.753
they'll be trading
us cash to be racist.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.255
(crunching)

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:36.489
Hey, what was that?

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.525
- I put the gun in
the trash compactor.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:41.661
Why, because most of you
would end up shooting me.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.264
Except for Lyle, who would
probably just kill himself.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.465
- Fingers crossed.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.033
- Bummer, you know what?

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.701
We don't need a gun.

00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:50.136
This is our museum,

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.438 align:start size:84% position:16%
we can remove any
obstacle in our path.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.175
- [Group] Yeah, yes,
whooo, dee dee do.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:56.910
- We're the good guys, guys.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.445
- [Group] Whoo, Yoo hoo.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:02.982
- From now on, we
become the guards

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.018
we were always meant to be!

00:03:05.018 --> 00:03:08.254

yeah, mother fucker.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.092
