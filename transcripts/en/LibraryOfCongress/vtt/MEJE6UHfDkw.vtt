00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.430
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.350
On behalf of all my colleagues, and
in particular Dr. Mary Jane Deeb,

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.840
chief of the African and
Middle Eastern division,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.050
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.490
I'm Joan Weeks, head of
the Near East section,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.000
the sponsor of today's program.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.790
We are very pleased to present
this program on the poetry

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.040
of Jawdat Haydar, a
transnational framework.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.650
However, before we start today's
program and introduce our speaker,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.020
I'd like to give you a brief
overview of our division

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.840
and the resources in the
hopes that you'll come back

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.740
and use this reading
room for your research.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.360
First of all, this is
a custodial division.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.790
That means that we house and serve
the collections to researchers

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.430
from around the world through
all the 78 countries and more

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.630
than two dozen languages.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.660
The Africa section is comprised

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.950
of all the countries
of sub-Sahara Africa.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.400
The Hebraic section
covers Hebraic worldwide.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.730
And the Near East section covers
all of the Arabic countries,

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.930
particularly of North Africa,
Turkey, Turkic central Asia,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.220
all the Arab countries in the
Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.580
and the Muslims of China.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.320
Even the peoples of the Caucuses.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.280
So it's a very extensive
collection and we really want

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.120 position:56%
to encourage people to come in for
their research and further programs.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.450
We'd also like to invite you to
try out our Four Corners blog.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.230
We have special little
fliers in your seats

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.030
that show those very special
blog posts by our curators.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.930 position:56%
Very interesting stories and very
special items about our collections.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.610
And if you like us on
Facebook, subscribe,

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.250

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.110
And also many interesting
facts about our countries.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.840
So also I'd like to remind you
that you're more than welcome

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.500
after the presentation
to ask questions.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.290
But since we're videocasting this
presentation, if you ask questions,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.350
you're implicitly giving us
permission to rebroadcast them.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.420
Also after the presentation
I'd like to invite you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.450
to a very special display
of the poet.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.060
This is a very special time
of the year at the library.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.640
We celebrate April as poetry month.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.850
And so this is a very special
opportunity to celebrate that

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.600
and see a display of the poet.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.260
As well as some refreshments.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.980
And so we really appreciate
those and invite you to come back

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.680
to the conference room after
the presentation for that.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.540
So right now I'd like to invite our
Arab world specialist Nawal Kawar

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.700
up to the podium to
introduce our speaker.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.510

She's currently working on a book.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.970
No, she's not currently
working on a book.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.620
I am reading the old one.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.830
She just completed her book
entitled, Between the Transnational

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.710

by Arab American writers spanning
the second half of the 20th century

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.320
to the present to examine
the pivotal role

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.690
that the Arab homeland plays
in shaping Arab American.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.510
Please help me welcome
Dr. Carol Fadda.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:20.070
[ Applause ]

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carol Fadda: Let
me grab my computer here.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.010
Thank you so much for
that introduction.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.820
And I've been instructed
to speak close to the mic

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.200
so that you can all hear me.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.530
And if for some reason I move
away from the mic, just wave

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.470
and I'll come close to it.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.460
So thank you so much for all being
here on such a beautiful day.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.350
It means a lot you know when we
leave the sun outside and come

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.390
and sit in this beautiful library.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.550
I want to thank the
Library of Congress,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.590 position:56%
especially the Near East section of
the African and Middle East division

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.300 position:56%
for hosting us in this lovely space.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.400
I also want to thank Mrs. Hasheen
Al-Saddon, Mrs. Dean Al-Saddon

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:09.210 position:56%
and also Ria Al-Saddon for
inviting me to be part of this event

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.860
and to speak about the
wonderful work of Jawdat Haydar.

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:20.330
So my talk today will
be focusing on the works

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.630
of the Lebanese poet
Jawdat Haydar who was born

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.200
in 1905 and passed away in 2006.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.140
Placing his poetry in a
transnational framework in order

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:37.120
to analyze how such a framework can
be used to link for example the US

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.140
and the Arab world in ways that
exceed and trouble neat divisions

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.840
of here and there,
the west and the east.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.700
So also this transnational
framework will help us to read

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.500 position:56%
and study writers like Jawdat Haydar
alongside Arab immigrant writers

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.480
in the US, most notably the
Bajhad writers whom I will speak

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.140
about more in a bit.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.650
But part of my talk also today
will show how the works of writers

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:09.600
like Jawdat Haydar who did not
necessarily reside long-term

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.170
in the US, nevertheless include
an important transnational link

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.350
between the US and the Arab
world as well as other places.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.530
That helps us in thinking
about literary

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:25.230
and poetic production beyond
the limits of national contexts.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.920
So and then I will move to talk
particularly about some poems

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.300
from Haydar's body of works.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.850
I would argue that the poems
of Jawdat Haydar provide us

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.830
with an important lens
to consider a vision

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.580 position:56%
that straddles multiple national
locations without necessarily taking

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.870
on ethnic or hyphenated identities
such as Arab-American for example.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.010
The transnational aspect of
Haydar's poetry navigates multiple

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.710
belongings, literary influences
and humanistic investments in ways

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.900
that necessarily complicate again
the neat divisions between here

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.290
and there, the Arab
world and the west.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.750
And by doing so reject the
limited and rigid values attached

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.620
to these binary divisions.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.450
With you know, what
we're very familiar with,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.360
with the Arab world being
depicted as backward and the west

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.030
as civilized and progressive.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.720
So looking at how these poems
trouble and complicate that.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.560
So again Haydar's poetry questions
these binaries by presenting

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.150
in his body of work as a
whole a transnational vision

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:37.230
that ultimately exceeds limited and
prepackaged notions of identity,

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.050
nation, belonging and citizenship.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:44.410
So just to speak a bit about
this transnational framework,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.880
because I've taken
it up in my own work,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.270
whereby I discuss the literature
of Arab-American writers,

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:53.360
mainly focusing from
the 1990's onwards

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.560
to show how these works
exhibit forms of connection

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:02.100
to the Arab world and to the US
that point to a fluid, multiple

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.170
and complex form of
national belonging

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.260
that cannot simply be contained

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.440
by single citizenships
or national identities.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.280
And we see that in a
variety of ways in the works

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.470
of the Arab-American
writers I study,

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.420
whether it's Lebanese-American
writers,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.290
Palestinian-American
writers, Iraqi-American,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.820
Egyptian-American, et cetera.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.050
And what about this concept
of the transnational?

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.750
Let me just say something
about it quickly.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.100
To think about you know the
transnational and people

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.820
who perform this notion of
transnational belonging,

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:46.140 position:56%
to think about how it mainly focuses
on embodying a simultaneous physical

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.330
or metaphorical placement in dual
or even multiple locations that cut

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.420
across national boundaries.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.450
Transnational enactments are far

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.160
from being uniform or
consistent, however.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.560
They include physical
mobility but also extent

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.610
to imaginative attachments.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:06.550
All promulgated by the
fast development of tools

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.490
of communication such as
the internet and others.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.190
So these transnational enactments
vary depending on the conditions

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.400
that enable or prohibit
people's access

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.480
to multiple national
locations, whether by virtue

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.220
of geopolitical conditions,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.730
generational divides,
or economic means.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.660 position:56%
So what I mean by this is that even
when we talk about the transnational

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.910
as bridging two places, we
also have to keep in mind

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:37.540
that not everyone can
travel easily between places

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.740
and nations and cross borders.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.570 position:56%
So it is with these understandings
in mind that I argue for development

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.030
of a complex transnational
discourse,

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:50.180
a discourse that overturns fixed
and conventional adherences

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.360
to diasporic, national
and ethnic labels

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.120
and underscores larger structures
of belonging, citizenship

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.510
and national membership

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.270
that transform the limits
of the nation state.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.260
At the same time, it places
racial, ethnic, gendered, religious

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.860
and sexual identities outside the
rigid constructs of traditional

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.940
or normative, cultural
and national frameworks.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.040
So again I want to kind of
see how that is an evidence

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.110
in Jawdat Haydar's poetry and how

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:26.910
that poetry negotiates this
multiplicity of belongings.

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.580
And just to kind of say
a bit about the context

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:36.000
of an immigrant framework, in
order to place that in conversation

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.060 position:56%
with Jawdat Haydar's own experience,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.260
so this transnational consciousness
is not a new phenomenon.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:48.240
And other scholars have written
about it in a historical context

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.030
in relation to the Arab
diaspora and Arab immigration.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:57.350
And so we see how transnational
connections between Arab homelands

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.030
and the diaspora are very much

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:03.000
in evidence during the first
period of Arab immigration.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.440
And so just to kind of quickly
say that Arab immigration

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.810
to the US spans roughly
three periods, three phases.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:21.240
The first one extends from the
1880's to 1925 or mid-1920's.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.860
Which is 1925 is the year that the
Immigration Quota Act was passed.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.940
And that limited the
number of immigrants

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.570
to the US based on
their nationality.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.590
And the second wave of
immigration started with the end

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:37.620
of World War II, '45 to late-'60's.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:44.210
And the last phase facilitated by
the passing of the 1965 Immigration

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.820
and Nationality Act extends from
the 1960's to the current period.

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.210
So that's also helpful to know

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:56.950
because the various literary
movements in the US as well

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:02.150
as the movements that straddle the
Arab world roughly follow these

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:06.630
three waves of immigration, early,
middle and contemporary period,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.600
with the Mahja writers coming to
the forefront in the first period.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.720
And so this is -- I just want to
kind of talk about that quickly

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.370
because it's important to know
that phase in terms of placing

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:25.320
that first phase in relation to
Jawdat's own experience in the US.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.090
So during this first period we
have the Mahja writers including

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.470
of course Khalil Gibran,
Ameen Rihani, Mikha'il Na'ima,

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.720
and Elia Abu Madi among
others, who immigrated to the US

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.140
and eventually resettled in
their original homelands.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.130
And they wrote in both
English and Arabic.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.930
In 1920 they established in
New York what came to be known

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.570
as Rabhi mik Colonia,
or the Pen League,

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.790
consisting of both Syrian
and Lebanese writers.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.380
And they maintained a
solid transnational outlook

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.330
in their physical and
intellectual negotiations

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.260
of Arab and American identities.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.150
So again, to emphasize
this early period,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.370
and in order because
this is the period

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:14.480
when Jawdat Haydar you
know came to the US.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:21.370 position:56%
So in order to get an idea of what
kind of literary space was happening

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.800
or existed within the US.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.770
So turning to the life and works of
Jawdat Haydar, we see that somebody

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.790
like him cannot be easily
placed within a specific

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.610
or rigid hyphenated identity,

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.670
because he himself was
not an immigrant per se.

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.690
But came to the US to study,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.750
after which he returned
to his native Lebanon.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.550
But as I will address here in a
bit, his poems nevertheless point

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.550 position:56%
to a multiple and varied perspective
that cannot so easily be defines

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.160
as US-based or solely
Lebanese per se.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.580
For these poems exhibit an
elusiveness and a range of places,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.590
themes, commitments
and relationships.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.460
Writing primarily in English,

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.430
Jawdat Haydar published his
first anthology, Voices,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:17.190
in 1980 which was followed by
Echoes in 1989 and Shadows in 1998.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.860
In 2006 he published his last book,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:27.120
101 Selected Poems
at the age of 101.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.720
So after graduating from North
Texas State University in 1928

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.270
and upon his return to Lebanon,
Haydar kicked off his career

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.650
as principle of the Universal
College in Hallab, Lebanon,

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.290
after which he assumed
the directorship

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:44.450
of the Nahda National School
in Nables in Palestine.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:50.240
In 1932 Jawdat Haydar became the
first national staff employee

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.640
in the Iraq Petroleum
Company, initially appointed

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.510
as assistant employment
officer in Syria.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.590
And then he became industrial
relations advisor in 1956.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:05.940
After which he subsequently became
general manager of the Mid East Oil

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:11.730
and Trading Company until
his retirement in 1965.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.850
Haydar was also the founder and
president of [inaudible] or Oasis

00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:19.990
of Literature in the Baca Valley.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:23.640
And a member of the Union
of Lebanese Writers.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.830
His poem, The Temple of
Baalbek has been incorporated

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.010 position:56%
into the official curriculum for
the Lebanese national baccalaureate.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.280
While a copy of the poem
currently hangs in the museum

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.140
at the temple of Baalbek.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.900
More recently the faculty
of arts and humanities

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.420
at the Lebanese University also
passed an official decision

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.380
incorporating Haydar's poetry

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.090
into its national curriculum
at the university level.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:53.060
And he's been the recipient
of numerous medals and awards.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.970
And there's a really
wonderful display

00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:58.250
of these awards in the next room.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.550
So after the talk we
can take a look at it.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:07.930
So it is during his time in the
US, after he graduated from UAB

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:10.620
in 1925, he came to the US.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.930
And so after -- it was
during this time here

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.720
that Haydar first started
writing poetry.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.040
He graduated again from the
North Texas State University

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.350
in '28 with a BS in education.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:29.180
And so we see him writing
about the US

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.120 position:56%
and this is the poem Dear Old Texas.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.450 position:56%
And I'm not going to read all of it,
but if we take a look at the end,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.410
it says, "Home again, home again
to Dixie Land; the ship will

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:47.840 position:56%
and merrily I land; on the shore and
straight I go to the plow; the hat,

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.800
the pistol, the horse and the
cow; I love thee old Texas,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.080
I love thy land; I love the plains,
rivers, rocks, hills and sands;

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.000
I love they flag, heaven,
nature and sea; God keep you,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.850
God safeguard your liberty."

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.260
So in fact this love of
and attachment to the US,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.710
specifically Texas, is also
elucidated in the poem Sweet Home,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:16.030
which he wrote while he
was working in Nables.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:25.310
So again here you know we see him
returning to this space of the US

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:30.470
and specifically Texas
as a space of belonging

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.980
that he is longing for actually.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:39.280
And then he says, "Yes, those days
of old were resplendent and fair;

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.520
when nigh the sycamores with dear
Jack and Lee; I jovially rallied,

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.620
played and learned
to care for the land

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.040
of the real, the land of the free.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.270
Oh no more, nevermore, those
homely sunsets; no more, nevermore,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.780
those song sparrows to hear;
for the queen moved to take me

00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:02.370
where she sits, on the horizon
and old Texas the dear."

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.510
So now this poem and the
preceding one might be used

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.870
to simplistically assert a
singular type of belonging

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:15.030 position:56%
that elevates the US and Texas to a
higher level of national attachment.

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:19.820
However, such a reading falls short
when considering the larger scope

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.750 position:56%
of Haydar's poetic works in which we
find multiple and complex assertions

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.130
of love and attachment
towards a sense of place,

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.880
nation and one's own
standing within these spaces.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.590
As well exceeding singular
or binaristic spaces

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.560
that are pitted against each other.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:42.190 position:56%
For reading Haydar's poems through
a transnational lens enables us then

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:47.360
to place poems like Dear Old Texas
and Sweet Home both temporally

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.290
and spatially alongside poems
like Lebanon and others like it.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.910
In which the concepts
of freedom, democracy

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.970 position:56%
and national pride are not
restricted to one nation or country,

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.870
but one that Haydar locates in
multiple and interconnected spaces

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.180
that are connected through
his transnational location

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.200
within and across them.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:17.760 position:56%
And so we see that similar type of
you know, exploration and veneration

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.440
of a place happening
in a poem like Lebanon.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.190
And towards the end he says,
"Oh life, there is nothing more

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:34.430
to enchant me than this vision of
growing ecstasy; I feel dissolved

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.800
and carried fancy free where
beauty and dreams meet in policy."

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.300
And he says that's the Lebanon.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.980 position:56%
This is the last stanza, "That's
the Lebanon, the heart of the world,

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.450
where the cedars living for
ages unknown and the flag

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.100
of liberty always unfurled and
a democracy without a throne."

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.370
And so here he's talking
about Lebanon.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.380
In thinking about Haydar
and his work

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.520
within a broader transnational
framework, what is noteworthy

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:05.680 position:56%
about his writing in relation to for
example the Mahja poets who lived

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.700
and wrote in the US for
most of their adult life,

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.010
is that Haydar's writing
enacts a similar investment

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.600
in a transnational viewpoint
as that of the Mahja poets,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.250
but from the location
of the Arab world.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:22.370
Which again contributes
to a sense or a worldview

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:26.420
that is not restricted to simple
notions of national expression.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.390
And I would argue that this
is the crux of my argument,

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:36.420
that it is primarily a unique
aspect of Jawdat Haydar's work

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.530
and in fact distinguishes
him from the Mahja poets

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:44.160
and that he was located in the Arab
world but wrote in English mostly,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.310
a combination that
complicates in a positive way

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:51.560
and captures the interconnected
aspects of what is often presented

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:55.270
and perceived as east
versus west, here and there.

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.830 position:56%
So thus we see here how a
transnational poetic vision does not

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.490
necessarily have to emanate from
a US context, but can be based

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.340
in an Arab context while
asserting the fluidity of belonging

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.350
that literature articulations
bring forth in varied ways.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.680 position:56%
And that is something that the Mahja
poets collectively struggled with

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.580
and worked on throughout
their lives,

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.120
because they ultimately occupied
a different positionality

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.160
than that of Haydar's.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:29.360
I want to emphasize though that
such a transnational poetic vision

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.350
that I've been discussing is often
juxtaposed with the restrictions

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.280
and limitations of physical
boundaries and borders.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.290
And we see that affecting
Jawdat Haydar himself

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.900
when for instance we
see him after graduating

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.400
from the American University
of Beirut, he went to France.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.930
And he was trying at first
unsuccessfully to get a visa

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.440
to study in the US
while he was in France.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.900
So the story goes that he by chance
met the American consult's wife

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.430
in a movie theater and she offered

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.230
to help him procure
a visa to the US.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:07.630
And we also see the difficulties of
border crossings and the conundrums

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:12.270
of national identities,
especially for colonized peoples,

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.770 position:56%
even when supposedly returning home.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.960
When Haydar could not procure a
passage to Lebanon from the US

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.140
because he would be entering
what would be referred

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.480
to as French mandated territory

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.490
and that he was still
identified as a Turkish subject.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:31.770 position:56%
So I'm giving these examples to help
us think about not only the ease,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.830
but the difficulty of
crossing borders and enacting

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:41.450
that transnational vision
that I'm talking about.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.410
So we see here a link between the
lives and works of Jawdat Haydar

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:48.970
and the Mahja poets, which
is a recurrent thematic focus

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:53.130
on cultural negotiation, and in
between this, specifically in terms

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.960
of east and west relations,
cultural difference

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.850
and political instability
affecting their home country.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.180
Even though as John Monroe states,

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:06.930
Jawdat Haydar himself did
not experience the feeling

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.250
of being pulled in two
different directions,

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.910
sometimes toward the east and
sometimes toward the west.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.550
I would point out that Haydar's
poetry nevertheless exhibits

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.700
sensitivity, awareness
and investment

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.960
in such cultural negotiations.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.920
An awareness that might not emanate

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.300
from again an immigrant
experience per se,

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.040
but one that is nonetheless
shaped by experiencing the US

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.830
and specifically Texas as an Arab.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.670
And then living and travelling
in the Arab world as a Lebanese

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.970
but with multiple cultural
registers and experiences.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:47.060
Moreover, even though as Monroe
writes in his book, Jawdat Haydar:

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.600
the Voice from Baalbek, that
and I quote, "Haydar's sense

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.170
of alienation was quite different
from the alienation as experienced

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:57.440
by the Mahja writers,"
it is inevitable

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.610
that Haydar was quite cognizant
of the negative representations

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.930
of Arabs in the US, and the extent

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.130
to which these representations
were internalized by many Arabs

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:08.930
and Arab-Americans themselves.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:14.270
So for here we have a context
of a long history of orientalism

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.580
that defines western
attitudes toward the east.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.430
And just to speak briefly about
it, you know, this kind of back

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:28.440
and forth was not only you know,
Arab immigrants coming to the US,

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.230
but also there's a back
and forth movement.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.700
Because American culture
in the late 18th

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.790 position:56%
and 19th centuries was characterized
by what [inaudible] describes

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:42.930
in US orientalism as
a race to the orient.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.400
So we have merchants,
travel writers, tourists

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:52.570 position:56%
and academics among other explorers
and opportunists sweeping the orient

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.660
in pursuit of treasures,
whether they be material,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.690
spiritual or intellectual.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:03.030
And also accounts of near eastern
and Asian lore and magical tales

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.820
of adventure and discovery were

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:08.140
in great demand among the
American public at that time.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.780
Such reports contributed
in fostering

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.320
and embellishing an alluring
eastern mystique in the western,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.810
specifically American,
consciousness.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.770
A natural consequence of these
exploratory endeavors was the

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.870
inevitable inception of a
valuable vein of discourse

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.210 position:56%
between western and eastern culture.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:31.560 position:56%
However, such a rapport, instead of
being a mutual and balanced exchange

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.770
of cultural views and ideas,
was initially heavily informed

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.820
by a western biased outlook
in matters pertaining

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.000
to the perception,
translation and espousal

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.830
of the collective eastern mind.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:48.910
And of course some of
these western perceptions

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.410
of eastern thought were
initially transmitted by the waves

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:55.500
of Christian missionaries
who flocked to the Near East

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.050
in the early 19th century,
specifically to Syria, Lebanon

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.510
and Egypt in pursuit of converting
the masses into Christianity

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.730
and hence -- you know,
as described by them --

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.430
redeeming their own
souls in the process.

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:11.390
The reactions emanating
from such western encounters

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.700
with the east greatly
contributed to shaping the manner

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.430
in which eastern characteristics
and images were absorbed by

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:23.990
and imprinted on the American mind.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:28.710 position:56%
So this intellectual and even
dominance-oriented expansion towards

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.900
the east however may be offset

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.190
by a counter movement towards
the west led by Arab immigrants

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.620
and students seeking their
fortunes in the Arab world.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:48.130
And so there were serious
implications of this exchange,

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:53.360
right, in terms of these western
missionaries and scholars going to

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.660
and describing the
east on western terms.

00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.720
However the US's early what is
referred to as benevolence control

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.590
in the Arab control presented it in
a largely positive light for Arabs,

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.680
especially when compared to
the colonial roles of France

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.360
and Britain in the region.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.610
Which is why it is not surprising
that Jawdat Haydar's attitude

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:18.480
to the US and his coming to the
US was a largely positive one.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.360
So you know, just to kind of
place it in historical context.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.650
His relatively short stay in the
US might have helped maintain

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.490
that positivity which
differs for example

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:33.550
from the increasing disillusionment
faced by many of the Mahja poets

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:38.630 position:56%
in the US and what they described
as the country's excesses and greed.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:43.070
However, if we look at the long arc
of Jawdat Haydar's poetic output,

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.730
we see him denouncing the causes
and effects of immigration,

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:51.470
which he comes to describe as
detrimental to the Arab psyche,

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:56.040
advocating for the Lebanese
for one to stay at home rather

00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.170 position:56%
than pursue the dreams of success in
the west and specifically America.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:03.070
The urge that characterized
many of the early immigrants,

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.050
including the Mahja
writers among them.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:10.050 position:56%
And this is one of the things that's
really great about these poems,

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:14.040
is that given that they span
a long historical period,

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.710
we can see how they
also can be placed

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.590
in conversation with each other.

00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:21.820
So for example, in this
poem Lebanese Immigrants --

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.660
and I'll read just a
short excerpt from it.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:30.000
He starts by saying, "Friends,
why spend yourselves on the wings

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.710
of time, flying everywhere
and nowhere to land.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.470
Look how the eagles dare the
sky and climb, and wing reach

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:39.790
and back on the cliffs to stand."

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.880 position:56%
And then later on in that same poem
he says, "The alien footing treading

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:47.980
on your threshold to safeguard
the grandeur of your tradition,

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.820
by the lion limb you
have had of old,

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.950
the mighty shield of
your true position.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:58.020
Come back, put your food down and
your head up, like proud Sunine

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.870 position:56%
on the breast of our land, with eyes
looking the world from the top up,

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:07.120
our flag down the years of
the brine washing sand."

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:11.740
So keep in mind if you look
at the date on that poem

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:15.150
that this poem is actually written
while the Lebanese Civil War was

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:16.840
still going on and raging.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:22.370
So to write this poem during
that period, you know to caution

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:25.130
against immigration
is pretty noteworthy.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.740
And not only showing that
Haydar's poetic vision spans a long

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:32.920
historical period and charts
different historical, geographical

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.910 position:56%
and political moments, and the
poet's specific position in relation

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:42.790
to them, but also that his poems
take up thorny and difficult topics

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:46.610
of war trauma and the
devastating effects of conflicts

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:50.020
on individual and collective
psyches.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.870
While the Mahja poets for one,

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.350
as well as the more
contemporary Arab American

00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.620
and other diasporic writers of
the late 20th century onwards

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.300 position:56%
for the most part accessed the
wars, unrest and political conflict,

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.060
from the vantage point
of the diaspora,

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:08.940
Haydar lived those experiences
from within the Arab world

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.880
and wrote about them in English.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.050
Which provided access
to a wider audience.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.730
For one Haydar wrote
extensively about the Lebanese war

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.060
in this poems, warning
the destruction of Beirut

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:24.290
and denouncing the violence
that overtook his country.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:28.580
Again, writing about it not from
the vantage point of the diaspora

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.010
but from within Lebanon itself.

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:42.060
And he says in this poem -- I'm
going to read the last part,

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:46.200
which is cut from here so
you can -- I'll just say it.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.430
"Never mind, history will record
the crime, and timing time,

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.350
timely will avenge blood for blood;

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.060
just to make the balance sheet
right; and I'll stand there

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:01.480
on the highest mound to spit now on
every year once on the whole world,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.170
to lubricate the tools
of its mechanism.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:09.610 position:56%
Perhaps it will wheel right to the
palace of justice so that the people

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.800
on earth may enjoy
their safety tomorrow."

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.160
And that's written
on August 12th 1982.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.840
However, attesting to their
thematic versatility --

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.270
and you know, I really do need
to emphasize that the range

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:30.730 position:56%
of his poems also shows the thematic
versatility and the multiple themes

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.860
that he takes up in these poems.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.550
So again these poems do not focus
singularly on the Lebanese War

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:42.170
or on Lebanon, but explore stated
and unstated far-reaching effects

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.900
of such violence on individual
and collective psyches.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:49.800
We see in Haydar's later
poems for one a turn to nature

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:53.690
that elucidates a continuing
interest in and influenced

00:33:53.690 --> 00:34:00.200
by the romantic poets, which he has
also written about in his poems.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.950
On his poetic style, Jason Lewan
who is an assistant professor

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:09.410
of creative writing at AUB,
he writes, "He, Haydar,

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:13.770
boldly fuses the poetic styles
and sentiments of the romantic,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:15.510
Victorian and modern periods

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:19.720
of Anglophone literature while
exploring issues of common interest

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.950
to people living in regions as
far apart as Texas and Iraq."

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:32.220
And so we see also that versatility
of the poems coming through in

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:34.610
that broad thematic reach.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:40.650
You know, and expressing
his influence and admiration

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.860
of the romantic poets, we have
a poem here titled In Memory

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:49.060
of Wordsworth and His Sonnet
Upon Westminster Bridge.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.310
And he says, "Wordsworth, I stand
where you once stood before,

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:58.050
on this bridge of antiquity and
fame; where emperor, tourist

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:02.450
and troubadour have come to
London in honor of your name."

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:09.230
And he says, "Wordsworth, your
words worth being a tableau,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:14.000
pranked by the lifelike hue of
your sonnet; with the stately views

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.850
of the world that show old London
wearing a gray sky bonnet."

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.330
And he says, "Although you fell
silent long ago, you are enlivened

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.170
by your posse; to remain
time-honored in your chateau,

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:33.910
bearing the regal crown of posity."

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:38.730 position:56%
And so at the height of the Lebanese
Civil War, Haydar chose to retire

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:43.030
in his hometown Baalbek where
he spent the rest of his years.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:48.230 position:56%
It is also in Baalbek that Haydar
established what I referred to early

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:52.830
as [inaudible] or the Oasis of
Literature, a society of poets

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.470 position:56%
who strove to revive Lebanese poetry

00:35:55.470 --> 00:36:01.390
and enhance collaboration among
the poets of the Baca valley.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:05.960
And under his presidency,
it's noteworthy that Oasis

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.560
of Literature restored the statue
of the renowned poet Khalil Tran

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.830
to the entrance of the
historic city in recognition

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:17.500
of Tran's prominence
as a native scholar.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:23.230
And Haydar dedicated the rest of
his years to farming and poetry,

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:27.670
a wonderful combination
in my opinion.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:34.020
Insisting he is a farmer at heart,
Haydar over 90 years old relates,

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:39.430
he says, "I still farm my land to
get the fresh smell of the earth."

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:43.510
And in an interview shortly
before his death, Haydar states,

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:47.570
"My secret for long life
is always being thankful.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.040
Life is a gift.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.770
Be happy when you can."

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:56.650
So the simplicity of these words
belie a rich and complex vision

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:01.000 position:56%
that understands and well
articulates the conundrums, ironies,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.210
joys and pain of a life
richly lived and experienced.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:10.450
And I'm going to end
here with this poem

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:14.100
which I think really
captures the vision

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:21.290
that runs throughout these poems
and span a long historical period,

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:25.130
but captures that essence
of these poems.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.370
And it's titled Going Back.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.670
"We start going back
on the road we take,

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:37.080
walking ahead to the outset behind;
that's how of birth we are stepping

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.380
to make, a ring back on
the track into the blind.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:45.920
That's a round trip we are
destined to run, climbing the hill

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.990
and railing down the slack; and
railing we signal the day is done,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.490
and what is done, a
journey ahead and back.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:38:01.150 position:56%
Sure, we come going with the ticks
of time, a distance measured by fate

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:05.470
and we fall; never to stand
again, never to climb,

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:09.120
heaven and back and
gone beyond recall.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.550
That's how travelers ahead walking
back, leaving impressions only

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:19.610
of name; and memory of the walk
on the track and the track trails

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:22.040
and smoke behind the flame."

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.840
Thank you.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:31.490
[ Applause ]

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:33.770
Now for questioning.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.070
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Thank you, Carol.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:36.370
That was really wonderful.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.310
Anybody has a question, please?

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:43.910
Yes? Mary Jane, carry on.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.030
That was wonderful.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:53.840
And I wanted to ask you,
did Haydar have a group?

00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:00.190
You know, sometimes poems belong to
a group of other poets and writers

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.610
that share the idea
with their community,

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.060
whether in Texas or Lebanon.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:13.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carol Fadda: From my
readings I saw that you know,

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:19.450
he had a good community
in the US and Texas.

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:23.830
And you know, that partly explains
his favorable experience there.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.900
And you have a really
good experience.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:35.530
But from what I read, you know,
he was the only Arab in there.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:43.060
So that's also interesting, to see
how he was engaged in the community

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:45.110
as someone who's Arab and coming

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.140
into that community
from the Arab world.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.830
But in terms of Lebanon, you know,

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:54.120
the Oasis of Literature
group is really interesting.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.200
Because that shows that
he had the big investment

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.280
in not only producing
poems individually,

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.680
but also collaborating.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:08.070
And having this sort of communal
sense of artistic production

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:14.580
that was invested in showcasing the
works of other poets and writers

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:22.500
like Matran, and placing him
very centrally in the square.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.130 position:56%
So there definitely was an
investment in collectively producing

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:31.060
and insisting on artistic
production.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:32.810
Yeah.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:39.510
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: There
is one over there.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:47.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.400
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carol Fadda: I
didn't catch the last part.

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.510
I'm sorry.

00:40:50.510 --> 00:41:03.120
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:04.720
Yeah, he went to EB.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.760
I mean, I can't speak to
why he decided to do that,

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.130
but I can also speak of
what does it mean to write

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.910
in English as an Arab poet.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:25.000
And so I would say that also shows
a kind of approach to writing

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.450
that is not limited to you know

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:29.910
as an Arab one only
writes in English, right?

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:36.720
Or you know, so that also shows
a kind of educational background,

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:46.160
also an exposure where English you
know becomes a way of communicating

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:50.900
and writing that is not
only restricted to writers

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.570
who are in the US, right?

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:53.870
Or in the west.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:58.440
So I think that's the point
that I'm really interested in,

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:02.590
to kind of think about if you want
to call it Anglophone literature

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:06.770
as literature that doesn't only
emanate from the west, right?

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:10.450
Or is only owned by
a western context.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:14.770
But also how writers positioned

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:20.110 position:56%
in the Arab world also engage
linguistically with English in order

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:21.660
to produce their own visions

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.890
and their own relations
to the language, right?

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:28.260
And also to kind of
show that versatility

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.790
of linguistic and artistic
production.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:36.420
That becomes part of you know
Anglophone Arab cultures.

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.510
Okay.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:43:09.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.500
So the first poem on Texas,

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.930
I think that was published
in a college newspaper.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.850
So we can count that as you know
the first publication and reception

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.150
of that poem, which was
received very favorably.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:28.730
And you know, I also want
to note that the mere fact

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:34.280
that were having this event today
in the Library of Congress attests

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:40.170
to the reception of these poems
and these works that you know,

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:43.050
extend beyond a certain timeframe.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.510
Right, so then how we think of
the reception of these works

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.280
and the ongoing reception
of these works in a kind

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.260
of longer time frame
is also important.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.340
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: I think
we have a couple

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:06.510
of questions, and then -- okay.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:31.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carol Fadda: Probably.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:35.230
I mean, this is all conjecture,
but also the kind of thing

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:41.730
about the Mahja poets like
Gibran and Ameen Rihani,

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:43.810
their experiences I think in Boston

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.460
and New York are significant,
you know.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:51.870
So location I think plays a
big part in how do you interact

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:56.760
with your location or what kind of
community do you find yourself in.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:01.890
You know, because most of the
Mahja poets lived and wrote

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:04.900
in Arab immigrant communities.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.320
So I think that also shapes
that vision significantly.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:14.460 position:56%
So my response would be absolutely,
location, who you're connected with,

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.010
who you interact with,
these communities

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:22.910
around you are ultimately going to
shape your vision of that place.

[ Inaudible ]

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:48.090
Primarily it's that form.

Right, yeah.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:56.530
And there are other I think --
this one, so there's a variety.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:01.360
So we see here in this poem
there is a variety there.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:07.750
And also you know, looking at the
scope of the poems is important

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:13.610
because then we see how
there's a change over the range

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:16.890 position:56%
and the scope of these poems, right?

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.510
So that's versatility, absolutely.

[ Inaudible ]

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.400

are we defining the experimental,

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:32.700
right?

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.000
Because if I'm thinking
of experimental,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.850
I might go through the
extreme and kind of think

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:39.800
about extremely experimental poems.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:46.470
So even if he is not experimental
in that sense, I would see a kind

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.980
of shift in form and trying
different forms throughout

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:52.410

autobiography you know.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.840
He wrote an autobiography
so that's kind

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:19.310
of another genre that he worked on.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:25.510 position:56%

that they're honoring him.

Maybe if you can speak more to that,

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.280
because you were just
visiting the university.

to share with us this event.

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.630
I would say that he was always
in contact with everyone he knew.

He was such a friendly person
and wanted always go keep

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:22.860
in good relation with
everyone and everywhere.

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:26.640
may I answer this question,
if you don't mind?

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.320
The reason why he wrote
directly in English,

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.520
I suppose he was the only one
who wrote directly in English

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.760
since he was 16 years old.

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:43.510
Because he was deprived from
learning Arabic in Lebanon,

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.220
we were under Turkish rule.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.840
And his family was
against the Turkish rule

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.650
and they were exiled to Turkey.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.810
And here he was, only
eight years old.

00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.750
His mother, he stayed with his
mother when he was eight years.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:01.690
His mother passed away.

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.260
She was sick from typhoid.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.280
And here he was all on his own.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:13.310
He went and asked the Turkish
responsible man at the gate

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:17.930 position:56%
of the train, "I want to go to my
parents, to my father and brothers."

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:20.260
And they said, "Go away,
you little boy, from here."

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:22.190
He said, "No, I want to go.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:26.640
Otherwise I'll try
to write a letter."

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:33.730
You know, his father was like
a judge and so the man said,

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.270
"Okay, I will let you go."

00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:36.720
Then he went to Turkey.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.870
He was deprived of Arabic,
was learning Turkish.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:41.270
He came back.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.930
The British troops were looking

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.120
over that the Turkish
would leave Baalbek.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:53.390
He was there and he was
listening to their language.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.260
He was fascinated by the
English language and he said,

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:00.150
"I must go to the new world
and I must learn this language.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:01.990
It's so beautiful."

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:04.410
And so he had a private tutor.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:09.700
This is after all the
family came back in 1917.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.040
And he learned English,
went to the American school

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.690
which is not the American school.

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:17.670
It was the International
College, IC.

00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:21.550
And so he was very good in English.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:23.640
He wanted to go to the States,

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.370
and this was how he was
deprived from the Arabic.

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:30.750
And when he came to Texas, his
teacher was so in love with Burns

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:35.450
and she used to all
the time read for him.

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:39.040
So my father stood up and
said, "Sweet, don't be proud

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:41.530 position:56%
of thy fairly good eyes," so and so.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:43.420
And he said, "Oh, a poet is born.

00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.470
A poet is born."

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:51.280
Then the Dallas newspaper published
his first -- he was 16 years old.

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.900
And then when he came
back to Lebanon,

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.670
of course he was studying
Arabic as well and everything,

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:59.880
but he felt that English
was the tool

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.860
that he could express
his feelings and himself.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.160
That's why.

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.440
And when he published his
first book, he sent his poems

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.510
to Vintage Press here in New York

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.900
and they immediately you
know, they were published.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:20.160
And since then he kept on writing.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.510
Thank you very much.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:25.680
[ Applause ]

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:29.160
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Mrs.
Al-Saddon, she is the daughter

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.230 position:56%
of Mr. Haydar, if nobody knows here.

00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:33.630
Nobody hears me?

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:38.230
Mrs. Al-Saddon is the daughter
of Mr. Haydar the poet.

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:40.030
Okay, now we come to an end.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:43.550
And please, everybody is
invited to the reception.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
