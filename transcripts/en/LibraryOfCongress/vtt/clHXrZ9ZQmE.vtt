00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.910
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
I'm Betsy Peterson.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.540
I'm the director of the
American Folklife Center

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.840
and I want to say welcome.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.570
We're really thrilled
that you all are here.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.920
This is Collections,
Collaborations and Connections.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.040
I guess every academics sort

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.500
of gathering must have
a literation somewhere

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.250
in some title, with a colon.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.320
So we're doing our best.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.800
But this is an event looking at
the American Folklife Center at 40.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.990
And we're really thrilled to
be having this opportunity

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.280
to celebrate all of the good work
of the American Folklife Center

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.530
over the course of the whole year.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.700
This is the third of three
symposiums that we've hosted

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.800
over the last couple of years
examining various issues related

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.220
to cultural heritage documentation

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.000
and archival practice
in this new century.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.970 position:56%
And while we wanted to celebrate the
work of the American Folklife Center

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.660
and celebrate the collections
of the American Folklife Center,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.190
we also wanted to do much more
than that over the next two days.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.760
And in developing the agenda, the
AFC staff working on the symposium,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.660
Nancy Groce, Guha Shankar,
Nikki Saylor and myself,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.080
we decided to highlight a handful
of our collections with an emphasis

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.620
on work developed since
the AFC's founding in 1976,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.790
though that's by no mean--
no means exclusively.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.720
As you can see from the large wax
cylinder collections documenting

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.060
Native American song from the turn
of the 20th century all the way

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.720
to our latest efforts to
develop a digital folklore web

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.970
archiving project.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.350
We also selected these collections

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.030
with an eye towards
inviting discussions

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.620
about contemporary problems
in archival practice

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.460 position:56%
and cultural heritage documentation.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.690
And for us, some of
these problems focus

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.820
on revisiting analog
collections, wax cylinders,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.570 position:56%
making them accessible in a new era.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.670
Some involve the thorny issues of
working with born digital material

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.840
and capturing emergent
vernacular culture.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.350
Others involve very thorny issues

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.060
of collaboration authority inviting
multiple voices into the archives

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.520
and inviting multiple uses of
our archives as we go forward.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.270
All of them require us to
think about scalability

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.220
and the scope of our work.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.220
I imagine these are problems
all of us encounter every day

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.250
in our work in some fashion.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.440
So we're looking forward to some
very lively challenging discussion.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.190
We hope you will think
out loud with us.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.700
We do not see this as a
symposium where we tell you

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.230
about all the great work we do.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.430
Although we'll probably
do a little bit of that.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.330
But we want to identify issues.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.790
We want to brainstorm with you.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.790
We're looking forward to
learning from all of you.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.600
And hoping that maybe, just maybe,
over the next couple of days,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.430
we might identify a few ideas
that will shape the work

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.060
that we do in the next 40 years.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.210
So we are looking forward.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.010
We want to thank the library
services here at the Library

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.130 position:56%
and the acting librarian, David Mao.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.510
Our new librarian will be arriving
tomorrow and will be sworn in.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.250
So we're very excited
about having Carla Hayden

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.650
as the new Librarian of Congress.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.490
And then I also wanted to take a
moment to thank all of the staff.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.500
I mentioned Nancy, who's done
fabulous work, Guha, Nikki,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.850
Thea Austen, Steve Winick,
Stephanie Hall, Jon Gold,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.700
and our fabulous sound man, John
Regan and all of the volunteers

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.390
and I actually should say, to
embarrass one of our newest,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.250
our very new staff member, Kelly
Revak who just joined us a couple

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.790
of weeks ago as a new
processing technician.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.660
So, welcome Kelly.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.560
And now I'll turn this over
to Nancy, who I know wants

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.670
to make a few remarks
about just issues.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.970
Logistics.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.270
Logistics.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.710
&gt;&gt; Nancy Groce: Yes.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.310
This shouldn't be issues, but
just a couple of logistics.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.490
The program it says
I'm Steve Winick.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.240
I'm actually not Steve Winick,
but he is running a little late.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.030
So, just-- we will be in this
room for the next two days.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.930
We hope you'll be able
to join us for both days.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.840
We're right near the usual
restrooms, just outside the door

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.020
to the left and right
across from the cafeteria,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.130
which might be the best choice
for lunch, which we'll be

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.860
on a relatively short lunch break.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.860
We're going to try to run the
sense on time as possible.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.940
We know these always go a
little bit longer and we expect

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.820
that it will be a very
interesting and productive day.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.170
We-- As Betsy said, we
want to encourage dialogue,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.820
both while people are up here

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.000
and also during the breaks
and at the reception.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.700
We hope you'll stay for
the receptions evening.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.410
Also if you haven't had
enough, there are going

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.430
to be some dinner parties going

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.940
out to various places
that's unfortunately,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.240
you'll have to buy your own dinner.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.230
But if you'd like to join
one of four discussion groups

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.490
that will continue on to dinner,
there are signup sheets outside

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.900
on the table as you come
in and please join me

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.120
or my colleagues are all going
to different area restaurants

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.550
to continue discussion and just
to have a less formal chat.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.700 position:56%
I'll be back, or probably Steve will
be back during the day as masters

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.730
of ceremonies to update you
on various [inaudible] things.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.440
But for right now, I just like
to thank you again for coming,

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.240 position:56%
welcome you to the American Folklife
Center and the Library of Congress

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.500
and to reintroduce Betsy.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.290
So, Betsy, if you come up
and I'll-- again, thank you.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:28.460
[ Applause ]

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.760
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: OK.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.440
Hello again.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.530
Oh, OK. All right.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.600
Hello again.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.300
I confess I actually
didn't fully follow the task

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.390
that was said before me to prepare
remarks about the challenges

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.180
of the archives of the future.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:55.070 position:56%
Or actually, what I started doing
was preparing remarks about the goal

00:06:55.070 --> 00:07:00.840
of providing the shifting context
or backdrop of our work now

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.350
and in the past 40 years.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.370
And then secondly, to talk a
little bit about the shifts

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.940
in our archival practice and goals.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.040
So, with that, I think you'll
see, we're going to look

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.850
at the trajectory of AFC's
work in the past 40 years.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.100
But I think also challenges and
opportunities will be identified

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.960
and I think clearly evident.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.700 position:56%
And as an illustration in
preparing these remarks, I went back

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.690
and looked at some of the great
material that's been written,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.060
particularly about the first
20 years of the center.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.870 position:56%
And I went back and read some essays
that the founding AFC director,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:45.020
Alan Jabbour, had written on the
occasion of the 20th anniversary

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.640
in 1996 and there are marvelous
essays that are on our website.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:55.260
Steve Winick has also written about
this period as has Nancy Groce.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.640
But I also wanted to take a
moment to introduce Alan Jabbour,

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.510
the founding AFC director,
who's sitting in our midst.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.370
[ Applause ]

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.070
What-- this is-- so
this is a paragraph.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.160
It was called-- it's from a
piece called Building an Archives

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.460
for the Future.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.080
Folklife Center celebrates
its 20th anniversary.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.540
And he also sort of sets
the context for that event.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.950
The 1970s was a period of
increased attention to roots.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.530
Those aspects of heritage that
lie between the individual

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.620
and the nation and the
connect individuals

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.590
to communities while defining
the nation as a whole.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.580
This attention led to the passage

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:44.810 position:56%
of the American Folklife
Preservation Act, Public Law 94-201,

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:50.420
that passed both houses of Congress
at the end of 1975 and was signed

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:56.030
into law by President
Ford on January 2nd, 1976.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.600
The definition of folklife

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.500 position:56%
in the American Folklife
Preservation Act anchored the center

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.050
firmly in the expressive culture
of the family, ethnic, religious,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.860
occupational and regional
groups that make up America.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:16.910
I tried to think with what that
paragraph would be like in 2016

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.650
and it would be very different.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.890
And I think the shifts are striking
and I think the shifts will speak

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.220
to some of these dramatic
changes, and some of the things

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.940
that shape our work
now going forward.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.330
And certainly, I think we see
very dramatic shifts in attitude

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.390
and a tempered belief in
the national enterprise

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.170
and democratic experiment
that is the United States.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.260
I think there are shifts in
expectations about government

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.130
and civil society, citizen
rights, and responsibilities.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.700
I think there is a stronger
push towards the limit

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.200 position:56%
of government and fiscal constraint.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.410
And these shifts have
affected and continued

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.100
to affect how we do our work, how
we conduct our field research,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:08.170 position:56%
how we develop our collections and
they affect our access to resources.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.740
And I think know, Alan began

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.120
to experience those
constraints towards the end

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:20.380
of his 20-year period
here at the Library.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.810
There's also been a shift from
analog to digital and the rise

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:29.130
of the internet and social
media of course are critical.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.020
And the technology for
documenting our lives

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.010
and culture is much cheaper.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.310
There's more of it.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.770
It's available and
accessible to all.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:42.140
And we can document most
anything anywhere anytime.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.490
And these shifts make
it possible for anyone

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.610
to do professional
quality documentation

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.050
and approximate archival standards.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.820
And it puts into play
all sorts of questions

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.540
about professional knowledge,
authoritative expertise,

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.980
and it also allows us to
begin thinking about access

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.070
on a scale never before possible.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:09.730
And ironically, as it calls into
question professional expertise,

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.410
it also requires a whole new set
of skills and expertise to deal

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.160
with this work in the
backend of things.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.180
Closer to our disciplinary
foundations, there are shifts

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.680
and ideas about community
and individual.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:30.290
And in the 1970s, as you
could see from that statement

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.300
in the definition of Folklife
and the way it was portrayed,

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.100 position:56%
there was more emphasis on
describing cultural or social groups

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.860
in monolithic or static terms.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.450
And in the intervening
years, there is a greater--

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.320
there's been a greater
acknowledgment in anthropology,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.530
sociology, folklore, most any
place you look in the agency

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.930
of the individual, and
the evolving processes

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.370
of forging individual identity.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.360
The shift from group to
individuals almost moved

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.050
from individual towards group.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:10.150
These shifts affect how we
think about folk culture today.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.770
They affect how we think
about cultural communities

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.860
and individual creativity.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.250
And it affects the type
of collections we develop.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:22.740
World history collections have
always been a part of the archive,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.690
but are increasing in number
and significance as a part

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.130
of the archive, and the
Veterans History Project,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.130
and the Civil Rights
History project,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:36.830
both are congressionally mandated
projects are recent examples.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.600
And I can't believe I'm
talking as much I am.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.130
I've just gotten my morning.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:47.020
From the AFC's beginnings,
Alan with Carl Fleischhauer,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:52.210
who was also in our midst and was
the first staff member hired here

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:58.040
at the center, I know both of them
saw a direct linkage to the archive

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.080
of folk song, which was
founded by the Library in 1928.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.630
And in fact, the AFC was
placed at the Library in part

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.080
because the archive of
folk song existed here.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.380
The archive eventually merged
with AFC beginning in 1978

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.820
and it is still the
heart of AFC, I think.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.290
But the archive had a legacy
of initiating field research,

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.500
sending government workers
out, solo or as part

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.880
of larger federal projects
such as the WPA.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:31.190
And in the first 10 years of the
center, this was a large part

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.860
of the work that the center did.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.920
And while they were
continuing in a tradition,

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.880
they were also adding to it.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.550
And they were developing team-based
approaches to field research

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.540
and the material was
much broader in scope,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.590 position:56%
while I think the earlier material
was much more sort of item oriented,

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:55.270
focusing on getting those
songs, getting those stories,

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.820 position:56%
this field work was much more
focused on documenting a broad range

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.970
of cultural tradition
in everyday life.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.400
And visual documentation became
very central to the process

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:12.180
and has only continued
to grow and be at present

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.740
as much as or audio material.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.420
In the late '80s, federal
budget shrunk,

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.660
field surveys decreased
in size and number.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:27.010
And programming started becoming
more critical and, I'm almost done.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.920
I promise.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.340
Alan has remarked that
in that period,

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.170
there began to be a
shift towards working

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.320
with the collections that existed.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.350
And I think the Federal
Cylinder Project and the work

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.090
that is continuing to be
done to bring that work

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.600
into the 21st century
is one great example,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.580
and a very successful
example of that.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:58.330
When Peggy Bulger came to the
archive in the Folklife Center

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:05.710
in 1998, she shifted-- began to
shift some of the collecting,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.030
or collections development
for the Folklife Center.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:12.770 position:56%
And again, I think fiscal constraint
and limited government begins

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.330
to come into play into
that equation and began

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:20.010 position:56%
to acquire collections either
through donation or through purchase

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.110
from individuals such as
Alan Lomax, John Cohen,

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.450
Bruce Jackson, Margaret Mills.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.870
And she also began to
develop long-term agreements

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.460
with nonprofit organizations
such as StoryCorps,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.010
the International Storytelling
Center, the National Council

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.460
for the Traditional
Arts and more recently,

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.530
the Center for Traditional
Music and Dance.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:48.170
And as Steve Winick has commented
in a blog, this led to an explosion

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:51.220
in the quantity of
documentation in the archive

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.470
without a sacrifice in quality.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.460
And since 1976, the
archive has grown

00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:00.280
from approximately 450,000 items

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.750
to a current figure
of about six million.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.400
And that does not include
the Veterans History Project

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.700
as part of that.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.310
So, where do we find
ourselves today?

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.150
Yeah, I think you're
going to hear about some

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.840
of the work that we're doing.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.580
We see ourselves, very much,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:19.090
as a part of a great lineage
stretching back to 1928 building

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.460
on the work of Alan
and Carl, Peter Bartis,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.720
Mary Hufford and many others.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.920 position:56%
And we also find ourselves in a time

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.180
of fiscal constraint,
technological change.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.630 position:56%
The nature of the staff is changing.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.130
The nature of our work
continues to evolve.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.980
We will continue to
grow our collections,

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:44.650
primarily through donations
and occasional purchases.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.890
But that's going to allow us to
bring in a whole bunch of voices

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:51.960
that have never been heard, a whole
bunch of different perspectives

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.440
that may not be amidst the staff.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.490
And I think will provide a
fuller picture for what we do.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.850
I think Veterans History Project,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.860
Civil Rights History
Project have allowed us

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:09.320
and allowed the federal government
to maintain some sort of presence

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.770
and I hope validation
in vernacular culture.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:20.020
But going forward, that will be a
larger, I think, kind of picture.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.460
And I'm excited about that.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.070
I also think the technological
change,

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:32.820
while sort of being disruptive as
people like to say in many ways,

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.980
it is also going to open
up incredible opportunities

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.590
for us to think about scale.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.420
Not only scale in terms of
what we can share online,

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.520
but scale in collaboration in a way

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.110
that we've never been
able to tackle before.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.570
And that's very exciting
to me and, I think,

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.470
to the rest of the staff here.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.690
And with that, I will stop.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.370
But thank you again and
thank you for coming.

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:05.010
We're very excited and I'll
turn it back over to Nancy.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.470
[ Applause ]

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.770
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Hey, hi.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.070
I'm Nikki Saylor.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.760
I'm head of the archive at
the American Folklife Center.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.170
Thank you all for making time to
come out to talk with us today.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.210
-- is happening.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.520
And so, we are trying to figure
out how to be responsive to that.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.880
What it means to create
a research collection

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.980
that will be meaningful
for years to come.

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.260
So, we've invited two archivist
librarians and two folklorists,

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.800
who do research online, to talk
a little bit about what they do

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.570
and then put them in
discussion about the issues.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.900
So I would encourage you to
look at their full bios online.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.700
But I would just mention the order.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.040
Here, we've got Abbie Grotke.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.110 position:56%
She is the head of the web archiving
team at the Library of Congress.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:32.240
She has enabled us to start a
modest and problematic apparently,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.650
collection which we'll hear more

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.730
about documenting expressive
cultures,

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.660
which was actually a
partnership Trevor Owens,

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.960
who's no longer at the Library.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.050
But he took a lead on that
for us so shout out to Trevor.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.320
And then next, you'll be hearing
from Andrea Kitta at East--

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.620
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Kitta.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.920
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: What?

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.220
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Kitta.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.520
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Kitta.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.820
Kitta-- from East Carolina
University

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.120 position:56%
and she's associate professor there.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.300
And she has a PhD in folklore
from Memorial University

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.830
and she does all kinds of research

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:10.210
on medical folklore
and what have you.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.130
So then, we will hear from
Bergis Jules and he is

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.940
at University of California
Riverside.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.490
He also happens to be the PI on a
grant called Documenting the Now,

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.330
which is looking at sort
of technologies and ethics

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.340
around social media archiving.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.640
OK.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.940
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: OK.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.240
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: And then
we have Montana Miller

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.850
and she is associate professor
at Bowling Green State.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:39.440
And she has a PhD in folklore
from UCLA and does all manner

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.520
of research online
and is also involved

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.400
in IRB issues related
to internet research.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.220
So, I'll hand it over to Abbie.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.520
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: OK.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.430
I'm waiting for my
slides to come up.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.730
Should I stand up there?

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.300
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: You
can do whatever you want.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.600
This is a free-form.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.990
You sit if you like.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.290
If you--

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.590
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: No dancing.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.890
Sorry.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:04.190
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Now,
there, you can sit.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.490
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: Hi, everybody.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.790
Welcome. I'm going to talk
a little-- a tiny bit.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.090
We don't have much time
but I'll talk a little bit

00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.420
about our web archiving
program and how we got--

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.320
or some of the challenges
we're facing

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.650
with our web cultures, web archive.

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.280
So, the library has been
archiving web content since 2000

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.330
and we started, like most national
libraries do, with US elections.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.360
We're still archiving US
elections which, you know,

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:26.910
is very draining sometimes.

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.510
But-- So, I'm excited today to talk

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:34.020
about something that's not
government and election content.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.020
So, we kicked off archiving
with sort of pilot programs

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.660
and then quickly became
a production outfit

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.960
when we started documenting
the events of 9/11.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:48.140
So that's been on our
minds the last few days.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.290
And that's one of our earliest
web archives where we are trying

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:56.160 position:56%
to document the expressions and
output of citizens and organizations

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.240
and just the reaction
of the community

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.830
that was unfolding on
the web at that time.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:05.660
So, our-- We have a minimal amount
of our collections available

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.850
through the Library's website.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.140
We-- That's one of our
challenges that I'll talk

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.700 position:56%
about in getting collections online.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.470
We currently have about 25
active ongoing collections

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:18.790
that we're working on.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.960
There's about 90 that we've done.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.440
We take a thematic and
event-based approach to archiving

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.230 position:56%
so we don't have the legal authority
to archive all of the US web.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:30.340
We can't even define
what the US web is.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:33.780
So, unlike some of our
national library colleagues

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:37.240 position:56%
who can archive all of the Icelandic
domain or the French domain,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.540
we don't have that luxury.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:43.250
So we do select the content
and my team is responsible

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.600
for managing the sort
of the overall project

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.320
and activity on the workflow.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.650
The selecting of the
websites and the development

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:54.240
of the collections come
to experts like Nikki.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.510
And when Trevor was here,
he helped us out as well.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.890
So that's sort of the quick
overview of what we're doing.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.420
Here's the description
of how the web archive--

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.960
the web cultures web
archive was proposed to us

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:12.620 position:56%
and we have a little proposal form
that people have to fill out to sort

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.400
of think about the types of content

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.510
that they might select
for the archive.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.240
How that actually plays out when
they come to select the content,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.950
it can depend on a
number of factors.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:25.990
I won't spend time
reading that but basically,

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:32.040 position:56%
the idea is to capture vernacular
sites that aren't official channels.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.230
So they were some of these-- I will
show some examples that will help.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.030
So, we began crawling this
content in April of 2014.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:47.220
Forty nine sites or URLs
were nominated for archiving.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.370
We have crawled 33 of them.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.720
We're crawling most of it still.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.100
There are few that have
gone away since then.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.860
Sixteen of those have not been
crawled for permissions reasons.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.000
We have to ask explicit
permission of the site owners

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.800
to archive their content.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.040
I could spend the whole
hour to talking

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.750
about our extensive permissions
policies here but I won't.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.020 position:56%
But we-- 13 of those did not
respond to their permission request.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.560
So, if they do not
respond, we cannot archive

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.720
which is-- can be unfortunate.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.920
Two sites denied permission
to crawl so we were not able

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.050
to collect those sites and then
a few others we did not archive

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:27.640
for other reasons.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.520
So, some of the biggest
challenges, again,

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.310
are the permissions responses.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:37.020
There are a number that we attempt
to contact site owners three times

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.690
and if they-- If we don't hear
from them after a year, we give up,

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.700
unless we find another
contact email to try.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:48.230
But not hearing back means we
don't preserve that content.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.690
So that content is lost

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.880
and potentially creates skewed
collections or just confusing.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.770
You know, "Why wasn't that site
archived and instead of that site?"

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.040
Getting access to researchers has
been sort of a painful process

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.530
for all of our web archives.

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.230
We have-- If you're familiar
with the Internet Archive

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.710
and how they collect
and show websites

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.010
through the Wayback Machine.

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.610
Is everybody generally
familiar with that?

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.030
Hopefully.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.860
So, websites are crawled over time,
so multiple captures over time

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.800
and then you have to use a viewer
to click around the website

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.170
and view the dates of capture.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.710
We have that sort of simple access.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.900
Other types of access too for
researchers, including cataloging

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.260
of the records, has not happened
for this particular collection.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.190
We don't have bulk data sets
that are available for download

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.910 position:56%
for researchers which is the way
that a lot of people are interacting

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.840
with web archives these days.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.330
Other challenges are
around crawling the sites

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.670
and I'll show some examples.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.450
But these are-- Some of
these are very large sites

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.950
where content is not
really deleted very often

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:00.350
so it just builds up and builds up.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.260 position:56%
Crawling them has been a lot more
complicated than we had anticipated.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.320
They're-- We had been used to
crawling relatively small sites

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.270 position:56%
that were pretty easy to collect and
these have created other challenges.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:20.370
So-- And some of those
challenges have been resolved

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.680 position:56%
by some new techniques for crawling.

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:26.820
We are doing some deeper, longer
crawls of some of these sites

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.990
so we can get more of the deep
buried content that's hard

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.450
if you're just going back
once a week or once a month.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.960
We're also crawling RSS
feeds if we can find them.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.630
So that's-- We're doing that twice
a day for some of these sites

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:44.240
so we're able to get
frequent changes

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.690
to the site that's being published
out in an RSS feed in addition

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:49.180
to the deep quarterly crawls.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.390 position:56%
So that's helped us improve results.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.110
We've been a little
bit shortstaffed.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:56.730
We've recently hired a few
more people who were hoping

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.520
to spend some time analyzing
the results of these.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:06.860
So just in examples from the
archive, Emojipedia is one of them.

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.160
Let's see.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.860
Nikki is our expert in why some
of these sites are selected

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:15.260
so I won't go into the reasons why.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.000
But this one decodes the
meanings and definitions

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.410
of the emoji characters,
providing insight

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.780
on the vernacular meaning
of the characters.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.090
So a lot of these sites,
another challenges that you'd--

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.500
Interacting with the live
site is very different

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.800
from the archived site.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.920
Some of these have search functions

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.700
that aren't replicated
in the archive.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.600
So unless there's-- This one
has a nice browse by category

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.660
that will replicate in the archive.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.500
But if you actually wanted to
search the original website,

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:48.410 position:56%
you can't do that the way that we're
currently capturing this content.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.050
So browsing is very important.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.350
Oop, I'm out of time.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:53.280
I didn't get my two-minute warning?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.710
Oh, I missed that.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.010
I'm sorry.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.600
I'll just-- Can I go
one more minute?

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.540
OK. So we have LOLCat Bible.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:01.030
I won't read the descriptions
of these.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.450
I'll just show you some examples.

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.080
MetaFilter is another example

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.740
where it's a very deep heavily
changing site so we're using

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.530 position:56%
that new crawling strategy for that.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.280
Mudcat.org, I believe is in music--

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.670
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Mudcat Café.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:16.970
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: Mudcat Café.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.530
That's another one where we've had
to crawl in multiple different ways

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:21.680
and we're trying to piece
together the results of that

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.020
to see how successful it is.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.410 position:56%
Fark is very difficult because a
lot of it is related outbound links.

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:31.640
So there are-- If you're familiar
with Fark at all, it's a comment--

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.890
a lot of comments about
external links.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:36.880
We are not getting those external
links as a part of the archive

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.000
because of our permissions
policies and other restrictions.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.820
You're the Man Now Dog created
lots of problems in our archive.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.460
Every page on this site
is a separate subdomain.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:53.590 position:56%
So crawling that was terribly
intense and we had to figure out how

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.840
to crawl it in a slightly
different way.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.640
You can also see there's some
formatting problems with some

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.180
of the not-in-archive
content with this one.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.510
And that's it.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.220
Where's my emojis?

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.720
Thanks. OK.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.410
Andy, go. I think you're next.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.710
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Yes.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:15.010
OK. Thanks.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:19.710
OK. Wait for my presentation
to come up.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.060
So, I'll start with
just by saying one

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.840
of things I really kind
of love this quote.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.300
Lynne McNeill, in her TEDx
Talk, actually referred the--

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.870
to the internet as the
world's largest unintentional

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.610
folklore archive.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.950
And I think that's a great quote

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.410
for that especially
the unintentional part.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.590
I don't think when people
put things on the internet,

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.680
they necessarily intend for
those things to be kept forever.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.490
We think of it as a
very volatile media.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.530
For example, right up here
I have my Twitter handle

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.580
and the hashtag Folklore
and FolkloreThursday.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.770
I didn't actually know if we had
a hashtag for this conference.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.070
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: We should.

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:55.370
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: We
should have a hashtag.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:56.670
We could make one up
right now if you like.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.970
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: I'm
looking at Jessie now.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.270
FC40?

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.570
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Yeah, that's--

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.870
actually I was going
to suggest FC40.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.170
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Yeah,
hashtag FC40.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.470
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: So, there you go.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:05.770
So if anybody is live
tweeting, there you go.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.070
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Go with that.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.370
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: So, all
of these things are--

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.230
we don't necessarily think of them
as being necessarily permanent,

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.390
but we are starting to
archive these things

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.270
and maybe that's not what
people's original intensions were.

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.460
I'm one of those people
that studies urban legends.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.230
So I look a lot at those kind
of things and what's happening.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:21.530
And one of the interesting things

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.990
with urban legends is no
matter what, they always--

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.390
everything old is new
again with these.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.730
So, that didn't work out so well.

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:35.960
So, a lot of these legends are very
old and we're now seeing these sort

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.120
of versions of them with
pictures, with the text underneath.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.910
That's easier to share
on Twitter, of course,

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:42.910
where you have only 140 characters.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.950
So, people are creating
these things online.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.100
So, we have on the
left-- sorry on my left.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.610
Yeah, that's your left as well.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.240
We have a fairly classic
urban legend,

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.970
especially with the
children's handprints.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.950
And then we also have
the vanishing hitchhiker,

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.840
but we have an old version of it.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.300
We have one from World War II here,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.260
which of course is
even older than that.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.710
But this one is starting
to make the rounds

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:06.820
when I did a quick Google search on
urban legends which is, you know,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.050
more common than contemporary
legends for a lot of people,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.000
which probably upsets
some folklorists.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.960
I saw that right away we have
this version from World War II

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.800
that I've not heard in years,
but there it is on the left,

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.620
all over the place and it
comes up rather quickly.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.240
So, it's pretty interesting.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.540
This is one of the versions

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.320
where the vanishing
hitchhiker actually tells them

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.880
when the war will end.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.210
And I have not heard that
version in years or my students

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.890
from an oral tradition anywhere.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.800
But here it is on the internet.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.160
So, that's interesting
that that's one of the ones

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.570
that has kind of come up.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:40.080
One thing I do hear a lot about
from my students are Creepypasta.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:44.340
So, for those of you
who have-- oh, sorry.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:48.010
I also forgot to mention the
technology legends are changing

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:49.310
overtime too.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.750
So, those we who grew up with the
whole notions that you are going

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:55.550
to get cancer from your microwave
or from sitting too close

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.200
to the TV, it's now your cellphone.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.360
So, we have a mobile radiation
penetrating your brain.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.950 position:56%
I also don't ever recommend Googling
the terms creepy baby monitor,

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.570
unless you don't ever
want to sleep again.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:13.060
So, this is a very common one
that has come up more recently

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.770
where we have a lot of people
because there was at one point

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.070
where people were hacking

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.330
in the baby monitors
and creeping people out.

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.320
But now, there all these ghost
stories about people seeing things

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.120
like this terrifying picture
on their baby monitors.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.580
So, this is older tech-- this
is new legends about technology,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.690
the newer technology but they're
the same as the old legends

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:32.990
that we've had in the past.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.290
They're just about
something different now.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.640
They're about cellphones
instead of microwaves.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.670
So, it's kind of-- everything
is kind of keep changing.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.100
Now, these Creepypastas, for
those of you who are not aware,

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.040
this is a very widely used website,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.660
especially among people
who write fan fiction.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.120
So we have a whole host of
terrifying characters including one

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.240
of my favorite slender man
up there on the upper right.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.130
I read quite a bit about slender
man and some of you might be aware

00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:01.030
of him because of the slender man
stabbings that happened in 2014.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.780
So, my students are coming
in and they want to know,

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.160
what are the precedents
for slender man?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.460
What are the precedents
for the rake?

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.450
What are the precedents
for these other characters?

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.970
Now, of course in the bottom
corner there, we have the clown,

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:16.320
which those of you who are not
aware, there is an outbreak,

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.660
an epidemic dare we say of clowns
in North Carolina right now,

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.810
of them just showing up and
standing there creepily and a lot

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:24.830
of issues are coming up about this.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.690
It's becoming a safety
issue as well.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:30.710 position:56%
So, this is getting to be pretty
interesting to see how these change.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.540
Now, clowns stories have been
around since at least '81

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:35.620
with people having
creepy clown stories.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.680
So, this is not anything
new by any means.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.840
In some ways, this has
really made our jobs easier.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:44.350
We can sit at home and look
at the stuff in the internet

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.370
in your pajamas and you don't have
to go anywhere or do anything.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.240
Of course, there are some problems
with doing it this way and one

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.590
of the big problems that I
face because I work a lot

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:56.090
with medical information, I
work a lot with the vaccination,

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.470 position:56%
anti-vaccination and pro-vaccination
movements and how people share

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.800
that information online, it's
medical information, right.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.770
So the internet has been wonderful
for people with disabilities,

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.600
especially those who are not
able to easily access places.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.320
They can use the internet, they
can share with online communities,

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.000
especially if they have
a chronic condition.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.820
It's wonderful for those reasons.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.780 position:56%
Wait, I'll get you-- you don't have
to have that staring at you anymore.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:24.770
I started realizing people
kind of kept shifting over.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.420
So, all of this information
that's out there

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.230
in the internet is
wonderful to have,

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:30.680
but we don't necessarily
know all the context.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.310
So, people will share
things on the internet,

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.710
but we don't know why
they're sharing them.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:40.480
Or what they mean to them if they
don't put any of that context down.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.740
So, when we don't get
the full context,

00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:44.190
are we doing proper fieldwork?

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.990
I'd say we're not.

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:48.330
And this is especially true
with medical information,

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:49.630
especially when you start to look

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.250
at how people are sharing
medical information.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.550 position:56%
So, when they're sharing this stuff,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.410
I don't think they
always know exactly

00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:56.880
to what extent they're doing.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.940
So, I thought I'd just
show you very quickly.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:03.040
If I type in Google,
anti-vaccine and Facebook,

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.170
which is something I frequently do,

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.710
the first thing I get is the
vactruth.com Facebook page,

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.130
which I clicked on.

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:11.730
This is it.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.090
I decided, well, let's just see,
just for fun, what if I click

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.250
on to see who liked
the first article.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:20.990 position:56%
These are all the names of the
people who liked that first article.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.370
I've blocked them out
so you can't see them.

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:26.700
So then I can just click
on the first person.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.850
There's her name, there's
a picture of her child,

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.720
there is a picture of her dog.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.180
There is a-- her picture,
there is all of her friends.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.050
I can send her a message.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.630
Her school and career.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.040
She's a nurse by the way.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.480
Very interesting from my research
as someone who's interested

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.040 position:56%
in the anti-vaccination movement
and there's also her husband's name.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.980
Scrolling-- That's on just the
beginning part to that page.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.000
Wonderful information, wonderful
context, can I ethically use it?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.280
I say no. I'd-- even though
it is public information,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.050 position:56%
she has publicly posted all of these
things, I don't feel it's ethical

00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.030
for me personally to use this.

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:02.870
Scrolling down slightly, I
also know her child's name,

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.790
I know her dog's name.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.090
I know everything about that.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.020
I could probably figure out her
passwords if I really wanted

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.670
to based on that information.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.740
Since people tend to use
children's name, dog's names,

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.270
those kind of things as passwords.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:19.820
This I don't think is ethical at
all in a lot of different ways but,

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:21.810
you know, how do we
figure these things out.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:26.620
How do we decide what we use in
our research and what we don't use.

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:29.260
That gets very, very
complicated and what we can use

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.500
and what's ethical for us to use.

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.490
Especially in the case of we
are talking about vaccinations.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.090
So, this is her child's
health information.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:43.990 position:56%
Not hers. And what happens in 20
years when her child goes to school,

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.440
goes to university, and they
find out they're unvaccinated

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.830
because they looked
at his mom's website.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:52.200
So now, we're talking
about medical information.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.610
So, I just wanted to kind of end
with saying that, you know, privacy

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.840
and consent is very important
in all these situations.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.710
Just because we can't find it,
maybe we shouldn't find it.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.480
But the internet really provides
us with some great opportunities

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.460
to find this information online
and gives us access for people

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.270
who don't normally have access.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.700
But we have to think about how
we do this ethically and morally.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.810
What is our role of folklorists?

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.100
What are-- How do we
define that for ourselves?

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.440
It's conversations we need to have

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.120
and I think this is a
great place to have them.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.920
Thank you.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.230
[ Applause ]

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.530
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: I
don't have any slides.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:25.830
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: OK.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.130
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: I
don't have slides but--

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.430
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: OK.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.010
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: Alright, so I'll--
since in the interest of time,

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:35.390 position:56%
I'll talk briefly about a project, a
specific project I'm involved with.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:37.720
And why we did it and
some concerns we have

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.190
as we're getting the work done.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.040
So, I'm one of the
principal investigators

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.240
on a project called
Documenting the Now

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.290
and we're building a
social media archiving tool

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.270
that were calling DocNow.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.770
This is a partnership
project with Washington,

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.450
University of Saint Louis and
also the Maryland Institute

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.260
for Technology and the Humanities.

00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:05.760
My other two PIs are at summers,
who is the lead software developer

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.840
at MITH in Maryland and Chris
Freeland at Washington University.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:17.310
This work started a couple of
years ago with Ed Summers and I.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:22.130
This project was really inspired
by the events following the killing

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:27.980
of Michael Brown in Ferguson
Missouri in August 2014.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.970
And, you know, the millions of
images that we saw being shared

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:36.200
on Twitter and other social
media spaces, millions of videos,

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:43.000
personal stories about that
event and what it led to.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.010
So we saw these millions
of expressions of--

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.700
sort of publicly accessible
expressions of grief, of anger,

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:55.520
of criticism, of support and, you
know, Ferguson is what really led

00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:01.070
to what we now know as-- what
gave life to what we know

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.220
as the Black Lives Matter
movement right now, right,

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.220
which is a movement that sort
of bring us more attention

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:10.220
to mass incarceration,
police violence

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.430
in poor communities,
among other things.

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:15.760
And so, you know, we
were at the Young Society

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.590
of American Archivist
conference during the week

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.220
that Michael Brown was killed
and it was basically a bunch

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.430 position:56%
of archivists sort of sitting around
watching these events sort of fall

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.580
in social media and thinking about
ways that we could help, you know,

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.990
our peers collect this
information, build documentation,

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.980
builds collections around this type

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.030
of very rich content
that was being shared.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:42.080
And so, we decided to start
doing several projects

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.510
around collecting different
hashtags, around killings

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.920
that were happening that
happened over the past two years,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.250
we had Walter Scott, we had
the Charleston shooting,

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.440
we had Sandra Bland.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.140
All of these different types of
events had their own life online

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.760
and they were really sort of
playing out on social media,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.200
which is the first place
that people will go to find

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.500
out about what was happening.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.780
And we had people really
close to the ground,

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.530
really close to the event,
really close to the people

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:13.160
or family members, getting online
and telling their stories in sort

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.920
of these unmediated ways, right.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:19.050 position:56%
So, we wanted to think about ways to
get archivists and researchers sort

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:23.470
of plugged into that
content and think about ways

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:26.700
to do that easily for them.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:31.370
So, DocNow is basically
a project to build tools

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:36.550
that archivists could use to easily
and easily is really important here

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.910
because there are a lot of tools
available right now to do this work

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:46.510
that don't-- that require sort of
this high level of technical skill

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.400
to really get into and really
use sort of capture the data

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.890
and make any sense of it.

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:54.750
So, what we're doing is we're
building something that folks,

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.510
you know, without any technical
skills, could just sort of tap into

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:00.520
and start making some sense out of
this sort of vast amount of data,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.910
right, millions of
tweets in some cases.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:08.180
So, building tools to capture
that data, to export metadata,

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:14.530
to export visual content like
videos and live streams and images.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.770
And we're also building
tools for researchers.

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.770
Researchers are our second
main audience for this project

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.090
and we're interested
in building tools

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:27.120 position:56%
that can help researchers make sense
out of this vast amount of data

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.560
and also to share that data back
and forth because there are a lot

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.010
of restrictions from
the platforms themselves

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:35.720
about how you can share the
data with other people, right,

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.870
that they create because sort

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:43.610 position:56%
of data reselling is also a business
model for a lot of these platforms.

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:48.700
We do have some concerns as
we've been doing this project.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.610
We're a very transparent project.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.390
We do a lot of our sort
of development very open.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.100
We have a Slack channel
with almost 200 people in it

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.640
that anyone here can join and
sort of jump in the conversation

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.170
around social media archiving,
social media research.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.600
We have our Twitter account
where we share information

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.900
and have back and forths.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.200
We have a blog.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.310
So we really believe in sort of
being transparent about this type

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:16.970
of work and I think we're really
one of the first projects to do

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:19.310
that type of development,
software development

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.280 position:56%
around this particular issue in this
way and it's been really beneficial

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.540
to us because we're getting all
this feedback from so many people

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.660
and we actually take this
feedback and put it back

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:29.960
into the work that we're doing.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.760
And a lot of the concerns that
are consistently being brought

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.760
up are around ethics, right.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:40.440
And why or how we should
be doing this type of work.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.680
And so, one of the main concerns is
around ownership of content, right.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:48.950 position:56%
Who actually owns the content that's
being shared via social media.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.490
So, Twitter for example says
that you own your content

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.370
but because you're using their
platform, you're giving them sort

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.630
of this exclusive right to
reuse your content, right.

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:00.110
They say that you own it.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.390
They have rules around how
other people can use it.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:04.690
And so, you know, one

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:07.090
of the questions we have is
how should archivists sort

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:09.190
of operate in this space, right.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:13.620
How do you seek consent for
example or should you seek consent

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:17.590
if you're building an archive of
tweets where you're using a hashtag

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:18.890
or where you're using a keyword

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.140
and you're not necessarily
focused on a particular person.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.800 position:56%
So, how do you navigate those
really murky waters around ownership

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.800
of content-- two minutes, OK.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.750
And consent, right?

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:38.520
As far as consent goes, you know,
most content creators don't know

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:43.870
that we're building these archives
of social media data, right.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:47.260
And so, you know, when
you post something online,

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.510
you may post it in one context.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:55.130
An archive may take it and keep it
in our repository for 15, 20 years

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.430
and someone else may
reuse that content

00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.160
in a completely different context.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.970
So do we owe it to content
creators o really respect sort

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.540
of the original intent of their
material that they posted online.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:10.020
So this is just some of the issues
that we're trying to grapple with

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.640
and thinking about ways to sort of
build functionality within the tool

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.140
that may be able to address
some of those issues.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.420
There's also the issue
of surveillance, right.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:25.080
So law enforcement at every
level in the US is using tools

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.180
to monitor social media activity.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.910
This happens at the local
police level, the FBI, the CIA.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:36.480
I mean, the CIA has a funding
arm, In-Q-Tel that, you know,

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.520
one of the things they
invest in is companies

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.250
that do social media
mining specifically.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:46.800
And so, how do we build
collections that don't sort

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.500
of support this kind
of activity, right.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:56.080
So, let's just say, you
know, companies like In-Q-Tel

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.130
or funding arms like
In-Q-Tel don't exist,

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:02.790
the companies they fund don't exist
and, you know, the CIA is like,

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.000 position:56%
well, Library of Congress has all
the tweets that were ever collected,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.830
let's tap into that, right?

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.520
So how do we sort of think
about how to protect people

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:16.500
that are represented in those data
sets from this type of activity?

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.640
And a more general concern I have
is really the lack of diversity

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.150
in the web archiving
in social media space.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.690
I mean, it's-- frankly
it's a very wide space,

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:27.990
the people who build tools

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:30.340
around social media
archiving, web archiving.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.500
And we have to think about what
that means for the type of content

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.670
that will be saved for the future.

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:37.980
All right.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.780
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Great thank you.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.500
[ Applause ]

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.380
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: OK.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.680
Hi I'm Montana Miller.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.020
Can you all hear me OK?

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:54.220
So it seems like there's an
interesting mix here of archivists

00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.340
and researchers and archivists,

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.970
who work with researchers
and vice versa.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:02.980
I'm a folklorist and a
researcher, but I've also--

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.560
since the beginning of my academic
career, I've been very interested

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:09.560
in IRB issues, which is human
subject research protections.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.500
And since I began working at
Bowling Green State University,

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:16.650
I've also been serving on
the HSRB or the IRB there.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.290
And I've also had the opportunity
to be involved in PRIM&amp;R

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:25.740
which is the national organization
that teaches all of the members how

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.050 position:56%
to review proposals and especially
in the role of kind of bringing them

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:34.090
into the internet age and
kind of educating them

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:38.870
about the specific dilemmas and
boundaries and issues that come

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:40.470
up with internet research.

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:43.410
So I wanted to kind of
outline some of those issues

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.950
and read you a small passage from
my chapter in Trevor Blank's book.

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.270
This is "Folk Culture
in the Digital Age".

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.210 position:56%
I wrote the last chapter to this
book, which is about doing fieldwork

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.400
on Facebook as a folklorist and
the issues that come up with that.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.110
This came out in 2012.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:02.210 position:56%
So it's not completely outdated yet.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:06.090
That's the problem with publishing
on anything internet related,

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:08.930
of course, it's immediately
outdated.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:14.830
So I consider a major rule for me,
one of my purposes as folklorist is

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:18.670
to kind of bridge that gap
between IRB members and folklorists

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:19.970
because there's a lot

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.000
of misunderstanding
and fear on both sides.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.670
And it's also complicated

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:28.730
because not every folklore
program is bothered by IRBs,

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.920
like when I went to UCLA that
IRB didn't want anything to do

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:33.220
with the folklore department.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.320
We didn't have to worry about it.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:40.690
However, at many universities
now, folklorists are part

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:43.890
of the larger social science
contingent that does have

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.900
to go through IRB review.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:51.230
So the idea that now we are kind of
mining and harvesting huge amounts

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:54.760
of folklore material that's
available to us on the web,

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.670
it's so tempting and yet, it
does present a lot of issues

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:01.760
which I think every other panelist
has very sensitively addressed.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:05.160
And so I just want to
go over some of them.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:08.490
The whole concept of
privacy has changed so much

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:10.400
and is continuing to change.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.470
And I think that maybe some of
you have heard of Dana Boyd.

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.120
She's a well-known researcher,
who studies teenagers

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:20.410
and their attitudes for privacy
and their social media behaviors.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:24.300
She talks about how
teenagers don't worry anymore

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:29.820
about whether what they're posting
is private or not because they kind

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.350
of know that privacy
doesn't even exist anymore.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:35.130
It's not really even
possible to have privacy.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.070
Anything that you post
could be seen by anyone.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:42.270
So instead of worrying about the
content and keeping that private,

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:46.870
she has found that instead they
have developed coded systems

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:48.170
of communicating.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.920
So that, yeah, anyone might
be able to see what I posted,

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.870
but they won't know what it means.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:56.240
So an example of that that she
writes about is subtweeting.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.650
Has anybody heard of subtweeting?

00:48:58.650 --> 00:48:59.950
A couple of people.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:07.310 position:56%
OK. So I'll just go to the Urban
Dictionary definition of a subtweet.

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:09.010
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: We're
archiving that too.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.310
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller:
The top definition

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:14.040
of a subtweet is a tweet-- you
all know what a tweet is, right?

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.530
A message posted on Twitter,
that mentions a Twitter member

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:21.170
without using their actual
username, usually employed

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:23.530
for negative or insulting tweets.

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.730
The person you are mentioning
won't see the subtweet

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:30.240
in their Twitter timeline as
it doesn't contain the @ symbol

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.680
that every Twitter username has.

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:37.270
But even more than that, maybe
you've heard the term vaguebooking.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.780
It's when somebody post a
status update like, "Oh,

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.440
I just can't believe
that asshole did that."

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.740
And that's all they write.

00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:46.140
And, you know, you want

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:48.800
to know desperately what they're
talking about, but if you are not

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.550
in the inside of circle,
you're not going to know.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:54.610
And how much use would
that kind of material be

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.310
to a folklorist who's gathering
material, there's no context

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.260
as you we're talking about.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.620
So in a way, the protection for
the new generation that knows

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:09.340
that privacy no longer exist is
to use subtweets and vaguebooking

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.010
and to make the context
so indecipherable

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.420 position:56%
that it's really useless information
to anyone that they don't want

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.710
to understand what
they're communicating.

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:26.700
OK. So coded communication we could
call that, including subtweets.

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:30.800
Of course, what is public space
and what is private space is

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.770
so much a matter of
perception these days.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.900
And one thing that I really cover
in my chapter in "Folk Culture

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.220
in the Digital Age" is that
before you even do your fieldwork

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.210
and especially before you present
your proposal to the IRB and try

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.580
to get them to pass it, you have
to really know your population

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.810
and know what their perceptions
of private and public are.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.420 position:56%
Often, the IRB is concerned that
you might be invading these people's

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:58.770
privacy but in fact, you know
that they completely are aware

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.810
that people could be
looking at their stuff.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.060
And they're OK with it.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.670
So you need to be able to show
that and to know it yourself.

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:10.300
So I always advocate to all of
my students and other researchers

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.230
in folklore that before
you just dive

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.870
into our project, spend
some time there.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:19.250
Get to know the patterns and
get to recognize the clues

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:23.610
that people certainly give
out as to whether they realize

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.670
that their stuff is being watched.

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:28.750
For example, I observed a
chat room for several years

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:32.770 position:56%
and which was regularly mentioned
that there were probably journalists

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.560
and researchers observing
the whole thing.

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.840
Well, if that's regularly
mentioned in that community,

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.260
you can't really be a member
of that community for very long

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:45.700
without getting the message that,
you know, journalists go there

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:49.210
to get ideas for stories and
researchers are probably writing,

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:51.470
you know, on newspapers on this.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.310
And everybody who was
sort of an integral member

00:51:55.310 --> 00:52:00.300
of the site seem to know that.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:08.530 position:56%
Passivity and consent, you mentioned
this Abbie, if you didn't hear back

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.420
with permission to crawl then
you weren't able to crawl.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.610
I wasn't familiar with the
term crawl but that's great.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:18.310
It's got that same imagery as
like harvesting and we just need

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:21.270
to be really careful about that.

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.490
So the perception of private and
public, generally we've relied on,

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:27.900
you know, what does a
reasonable person expect?

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:33.280
Does a reasonable person reasonably
expect to be able to behave

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:37.030 position:56%
without being recorded and regarded?

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:40.110
These distinctions are
definitely changing,

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:43.620
especially in when we consider
these big data environments.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:47.420
And I encourage you to look ay
Michael Zimmer who writes lot

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.610
about these issues, especially when
it comes to big data like OKCupid

00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:53.720
and study they come out
with Twitter, Facebook.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.530
I've worked with him at PRIM&amp;R
and served on many panels with him

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.520
and he's not a folklorist,
but he is very savvy

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.080
about these computer issues.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:10.130
So that is Michael Zimmer, knowing
your field before the harvest,

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.440
I've mentioned that before,
getting to know your population

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.740
and what their perceptions are.

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:19.250 position:56%
This interesting dilemma of
whether something is oral expression

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:22.860
or textual archive
because IRB is considered

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.500
as something that's
already published.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.320
You have to write to use it.

00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:30.550 position:56%
However, something that is emerging
constantly like Twitter or Facebook,

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:32.830
where people are actually
spouting it

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:35.880
out as though it's
an oral phenomenon

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.970
and then instantly becomes
archived published material,

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:41.300
what do we consider that?

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.510
IRBs are extremely
confused about that issue.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.650
And if I may just read
this passage will get to,

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:51.100
this idea about shoulder
to shoulder.

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:56.180
So, "When researchers first
began flocking to the internet

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.270
to observe chat room
discussions, blogs, and the like,

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.690
it was somewhat easier to
distinguish between public

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:03.650
and private spaces online.

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:07.760 position:56%
Debates sprang up about communities
where public access seemed ambiguous

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.320
such as LISTSERV and topics
that were especially sensitive

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.160
such as vulnerable or
stigmatized groups.

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:17.250
But it was easier to determine what
a subject's reasonable expectation

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:21.130
of privacy would be and then weigh
the risks of using that data,

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.460
the risks to the individual
and the risks

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.210
to the community being studied.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:28.220
Folklorists must now
consider the risks

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:32.150
and ethically navigate the new
internet terrain for our fieldwork

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.130
because there are so much important
cultural behavior occurring

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:37.290
in the space.

00:54:37.290 --> 00:54:38.890
Jumping through the
bureaucratic groups

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:42.250
of Institutional Review Boards is
certainly infuriating as it seems

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.670
like there are folklorists all over
Facebook and other social networks,

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.060
and discussion boards
throwing questions out there

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.430
and reaping abundant harvests.

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:54.280
At this writing, increasing numbers
of us are Facebook users ourselves,

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.030
sharing our research and our
lives as academics and humans.

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:01.480
More than ever before,
both online and offline

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.800
with the boundaries dissolving
all around us, we stand shoulder

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.700
to shoulder with the
folk whose traditions

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:09.890
and meanings we explore
and interpret."

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:13.330 position:56%
So that phrase "shoulder to shoulder
with the folk" it's something

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:15.940
that I heard folklorist
John McDowell say

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.590
in his 2008 Archer
Taylor Memorial lecture

00:55:18.590 --> 00:55:21.150
at the Western States
Folklorist Society Meeting.

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:24.480
And I've always thought that was a
great encapsulation of our ethics

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:28.070
as folklorists, is that we don't
hold ourselves above our subjects.

00:55:28.070 --> 00:55:30.620
But we are right in there
with them advocating

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.760
for them authentically representing
them and we need to find a way

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.900
to apply that to the
internet world as well.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.700
Thank you.

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:44.800
[ Applause ]

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:46.100
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Right.

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.400
There is a lot there.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.740
Thank you all so much.

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:52.790
We can open the floor
to some questions.

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:54.200
Surely there are some.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.970
I don't know who has the--
you can get the mic, OK.

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.370
&gt;&gt; Test, OK.

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:16.290
Hi. I really appreciate the
different mentions of ethics

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:17.890
and fieldwork by the panelists.

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:20.500
And I wondered if anyone
want to talk a little more

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:25.090
about the aspects of-- for
example we do web archiving here

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.390
at the Library of Congress,

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:30.490
the aspect of embedding
your own personal

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:35.630
or the institutional
orientation towards those issues

00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:38.330
into the data that
has been collected.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:41.540
Because one thing I've noticed with
the way we do web archives here is

00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:45.850 position:56%
that all those decisions are made
outside of the web archive and not--

00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:47.870
excuse me, directly included,

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:52.130
not meaning to criticize the
library overly, but in general,

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:57.720
I think one of the great
benefits that folklore brings

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:02.360
to scholarship is its
attention to these details.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.120
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Who
wants to take that?

00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.070
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: Well, I
mean, I have something to say.

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:16.110
I don't know if it'll
answer your question.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:20.870
Couple of weeks ago, so we have
a pretty stellar advisory board

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:23.020 position:56%
for our Documenting the Now project.

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.800
We have scholars, archivists,
librarians, journalists,

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.430
I think about 22 people
on the advisory board.

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:34.660 position:56%
And so we had our first meeting in
Saint Louis, which was live streamed

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:37.680
and actually, the recording should
be up either today or tomorrow.

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.470
But we had six different
panels on the day.

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:44.680
But, you know, to me, the most
impactful panel was a panel

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:48.040
of activists from Ferguson,
right, who were--

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.140
who joined us to sort of tell us
about their experience, you know,

00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:56.410
being in those early protests,
you know, minutes after--

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:59.840
hours after Michael
Brown was killed.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:03.980
And I think one of the most
important things, you know,

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:09.550
they said was they each-- the
chair of the panel asked each

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:12.830
of them what they were doing
right before, you know,

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:16.220 position:56%
they sort of became activated,
right, before they became activists.

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:19.360
And their stories were
so totally different.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.600
I mean, a couple of them were
working at fast food places.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:27.030
One young activist talked about,
you know, how she had planned

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:31.180
to commit suicide either
that day or just, you know,

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.720
in the hours right before she--

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.480
you know, someone texted her to say
that, you know, sent her a picture

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.120
or she saw it on Twitter,
the picture of Michael Brown

00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:42.300
in the street and, you
know, to this day, she says,

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:44.580
Michael Brown saved her life.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:48.240 position:56%
But, you know, they told us some
really powerful stories and I think,

00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:53.020
you know, as people thinking about
documenting this type of content,

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:56.020
collecting this type of
content, I think interaction

00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:58.600
with content creators and
content owners, right,

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.930 position:56%
these are the people sort of, you
know, putting these things out there

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:06.850
that we want to take
really to tell stories

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:10.550
in the future I think
interaction with those folks,

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:13.940
I think respecting their
views about how they want

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:16.940
to be remembered is
really important.

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:22.580
And, you know, we've done this-- we
sort of built protocols around this

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.920
for other types of materials
that we've collected and we've--

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.500
we have these rules and these
policies for a lot of sort

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.050
of the physical materials
that we collect.

00:59:31.050 --> 00:59:34.160
But we've seem to sort of-- you
know, we're throwing all these

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.910
out the window in a lot ways
when it comes to web archives

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:41.050
or social media archives
because I think the vast net--

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:44.240 position:56%
vastness of it all sort of really
pushes a lot of people away to say--

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:47.250
a way to say well, you know,
there's so much stuff here

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.820
for us to get too personal.

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.120
And I think that's wrong.

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:54.440
There are ways that we could sort
of dig in and get to know some

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:58.220
of the people building the content,
creating the content around,

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.190
some of the subjects
you want to capture.

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:03.350 position:56%
So, I think that's really important.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:07.180
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: I think--
sorry, if you don't mind.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:08.480
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Go ahead.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.120
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: I think one of
the ways, at least on Twitter

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.740
and other media we were
allowed to hashtag things,

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.100
as much as we make fun of
hashtags, they're a great way

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:21.310
for the people involved to not only
kind of give consent in some way

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:24.050
to saying that I want this to
be a part of the discussion.

01:00:24.050 --> 01:00:27.340
But there are also a way to find
that information because those kind

01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:30.440
of do become or more
organic from the people

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.890
who decide what the hashtag.

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.130
I mean, we just sat here
and decided our own hashtag.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:36.090
And that's what happens
when people start talking

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.770
about these things online,
they make the hashtag.

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.820
And then when they choose to
use that, that kind of gives us,

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:44.770
you know, I don't want
to say permission,

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:47.290
but they know that they're part
of a conversation then at least.

01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:48.590
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Right.

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:50.350
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: So, yeah.

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.330
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Great.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.010
OK.

01:00:54.010 --> 01:00:56.960
&gt;&gt; You've partly addressed
my question there.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.840
But what I'm curious
about is for the people

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:05.280
who are doing research online
and among groups that are aware

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.470
that researchers are--
maybe they are--

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:14.510
do you see any formal request
from researchers for permission

01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:19.070
or announcements that
I'm doing research.

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:21.990
Or does this all have to--

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:26.230
what is the mechanism
for securing permission?

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:29.690
Is it going to individuals
whose words and image as you'd

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:32.110
like to-- eventually like to use?

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:33.480
Or do you approach the group?

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.280
It sort of like the collective.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:40.820
Where is the agency of
the collective located?

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.120
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: Well, yeah.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.070
In our web archives, it's the
person-- it's the site owner.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:50.330
So, we-- there's no way we could
possibly notify all the people

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:51.930
that are contributing
to those sites.

01:01:51.930 --> 01:01:56.040
So, they have to act on behalf
of their community basically.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:00.300
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: And you can
post an informed consent documents

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.600
somewhere on the site.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.680
But there's no way to guarantee
everyone is going to see it.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.980
So--

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.280
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: Yeah.

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:10.580
Yeah, I mean it's really difficult.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:12.750
So, we're thinking about the
sort of technical ways to deal

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:15.440
with this with the DocNow project.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.820
And also more sort of socially
responsible ways, right.

01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:22.720
So, one of the technical things
we're talking about is, OK so,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.110
let's say you're collecting
a hashtag.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.940
Generally when people are using
a hashtag to communicate online,

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.760
they're generally sort of
watching it happen as well, right.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.410
They're watching the
conversations so they can respond.

01:02:35.410 --> 01:02:39.270
What if as part of the tool,
you could automatically send

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:43.520
out information that actually
uses the hashtag twice

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.210
or three times per hour, right.

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:48.390
Saying this hashtag
is being archived.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:51.210
Here is a link about the project.

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.930
It's being archived
by this university.

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:55.550
So, the idea is you're sort of
putting information out there.

01:02:55.550 --> 01:02:58.080
And, you know, as part of
that, you know, that message,

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.780
it could also be an
opt out message, right.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.680
This hashtag is being archived.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.250
Click on this if you
don't want to be included

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:08.280
in the collection, right.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.870
Now, how this will all work?

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:14.420
I'll leave that to Ed and people

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.080
like Dan should now
have to figure out.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.610
But that's one of the
things we're talking about.

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:22.490
The other thing we're talking
about is really, you know,

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:25.520
thinking about how do we
communicate our values, right.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:30.070
So, we're thinking about this idea

01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:33.880
of social media data
labels for example.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.930
So, after you build a
collection of social media data,

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:41.630
can we come up with some labels
that sort of specify a few actions

01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:43.800
that you should take while
you're using this data

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.810
or how you should treat this data?

01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:49.900
So, for example, you can have a
data label that says, you know,

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:53.910
that this collection will only be
around for one month from this day

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.060
to that day and it will
be destroyed after that

01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:01.370
or this collection has a
lot of images of minors

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:06.140
so you can only use it on
site and it can't be shared.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:12.590
So, how do we sort of communicate
our values about what we want

01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:13.890
to the tool to be used for?

01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:15.320
How we want the tool to be used?

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:18.030 position:56%
And how we want the data to be used?

01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:23.230
Sort of in the absence of all
the sort of technical ways

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:26.080 position:56%
that we could address that, can we--

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.830
the least we could do is kind of
sort of communicate our values

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:31.110
to people about how we think
the data should be used.

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:33.190
So, there are lots of
ways to think about it.

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:35.790
But it's really complicated.

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:37.290
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller:
If the key concepts

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.780
of human subject protections
involve confidentiality, consent,

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:46.940
and protecting from harm, we can't
always inform consent everybody,

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:50.550
we can't always keep
everything confidential.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:53.300
However, there are often things
that we can do to mitigate the harm

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.730
by taking out some of
the identifiable data.

01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:02.750
By once you have collected the
stuff just protecting those

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:08.500 position:56%
who have posted it from having it be
specifically identifiable to them.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.280
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Other questions?

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.550
Joe?

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:24.850
&gt;&gt; Joe: Maybe for all of you but
Bergis perhaps especially for you,

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:28.220
of course, archiving social
media is still pretty new

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:32.310
and moving forward in a new way.

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:38.360
I'm wondering though if there are
any instances yet of behaviors

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:42.030
that have been influenced by the
knowledge of archiving activities.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:45.550
In other words, you know,
do people who participate

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:50.510 position:56%
on Twitter suddenly develop a
filter in any way once they're aware

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:53.760
of the fact that, you know, there
may be research activity involved

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.070
with what they're doing
that's going to be kept

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:58.600
in perpetuity in some way?

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.460
Do you have any examples
of anything like that

01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:07.290 position:56%
where it's affected the spontaneity,
the quality of what's happening?

01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.590
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: Yeah.

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.740 position:56%
So, a couple of years ago when we
started this project, I was thinking

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:17.190
about just doing something
really local at UCR.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:21.840
And I asked one of our
professors, Nalo Hopkinson,

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.920
who is a science fiction-- really
well-known science fiction writer.

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.260
You know, if-- you know, we
had a meeting about this.

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:31.130
And we chat and I was like,
OK, so, I want to build,

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:33.550
I want to collect all your
tweets and I want to put it

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:35.800
in our archive and all this.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.370
And the first thing
she said was, "Well,

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:41.410
if I knew you were collecting them,
I would tweet in a different way."

01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:46.670
And so, yeah, I think, you
know, knowing that, you know,

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:53.120 position:56%
your stuff will be sort of preserved
for a very long time in a space

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:57.250
and other people may be able
to use it to do their work,

01:06:57.250 --> 01:07:01.690
I think that definitely, you know,
will change people's actions as far

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:03.500
as how they interact
with the platform.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.160
And that's-- I think, that's where
we also have to be careful too

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.710
as people building these
tools because, you know,

01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:11.940
I don't think Twitter of
Facebook or Instagram or any

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:15.150
of these places want, you know,

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:18.300
whether it's social media archiving
tools or whatever to be built.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.120
They don't want any of
these sort outside things

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.870
to influence how their users
use the platform, right.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:26.470
So, we have to also be really
careful about, for example,

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:30.190
if we're going to send out these
sort of messages using the hashtag

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:32.830
that Twitter will latch on to
that and say, "Hey, you know,

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:35.440
these people are really
messing with our thing here."

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.610
And so, I think that's
a big concern.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:40.550
It's about how people will
change their interactions.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.810
But we see now that people are--

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:47.410
you know, as these platforms
become really well-established,

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:50.170
Twitter has been around for
10 years, people are thinking

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:52.610
about how they use
the platform anyway.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:55.670
So, we're seeing a lot of
tweets being deleted, right.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:59.760 position:56%
I mean, so you can collect a hashtag
today and then a week later sort

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.890
of run a test on it to see how many
of the tweets have been deleted

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:07.370 position:56%
and you see that number goes up the
longer the data set has been around.

01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:11.760
So, people are already changing
their actions on the platforms even

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.490
without knowing that
they're being monitored.

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:17.760
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: Yeah, we have--
it wasn't from this archive,

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.350
but years ago we had--
we sent out an email

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:25.030 position:56%
and sometimes the site owners
publish that email to their website.

01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:26.330
And say, "Oh, the Library

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:28.020
of Congress is collecting,
isn't that great?"

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:32.900 position:56%
And we did have one-- I think it was
a blog where we had a ton of posts

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:35.100
where people were saying
hello to their grandchildren.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.010
And, you know, waving to
the future kind of thing.

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:41.410
But we haven't seen,
you know, major changes.

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:44.690
I think they forgot about it.

01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:45.990
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Yeah.

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:47.350
We-- I saw that a lot of
times with online communities,

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:50.070
you'll see an entire online
community fell apart as soon

01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:51.810
as they realize that
there's a lurker.

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:53.710
Or there's somebody that
maybe isn't really a part

01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:55.150
of that community that
starts commenting.

01:08:55.150 --> 01:08:57.120
This happens a lot on
anti-vaccination websites.

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.100
If they find a debunker
comes in and starts posting,

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.600
there's a very violent
reaction to that person.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.250
But sometimes reaction is that the
whole community just falls apart

01:09:06.250 --> 01:09:10.710
and they go some place else or
they just-- they disband entirely.

01:09:10.710 --> 01:09:13.990
So, it really makes-- you know,
things can really change as soon

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:16.370
as somebody finds out that
somebody else is listening in.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:17.670
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller:
I've also observed

01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:19.900
that sometimes they
change just temporarily

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.120
and then they go right
back to normal.

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:23.420
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Yeah.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.230
Some of them do.

01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:27.840
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: Did anybody see
that news story about the woman--

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:31.800
the model that posted a picture
of a naked old lady at LA fitness?

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.100
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: Yeah.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.400
That was terrible.

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.700
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: What I think
it's so interesting about most

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.280
of the coverage of that is that
it's been excoriating this model

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.660
for body shaming, the woman
with very little discussion

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.720
about the complete
breach of privacy,

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.550
the really illegal
breach of privacy.

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:48.390 position:56%
But it's all about the body shaming.

01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:53.300
So, I just think it goes to
show how thoughtless people are

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:54.880
about privacy right now.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:57.570
Instead it's about other issues.

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:00.160
People kind of given up on privacy.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.170
I also wanted to suggest a more
sexy hashtag for this conference.

01:10:04.170 --> 01:10:05.470
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: OK.

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:08.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: Since we're at
the Library of Congress and because,

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:12.020
you know, Hamilton is really
big in-- all over the place.

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.510
How about something like not
your founding fathers internet?

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:19.040
[ Laughter ]

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:21.120
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: That's good.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.040
&gt;&gt; One thing I've often had
to deal with over many years

01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.800
of doing researches
embargoed material,

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.320
is there a way to embargo
information?

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.410
&gt;&gt; Abbie Grotke: We
embargo one year.

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:35.270 position:56%
We've actually embargoed a lot
longer because of other reasons just

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:37.170
to take us a long time
to get things online.

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:40.950
But we're collecting about 15
to 20 terabytes a month now.

01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:42.250
So-- in all of our collection.

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:44.740
So it's just a lot
of data to deal with.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:48.770 position:56%
But yeah, the lawyers have suggested
a one-year embargo, which we follow.

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:51.830
So, we only have-- you
can actually get to some

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:55.010 position:56%
of these sites through our way back.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:57.200
Talk to me after if you want.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.970
I'll give you tips
on how to do that.

01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:02.310
But you can only get
through about a year ago.

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:05.570
So, we're collecting currently
but that's not available.

01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:07.870
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: OK.

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:15.410
&gt;&gt; Hi. Good morning.

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.190
There's very-- a lot of really
interesting perspectives.

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:22.140
I guess I'd like to ask since
there's an interesting combination

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:26.770
of people on the stage, kind
of from folklore and archives,

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:30.510 position:56%
which speak but not always together.

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:34.880
And I'm wondering, two
of you are participating

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.450
in IRB activities at
your institutions.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:38.750
That's another relationship

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:41.780
that I think has often been a
little bit fraught with folklorists

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.300
in particular, and speaking
as an ethnomusicologist,

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.980
I know that it's also
been a relationship

01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.280
that people aren't
always comfortable

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.730
with because practices are
developed somewhat outside

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:53.800
of our disciplinary practices.

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:57.930
So, I'm wondering sort of what
perspectives you're bringing

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:03.080
to the IRB and of what your
experiences there have been?

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.830 position:56%
And I guess, some of the things
that I'm hearing the archivists say,

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:09.560
I'm sorry, this is sort of
a two-part question here.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.890
But so I'm kind of wondering
what folklore brings to IRB.

01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:18.390
And for the archivists, I guess I'm
thinking here more of people coming

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:19.750
from information science.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:22.480
But, you know, in online
culture people are talking

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:25.050
about participatory
surveillance and things like that.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:26.350
Something is changing.

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:30.630
All of you have said something
is changing about privacy too.

01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:36.690
And I wonder if we're
seeing something different

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.070
with digital culture here.

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:41.550
And so, I guess I'd like to
hear your perspectives on that.

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:45.870
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: IRBs tend
to be populated by older

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:51.300
out of touch people that do
not spend a lot of time online.

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:55.560 position:56%
IRBs really need people to join
them and bring them into the future.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.900
More folklorists need
to get on IRBs.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:03.640
I have done a lot of work
trying to educate IRB members

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:06.820
around the country on
qualitative research.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:09.300
Just getting the means
to things like the idea

01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:13.320
that you can't always give the
IRB your exact list of questions

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.080
because there's going
to be followup questions

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.820
that you don't know what
they're going to be yet.

01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:21.050
That interviews in folklore are
never completely structured.

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:22.980
They're always somewhat
semistructured

01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.050
and informal to some extent.

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:32.810
The more folklorists get in there
and become a part of that board,

01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:34.890
the better they can make life

01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:37.840
for other qualitative
researchers at their institutions.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.810
IRBs are so different
at every university.

01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:46.750
My university has a wonderful IRB
with lots of qualitative people

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:49.840
on it and very flexible
open minded people.

01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.000
That's not the case
at every university.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.690
And it's really not fair because
the folklorist has a great project

01:13:55.690 --> 01:13:57.430
that would be highly encouraged

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.450
at Bowling Green State
University might run into a wall

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:04.530 position:56%
at another place just because the
IRB is stuck in a different mindset.

01:14:04.530 --> 01:14:08.360
So, that's why it's so important
for more of us to not be so afraid

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.320
of the IRB but, you know,
you can't beat them,

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.350
so join them and change them.

01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:14.600
And with the digital
culture, in the same way,

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.380
bring them into the present

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.050
because many IRB members have no
interest in learning about it.

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:23.460
Let alone, making their right
decisions about researchers

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.900
who are doing their research there.

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:27.200
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Yeah.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.090
I've had similar experiences
where I--

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:32.130
I'm not going to say anything
bad about our IRB board

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:36.560
but things have gotten
caught up for very silly to--

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.220
at least to a folklorist reasons.

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.680
Ours tend to be highly
medical and as someone

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.910
who does medical research,
I get tagged a lot

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:47.130
for not knowing exactly how
many participants I'll have,

01:14:47.130 --> 01:14:48.430
which is something I can't know

01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:50.260
until I start actually
doing the research.

01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.750
But they-- I've gotten held up
for months at a time, you know,

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:58.010
and had issues based on things
that are very minor compared

01:14:58.010 --> 01:15:01.480
to the major, you know,
ethical issues I'm seeing,

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.360
they're more worried about,
you know, number of people,

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.880
number of questions,
those kinds of things.

01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.180
So, it is very true.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:12.410 position:56%
A lot of these boards either tend
towards, you know, looking at people

01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:13.710
who maybe are a little
more out of touch,

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:16.500
with what current researches is
kind of happening or they tend

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.000
to be highly medical
and are looking more at,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.640
you know, are you drawing blood.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.890
Are you-- and I don't quite
understand, you know--

01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:27.330
in some cases too, I've had people
say, oh we are just asking people

01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:29.200
for stories that can't
possibly harm anybody.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.500
And I'm like, well, no, it could.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:31.800
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: It could, yeah.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.100
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: Yeah,
absolutely could.

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.830
So it is-- it's very-- very
much depends like especially

01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:38.280
on the organization,
the institution.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.620
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: But
something encouraging is

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.130
that if there's a board
that hardly has anyone on it

01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:44.720
that gets these issues and
then you'd get somebody

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.230
from the Folklore Department
or you yourself get on the IRB,

01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:52.130
like what happens to me is that
our compliance officer directs most

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:58.620
of those protocols to me, so I have
a real chance to help, you know,

01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:00.590
qualitative researchers
and to be the one

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:02.710
that actually does
get what they're doing

01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:06.790
and to make the path
easier for them.

01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:08.090
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: So, you know,

01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:09.620
I think the surveillance
thing is going

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:12.330
to become real challenge
for archives.

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:17.130
People have been doing
traditional archiving pretty soon.

01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:23.190 position:56%
So, when Ed Summers and I were
collecting social media on Ferguson,

01:16:23.190 --> 01:16:27.110
and he posted about his, I think
it was almost 14 million tweets

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:29.530
that he had collected on Ferguson.

01:16:29.530 --> 01:16:33.230
He wrote a blog post about
it and posted it online.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:37.050 position:56%
You know, one of the first people to
reach out to Ed was a security firm,

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:40.540
right, who had also been collecting
on Ferguson, but they had missed

01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.380
that window that we
had the data for.

01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.830
So they wanted Ed to share
that data with them, right.

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:51.430
And so, people are out
there watching, right.

01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:57.070
Law enforcement is watching
and we know that, you know,

01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:59.740
when these tools, that law
enforcement bill gets put

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.320
into place, they disproportionately
target poor people

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.620
and people of color.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:05.920
That's just what happens.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.370 position:56%
I think no matter what the sort of
reasoning is, what's about terrorism

01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:14.460 position:56%
or whatever, whatever is sort of the
justification is at first to sort

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:19.260
of justify the use of the stuff,
it always ends up being sort

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:20.560
of marginalized groups

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.470
or disproportionately affected
by these types of tools.

01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:26.740
And so, I think, you know,
archivists, you know,

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:29.980
we've been sort of
operating and, you know,

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:31.750 position:56%
in the sort of closed spaces, right,

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:34.030
with paper records
for a very long time.

01:17:34.030 --> 01:17:36.040
We sort of own that space.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:40.260
We sort of decide what happens
in that space, who gets access.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.400
But as we move into this
sort of digital space

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.410 position:56%
where really we're dealing with
data, right, and we call it archives

01:17:46.410 --> 01:17:49.160
and all this stuff, but we're
dealing with data and metadata

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.790
and other people can
tap into that, right?

01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:54.320
We no longer have control
of these types

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.980
of archives that we're building.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:17:58.600
So I think we really need to think

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.280 position:56%
about as we're building these
collections of data, how we're going

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:06.080
to protect people that represented
in there and we're not even close

01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.380
to thinking about that yet.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.770
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: All right.

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:13.720
We have a couple minutes
and then we will break.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.650
Does anyone have a
final question or two?

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:26.510
&gt;&gt; This has been a great panel.

01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:31.030
I'm wondering how each of
you can anticipate the future

01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:32.710
of technological development.

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:35.510
We talked a little bit about
Twitter and Facebook but, you know,

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:39.110
we don't know what's around the
corner in terms of social media.

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:42.090
Is that something that you're
able to tackle or think

01:18:42.090 --> 01:18:46.900
about in your current work?

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:48.930
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: This reminds
me the-- this past weekend,

01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:50.230
I was doing an interview.

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:53.410
I'm working on a book right now
where I'm doing interviews with--

01:18:53.410 --> 01:18:56.740
that are long in depth in-person
interviews and I don't record them

01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.330
because I don't have
time to transcribe.

01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:01.600
So I just write it all down
as we go because I type fast.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.620 position:56%
So I told my interviewee that I
wasn't recording and he said, well--

01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:09.640
he immediately pointed out to
me, in the room we were in,

01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:13.170
all the different things that might
have recording devices in them

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:16.080
and he said, just because you're
not recording doesn't mean

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.890
like somebody-- if they'd
wanted to couldn't be tapping

01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:22.180
into the microphone on my phone,
on your phone, on that computer,

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.770
on that computer and
there and there.

01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:27.740
And I'd-- I said well,
why would they want to

01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.560
and he said, "Well, you never know.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.390
Maybe not today but, you
know, in a few years,

01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.460 position:56%
we could have a government that does
one and like watch everything we do

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.400
and they could be collecting
all of it."

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.560
And I just kind of went,
whoa, like I didn't even want

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.160
to imagine a world like that.

01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:46.350
I can't worry about that.

01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:50.590
But some people are very highly
attuned to the possibility

01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:56.340
that we are moving into a
world where we're completely

01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:01.060
under surveillance for
nefarious purposes all the time.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.170
&gt;&gt; Bergis Jules: I think
there's a question.

01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:15.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I had a question about how
different online spaces like Twitter

01:20:15.630 --> 01:20:20.630
or like Reddit affect privacy
concern, like, so for example,

01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:23.590
Twitter feels very much like
a public forum, I think,

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:28.040
similar to Reddit that you have
these threads in which you--

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.690 position:56%
you're not immediately identifiable.

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:33.860
You have a username and you can
post within that conversation.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:36.330
I'm wondering if within
those spaces,

01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:41.150
some of the privacy concerns
you have around being able

01:20:41.150 --> 01:20:45.780
to identify people, or people's
own posts and their thoughts

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:52.430
as to what is private and what
isn't, how do you sort of negotiate

01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:56.010
that given the different
online spaces?

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.000
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: It depends on
the sensitivity of the material

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.190
and also how hard people are
trying to conceal their identities

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.200
because some Twitter
handles you can't figure it

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.950
out who it is quite
easily and others you can.

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:10.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kitta: I think a lot of
people, especially who are more used

01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:15.080
to social media too either divide
their lives up into sections.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:18.070
So they have an official
Twitter or official whatever.

01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:19.900
And then they have their
sort of private line

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.220
where they have name
changes, they have, you know,

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:24.760
more privacy protection on it.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.620
So I think people are
dividing their lives

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.750
up into little segments
in different ways.

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.630
And that's kind of interesting too.

01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:35.520
That we've had started to know
that we have a public persona even

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.570
if we're not a public person.

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:40.430
You don't necessarily need to
be a politician or a professor

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:43.110
or anything like that to have a
sort of public persona anymore.

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:45.270
Everyone needs one now.

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:47.180
&gt;&gt; Montana Miller: There's a great
new book called "Modern Love"

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:50.570
by Aziz Ansari, who worked with
sociologists and psychologist

01:21:50.570 --> 01:21:55.050
to collect information about
how people date and use texting

01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:57.740
and the internet in
romantic life now,

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:00.810
and one of the methods they used
was they created a sub-Reddit,

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:05.500
where they invited people to
give a huge amount of material

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.830
from their online dating lives,

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:12.360
and I thought that because not
only a great informative book

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:17.290
but really innovative in its use of
social media platform like Reddit

01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:20.260
to collect data in a
very voluntary way.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:26.070
And people always are much more
willing to give us information

01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:28.150
than we fear that they will be.

01:22:28.150 --> 01:22:31.550
So we don't always have to worry
about like harvesting and spying

01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:35.290
on them when there's so much that
people are willing to give forth.

01:22:35.290 --> 01:22:38.410
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: OK,
final thoughts.

01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:40.510
All right, thank you very much.

01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:43.500
[ Applause ]

01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:47.970
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Welcome back.

01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:50.260
My name is Steve Winick.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.570
I'm the editor here at the
American Folklife Center

01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:54.170
at the Library of Congress.

01:22:54.170 --> 01:22:57.760
And I'm here to welcome you back
to introduce the next panel,

01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.140
which is going to be about the
American Folklife Center field

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.230
projects, which is something
that we're really excited about.

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:09.130
These are projects that went on
from the 1970s through the 1990s,

01:23:09.130 --> 01:23:12.620
in which staff from the
American Folklife Center along

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.320
with other fieldworkers went
out and documented a wide range

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.540
of communities across the country.

01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:22.490
And we came back with a huge
archive of documentation,

01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:25.830
which is now being
digitized and placed online.

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:28.020
And that's what the part
that we're the most excited

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:32.050
about right now is getting this
stuff out there for people to see.

01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:35.650
So, the first person that I'm going
to introduce and then after her,

01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:38.700
the rest of the panel
will come up is Ann Hoog.

01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:42.430
Ann is a member of the
American Folklife Center staff.

01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:44.870
And I'm very happy to say
that I'm the first person

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:48.490
who has the privilege of
introducing her as our coordinator

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.830
of processing, which is a job to
which she has recently promoted.

01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:55.250
So we're all very happy to
have Ann in this position

01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:58.610
where she'll be having a
great impact on the way all

01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:00.940
of our materials are
processed from now on.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:05.390
But she's also been working very
diligently on these field projects

01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:07.830
and making sure that
they're getting up online.

01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:10.260
And so, Ann is going to come up
and talk about the background

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:12.390
of these projects and
what she's been doing.

01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:15.510
So please welcome Ann Hoog.

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:19.500
[ Applause ]

01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.480
&gt;&gt; Ann Hoog: Good morning.

01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:28.180
Some of this presentation will be
showing a sampling of the photos

01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:30.050
from various field projects

01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:33.530
and a few slides just have some
descriptive material showing an

01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:36.950
overview of what the field projects
are, and why they're a topic

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:38.480
of the panel at this symposium.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.390
With the American Folklife Center
celebrating its 40th Anniversary

01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:43.690
this year, it is appropriate

01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:46.740
that we have a panel celebrating
this field project surveys.

01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:48.490
These projects came
to define the work

01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:50.730
of the American Folklife
Center in its early days.

01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:53.290
And now the opportunity to
digitize these materials

01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:56.750
and put them online makes them
more widely available and promises

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:59.300
to continue this work in a new way.

01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:04.560
This is one picture
being tomato season.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.910
I thought appropriate to show the
ripening tomatoes in the windows,

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:09.600
so the Lowell Folklife
Project picture.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.400
So this is a timeline of the
field projects and the order

01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:19.750 position:56%
of when they first started in 1977,
shortly after the center was founded

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:23.950
up to about 1999, when the last
of these field projects concluded.

01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:26.230
These projects moved
around from place to place

01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:28.340
and each had its own
focus and approach

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:32.490 position:56%
from documenting ethnic arts or
industrial heritage in a single city

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:35.280
to exploring the complex
cultural relationships of land

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.760
and people across regions.

01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:44.480
There are differences
between these projects.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:46.420
Most of them share
certain characteristics

01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:49.830
that help define nature
of the field projects.

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:53.360
They all used teams of fieldworkers
working together in the community,

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:58.530
usually 3 to 10 or so depending
on the scope of the project.

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:01.510
They all had an emphasis on
professional documentation,

01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:05.330
creating high quality sound
recordings and photography along

01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:08.690
with detailed logs and field notes.

01:26:08.690 --> 01:26:12.690
Attention was paid to a broad
span of expressive culture,

01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:16.780 position:56%
including the full range of everyday
life, not just music and crafts,

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:20.690
but celebrations, food ways,
games, vernacular architecture,

01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:24.850
occupations, environmental
issues and more.

01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:28.080
Most of the projects included
some level of cooperation

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.330
with other local, state
or federal agencies

01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:34.030
such as the National Park Service,
or state and local arts councils.

01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:37.890
And these projects all resulted
in the creation of a large body

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:42.060 position:56%
of ethnographic archival collections
as a product of the fieldwork.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:48.060
What is in this large body of
ethnographic archival materials?

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.770
The field projects have materials
arranged into similar categories.

01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:55.300
Many of them arranged by
administrative documentation

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.270
and publications and ephemera.

01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:59.980
The administrative category
includes information about how

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.290
and why these projects came to be,
who was involved with the planning,

01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:07.120
contracts with the fieldworkers
and release forms, et cetera.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.900
The documentation category for
each project are the materials

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:12.470
that were created by the
fieldworkers and photographers.

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:16.200
In total, all field
projects added together,

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.400
the formats included approximately
140,000 black and white negatives,

01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:25.540
95,000 color slides and negatives,
3,500 hours of audio recordings,

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:28.470
45,000 pages of photo
and audio logs,

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:32.230
6,000 pages of written reports.

01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:37.950
These are just estimates,
totalling nearly 300,000 items.

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:41.540 position:56%
The third category, publications and
ephemera, includes primarily maps,

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.960
brochures and local
publications gathered in the areas

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.520
where field work was
being conducted.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.740
It's the second category,
the documentation category

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:52.090
that includes the items that
had been recently digitized.

01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:55.980
So use those formats listed again

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:59.890
with a total digital
memory needed, 21 terabytes.

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:05.930
And if you're keeping score at
home, that's 21 million megabytes.

01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:08.910
Digitization is now complete with
these collections and so now we're

01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:12.680
in the process of preparing
items for online presentation.

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.190
One project has gone up
in its entirety already

01:28:15.190 --> 01:28:18.280
of the documentation category,
the Chicago Ethnic Arts Project

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.610
and soon the Montana Folklife
Cultural Survey will be going up,

01:28:21.610 --> 01:28:22.910
it's in test right now.

01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:25.360
We're hoping to have it by
now, but it's almost there.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:29.280
We're getting there.

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.440
[Inaudible] to start with
the series of pictures

01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.540
to help define visually the
nature of field projects.

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:38.640
I mentioned the teams of
fieldworkers with these projects.

01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.320
Often fieldworkers work in
tandem, with fieldworkers,

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:45.290
photographers and recorders.

01:28:45.290 --> 01:28:48.660
This is Carl Fleischhauer with
the cameras taking a photo

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:53.420
of Etta Anderson of Ocilla,
Georgia, taken August 20, 1977.

01:28:53.420 --> 01:28:54.810
And looking at the cameras he had

01:28:54.810 --> 01:28:56.540
which would have been
somewhat typical

01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:00.850
of the field project photographer,
likely one camera had 35 mm black

01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:04.590
and white film, one had
35 mm color slide film

01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:08.410
and perhaps another had 120 film
either black and white or color.

01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:11.290
Now usually the fieldworker
and photographer were matched

01:29:11.290 --> 01:29:14.600
up together while on the community
and often both the fieldworker

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.640
and photographer had cameras.

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.540
This picture was taken by the
late folklorist, Beverly Robinson.

01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:23.840
And here's the picture
that Carl was taking.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.550 position:56%
And you can see off to the left,
there's a bag, sort of in the corner

01:29:29.550 --> 01:29:32.140
of that picture, that's actually
Beverly Robinson standing there

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.600
taking that picture of Carl.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.160
You can also note in this picture,
there's a microphone attached

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.510 position:56%
to Mrs. Anderson's collar indicating
there is an accompanying sound

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:45.490
recording that goes with
these photos as well.

01:29:45.490 --> 01:29:47.780
And so one thing that makes
these photos so representative

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.570 position:56%
of the field projects is in addition

01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:51.900
to documenting a community's
traditions,

01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:54.970
what is also captured is the
documentation process itself.

01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:57.870
The documenter becoming
the documentee.

01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:59.610
So frequently, you have
teams of fieldworkers

01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:01.670
and photographers documenting
each other.

01:30:01.670 --> 01:30:05.270 position:56%
Photos of photos being taken, photos
of sound recording being made,

01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:07.460
and though inadvertent to
times, sound recordings

01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:10.810 position:56%
of the photos being taken as you can
frequently hear the shutter going

01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:12.110
off in the background.

01:30:12.110 --> 01:30:14.620
That's capturing the
moment of documentation.

01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:17.890 position:56%
The lens not focus on the
informant, so in field only but also

01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:22.730 position:56%
on the fieldworkers and the part
they played in the creation process.

01:30:22.730 --> 01:30:24.430
One important job that
the photographer had

01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:26.750
to do was also typing up notes.

01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:29.050
And this is very hard to see but
I just wanted to put one piece

01:30:29.050 --> 01:30:31.030
of paper up there, it's a
sample of the materials that are

01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:34.000
in the collections
and being digitized.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.870
And there is-- this is a log of--

01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:37.900
this is a log that
Beverly Robinson typed

01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:41.700
up of what she was taking
pictures of in picture 6-6A there,

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:44.630
so it's Carl Fleischhauer
taking picture.

01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:52.940
Sadly peach season is
almost over in this region.

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.770
But I love this photo
taken by Lyntha Eiler.

01:30:55.770 --> 01:30:57.760
It's representative of
the many wonderful food

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.950
and food ways photos
in these collections.

01:30:59.950 --> 01:31:04.320
So I sorted through these thousands
of scans of field project photos,

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.790
something struck me about them.

01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:10.400
They don't just capture
the objects of the food,

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:14.790
and of the vernacular architecture,

01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:19.340
but also the transmission
of knowledge.

01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:25.180
And what defines these
projects as much as the objects

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:27.370
in the transmission of knowledge
among the communities is the

01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:29.850
relationships, and
transmission of knowledge

01:31:29.850 --> 01:31:33.130
between the fieldworkers
and the communities.

01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:38.230 position:56%
There really isn't any way to
conduct good fieldwork and to create

01:31:38.230 --> 01:31:41.790 position:56%
such rich documentary materials
without a good trusting relationship

01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:44.070
with those you're working
with in the communities.

01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:48.560
And so here's with these
collections show the commitment

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.170
to doing it right and how
close these two worlds were

01:31:51.170 --> 01:31:55.670 position:56%
to each other during these projects,
to sharing and enjoying a story

01:31:55.670 --> 01:32:01.340
on the front porch, to
playing fiddle tune together

01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:03.660
on the front porch.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:12.380
A deep interest in care and how
things are made, and the source

01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:15.160
of knowledge and tradition
represented in each tool

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:20.510
that was used, in this case,
the Planters peanut can.

01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:27.770
Sometimes you have to climb
high on a government car

01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:31.580
to capture the cultural landscape.

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.320
And sometimes you have
to crawl into the weeds

01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:37.820
to find the more hidden things.

01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:41.680
And a part of each of
these fieldworker's notes,

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:45.290 position:56%
here we are taking notes in the
field with a piece of paper you have

01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:50.080
in the field and then returning at
night to the office of apartment

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:53.790
or hotel wherever the fieldworkers
are staying and typing it up.

01:32:53.790 --> 01:32:57.750
And this is the creation of the
log and fieldwork in action,

01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:00.250
like you're creating the
logs and field notes that are

01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:02.040
in the collection itself.

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:07.520
So these are the materials that
make up the field [inaudible],

01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:10.490
what is in them and a bit
about how they were created.

01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:12.350
And as the discipline
of folklife is,

01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:14.920
what we have here is not
just the documentation

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:18.290
of the cultural things, but
the process of the creation,

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:21.610
plus the process of the
creation of the documentation.

01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:24.580
Here on this panel are some of
the creators of these materials.

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:28.090 position:56%
So this ends my part of the talk and
I'll turn it over to Betsy Peterson,

01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:29.630
who's going to introduce the panel

01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:32.660
and begin our discussion
in more detail.

01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:34.690
And by the way, there'll
be a slide show going

01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:37.260
on during the panel that's
illustrating some of the photos

01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:41.510
that some of these photographers
and fieldworkers took.

01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:45.500
[ Applause ]

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:51.520
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Thank you, Ann.

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.230
I'm actually going to make very
brief remarks because I do want

01:33:56.230 --> 01:34:00.530
to turn the discussion over
to the people on the panel.

01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:04.200
I was in graduate schools,
just starting graduate school

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.440
when these projects were going on.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.660
And to me, at that time, I
knew-- certainly knew of them,

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:16.410
certainly knew of their impact
and always kind of looked at them

01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:19.510
and the people who
worked on them in awe.

01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:25.860
Over the years, I think these
field surveys have sort of receded

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:30.050
from people's minds,
memories, et cetera.

01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:34.110
And I'd realized a new generation
that is coming up is really not

01:34:34.110 --> 01:34:38.520
that aware of a lot of
these projects and so part

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.270
of what the digitization is all
about is to really bring these back

01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:50.460
to the-- really resurface them
and begin to look at the work.

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:54.660
And also, we hope range
of publications will come

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:57.250
out of it over the coming years.

01:34:57.250 --> 01:35:03.390
It is a gargantuan task as we're
realizing in and not an easy one,

01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:06.450
and it's certainly
going to take more time

01:35:06.450 --> 01:35:08.420
than we thought it
was going to take.

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:13.090 position:56%
But couple of things that I loved
about these projects that we'll talk

01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:19.440 position:56%
about more in detail in just a
second is the teamwork and the teams

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:22.790
that were assembled for
all of these projects.

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:25.880
They included photographers,

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:30.100
and photography I think becomes
a really significant part

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:32.430
of this project and
certainly in terms

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:35.510
of what is left behind
for us to work with.

01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:37.250
It's really critical.

01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:40.710
These projects also hired
professional photographers,

01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:45.040
which wasn't necessarily
that common at that time.

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.190
And also the-- just the
issue of client or sponsor,

01:35:50.190 --> 01:35:53.990
a lot of these projects were
the result of collaboration

01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:56.890
between multiple federal agencies,

01:35:56.890 --> 01:36:00.430
usually federal agencies
or state government.

01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:04.810
But I wanted-- we want to
explore those issues as well,

01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:07.850
what those partnerships were
like and how they came together.

01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:12.790
So with that said, I'll
just bring up our panelists

01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:18.830 position:56%
and we are having Carl Fleischhauer,
who as I mentioned earlier,

01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:24.170
was the first employee
hired by Alan Jabbour

01:36:24.170 --> 01:36:26.050
at the American Folklife Center.

01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:29.200
And he was very instrumental
with Alan

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.630
in shaping what these
field surveys became.

01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:37.140
We have Terry Eiler and Lyntha
Eiler, two of the photographers

01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:41.020
that worked on a handful
of these field surveys

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:43.250
and developed close
relationships with some

01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.010
of the folklorists
and I think have--

01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:46.310
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:47.820
OK. Yeah. Please come up.

01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:54.380
Mary Hufford, a former staff member
with the American Folklife Center

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:59.160
and now in Virginia,
at Virginia Tech, yes.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.590
And David Taylor, also former
American Folklife Center staff,

01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:11.330 position:56%
but current library employee working
in library services administration.

01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:14.760
And we will just get started now.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.680
What I wanted to do is ask
Carl, since Carl was the there

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.280
at the beginning, to
just talk a little bit

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.050
about what the thinking was,

01:37:23.050 --> 01:37:26.570
how did these come about,
why did they come about.

01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:30.230
And then we'll move on from there.

01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:31.530
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: OK.

01:37:31.530 --> 01:37:32.830
Thank you, Betsy.

01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:38.900
And I start by a big gesture on
Alan Jabbour's direction in a wave,

01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:43.470 position:56%
and to some degree, I'll be
channeling I think what he taught me

01:37:43.470 --> 01:37:45.610
and his thoughts at
this early moment.

01:37:45.610 --> 01:37:48.410
And so, a tip of the hat,
and if I get it wrong,

01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:51.350
you can pipe up in a little bit.

01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:54.800
When the center was
launched in 1976,

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.240
Alan more than anyone
was really aware

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.620
of the past presidents
here at the library.

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.500
They've been mentioned already a
little bit, many years for example

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:08.710
on which John and Alan Lomax
did field, collecting themselves

01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:10.880
and that was marked
among other things

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:13.530
by a sort of a surveyness to it.

01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:18.180
They went all around the country
and sent people around the country

01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:20.750
and they were really keen
on using modern equipment,

01:38:20.750 --> 01:38:24.850
which in that day was a
instantaneous disc recorder.

01:38:24.850 --> 01:38:28.290
Alan himself, when he was the head
of the archive, which happened

01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:33.670
in the 1960s and run into the
early 1970s, did a certain amount

01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:35.940
of fieldwork himself
and that was a period

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.330
in which the two of
us got acquainted.

01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:42.300 position:56%
We found ourselves visiting a family
named Hammonds in West Virginia

01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.590
and worked on a documentary
project over there.

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:47.840
And I think to some degree,

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:51.000
the way in which we
collaborated suggested things

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.860
about team fieldwork.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:55.340
I was an employee of
West Virginia University

01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:57.560
in Morgantown at the time.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:39:00.900
We had a little micro
team, you might say.

01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:03.040
We did a little bit of
everything, each of us,

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:06.160
but Alan tilted towards
musicology to be sure

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.070
and I tilted towards
photography and family history.

01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:14.220 position:56%
When the center got started and here
I really am channeling what I think

01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:18.380
I learned from Alan, is there
were several important roles

01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:20.980
that the field projects
played at the folklife center.

01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:24.600
For the library, it was a signal

01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:28.420
that we were still building
collections that like Lomax,

01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:31.570
this was about doing things that
would bring collections back

01:39:31.570 --> 01:39:35.810 position:56%
and you've just heard the statistics
about how significant that was.

01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:40.070
In the field of folklore
and folklife studies,

01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:42.050
we were exploring methodology.

01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:45.340
I think as Lomax had
with the disc recorders.

01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:48.820
We dragged those bulky [inaudible]
around and you got a glimpse of one

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:52.010
in the picture of Beverly
Robinson in Georgia.

01:39:52.010 --> 01:40:00.140
And the one real failure which Mary
Hufford and I have wrung our hands

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:03.200
about was, it was a day before GPS.

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.850
We drove ourselves crazy trying
to map phenomena in New Jersey,

01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:09.990
but that technology
wasn't ready yet.

01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:14.070
Today, that would be an
easy thing to map phenomena.

01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:18.160
And it's worth saying that this
methodological development still

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.470
continues at the Folklife
Center in its current work.

01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:27.970
I really admire what John Bishop,
who's here and Guha Shankar doing

01:40:27.970 --> 01:40:32.550 position:56%
with this oral history project,
which is using the very latest kinds

01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:38.830
of approaches for video recording
and also builds the collections.

01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:42.080
For students in university
programs at that time,

01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:44.940
and I guess that was Betsy,

01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:49.130
these field projects offered
some paying gigs for a few months

01:40:49.130 --> 01:40:53.550
and also let folklore
graduates students

01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:58.310
or recent graduates have
exposure to what we were up to

01:40:58.310 --> 01:41:00.670
and help us develop
some of the methods

01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:03.120
and approaches that we were using.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:06.860
And for the center, one of
the roles was to establish

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.360
and nurture relationships
with agencies.

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.990
Ann mentioned a little
bit the park service.

01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:16.190
We had several connections
to the park service,

01:41:16.190 --> 01:41:20.440
but there were also connections
to the Smithsonian and directly

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.720 position:56%
and indirectly to the arts endowment

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.660
through the state folk arts
coordinators and other programs.

01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:29.650
So all of that sort of
was the rationale I think

01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:31.810
in the history there.

01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:37.570
As has been remarked, the
team dynamics are important.

01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:42.350
And we have plenty up here to help
testify to that in a little bit.

01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:47.010
The one element was there
were academic specialists

01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:49.020
who were part of the team.

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:51.230
They tended to have
certain specialties

01:41:51.230 --> 01:41:53.280
that were tailored to the project.

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.790 position:56%
Chicago was about ethnic groups, the
Blue Ridge included, for example,

01:41:57.790 --> 01:42:01.140
someone who is really good
with quilts and fabrics.

01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:06.600
There were occupational topics
that David oversaw and Paterson

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:12.680
and Lowell where you get into
both ethnicity and occupational.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:17.290
And in Nevada, we found ourselves
as we did in many places deeply

01:42:17.290 --> 01:42:19.810
into vernacular architecture.

01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:23.310
Rusty Marshall was the director
for a couple of those projects

01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:25.470
and he's a real specialist in that.

01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:28.630
We also have the Smithsonian
specialists in saddles.

01:42:28.630 --> 01:42:32.940
The second element which
Tery and Lyntha represent

01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:37.080
where the media specialists,
specially still photography.

01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:40.620
There were team members like
Tom Rankin, who's also here

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:45.550
and Blanton Owen, who alas has
passed away, who were very good

01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:50.740
at wearing both hats, academic
specialist as well as photographer.

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:56.230 position:56%
But the photographers to some degree
help broaden the coverage I think

01:42:56.230 --> 01:43:03.710
by being more than the folklorist
sometimes focused on everyday life.

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:07.910
And in addition to which, they
would contribute by taking scenes

01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:11.800
that showed people doing X
whereas in a separate interview,

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.230
the folklorist would talk to
the person about how they did X

01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:18.720
and you sort of have the
documentation of doing as well

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.540
as the discussion of
doing that comes in.

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:33.240
There's also the general visual
context I guess I would say,

01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:38.060
you know, the cultural landscape
perhaps for lack of a better word,

01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:42.390
the photographers tended to have
a natural gravitation towards

01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:43.690
and so on.

01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:47.400
And so, it builds a context
in the documentation of place,

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:50.730
and a sense of place, and you saw
that, and you're seeing it now

01:43:50.730 --> 01:43:53.110
with some of these scenes.

01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:58.800
The team dynamic involved kind

01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:04.280
of cross training I guess is what I
would say where each of these folks

01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:09.580 position:56%
with their own specialties tended to
teach the others in back and forth.

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:13.260
The folklorists often
took photographs as well.

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:17.120
You saw the picture of
Beverly Robinson took of me.

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.660
So, you know, sort of work back and
forth that way where it's possible

01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:25.310
that I help Beverly with
the photography more likely

01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:28.250
that she helped me understand
African-American culture

01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:30.370
in that context.

01:44:30.370 --> 01:44:34.770
And there was also things like the
judgment of relative importance.

01:44:34.770 --> 01:44:38.410
In Chicago, what was sort of
interesting, Elena Bradunas,

01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:42.470
who is Lithuanian American
really helped us focus

01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:46.350
on these little wooden
shrines that were being made

01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:48.710
by people in that community.

01:44:48.710 --> 01:44:53.470
And so, that directed the
photographer, also Lithuanian,

01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:56.890
to move in that direction.

01:44:57.990 --> 01:45:02.220
It's worth saying as you've seen
that there was extensive use

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:05.440
of still photography
and fairly limited video

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.740
on motion picture film.

01:45:06.740 --> 01:45:09.230
That didn't even turn
up in Ann's tally.

01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:12.900
But in fact, there were some video
and some motion picture film.

01:45:12.900 --> 01:45:16.300
And I think our feeling at the time
was that it made a lot more sense

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:19.680
in a survey project to cover
things with still photographs,

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:22.270
which then could be
selectively used.

01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:25.490
I have come to wonder today
in a YouTube environment

01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:29.280
where little short
clips have a place.

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.430
Little short clips then
didn't have a place exactly.

01:45:32.430 --> 01:45:36.190
And so, today we might do more,

01:45:36.190 --> 01:45:41.630
but then it was still photographs
I think that made that work.

01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:45.470
And Ann has already touched on
the aspect of building the archive

01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:49.230
and the field with the picture
of Dave Stanley or whoever it was

01:45:49.230 --> 01:45:53.080
at the typewriter and
when we started,

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.340
there were not portable computers.

01:45:55.340 --> 01:45:59.740
So typewriters were what we
had by the time Mary and I got

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.570
to trying to work in New Jersey.

01:46:01.570 --> 01:46:09.030 position:56%
We drag out cape rose for the first
time and used five inch floppy disc.

01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:12.190
That was the first.

01:46:12.190 --> 01:46:16.540
We're saying that the contract
with all of the workers required

01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:19.200
that their output be
dedicated to the public.

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.790 position:56%
The idea was to thrust this material

01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:25.850
into the public domain just the way
the farm security administration

01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:30.490
photos is government work for hire
got thrust into the public domain.

01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:36.460 position:56%
That goes against a little bit what
is taught in photo schools and Terry

01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:40.950
and Lyntha are both, you know,
prominent in the photo school

01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:45.020
at Ohio University, where
protection of your right is sort

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:48.330
of an important feature
for most photographers.

01:46:48.330 --> 01:46:52.010
And we deviated from
that and I hope,

01:46:52.010 --> 01:46:55.630
it's worked out well
to people satisfaction.

01:46:55.630 --> 01:46:58.190
Finally, there was
a social dimension.

01:46:58.190 --> 01:47:01.090
We had shared living
quarters for the most part,

01:47:01.090 --> 01:47:04.120
even though some people came
and went serially and it meant

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:06.710
that you have like
a college dormitory.

01:47:06.710 --> 01:47:10.000
A lot of exchange over breakfast,
you're sitting in the lounge

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.810
or coffee at the mid
afternoon or whatever.

01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:18.530
And that was a rich form
of social communication,

01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:21.310
a social dimension there.

01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:27.430
So I guess I'll shut up and
turn to Terry, Lyntha, and Mary

01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:33.980
and the team dynamic and
how those things went.

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:36.870
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Well, it was an
interesting sleeping arrangement,

01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:38.670
definitely.

01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:43.990
[ Laughter ]

01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:48.140
The team dynamics is very
important I thought to us

01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:52.400
from the first project, Blue
Ridge Project that we worked on

01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.550
and that we found ourselves
visual narrative specials.

01:47:56.550 --> 01:48:02.890
Lyntha and I, yeah, and we knew how
to tell a story about the people

01:48:02.890 --> 01:48:05.330
and the situations,
the object, the event,

01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:11.610
but we had not gained
the kind of acute focus

01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:17.320
and the specialists were
suddenly bringing to us saying,

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.440 position:56%
you've got to pay attention to this.

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:26.290
And it really helped us to broaden
our coverage, but understand

01:48:26.290 --> 01:48:32.930
where the narrative would develop
so that there was a dynamic.

01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:36.230
I want to talk about the
contract though, that's fun.

01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:37.610
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler:
Well, I think the first

01:48:37.610 --> 01:48:39.300
for the Blue Ridge was interesting

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:43.850
because we had a four-month-old
child when we started the project.

01:48:43.850 --> 01:48:48.920
And so, the contract address that,
that we would have child care.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:57.030
And so, we went to Galax,
Virginia and found child care.

01:48:57.030 --> 01:48:59.500
Unbeknownst to us that
the woman that ended

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:02.160
up doing the child
care had a grandson

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:06.740
who was a big time
professional regional wrestler.

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.480
So our son went to a
lot of wrestling events.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:12.820
It was before a little tiny heads,

01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:15.830
so it may have damaged
his hearing somehow.

01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:18.350
But it was interesting.

01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:20.720
It was a wonderful group.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:24.500
They were all, you know-- we
had child care during the day.

01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:26.980
On the weekends, we had
a four-month-old baby.

01:49:26.980 --> 01:49:29.460
And this was a two-month project.

01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:31.500
But the baby was wonderful.

01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:35.990
We would go to a church
service and come

01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:39.830
in with this four-month-old
baby who doesn't discriminate,

01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:43.370
who is holding them and the
child would be passed around

01:49:43.370 --> 01:49:49.550
and we got a lot of goodwill and
cooperation following that baby--

01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:50.850
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Well, access.

01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:53.330
It was like having an
access card in diapers.

01:49:53.330 --> 01:49:55.430
It's just fantastic.

01:49:55.430 --> 01:50:01.480
But it also meant that the ocean,
Andrew ended up on Children

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:05.710
of the Heavenly King recording
right in the middle of it,

01:50:05.710 --> 01:50:08.010
letting lose some sort of a cry.

01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:11.010
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: Yeah.

01:50:11.010 --> 01:50:12.560
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.810
[ Laughter ]

01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:16.110
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: Yes.

01:50:16.110 --> 01:50:18.480
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Mary, how did you
find working with photographers?

01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:19.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: I was just saying

01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:21.270
about how I found working
with toddlers.

01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:26.820
I mean, it is because doing the
New River Project, we had toddlers

01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:30.800 position:56%
and so we were out there and it
gave us that-- I mean, we ended up--

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:33.510
we knew every single
playground really well

01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:34.900
by the time we left there.

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:37.820
But it also provided a
certain kind of access.

01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:43.750
I mean, we ended up interviewing
and documenting kids jumping rope

01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:50.420
and doing, you know, in African
American community on New River,

01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:52.300
where there aren't very
many of those and--

01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:58.250
no, but the child's
ticket is pretty good.

01:50:58.250 --> 01:51:00.730
The diapers aren't
but, you know, anyway.

01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:07.600
OK, the teamwork, I
found it really--

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:12.060
I mean, it was-- it's formative.

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:14.330
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Well,
you can be honest.

01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:15.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: No,
it was formative.

01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.470
I-- we-- what can I say.

01:51:17.470 --> 01:51:21.180
To work with photographers,
first of all, to have--

01:51:21.180 --> 01:51:26.260
if you're doing documentation and
you're trying to do the photography

01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:30.280 position:56%
and the recording and manage the
social interaction of the interview,

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:33.990
it's pretty-- it's
very, very difficult

01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:39.440
and to have photographers working
with you, they're not as, you know,

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:44.980 position:56%
an extension of you but as in
dialogue with you about the material

01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:49.090
and about everything that you're
doing and in constant conversation.

01:51:49.090 --> 01:51:50.470
I mean, to be in the car,

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:54.070
mulling over what we've
seen and thought about.

01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:57.450
All of the insights
that go in there.

01:51:57.450 --> 01:52:01.350
And as a folklorist, I came at
this probably much more with an ear

01:52:01.350 --> 01:52:07.530
for language and an ear for
stories and things like that.

01:52:07.530 --> 01:52:13.100
And I learned a lot about
visualization and framing pictures

01:52:13.100 --> 01:52:14.910
and things like that
from Terry and Lyntha.

01:52:14.910 --> 01:52:17.670
And I would ask Lyntha, "Lyntha,
could you please take a picture

01:52:17.670 --> 01:52:22.120
of the [inaudible] horizons,
just to show us how deep the tops

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:24.480
and the A horizon is
here and everything."

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.250
And she'd like, "Well, it's not
going to make a very good picture."

01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:33.670
So we'd have to negotiate those
kinds of things sometimes.

01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:35.530
But we did get the
[inaudible] horizon pictures

01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:36.930
and they were very, very-- yeah.

01:52:36.930 --> 01:52:39.050
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: I
did use [inaudible], I did.

01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:40.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Yeah,
I know you did.

01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:42.830
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: But I'll
break in and say, one time,

01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:50.250
we were interviewing a coal miner
union boss and we're in his home

01:52:50.250 --> 01:52:57.370
and the evening and it was when I
really realize that, you know, we--

01:52:57.370 --> 01:53:01.840
Mary was really thinking about
what questions you're going to ask,

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:05.300
what order, how she
was going to frame this

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:07.990
and I'm scanning the room
looking, where am I going to set

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:13.830
up my lights, oh my gosh, there's
a gun sitting on the couch.

01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:17.090
So, I didn't say-- well, you
know, we can't say anything.

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:18.830
We go outside after the event.

01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:21.990
And I'll say, "Mary, what
did you think about the gun?"

01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:23.880
And Mary is going, "What gun?

01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:25.180
I don't have any gun."

01:53:25.180 --> 01:53:28.360
But it was just-- you know, I'm
looking at visuals, you know,

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:33.020
and she was really
focused on this interview

01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:36.900
and because we could
divide and conquer, I--

01:53:36.900 --> 01:53:39.510
you know, I'm sure she would
have seen the gun if she had been

01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:43.640
out looking for photographs but
it was like, "Oh my gosh, OK."

01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:45.810
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Well, the other
thing that was really amazing

01:53:45.810 --> 01:53:49.350
about this, if you have people with
you who are dedicated documenters,

01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:52.730 position:56%
you know, photographers then they're
going to worry about, you know,

01:53:52.730 --> 01:53:59.720
like when we went into that
barber shop at Soak Creek, yeah.

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:02.600
And Lyntha just when I came
in with this big umbrella

01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:05.630
and she just set the whole thing
up and totally took it over.

01:54:05.630 --> 01:54:09.540
The barber shop was half
the size of this stage.

01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:13.340
And she managed to do this
and it was barber shop--

01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:16.440
music being made in the barber
shop and it-- that was incredible.

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:17.740
But--

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:19.040
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: But the barber
shop was lit by fluorescent,

01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:20.950
which we all know is
a tool of the devil.

01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:28.790
In real film, you had no option for
clear filtration of fluorescence.

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:32.220
So, you had to overpower it
in order to bring around.

01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:35.970
Today, yeah, you throw it over
to automatic white balance

01:54:35.970 --> 01:54:37.300
and the problem goes away.

01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: But the thing
is that in graduate school

01:54:39.850 --> 01:54:43.720 position:56%
as folklorists, we learned to become
very deferential to the informant

01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:48.910
and you don't take-- you tread--
it's like you take off your shoes

01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:53.310
to approach this burning bush
and here are these photographers

01:54:53.310 --> 01:54:56.940
who just come right in and
I remember Carl was with me

01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:59.770
in a New Jersey Pinelands
Project and I introduced him

01:54:59.770 --> 01:55:01.950
to Robley Champion and he said--

01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:04.490
he says, "Glad to meet
you, Mr. Champion.

01:55:04.490 --> 01:55:06.680
We're going to get every bit
of this on tape and film."

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:09.770
I mean, it was just like
that and people liked it.

01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.350
They were like, yeah,
you're not wasting my time.

01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:14.650
This is going into the
Library of Congress.

01:55:14.650 --> 01:55:16.580
And that was really interesting.

01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:18.410
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Two
things I need to point out.

01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:22.930
One, we're getting to see some of
these images for the first time

01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:27.230
since we photographed them,
which is just really a treat.

01:55:27.230 --> 01:55:28.530
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler:
Well, [inaudible].

01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:30.250
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: But secondly, yeah.

01:55:30.250 --> 01:55:37.300 position:56%
Secondly, when we worked for
National Geographic, we did not work

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:42.120
in the field with a partner and I
think many people feel that you do.

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.590
The writer at least in the early
days would be in the field second,

01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:47.890
sometimes they come first,

01:55:47.890 --> 01:55:50.640
but usually they were coming
into the field second.

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.210
So there wasn't a collaboration
of the sorts that we saw

01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:59.290
in the Blue Ridge or down in the
Coal River or the Blue River.

01:55:59.290 --> 01:56:03.910
So, there was this wonderful
idea of sharing the narrative

01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:07.540
as outsiders trying to
become knowledgeable

01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:09.750
of the narrative we were building.

01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:12.010
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler:
And one of the events Mary

01:56:12.010 --> 01:56:15.850
and I were spending
the night at Cybil's--

01:56:15.850 --> 01:56:20.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Cybil's bed and
barn, that's where we stayed.

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:22.600
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: The middle
of the night, Mary is going,

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:28.300
"We've got to get up," because
the miners that were also staying

01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:34.230
at Cybil's were out in the
common area playing card games

01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:36.980
and watching Christmas TV shows,

01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:40.500
movies and this was
about, what time?

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:41.800
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: They were--

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:43.100
that was probably about
two in the morning

01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:44.890
and they were laughing laboriously

01:56:44.890 --> 01:56:49.800
and they were playing a poker
game called pass the trash.

01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:52.700
And so, we're like, "OK,
we have to document this."

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:56.840
We got up and we can
document it and record,

01:56:56.840 --> 01:57:00.500
audio recorded and
that it was pretty.

01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:05.130
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: I'm curious
Terry, Lyntha and Mary have worked

01:57:05.130 --> 01:57:09.820
over a period of years together
on two or three, four projects

01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:15.510
but primarily in West Virginia and
I'm curious how your relationship

01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:20.920
or the interactions between you
and with the subjects changed

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:24.510
or matured or evolved over time?

01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:30.360
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: To get on an
iChat or a phone conversation,

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.650
it's like listening to two sisters.

01:57:32.650 --> 01:57:34.410
I just kind of sit back.

01:57:34.410 --> 01:57:37.280
But that was one way to change.

01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:39.930 position:56%
They were sharing tales and stories.

01:57:39.930 --> 01:57:41.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Hi, brother-in-law.

01:57:41.230 --> 01:57:42.530
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Right.

01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:46.470
But I think the big
change was that in terms

01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:49.680
of the people we were
working with in West Virginia,

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:53.690
suddenly we had the shared
contacts who would touch base

01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:56.000
with one or the other of us.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.930
We'd end up sharing that connection
and when a graduate student wanted

01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:04.100
to do a piece on mountain
top removal,

01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:07.640
I could send that graduate
student to Mary.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:12.230
Mary and I could-- and Lyntha
could send them down to someone

01:58:12.230 --> 01:58:15.610
in [inaudible] or wherever
we were working

01:58:15.610 --> 01:58:21.430
and they had a built-in shared
base from where we had started.

01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:26.150
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: But I also
think, it's Terry and I do a lot

01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:31.320
of projects together and
we'll stand the same spot

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:33.700
and photograph different things.

01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:36.110
And I pretty much know
what he's photographing

01:58:36.110 --> 01:58:38.820
and he pretty much
knows what I'm missing.

01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:40.380
You know, and so then,
we'll try to, "Oh,

01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:42.180
he's not doing that, oh my gosh.

01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:43.680
Well, I've got to do it."

01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:46.940
But the same thing with Mary,
after working over years.

01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:48.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Yeah.

01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.750
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: I pretty
much have an idea what she's--

01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:54.150
what she really will need.

01:58:54.150 --> 01:58:57.890
And, you know, so it was
a nice give and take.

01:58:57.890 --> 01:59:01.020
I'm sure she would say, "Oh,
Lyntha is going to need this.

01:59:01.020 --> 01:59:03.690
I need to maybe set up over here."

01:59:03.690 --> 01:59:04.990
Or I would say, "No, no, no.

01:59:04.990 --> 01:59:06.290
I've got to put strobes over there.

01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:09.870
You need to, you know,
do your interview here."

01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:12.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: And we went
on to do some work following--

01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:16.080
after I left the library,
we collaborated on a project

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.550
in Southwest-- Southeastern Ohio.

01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:25.750
It was a body-burden
monitoring project but we've--

01:59:25.750 --> 01:59:28.070
it was the same kind of thing.

01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:31.440
We really documented a lot of
cultural landscape connected

01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:36.400
with as a way of showing
what was under.

01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:39.070
Was that risk for the community

01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:42.510
when its water supply had
been contaminated by DuPont,

01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:47.200
a full range of cultural sorts
of amenities and everything.

01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.500
Yeah.

01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.930
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Let me
interrupt here, just enough to turn

01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:53.490
in David Taylor's direction
and ask, I mean in a funny way,

01:59:53.490 --> 01:59:56.030 position:56%
we've been hearing rural and I think
of you was urban with the project

01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:57.740 position:56%
in Paterson, New Jersey and Lowell,
Massachusetts and perhaps elsewhere.

01:59:57.740 --> 01:59:59.050
Did it seem the same that
is it-- as these stories?

01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:00.350
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: In
terms of field work?

02:00:00.350 --> 02:00:01.650
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
Well, or team, yeah.

02:00:01.650 --> 02:00:03.570
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Well, one of
the great privileges of working

02:00:03.570 --> 02:00:10.820
on this type of project for me was
the team dimension, the opportunity

02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:16.700
to get to know colleagues,
to work with them intensively

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:23.580
over long periods of time and
to learn their perspectives.

02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:30.120
Particularly from team members who
were trained in other disciplines.

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:35.810
Our work, for example, with
the John Alexander Williams,

02:00:35.810 --> 02:00:39.320
a fine historian, regional
specialist

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:44.600
of occupational studies
of the United States.

02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:50.760
We're still close friends and
it's been 30 years I guess we've

02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:54.500
been acquainted.

02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:57.380
But to learn his way
of looking at things

02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:59.800
and he was delighted
too to learn from us.

02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:02.950
Well, how does a folklorist
look at these things,

02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:06.620
which is his own turf
in a certain way.

02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:09.900
And he was so enthralled
with our perspective

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:13.590
on documentary photography that
he insisted that I teach him

02:01:13.590 --> 02:01:18.510 position:56%
to be an ethnographic photographer,
to look at things through the camera

02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:21.060
in a way that I would
look at things.

02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:23.640
And then he would come and
show me his pictures and say,

02:01:23.640 --> 02:01:25.170
"What do you think of that, David?"

02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:27.000
And he did a nice job.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:31.040
But that's the type of
enthusiasm that we shared.

02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:37.920
And when you are in a, let's
say second rate motel sharing it

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:41.730
with four, five other
people for a month or so,

02:01:41.730 --> 02:01:45.930
you get to know these people
because you're interacting

02:01:45.930 --> 02:01:51.160
at all the moments of the
work and the leisure time.

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:53.940
And you're talking
about what's going on?

02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:55.240
What are the standards?

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:58.220
This isn't what I expected
at all or this is.

02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:02.630 position:56%
This is great, the stuff that I saw
today, which I didn't personally see

02:02:02.630 --> 02:02:05.420
because I was running
around in another part

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:08.850
of the landscape doing
something else.

02:02:08.850 --> 02:02:11.270
And it was just so
fulfilling to work with others.

02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:15.930
And Tom is here, we worked together
on the Lowell project, for example.

02:02:15.930 --> 02:02:18.210
Are we forgetting other
people in the audience

02:02:18.210 --> 02:02:19.760
that worked on the field project?

02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Rita Moonsammy.

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:22.600
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Oh Rita,
of course yeah, here.

02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.240
Anyone else?

02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.510
Yeah.

02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:29.920
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:31.220
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Yeah.

02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:32.580
That's Frank Roshan
[assumed spelling],

02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:35.220
who has helped us out
from time to time.

02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:36.900
Actually, and there's another--

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:42.300
I'll ask David again because he
shepherded a project called Italian

02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:47.920
Americans in the West, which had
people in California, Colorado,

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:51.530
Nevada, Utah, and Washington.

02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:54.340
That must have been less
of a team sort of a thing.

02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:57.540
It is, I mean that was like--

02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:01.860
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: It was one main
team that I directed in several

02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:04.560
of these locations,
but there are a couple

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:08.160
of other ancillary teams
we might say who were

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:15.380 position:56%
under my remote direction working in
places where I didn't personally go.

02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:19.670
There were, I counted them
this morning, 20 field workers

02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:24.870
in addition to the AFC staff who
worked on that project over a,

02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:27.440
let's see, three-year period.

02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:31.270
So that may be the longest one or
certainly one of the longest ones

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:34.350
that we've undertaken with lots

02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:37.690
of people involved
including graduate students

02:03:37.690 --> 02:03:42.640
of [inaudible] out in the West.

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:48.430
And people from other
disciplines as well as as folklore.

02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:52.720
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: I'm curious,
I mean a question for all of you.

02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:55.990
When you were working
on a particular project,

02:03:55.990 --> 02:04:00.790
were you able to look at contact
sheets or to go, be hearing stuff

02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:05.210 position:56%
as you're moving along, so you could
review and either correct course

02:04:05.210 --> 02:04:11.980
or how-- were you having
regular team meetings to talk

02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:16.390
about the direction or
how did all of that work?

02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:19.170
&gt;&gt; David Tayloy: Well, part of
this was for all of us to work

02:04:19.170 --> 02:04:24.230
out what our roles were as team
leaders or project leaders.

02:04:24.230 --> 02:04:28.730
And I learned tremendously
from Carl and Mary and Alan,

02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:32.460
who would been evolved in
these projects before me.

02:04:32.460 --> 02:04:37.190
But I think all of us individually
developed our own particular styles

02:04:37.190 --> 02:04:39.030
of doing this.

02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:46.010
I took it as my responsibility as
the project leader to make life

02:04:46.010 --> 02:04:49.530
as easy as possible for my
fieldworkers to make sure

02:04:49.530 --> 02:04:55.230
that the logistics were
taken care of, that the hotel

02:04:55.230 --> 02:04:58.400
or motel arrangement was
done by me through them,

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:02.250
that they had a rental car,
their flights were paid for.

02:05:02.250 --> 02:05:05.670
They wouldn't be out
of pocket for anything.

02:05:05.670 --> 02:05:08.000
They had first class equipment.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:15.190
They had a manual for how we
wanted to identify the things

02:05:15.190 --> 02:05:18.750
that we are creating, the
numbering for the field tapes

02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:21.070
and photographs and all of that.

02:05:21.070 --> 02:05:24.810
Plus, I would be there and
sometimes with an archivist as well

02:05:24.810 --> 02:05:26.780
to answer their questions.

02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:29.740
And in some cases, we would
have a preliminary training

02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:31.970
for the people on the team.

02:05:31.970 --> 02:05:37.730
One thing that I learned somewhat
to my surprise that all folklores

02:05:37.730 --> 02:05:41.480
and anthropologists are not
created equal when it comes

02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:46.180
to fieldwork experience
and training.

02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:51.530
So there became a greater need
than I expected to train people

02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:55.310
in the standards that had
been developed for the Library

02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:59.520
of Congress, the American Folklife
Center, which led over time

02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:03.950
to the initiation of the Field
School for Cultural Documentation

02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:08.420
that AFC has been sponsoring
now for some years.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:11.910
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Betsy,
I would chime in echoing some

02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:18.580
of what David said and remind
everybody including myself perhaps

02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:24.560
that the client relationship
varied tremendously.

02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:31.180
And in some cases in fact, you
really could figure out what kinds

02:06:31.180 --> 02:06:36.310
of documentation was needed in
order to meet the requirements

02:06:36.310 --> 02:06:38.510
in the sense of the
client relationship.

02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:43.880
So in Chicago, for ethnic arts,
it's fairly easy, you know.

02:06:43.880 --> 02:06:48.340
There were 12 or 15 different
ethnic communities and you wanted

02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:50.670
to be sure you got
something from all of them

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:52.720
that represented the arts.

02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:56.870
What was happening in some of
the parks service project was

02:06:56.870 --> 02:07:00.460
that the resource that
was developed was intended

02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:02.680 position:56%
to inform the interpretive programs,

02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:06.530
a park interpretation
of regional culture.

02:07:06.530 --> 02:07:12.860 position:56%
In the Blue Ridge, it had one
character but, you know, in Paterson

02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:14.440
and Lowell, there were some of that

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:16.570
that had a rather different
character.

02:07:16.570 --> 02:07:19.340
But I guess I would ask Mary

02:07:19.340 --> 02:07:22.450
where we had another
park service relationship

02:07:22.450 --> 02:07:28.600
in the Pinelands Project, what
is it that they wanted to learn

02:07:28.600 --> 02:07:32.190
and how did we muster
the forces to answer it?

02:07:32.190 --> 02:07:34.520
And it gets back to your
team meeting question

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:38.420 position:56%
because the more you've got a goals
orientation, the more you could say,

02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:42.080
well, at the beginning let's meet
and list all of the things we want

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.550
to be sure to cover, then let's
meet once or twice in the middle

02:07:45.550 --> 02:07:49.260
and check them off and see how well
we've done and what we're missing.

02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:54.210
So in the final period, we can be
sure to, you know, pitchfork people

02:07:54.210 --> 02:07:56.660
to get out and get the
missing ingredients.

02:07:56.660 --> 02:08:01.440
But what is it that they wanted
to know in the Pinelands?

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.740
And--

02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Well,
this is very interesting.

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:06.240
OK, did you want to ask more?

02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:07.540
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: No, no.

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:08.840
Go on.

02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:10.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: I'm
ready with what you, OK.

02:08:10.710 --> 02:08:15.390
Well, I think that-- sorry.

02:08:15.390 --> 02:08:21.160
OK, I think that the real watershed
event demarcating the difference

02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.820
between the earliest field projects

02:08:23.820 --> 02:08:27.380
and the later ones was the
cultural conservation report.

02:08:27.380 --> 02:08:31.780 position:56%
I mean, that was an-- in retrospect,
that was an amazing thing to come

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.700
in over [inaudible] some, you know,

02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:39.940
the Congress to ask the American
Folklife Center for a report

02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:44.550
on the government's
history in approaching

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.750
and stewarding intangible
resources--

02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:48.470
intangible cultural resources.

02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:55.150 position:56%
So that the Pinelands Project
itself became a kind of a laboratory

02:08:55.150 --> 02:08:56.510
in which we could test
the principles

02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:57.970 position:56%
of the cultural conservation report.

02:08:57.970 --> 02:09:02.580
Now the cultural conservation
report came out in 1983.

02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:05.970
Four years ahead of the Brundtland
report, which was commissioned

02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:11.420
by the United Nations and
was published in 1987.

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:17.970
And in which the acclaimed
triple bottom line approach

02:09:17.970 --> 02:09:23.890
to stewardship was
established for sustainability.

02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:28.160
You need social, ecological,
and economic.

02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:31.540
That's the three-legged
stool but I actually think--

02:09:31.540 --> 02:09:32.840
and these people now are proposing

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:34.770
that there should be a fourth
leg called the culture.

02:09:34.770 --> 02:09:37.380
But I think culture is actually
the seat holding the three legs

02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:39.760
together, but I digress.

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.730
But anyway, so with
the Pinelands Project,

02:09:43.730 --> 02:09:47.970
what was very interesting is
that this was still in an arrow

02:09:47.970 --> 02:09:52.330
when everything was
so siloed, culture,

02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:54.990 position:56%
environment, you know, social stuff.

02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:58.510
It was all very siloed and we
were beginning to see the kind

02:09:58.510 --> 02:10:01.950
of crumbling of the silos but,
you know, they're still not--

02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:03.400
they're still haven't
been dismantled,

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.600
but we're still working on it.

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:11.600
So, the Pinelands commission
anticipated in its report

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.040
or in its plan, management
plan working

02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:16.520
with the American Folklife Center.

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.550
That was actually written in there.

02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:20.380
But culture was the caboose.

02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:23.240
It came along at the every end of
everything and we were expected

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:29.480
to kind of like overlay our-- the--
tell the Pinelands commission what

02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:34.160
to do with cultural resources
in relation to a plan

02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.790
that had already created.

02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:39.200
So that was part of
what was going on.

02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:45.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: I want to go back
to your question, which team meeting

02:10:45.450 --> 02:10:47.500
and make sure everybody realizes

02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:52.180
that if you were taking photographs
using kodachrome or archival film.

02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:53.480
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler:
Black and white.

02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.410
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Or black and
white, getting it processed,

02:10:56.410 --> 02:10:59.610
you couldn't get together
and look at today's tape.

02:10:59.610 --> 02:11:04.370
It was seven days, 10 days later
before the chrome came back,

02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:06.150
the black and white if we
got it up to [inaudible]

02:11:06.150 --> 02:11:10.490
and then proved we might get
it back in five to six days.

02:11:10.490 --> 02:11:15.670
So, those team meetings tended
to be discussions over the notes

02:11:15.670 --> 02:11:19.760
that the photographers had taken,
captured notes and information.

02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:22.230
And you weren't dealing with look

02:11:22.230 --> 02:11:26.580
at what I gathered in
terms of photographs.

02:11:26.580 --> 02:11:29.370
You were really used
to working shoot

02:11:29.370 --> 02:11:31.470
and ship blind and keep on moving.

02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:35.800
You had to trust the tools that
you were using in the field,

02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:42.010
know that you had the bracketing
capability, the lighting capability

02:11:42.010 --> 02:11:45.300
and could walk away
and keep on moving.

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:46.600
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well
I'm curious though.

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:52.860
For a couple of these projects,
I know say with Chicago and maybe

02:11:52.860 --> 02:11:56.830
with the Pinelands, you were
supposed to come up with a series

02:11:56.830 --> 02:12:03.790
of recommendations of how to do
programs or why you need the--

02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:07.900
or the justification for creating
a state folklore's position

02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:09.200
or whatever.

02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:12.430
I mean, there's this very
instrumental concrete goal

02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:14.890
that you were supposed to inform.

02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:18.800
Was that the case with
all of these projects?

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:21.690
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Well, it
seems to me not so much.

02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:25.810
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: You
know, to continue Mary's story.

02:12:25.810 --> 02:12:32.280
Perhaps the point there was that
it was a broad understanding

02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.990
of the cultural aspect of
the Pinelands as an area,

02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:39.330
you know, that needed description.

02:12:39.330 --> 02:12:45.220
And we always think of one's space
many place is really a terrific

02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:46.660
model for that.

02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:50.210
In the Blue Ridge, the
interpretive programs

02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:53.810
in a way were providing
raw materials for scripts

02:12:53.810 --> 02:12:58.400
that the park rangers or
interpreters would use, you know,

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.690
as well as perhaps identifying
things that ought to be followed

02:13:02.690 --> 02:13:06.450
up on or, you know, made more of.

02:13:06.450 --> 02:13:10.400
So again, those were
sort of agenda driven.

02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.460
In other cases like the work we
did in Nevada, in that small town

02:13:14.460 --> 02:13:18.960
in Nevada, it was more I
guess seed of the pants,

02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:21.170
you know, in terms of it.

02:13:21.170 --> 02:13:24.540
I mean, you worked on park
service in with Lowell,

02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:26.830
how clear was the agenda?

02:13:26.830 --> 02:13:31.560
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Well, Lowell, the
Maine Acadian Project from 1991

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:35.240
and the Paterson Project
were all cosponsored

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.520
by the National Park Service
various regional offices.

02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:43.370
And it was built into the--
our agreement with them,

02:13:43.370 --> 02:13:46.200
cooperative agreements
that recommendations

02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:49.770
from the American Folklife
Center would be forthcoming,

02:13:49.770 --> 02:13:52.850
particularly recommendations
to the National Park Service

02:13:52.850 --> 02:13:55.780
about programmatic
initiatives that we recommend

02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:00.250
that they would undertake
to better interpret

02:14:00.250 --> 02:14:03.880
to the public the cultural
resources of the region

02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:06.840
of the National Park-- in.

02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:13.460
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: And were they--
were those recommendations taken?

02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:14.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: In some cases, yes.

02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.590
Some cases no.

02:14:18.590 --> 02:14:23.290
It's became out of our hands
and we moved on to other things.

02:14:23.290 --> 02:14:26.670
But I think we discharged
our responsibility--

02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:28.410
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
The advisory function.

02:14:28.410 --> 02:14:31.430
I mean, I think you're doing
your best as an adviser.

02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:32.830
I've-- They seem useful.

02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:37.220
You know, before we go too far,
let's look in Alan's direction.

02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:40.100
You've been the recipient
of all of this verbiage.

02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:43.510
Do you want to actually
pipe up and say something?

02:14:43.510 --> 02:15:13.360
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:14.660
&gt;&gt; Alan: Thank you.

02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:20.180
I don't want to talk too loud.

02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:21.800
Is that all right?

02:15:21.800 --> 02:15:23.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Yeah.

02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:24.400
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Good.

02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:25.700
&gt;&gt; Alan: OK.

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:29.630
It struck me at an early
point maybe even as early

02:15:29.630 --> 02:15:34.030
as the Blue Ridge Project
that an important thing

02:15:34.030 --> 02:15:39.710
that teams did is deal
with community events

02:15:39.710 --> 02:15:44.810
that are large multihuman
events, you know,

02:15:44.810 --> 02:15:49.910
like a church service
or a community festival.

02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:55.750
And teams are really-- there's
almost no other way to do it except

02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:59.510
with the team because
these events are

02:15:59.510 --> 02:16:04.370
such elaborate complex
human activities

02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:10.340
that one person is just inevitably
can get just one person's

02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:14.510
perspective but a team can
really catch a lot of stuff

02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:18.930
and at least represent
the whole of that thing.

02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:24.570
And so I think one important thing
that we discovered along the way

02:16:24.570 --> 02:16:30.220
about having teams
documenting local culture is

02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:34.390
that the teams could actually
document cultural events

02:16:34.390 --> 02:16:42.280 position:56%
that were larger human events than
one person could do, just a thought.

02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:45.510
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: That's right.

02:16:45.510 --> 02:16:47.790
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well, what
about before we turn it open

02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:54.190
for questions, how-- what
are we encountering now

02:16:54.190 --> 02:16:58.940
and I know Ann can
probably jump in here with--

02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:04.730 position:56%
so here we have all this stuff and
how are you we getting it up online?

02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:09.860
What are the issues and
problems we're running into?

02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:15.260
And how do we want to see
this material out there?

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:20.980
I mean, the materials so varied and
it's an incredible kind of snapshot

02:17:20.980 --> 02:17:24.190
of the 1970s and '80s in America.

02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:25.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: I
wanted to just say--

02:17:25.490 --> 02:17:29.190
could I say one more
thing about the client?

02:17:29.190 --> 02:17:30.490
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

02:17:30.490 --> 02:17:36.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: This is-- the
Coal River Folklife Project as far

02:17:36.820 --> 02:17:38.890
as I know was the only project

02:17:38.890 --> 02:17:42.350
in which the partner was not
another government agency.

02:17:42.350 --> 02:17:45.960
It was the Lucy Brown Association
for the Mixed Mesophytic Forest,

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:48.220
a real civil society organization.

02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:52.710
And it was funded by the
Fund for Folk Culture.

02:17:52.710 --> 02:17:54.520
And I think-- yes.

02:17:54.520 --> 02:18:00.400
And-- But the thing is that that
we really got into the kinds

02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:04.590
of conversations that
emerged from that,

02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:06.810
that really affected the
project, that it was not--

02:18:06.810 --> 02:18:11.230
this was not a project conducted
in order to make recommendations

02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:12.850
to another federal agency.

02:18:12.850 --> 02:18:17.570 position:56%
So, this was a project that over the
years as I've thought back on it,

02:18:17.570 --> 02:18:22.840
I've often thought of that question
or that statement often made

02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:25.370
about the American
Folklife Preservation Act

02:18:25.370 --> 02:18:29.340
and the American Folklife
Center when it was in the--

02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:32.650
when Archie Green was
lobbying for it,

02:18:32.650 --> 02:18:36.180
that it would amplify voices
in a democratic polity.

02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:38.520
And often asking, how
does that actually work?

02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:39.820
Where does that happen?

02:18:39.820 --> 02:18:41.820
Where does the rubber
meet the road there?

02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:46.920
And with the Coal River
Folklife Project, I thought back

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:53.820
on how this-- the images that Terry
and Lyntha were creating were used

02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:59.290
to engage in conversation
across the silos with ecologists

02:18:59.290 --> 02:19:02.780
who are working on
forest decline issues

02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:06.310
and we were documenting the
community values of the forest.

02:19:06.310 --> 02:19:12.440
We presented the slides of
people using forest resources

02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:14.540
in the Southern West
Virginia coal fields.

02:19:14.540 --> 02:19:17.840
At the end of that, the
state forester approached me

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:21.080
and he said, "Hi I'm William Maxey.

02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:23.380
You know, that was
really interesting."

02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:25.640
And then he paused and he said,

02:19:25.640 --> 02:19:29.390
"You made those people
look so dignified."

02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:33.110
And these were lived
in Terry's images.

02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:37.350
And of course, you know, I was
talking about customary uses

02:19:37.350 --> 02:19:41.880
of the land in a place where those
are not highly regarded and valued

02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:44.100
and given much credence in
public policy and so forth.

02:19:44.100 --> 02:19:46.230
I'm not going to say
more than that right now.

02:19:46.230 --> 02:19:50.950
However, so several years
later, William Maxey who up

02:19:50.950 --> 02:19:53.880
until that point had stoutly
denied that anything was wrong

02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:58.310
with the forest, resigned his
position as state forester.

02:19:58.310 --> 02:20:04.800
And what he wrote when he
resigned was very telling

02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:07.660
because this meeting was in 1996.

02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:14.330 position:56%
And he said, "I resigned as a matter
of principle, for I did not want

02:20:14.330 --> 02:20:17.630
to share in the blame nor
the guilt for the loss

02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:22.780 position:56%
of West Virginia's heritage through
the loss of our forested mountains."

02:20:22.780 --> 02:20:28.030
And he-- somewhere else in
his explanation he explained

02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:33.460
that it was 1996 when he began
to realize what was going on.

02:20:33.460 --> 02:20:38.210
And he started to put together the
heritage of forest was the same

02:20:38.210 --> 02:20:40.470
as the heritage of culture.

02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:44.110
And to me, that's where
this amplifying of voices

02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:48.420
in a democratic polity
that one small moment

02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:51.840
when that kind of thing can happen.

02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:54.310
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Did those-- I
mean, just actually that brings

02:20:54.310 --> 02:20:58.440
up being a government agency
and working only with--

02:20:58.440 --> 02:21:01.740
well, or primarily with
other government agencies

02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:03.350
in doing the field research.

02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:06.710
How does that affect
what you're getting?

02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:10.020
How you're shaping the material?

02:21:10.020 --> 02:21:16.910 position:56%
I mean, did you have a greater
freedom to do certain things, or no?

02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:18.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: I
don't know that I--

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:19.560
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Certainly.

02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:20.860
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: -- that I will
describe it in terms of freedom.

02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:22.160
And it had to do with the kind

02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:23.470
of conversation you would
have with the client.

02:21:23.470 --> 02:21:24.980
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer
Yeah, I get-- I mean --

02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:26.330
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: That
was it, you know.

02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:30.700
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: -- to
chime in, I think what was nice

02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:35.190
about the field project and when
they had client relationships was

02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:38.430 position:56%
the level of independence, you know.

02:21:38.430 --> 02:21:41.090
The Folklife Center may
have an advisory group,

02:21:41.090 --> 02:21:42.810
but it wasn't just a hired hand.

02:21:42.810 --> 02:21:44.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: No.

02:21:44.110 --> 02:21:48.030
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: And the other
thing you can say is that in a way,

02:21:48.030 --> 02:21:50.320
it's the glory of the
archive, you know,

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:53.540
that then you have these raw
materials which are valuable

02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:58.700
and can be reused by others in
other ways, now 40 years later.

02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:01.900
And I'm reminded with all respect

02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:04.410
about the Farm Security
Administration photos

02:22:04.410 --> 02:22:08.670
in Roy Stryker, you know, if
anybody thought that those were

02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:12.290
about the work of a particular part
of the Department of Agriculture

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:18.530
that had a job of helping
farmers in a certain circumstance,

02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:20.920
and that the pictures
were limited to that,

02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:23.540
you know, you'd be badly mistaken.

02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:25.370 position:56%
You know, once you open the archive,

02:22:25.370 --> 02:22:29.650
all of pictures suddenly you've
got this kind of panoply of things,

02:22:29.650 --> 02:22:31.510
it's much broader than that.

02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:36.790
And we now have that vividly
before us as the things go online

02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:42.070 position:56%
and I would say, as you know, for
those who don't, I retired in April,

02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:44.190
and quickly came back
to the Folklife Center

02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:46.650
as a volunteer a couple
of days a week.

02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:50.080
And one of the things I
discovered was the consequence

02:22:50.080 --> 02:22:54.590
of mass digitization is a
massive material that's somewhat

02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:58.320
undifferentiated or
inadequately differentiated.

02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:02.020
And so I'm devoting a
portion of my volunteer time

02:23:02.020 --> 02:23:05.350
to improving the metadata
as best I can, you know,

02:23:05.350 --> 02:23:06.910
to make it more digestible.

02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:10.280
I think at the moment it's
semi-digestible and we're trying

02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:13.360
to get to higher level
of digestibility.

02:23:13.360 --> 02:23:15.680
But the other thing you
run into and this goes back

02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:20.350
to the FSA was before the photos
went online here, there was 20

02:23:20.350 --> 02:23:24.040 position:56%
or 30 years worth of books published
about it and highlights from it.

02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:27.330
So you had an interpretive
stream that coexisted

02:23:27.330 --> 02:23:29.910
with the archival resource.

02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:32.230
And we've had some of that here.

02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:35.470
Mary Hufford is again
a model for us.

02:23:35.470 --> 02:23:38.960
But David and I both have also
worked on websites that are

02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:44.240
to some degree interpretive that
now coexist or will soon coexist

02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:47.320
with these massive
raw material sets.

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:52.120
And I think the usability
or digestibility

02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:56.720
of these big archival collections
certainly strengthen or improved

02:23:56.720 --> 02:23:59.710
by the coexistence with
interpretive materials.

02:23:59.710 --> 02:24:02.800
And we got more of
it for some of them

02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:04.580
and less of it for others, Terry.

02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:07.380
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Well, apart from
the fact you failed retirement

02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:13.160
like I did, we're going to
see color much like we did

02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:16.680
with the Farm Security
Administration 30 years

02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:17.980
after the fact.

02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:21.520
We discover color, which was
always part of the project

02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:25.200
from the beginning but certainly
not something easily shared.

02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:27.300
So it's a very exciting twist.

02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:29.060
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
Yeah, well it's nice, yeah.

02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.280
And we did and this is--
you know, you were joking

02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:33.310
about how you can shoot
digital photos

02:24:33.310 --> 02:24:36.750
under fluorescent lights
and not worry about it.

02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:39.330
You don't need to use both
color in black and white film.

02:24:39.330 --> 02:24:40.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: That's right.

02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:41.930
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Well today,

02:24:41.930 --> 02:24:43.430
in the digital environment,
it's all color.

02:24:43.430 --> 02:24:46.400
Yyou can take the color out,
make black and white if you want.

02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.960
But we-- the reason I
look like a hardware store

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:50.880
with all those cameras on me is

02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:53.600
because I was juggling
black and white and color.

02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:54.900
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Absolutely.

02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:58.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: But I do think
the great treasure will be getting

02:24:58.730 --> 02:25:02.900
this resource online,
but it will be as I say,

02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:05.000
not as digestible as we would wish.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.170
So there will be some years now
of trying to improve that both

02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:12.130
through metadata remediation
and also

02:25:12.130 --> 02:25:15.600
through adding a few
interpretive layers here

02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:17.380
and there, which might be a book.

02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:18.680
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:19.980
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: You know.

02:25:19.980 --> 02:25:21.280
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: But
with good metadata

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.580
because I'm always surprised
when I find my pictures

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:27.610
with bad information on them
online, bad resource connection,

02:25:27.610 --> 02:25:30.520
interpretation and
I tend to send notes

02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:36.420
to people saying, not nice things.

02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:38.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Do
you foresee the--

02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:40.000
maybe shifting into that what now.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:41.300
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: OK.

02:25:41.300 --> 02:25:44.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: But do
you foresee the use of--

02:25:44.410 --> 02:25:52.870
the creation by independent
agencies or whatever of toolkits

02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:56.840
and interfaces with all these data.

02:25:56.840 --> 02:25:58.900
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Well,
the education resource people

02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:02.160
who are part of the Library of
Congress actually do a bang up job

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:06.200
with all kinds of materials the
Library has online making teacher

02:26:06.200 --> 02:26:07.500
kits and stuff.

02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.800
So there'll be some of
that right here at LC.

02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:10.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: But
I'm thinking beyond us.

02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:11.900
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
Well, I hope so.

02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:13.200
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: Yeah.

02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:14.500
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

02:26:14.500 --> 02:26:15.800
I think that would be the hope.

02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:18.950
I mean I would-- we would like
to get this material up and out.

02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:26.150
We certainly have ideas of wanting
to create different products

02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:30.100
or whether that's books
or manuals or whatever.

02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:34.170
But we also do want to
encourage other people to use it.

02:26:34.170 --> 02:26:37.120
And I mean, now 40, 50 years later,

02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:40.640
I would love to see how people
would engage with the material,

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:46.060
what they would think of it, how
they would shape it and put it out.

02:26:46.060 --> 02:26:50.210
But with that said, I do want to
open it up to the audience now.

02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:53.910
I know we've got I think
about 15 minutes left

02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:55.850
or so before we break for lunch.

02:26:55.850 --> 02:26:59.550
But I didn't know if
there are any questions

02:26:59.550 --> 02:27:02.740
for our esteemed panelists.

02:27:04.530 --> 02:27:12.110
Oh, OK. Yes Rita.

02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:16.130
&gt;&gt; Rita Potter: This isn't so
much a question and it doesn't--

02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:18.220
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: You
should introduce yourself

02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:19.940
as a veteran of our project.

02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:21.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Absolutely.

02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:23.200
&gt;&gt; Rita Potter: Veteran, yeah.

02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:27.900
I was the field coordinator
for the New River Project

02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:30.510
and also was working for
the State Arts Council

02:27:30.510 --> 02:27:33.560
in New Jersey during
the Pinelands Project.

02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:39.580
And in both of those roles
then I was participating in

02:27:39.580 --> 02:27:45.710
and observing the kinds of
collaborations that were necessary

02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:50.620
to execute these projects
beyond the federal government.

02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:56.880
And the consequences of them on
both the product and the response

02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:02.910
to are the use of what was
requested of the center.

02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:10.040
And I will say particularly, in New
River, we were asked supposedly,

02:28:10.040 --> 02:28:12.650
the point was to develop
recommendations

02:28:12.650 --> 02:28:15.360
for a cultural heritage center.

02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:22.390
And we did produce a report like
that, but the dynamics of the local

02:28:22.390 --> 02:28:27.550
and the state partners
that we had resulted

02:28:27.550 --> 02:28:30.450
in something completely different.

02:28:30.450 --> 02:28:37.670
In New Jersey, we had a set of
state partners using the materials

02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:40.920
including the photographs
for something

02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:45.130
that the Folklife Center hadn't
planned, but which then went

02:28:45.130 --> 02:28:52.350
on to be very useful and impactful
for a state and local audiences.

02:28:52.350 --> 02:28:58.790
At the bottom of this, that was
my strong impression of the way

02:28:58.790 --> 02:29:04.010
that those partnerships are in the
local state level could be fraught.

02:29:04.010 --> 02:29:11.290 position:56%
And I just wanted to know if Mary
wanted to describe some of the kinds

02:29:11.290 --> 02:29:16.450
of fences that we had to jump
over or couldn't get around.

02:29:16.450 --> 02:29:19.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: In New Jersey
or you mean on New River.

02:29:19.090 --> 02:29:20.460
&gt;&gt; Rita Potter: New
River or New Jersey.

02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:22.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Well, the New
River is very interesting because--

02:29:22.210 --> 02:29:24.570
&gt;&gt; Rita Potter: New River was
much more complicated that way.

02:29:24.570 --> 02:29:25.870
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: It's
very complicated

02:29:25.870 --> 02:29:28.820
and Alan said it was an
example of Oedipus complex.

02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:33.450
Now the problem is it that
the Denver Service Center came

02:29:33.450 --> 02:29:35.950
to the Folklife Center and asked

02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:40.260
if we could help them do
the documentation required

02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:45.120
to establish the foundation or the
rationale rise on death for the--

02:29:45.120 --> 02:29:48.040
a cultural heritage
center at Grandview.

02:29:48.040 --> 02:29:52.060
But there was a lot of ambivalence
about actually building something

02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:54.910
from the Denver Service
Center point of view.

02:29:54.910 --> 02:29:58.000
There's also the state
and local-- well, the--

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.700
it was more a state federal
kind of a problem too.

02:30:02.700 --> 02:30:06.080
Because the state also wanted

02:30:06.080 --> 02:30:10.180
to build what eventually
became Tamarack,

02:30:10.180 --> 02:30:13.950
which did what Superintendent
Joe Kennedy

02:30:13.950 --> 02:30:16.360
at the time said he
wanted to do for the park.

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:18.540
He wanted to bring men off
the interstate and shear them

02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:24.100
like a damn sheep is what
he said in the meeting.

02:30:24.100 --> 02:30:26.270
And the states swooped
in and did it.

02:30:26.270 --> 02:30:29.130
So-- But the thing is that what
we were recommending wouldn't have

02:30:29.130 --> 02:30:31.390
required anything more
than a trailer.

02:30:31.390 --> 02:30:35.080
And that's not what
they had in mind.

02:30:35.080 --> 02:30:38.720
We had an interpretive
program that we--

02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:42.620
that was really fueled by insights
from lots and lots of conversations

02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:44.510
with communities along New River.

02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:48.840
We wanted to work with communities
to establish their own kinds

02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:53.470
of buffer zones really, areas
where they could meet the public

02:30:53.470 --> 02:30:56.710
so they can have their own
exhibits and we would do that.

02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:58.010
That's what we really-- we--

02:30:58.010 --> 02:31:01.250
and plus using lots of things
that were already in place,

02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:03.350
the local radio station,
the local TV station,

02:31:03.350 --> 02:31:05.680
the churches, the firehalls,
you know.

02:31:05.680 --> 02:31:11.600
&gt;&gt; Rita Potter: And it would have
really served the various cultural

02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:18.290
entities and practices
of the people there,

02:31:18.290 --> 02:31:22.260
where what was eventually
reconstructed was serving the

02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:23.670
turnpike, the purpose of--

02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:27.170
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Well,
Tamarack, Tamarack the local name

02:31:27.170 --> 02:31:29.070
for it is the "Crown of Thorns."

02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:33.370
It's got this-- it's got all
these spikes coming out the side

02:31:33.370 --> 02:31:34.670
that are supposed to be

02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:37.530
in an architectural
interpretation of a quilt.

02:31:37.530 --> 02:31:42.910
But they call it the "Crown of
Thorns", which has its own ironies.

02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:47.940
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Are
there any other questions?

02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:50.250
Yeah, Chris.

02:31:50.250 --> 02:31:52.330
&gt;&gt; Chris: Hi, how are you.

02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:53.630
My name is Chris.

02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:54.930 position:56%
I work at the Brooklyn Arts Council.

02:31:54.930 --> 02:31:56.230
So I'm a folklorist in Brooklyn.

02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:58.230
And I'm lucky enough to
work in New York State

02:31:58.230 --> 02:32:00.830
where there are several
folklorists throughout the state.

02:32:00.830 --> 02:32:07.000 position:56%
And when we do get the opportunity,
which is very rare to work together,

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:10.430 position:56%
we do-- it's a wonderful opportunity
to learn from each other.

02:32:10.430 --> 02:32:14.790
And so building on that, something
you had mentioned about teams

02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:18.480
and how it's an opportunity to
see the different training styles,

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:19.860
the different approaches
or different--

02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:23.940
could you talk a bit more
about some things that maybe

02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:26.240
that when you worked on
teams that you learned

02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:29.260 position:56%
from each other and exchanged ideas.

02:32:30.290 --> 02:32:32.630
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Couple
of things come to mind.

02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:36.010
One, as you've heard I
work at Ohio University

02:32:36.010 --> 02:32:40.810
and I have taught documentary
photography there

02:32:40.810 --> 02:32:43.490
for several decades.

02:32:43.490 --> 02:32:47.020
And the end result has been that
an awful lot of my students go

02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:52.180
on to get PhDs in visual
sociology, anthropology,

02:32:52.180 --> 02:32:57.320
and folklore understanding that
they have a media obligation,

02:32:57.320 --> 02:32:59.510
but they don't want to
be part of journalism,

02:32:59.510 --> 02:33:02.480
they want to be in another area.

02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:08.220
So what I think we learned was
the idea that an ethnographic look

02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:14.290
at something is very different then
a journalistic look at something.

02:33:14.290 --> 02:33:20.460
And that there needs to be a shared
value teaching Mary journalism was

02:33:20.460 --> 02:33:25.810
as much fun as her teaching us
about physical architecture,

02:33:25.810 --> 02:33:30.230
Rusty Marshall was fantastic
at getting us to look

02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:34.480
at the physicality of what
we were photographing.

02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:38.490
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: What would have
been the journalistic approach.

02:33:38.490 --> 02:33:40.190
I mean, you--

02:33:40.190 --> 02:33:41.890
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: I'm trying
to get people to turn

02:33:41.890 --> 02:33:44.010
up the currency, the news--

02:33:44.010 --> 02:33:45.310
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: OK.

02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:47.070
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: What
journalists would call news value,

02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:51.550
but what is in the current
vernacular that's important.

02:33:51.550 --> 02:33:54.120
It's ginseng season, yes,
we're going to go out

02:33:54.120 --> 02:33:57.620
and photograph ginseng, but
let's go talk about the economics

02:33:57.620 --> 02:34:00.330
of it, let's talk about the--

02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:01.630
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Oh OK.

02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:02.930
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: Do
you see a distinction

02:34:02.930 --> 02:34:04.850
between ethnographic
and journalistic--

02:34:04.850 --> 02:34:07.000
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Not
the way I used to.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.900
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: But it's--
this summer, we teach a workshop

02:34:10.900 --> 02:34:16.410
in Scotland and we had students and
trying to push some on a project

02:34:16.410 --> 02:34:19.520
and make it more culturally based.

02:34:19.520 --> 02:34:24.590 position:56%
So, you know, they go in and they do
this picture of somebody like this,

02:34:24.590 --> 02:34:27.250
you know, and I'm going, "No, no.

02:34:27.250 --> 02:34:29.610
I want to see what's behind them."

02:34:29.610 --> 02:34:31.170
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Put
them in an environment.

02:34:31.170 --> 02:34:33.440
&gt;&gt; Lyntha Scott Eiler: I want
to see their stuff, you know,

02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:36.720
and how they place it in the room.

02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:39.150
And you could still make an
environmental part of them

02:34:39.150 --> 02:34:44.020
where they're big but that you
would still see this whole event

02:34:44.020 --> 02:34:45.320
behind them.

02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:46.620
&gt;&gt; Terry Eisler: And relationships.

02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:48.190
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
I guess, I would--

02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:52.850
I'm sort of reflecting
on my own experience.

02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:58.710
I've learned a lot from the
folklorist with whom I have worked.

02:34:58.710 --> 02:35:01.160 position:56%
So part of your answer is, you know,

02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:04.980
maybe it's just specific
to me like Terry.

02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:08.890
My familiarity with vernacular
architecture was fairly low

02:35:08.890 --> 02:35:13.300
and thanks to working with Rusty
and Blanton and others over time,

02:35:13.300 --> 02:35:18.320
I think I've sharpened my sense of,
you know, at least rural buildings,

02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:21.550
perhaps more that urban
buildings one way or another.

02:35:21.550 --> 02:35:27.150
In Chicago, the revelation
was interesting

02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:32.310
in a different way having worked
with Alan in West Virginia and sort

02:35:32.310 --> 02:35:37.920 position:56%
of being involved in documenting the
Hammonds family, which was the sort

02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:41.600
of Cecil Sharp would
have felt right at home,

02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:44.180
you know, coming into their house.

02:35:44.180 --> 02:35:49.910
We got the Chicago and you have
this much, much higher level

02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:52.890
of self-consciousness on the
part of ethnic communities.

02:35:52.890 --> 02:35:56.400
And how they costume
and present themselves.

02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:00.260
And it was quite interesting
and in a funny way having come

02:36:00.260 --> 02:36:04.600
from the Hammonds as it seemed
false to me in this odd sense.

02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:08.590
And by the end of the project
partly because of getting an earful

02:36:08.590 --> 02:36:11.620
from Elena Bradunas as
we went along, you know,

02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:16.280 position:56%
the idea of people's self-expression
as their self-expression, you know?

02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:18.470
Your job is to document
it, not to quibble

02:36:18.470 --> 02:36:20.350
with it or something, you know?

02:36:20.350 --> 02:36:22.730
So that was quite a
helpful revelation.

02:36:22.730 --> 02:36:24.030
In the--

02:36:24.030 --> 02:36:25.890
[ Laughter ]

02:36:25.890 --> 02:36:30.530
In Nevada, here again it's sort
of like the Rusty Marshall angle.

02:36:30.530 --> 02:36:33.040
It was quite interesting
working with Dick Ahlborn

02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:36.110
from the Smithsonian to get
into some of the nuances

02:36:36.110 --> 02:36:40.600
of saddlery I didn't
know about the degrees

02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.120 position:56%
to which you have a
California-derived Spanish tradition

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:49.420
for a certain kind of saddle that
has a single cinch and the marker

02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:52.210
of it is how-- well first of all,

02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:54.990
it's whether you call it
a [inaudible] or Riata.

02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:57.780
Obviously, they're coming
from the same Spanish word.

02:36:57.780 --> 02:37:01.690
But in Nevada, it's a riata.

02:37:01.690 --> 02:37:04.820
And you don't tie it hard
and fast to the saddle horn,

02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:09.660
you wrap it around or dally as they
say on the saddle, which goes back

02:37:09.660 --> 02:37:10.960
to having a single cinch.

02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:12.360
It's either two cinches and so on.

02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:16.410
So, this whole business about
methodology for cattle handling

02:37:16.410 --> 02:37:20.420
as it relates to the tools, well,
from a photographic point of view,

02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:23.020
that suddenly gives you an
ingredients list, you know,

02:37:23.020 --> 02:37:25.370
stuff to be sure to cover.

02:37:25.370 --> 02:37:30.200
But the other dimension in
Nevada, which I don't know,

02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:32.580
I'm not sure when it hit me.

02:37:32.580 --> 02:37:37.270
But there was also way back to the
self-consciousness of presentation,

02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:40.120 position:56%
the main rancher we documented was--

02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:47.840 position:56%
I think it carefully thought through
what he felt being a buckaroo meant

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:51.650
and what it came to when he would
actually stage these events.

02:37:51.650 --> 02:37:55.380
When we first arrived, he threw
what he called a buckaroo breakfast

02:37:55.380 --> 02:38:00.570
where they had this antique chuck
wagon and an open fire and so on.

02:38:00.570 --> 02:38:07.180
And what you began to sense slowly
but surely was that his view

02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:14.430 position:56%
of the work and the life had
somehow been amplified, if you will,

02:38:14.430 --> 02:38:18.930 position:56%
or reinforced by looking at Charlie
Russell paintings which he had done,

02:38:18.930 --> 02:38:21.720
probably Hollywood movies,
you know, John Ford.

02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:24.880 position:56%
I mean, you know, all of those
things begin to reinforce themselves

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:27.480
and you get this echo in there.

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:31.840 position:56%
But I'll credit myself with that
small inside rather than learning it

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.440
from somebody else with
the saddlery I got.

02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:36.770
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Your
question reminds me

02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:39.140
of the critical importance
of the composition

02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:41.650
of the field team at
the earliest stage.

02:38:41.650 --> 02:38:45.570
How do you decide who you need?

02:38:45.570 --> 02:38:51.160 position:56%
In one case of the Paterson, New
Jersey Project, I was very fortunate

02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:55.870
in being able to hire a very
highly qualified folklorist

02:38:55.870 --> 02:38:59.170
who is a native of
Paterson, Tom Carell.

02:38:59.170 --> 02:39:02.060
And the benefit to me
was he could take me deep

02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:05.860
into the community based
on his own experience there

02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:08.200 position:56%
and give me that kind of background.

02:39:08.200 --> 02:39:13.010
So, it was a tremendous,
rare, and valuable,

02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:18.360
deep dive into the cultural
heritage of that place.

02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:22.740
Because we were smart enough
to hire someone like that.

02:39:22.740 --> 02:39:28.020
The case of the Maine Acadian
Project on the northernmost border

02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:33.680 position:56%
of the state of Maine, responding
to the National Park Service request

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:40.220 position:56%
to document Acadian cultures that
existed in that region, we decided--

02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:44.440
I think it was Alan and I decided
that a great person to bring

02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:50.250
into that project as the on the
ground team leader was a person not

02:39:50.250 --> 02:39:53.650
with great familiarity
with Maine culture,

02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:59.530
but who was in fact a
Acadian from Louisiana,

02:39:59.530 --> 02:40:06.220
who had that natural interest in
this whole other branch of Acadians

02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:09.900
in the far northeastern
corner of the United States,

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:11.200
Ray Brasser [assumed
spelling], who was perfect

02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:12.500
and a French speaker as well.

02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:16.950
But you need to think
hard about that.

02:40:16.950 --> 02:40:18.550
Everyone can contribute.

02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:25.470
What are the contributions
do you need?

02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:29.420
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Frank
and then Alan-- oh, sorry.

02:40:29.420 --> 02:40:33.820
&gt;&gt; Frank: I just wanted to
ask about the absence of video

02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:36.500
and particularly from the
standpoint of the Library folks,

02:40:36.500 --> 02:40:40.070
is that something that you regret
to your grave or is that something

02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:44.300
that you thank God, you don't have
to deal with the legacy formats?

02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:47.100
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Black
and white color in video,

02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:49.670
we tried video in the Blue Ridge.

02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:58.530
It was an interesting-- experiment
is the best we can call it.

02:40:58.530 --> 02:41:03.440
With today's tools, it will be
a piece of cake in comparison.

02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:04.740
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Yes.

02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:06.040
I agree. It's a little
like the GPS stuff.

02:41:06.040 --> 02:41:09.620
It would be doable in a way it
was, and then the video equipment

02:41:09.620 --> 02:41:12.070
that we had, which
Terry is referring

02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:15.560
to is a single-tube video
recorder that had a lot of sneering

02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:16.860
in the picture afterwards.

02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:20.530
So the quality of the
documentation is not so hot.

02:41:20.530 --> 02:41:26.030 position:56%
But again, I would say these were
largely survey project, not entirely

02:41:26.030 --> 02:41:28.940
and I think there is something
that makes a good synergy

02:41:28.940 --> 02:41:32.870
between still photography, which
are these many isolated instances

02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:34.650
and the survey of things.

02:41:34.650 --> 02:41:36.180
What you don't get, you know,

02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:42.190
and of course your own experience
is terrific with this is, you know,

02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:45.810
visual documentation of music
and dance or some of those forms

02:41:45.810 --> 02:41:48.540
of expressive culture and in
the Blue Ridge, we were trying

02:41:48.540 --> 02:41:50.850
to get some dance and so on.

02:41:50.850 --> 02:41:54.760
We did shoot some movie film in
Nevada, but I don't regret it.

02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:59.350
I think, again, having
140,000 photos or whatever

02:41:59.350 --> 02:42:05.310 position:56%
that total number is online is going
to be a really valuable resource

02:42:05.310 --> 02:42:07.470
for people in a way
that the video wouldn't.

02:42:07.470 --> 02:42:10.150
So I have no regrets myself.

02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:13.030
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: But part of the
documentation too particularly

02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:17.310
for the latter of the field
projects was to accept the donation

02:42:17.310 --> 02:42:24.410 position:56%
of homemade VHS videotapes of family
reunions and other kinds of things

02:42:24.410 --> 02:42:26.360
that happened at the
community level.

02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:30.690
And people often ask us, "Well,
I've got this, don't you want it?

02:42:30.690 --> 02:42:32.350
How come you don't
have video cameras?"

02:42:32.350 --> 02:42:36.460
Well, and I would said
something like what Carl said.

02:42:36.460 --> 02:42:38.900
[ Laughter ]

02:42:38.900 --> 02:42:40.700
&gt;&gt; Betsy Petereson: Talk to him.

02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:45.200
[ Inaudible Remarks ]

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:51.820
&gt;&gt; Alan: But Carl use the great
advantage less stewards home videos

02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:54.270
in Paradise Valley
in Nevada, you know,

02:42:54.270 --> 02:42:58.080
which added I think
immeasurably to that project.

02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:00.140
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer: Right,
right and with [inaudible] help,

02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:02.850
we're redigitizing them
at higher resolution.

02:43:02.850 --> 02:43:04.650
&gt;&gt; Alan: Really.

02:43:04.650 --> 02:43:11.080
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:14.870
&gt;&gt; Alan: I just have
one trivial point.

02:43:14.870 --> 02:43:19.080
You introduced Carl
as the first employee

02:43:19.080 --> 02:43:22.540
of the American Folklife Center.

02:43:22.540 --> 02:43:25.530
Maybe my memory serves me wrong.

02:43:25.530 --> 02:43:27.730
I'm getting old, I grant you.

02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:34.100
But I think actually the first
employee was Paula Johnson

02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:43.990
and Paula is now a curator at the
Smithsonian, but also Carl's wife.

02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:45.290
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
Well, she is indeed.

02:43:45.290 --> 02:43:47.780
We also should remember
Carol Armbruster,

02:43:47.780 --> 02:43:49.850
who pitched in at the
beginning as well.

02:43:49.850 --> 02:43:53.890
So, I was the first one you
reached way outside and dragged in,

02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:56.180 position:56%
maybe that's a better way to say it.

02:43:56.180 --> 02:43:58.350
&gt;&gt; Terry Eiler: Smart
hiring practice, though.

02:43:58.350 --> 02:44:03.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Hufford: We got videotape,
just to return to that thread.

02:44:03.850 --> 02:44:09.590
We were videotaped on Coal River
by people who were videotaping

02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:12.670
or interviewing and
documenting, you know.

02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:15.910
They were just people from
the community who did that.

02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:18.350
They have the video
cameras and we didn't.

02:44:18.350 --> 02:44:19.800
&gt;&gt; Carl Fleischhauer:
Who has got a point?

02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:23.250
&gt;&gt; So I wanted to ask-- direct
this question towards David.

02:44:23.250 --> 02:44:26.430
I mean, the panel has been
fantastic in terms of talking

02:44:26.430 --> 02:44:30.500
about the cultural legacy of the
field surveys, but that stopped

02:44:30.500 --> 02:44:32.400
at a certain point
in the 20th century,

02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:36.120
1997 I think was the last one.

02:44:36.120 --> 02:44:39.790
How did the center then take
those methodological practices

02:44:39.790 --> 02:44:43.060
in particular, which I'm really
interested in forward in terms

02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:48.170
of informing the field, a wider
audience perhaps about the wonders

02:44:48.170 --> 02:44:50.810
of doing ethnographic in
a team-based fieldwork?

02:44:50.810 --> 02:44:52.670
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:54.930
I'm speaking particularly about the
field schools I guess I would say.

02:44:54.930 --> 02:44:56.230
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Well,
there are multiple ways.

02:44:56.230 --> 02:44:58.870
The Field School for Cultural
Documentations is one way

02:44:58.870 --> 02:45:05.870
that our practices in the
field projects was codified

02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:08.230
through the teaching that we did.

02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:11.900
And the amalgamation of the
ethnographic perspective

02:45:11.900 --> 02:45:16.750 position:56%
or the archival perspective was made
part of that as well in a package

02:45:16.750 --> 02:45:22.830
for instruction of two to three
weeks program that we sponsored

02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:26.250
in collaboration with colleges,
various colleges and universities

02:45:26.250 --> 02:45:28.380
around the United States.

02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:32.580
A good deal of that I believe
is represented on the website

02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:37.040
or certainly sharable to
anyone who's interested.

02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:41.130 position:56%
Things having to do with archival
numbering systems which is something

02:45:41.130 --> 02:45:43.720
that I began to learn from Carl.

02:45:43.720 --> 02:45:47.350 position:56%
How do we share that information
and I think I still have a photocopy

02:45:47.350 --> 02:45:50.890
of the methodology
that you've developed,

02:45:50.890 --> 02:45:56.170
and then the evolution
of the technologies.

02:45:56.170 --> 02:45:58.540
I remember working with Doug
Donatelli [assumed spelling]

02:45:58.540 --> 02:46:03.630
who has great head for
archival practice in combination

02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:09.450
with new forms of media,
the computer, for example.

02:46:09.450 --> 02:46:13.130
And he modified Carl's
document to take

02:46:13.130 --> 02:46:16.660
that into account,
I remember as well.

02:46:16.660 --> 02:46:20.750
So how much that is made available
outside of the field school,

02:46:20.750 --> 02:46:23.930
you can tell me better
than I can tell you.

02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:27.640
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Yeah.

02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:29.960
[ Inaudible Remarks ]

02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:32.260
&gt;&gt; Alan: Yes, I did.

02:46:33.840 --> 02:46:37.110
I would start the history

02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:42.300
of diffusing our experiences
beyond our own circle

02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:45.960
with the equipment loan program--

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:47.260
&gt;&gt; David Taylor: Right.

02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:48.950
&gt;&gt; Alan: -- which started
very early,

02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:54.440
we had all these [inaudible]
and, you know, and professionals

02:46:54.440 --> 02:46:58.820
in our field didn't have them
and so they wanted to borrow them

02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:03.670
and we just made them
available and Carl was the locus

02:47:03.670 --> 02:47:06.890
of the-- made them available.

02:47:06.890 --> 02:47:12.490
But Carl in a way was part of
the bargain because you got him

02:47:12.490 --> 02:47:19.100
as a kind of instructor and guide
helping you not only with how

02:47:19.100 --> 02:47:25.110
to work the machine but, you
know, how to do good fieldwork

02:47:25.110 --> 02:47:29.010
or at least other ideas, our ideas

02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:33.690
about how one might go
about doing fieldwork.

02:47:33.690 --> 02:47:42.980
And then Carl moved on from that
to kind of a moving workshop

02:47:42.980 --> 02:47:49.210
on fieldwork-- field documentation
and the equipment and how

02:47:49.210 --> 02:47:55.480
to use them, and so-- and then
it moved on to the later things

02:47:55.480 --> 02:48:00.230
that David is talking about.

02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:02.160
But I'm through.

02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:03.460
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: OK.

02:48:03.460 --> 02:48:04.760
I'm sorry.

02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:09.280
There's a woman in the back
there who has a question.

02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:11.920
You, or in the middle.

02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:15.440
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.

02:48:16.540 --> 02:48:20.420
Yeah, I'm not a card-carrying
folklorist like all of you,

02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:22.610
although I am a consumer
of what you do.

02:48:22.610 --> 02:48:26.390
And I've been sitting here all
morning thinking there is this

02:48:26.390 --> 02:48:31.280
strong [inaudible] quality to
everything I'm hearing you said.

02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:36.940
Oh sorry, and so my question
is, is this project over?

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:38.520
Is it completely done?

02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:43.520
I mean, this is kind of
following up on the last question.

02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:46.360
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well, I mean,
I-- when we talk about the project

02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:54.730 position:56%
or the projects, these were a series
of discrete projects that were done

02:48:54.730 --> 02:49:00.050
over a period of years and on
some level I would imagine some

02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:05.500
of them were a little opportunistic
in the sense that, you know,

02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:11.720
Alan or whomever saw
potential for a project.

02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:16.410
There was a sponsor, someone who
wanted to work in collaboration

02:49:16.410 --> 02:49:18.910
with the Folklife Center
to do something.

02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:24.340
I think most of the projects
developed or merged in those ways.

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:30.070
So, maybe a little bit
serendipitously I know the Nevada

02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:33.070
project is a little
bit different and some

02:49:33.070 --> 02:49:36.310
of the Coal River Project might
have been a little bit different

02:49:36.310 --> 02:49:44.090 position:56%
in that regard, in the sense that
AFC pursued those more intentionally

02:49:44.090 --> 02:49:46.200
and it emerged out of other work.

02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:49.780
But are they over?

02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:51.920
I don't know.

02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:57.620
I mean, field survey
projects may be done again.

02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:01.670
It would depend on
resources, partnerships.

02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:08.650 position:56%
It would definitely require-- you
need local, state, regional partners

02:50:08.650 --> 02:50:14.670
to make these things, you
know, work, as well as money.

02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:16.180
But--

02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:18.380
[ Inaudible Remarks ]

02:50:18.380 --> 02:50:24.010
&gt;&gt; -- actually continue
to request your help?

02:50:24.010 --> 02:50:25.540
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Well,
that's an interesting--

02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:30.430
&gt;&gt; Alan: Is Park Service
still on board?

02:50:30.430 --> 02:50:31.730
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Well, yes and no--

02:50:31.730 --> 02:50:35.870
I mean, yes, the Park Service
has generally been on--

02:50:35.870 --> 02:50:39.690
the American Folklife Center
has a board of trustees.

02:50:39.690 --> 02:50:42.560
And we have one trustee here.

02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:48.480
But the appointments to the board
are made through various channels.

02:50:48.480 --> 02:50:52.890
The president is-- appoints an--

02:50:52.890 --> 02:50:59.770
or appoints for individuals from
federal agencies with like minded

02:50:59.770 --> 02:51:05.250 position:56%
or relevant interest and the Park
Service is usually I think appointed

02:51:05.250 --> 02:51:09.790
through that-- I mean, we've
always had an appointment

02:51:09.790 --> 02:51:11.110
from the Park Service.

02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:14.280
Sometimes it's the head
of the Park Service.

02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:17.920
Sometimes it's senior
official in the Park Service

02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:21.730
who is appointed by the director.

02:51:21.730 --> 02:51:26.370
At the moment, we do not have
anyone from the Park Service.

02:51:26.370 --> 02:51:27.670
Yeah.

02:51:27.670 --> 02:51:31.100
&gt;&gt; I guess maybe I can
jump in here and say that--

02:51:31.100 --> 02:51:34.640
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: It's a longer,
I think, conversation but--

02:51:34.640 --> 02:51:38.340
&gt;&gt; The days when we were
collaborating with the Park Service

02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:40.660
and Alan and others can
certainly correct me if I'm wrong,

02:51:40.660 --> 02:51:44.230
my memory doesn't go back
as far as theirs does.

02:51:44.230 --> 02:51:46.390
We were there as sort
of experts brought

02:51:46.390 --> 02:51:48.330
in to do this kind of
methodological piece.

02:51:48.330 --> 02:51:51.530 position:56%
If you look at the Park Service now,
they have their own ethnographic

02:51:51.530 --> 02:51:54.880
and cultural documentation
teams that are on board.

02:51:54.880 --> 02:51:57.190
They actually have a
division of the Park Service.

02:51:57.190 --> 02:52:00.190
So whatever Park Service sort of
initiatives are being undertaken

02:52:00.190 --> 02:52:01.720
or done under their own hospices

02:52:01.720 --> 02:52:04.770
and not necessarily
external agencies like ours.

02:52:04.770 --> 02:52:07.400
And that might be interesting
to think about what happens

02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:10.070
in the field surveys of
the state by state level.

02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:12.740
Lots of states do their
own in the field surveys.

02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:15.930
Now they don't necessarily rely
upon us although we are all

02:52:15.930 --> 02:52:18.720
in the family, kissing cousins,
however we want to phrase it.

02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:20.620
So, I think that was sort of--

02:52:20.620 --> 02:52:24.350 position:56%
to the heart of my question to David
was how does our methodological

02:52:24.350 --> 02:52:27.650
practice go beyond just the
projects that we undertook

02:52:27.650 --> 02:52:30.030
and how do they inform the
rest of the field in some ways

02:52:30.030 --> 02:52:32.400
and I think Roby Cogswell
and other people

02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:37.690
up in Tennessee might be a prime
examples of people who came up

02:52:37.690 --> 02:52:40.920
and viewed with the methodologies
that we taught and apply them

02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:42.220
at their own sort of context

02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:46.200
without necessarily a direct
linkage to the Folklife Center.

02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:50.940
&gt;&gt; And I'd say one more thing
is that there are other models

02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:58.060
of doing ethnographic projects
and of receiving the documentation

02:52:58.060 --> 02:53:01.940
that comes out on those projects
that we've explored more since then

02:53:01.940 --> 02:53:05.910
and we have-- there are certain
things that the government thinks

02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:09.230
that federal agencies
are particularly good at

02:53:09.230 --> 02:53:12.420
or particularly appropriate
for and for that reason,

02:53:12.420 --> 02:53:14.700
we have the Veterans
History Project now.

02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:16.380
We have the Civil Rights
History Project,

02:53:16.380 --> 02:53:17.720
which are two different models

02:53:17.720 --> 02:53:21.670
for doing ethnographic
interviews of various kinds.

02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:24.780
And we also have things like the
Occupational Folklife Project

02:53:24.780 --> 02:53:29.740
where we help fund projects of
folklorists out in the world

02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:31.460
who want to do these
kinds of projects.

02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:36.290
And so we're continuing to be
involved in the process of,

02:53:36.290 --> 02:53:40.410
you know, advising and designing
these kinds of projects.

02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:43.410
They just don't look exactly
like the ones that we did

02:53:43.410 --> 02:53:46.070
from the 1970s to the 1990s.

02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:49.130
But these kinds of projects where
we're still getting large scale

02:53:49.130 --> 02:53:53.250
at ethnographic documentation
are still going on.

02:53:53.250 --> 02:53:54.550
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Excellent.

02:53:54.550 --> 02:54:00.770
Yeah. Alan gets the last word.

02:54:00.770 --> 02:54:07.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan: Well, this is a nice moment
to celebrate the sort of person

02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:12.630
that the administrative level in
the Park Service in this case,

02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:17.140
who is totally unsung otherwise

02:54:17.140 --> 02:54:20.450
and that was my chance
to sing his praises.

02:54:20.450 --> 02:54:28.300
I think a huge factor in
the Park Service thread

02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:34.110
that we spun was not just that we
have the Park Service on the board,

02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:40.000
but there was a representative
at a high level

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.270
from the Park Service
named Ross Holland.

02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:47.090
And Ross Holland was
very sympathetic,

02:54:47.090 --> 02:54:49.820
very engaged and friendly.

02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:53.700
One of his specialty, you know,
I think life houses were--

02:54:53.700 --> 02:54:59.500
was his specialty, you
know, but he was a good guy

02:54:59.500 --> 02:55:05.500
and a friendly administrator who
supported all these things who knew

02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:12.230
who to talk to in the Park Service
to dislodge or get something going.

02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:17.180
And so, now I've had a
chance to sing his praises.

02:55:17.180 --> 02:55:18.480
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Good.

02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:19.780
Thank you.

02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:24.940
Thank you, and thanks to everyone
else and I misspoke earlier.

02:55:24.940 --> 02:55:30.150
We actually do have a short
session coming up here, right now,

02:55:30.150 --> 02:55:36.350
talking shop dialogue with
Doug Boyd and Nikki Saylor.

02:55:36.350 --> 02:55:38.870
So thank you.

02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:43.330
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: So
at the Folklife Center,

02:55:43.330 --> 02:55:48.500 position:56%
we embarked on a three-year planning
project for the archives and we're

02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:49.800
on the third year of that.

02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.420
And we declared sort of six
strategic directions that we wanted

02:55:53.420 --> 02:56:00.070
to focus on, and one of them was
providing access at digital scale.

02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:02.510
And so what you see with the Folk

02:56:02.510 --> 02:56:08.570
or with the field projects is
an example of us trying to scale

02:56:08.570 --> 02:56:10.340
up our access to materials.

02:56:10.340 --> 02:56:12.030
We're doing that metadata.

02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:16.870
We're bulk uploading, you know,
tens of thousands of records

02:56:16.870 --> 02:56:18.170
for the [inaudible] collection.

02:56:18.170 --> 02:56:24.420
And so anyway this-- Thinking
about how to make oral histories

02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:29.260
and various spoken word
materials accessible online is

02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:30.560
of a piece, right.

02:56:30.560 --> 02:56:33.800
So this is really something we're
thinking a lot about right now.

02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:36.750
What we do is a bit old school.

02:56:36.750 --> 02:56:40.230 position:56%
We will put up a PDF or a text piece

02:56:40.230 --> 02:56:43.550
that goes along with
the AV material.

02:56:43.550 --> 02:56:47.440
Of course, we want to get into
the world of time stamping

02:56:47.440 --> 02:56:49.340
and synchronizing our metadata.

02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:52.920
And so to talk about
that, thought immediately

02:56:52.920 --> 02:56:54.390
of our friend, Doug Boyd.

02:56:54.390 --> 02:56:58.600
Doug Boy directs the Louie B.
Nunn Center for Oral History

02:56:58.600 --> 02:57:00.200
at the University of Kentucky.

02:57:00.200 --> 02:57:04.680
He's also the coordinator of
a wonderful tool called OHMS.

02:57:04.680 --> 02:57:05.980
And he'll talk about that.

02:57:05.980 --> 02:57:10.780
But he'll also talk about his
experimentation with voice to text

02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:14.670
and other methods of trying
scale up this kind of work,

02:57:14.670 --> 02:57:18.520
and sort of the ethical
implications that come with sort

02:57:18.520 --> 02:57:20.760
of blowing it all out there.

02:57:20.760 --> 02:57:26.420
And how to sort of strike a
balance between giving the access

02:57:26.420 --> 02:57:29.920
that people in the 21st century
want against out responsibility

02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:31.680
as stewards of this material.

02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:33.980
So, I'll go ahead and
turn it over to Doug.

02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:41.110
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: In the
interest of being quick,

02:57:41.110 --> 02:57:45.480
efficient for lunch,
I opted for no slides.

02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:53.000 position:56%
So that I could also then vaguebook,
or subtweet my entire presentation,

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.950
hashtag oral history wants
to be heard and watched,

02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:59.230
hashtag archives should
enhance access for impact,

02:57:59.230 --> 02:58:05.970 position:56%
but remember hashtag sustainability,
hashtag ethics, @taylorswift13.

02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:14.250
The Nunn Center started in
1973 collecting oral history.

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:18.660
When I took over in 2008, we had
a collection of 6,000 interviews,

02:58:18.660 --> 02:58:24.950
mostly were-- mostly analog, mostly
untranscribed, almost no metadata.

02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:26.470
We had no public interface.

02:58:26.470 --> 02:58:29.910
I was the single staff member, even
though they called me a director.

02:58:29.910 --> 02:58:32.100
And despite this, we still brag

02:58:32.100 --> 02:58:34.740
that we had 500 researchers using
our oral history collections

02:58:34.740 --> 02:58:36.040
every year.

02:58:36.040 --> 02:58:38.280
So, one of my great
obsessions I think

02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:41.470
over the past many years has been

02:58:41.470 --> 02:58:44.100
that there's these great
oral history collections all

02:58:44.100 --> 02:58:45.400
over the world.

02:58:45.400 --> 02:58:48.330
But especially here in the
US, especially in Kentucky,

02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:50.720
I think we have 43
different repositories

02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:54.020
that have oral history
interviews within them.

02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:57.910
But the majority of those
oral histories are continuing

02:58:57.910 --> 02:59:01.350
to be sitting there on
the shelves and unused.

02:59:01.350 --> 02:59:06.370
Even if they've been digitized,
they're very, relatively speaking,

02:59:06.370 --> 02:59:08.550
unused and still rather obscure.

02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:10.220
And that's not why we
went into this business.

02:59:10.220 --> 02:59:12.140
We went into this business
to document not

02:59:12.140 --> 02:59:15.450 position:56%
for obscurity but for impact, right.

02:59:15.450 --> 02:59:19.990
To put these individual stories
to document these cultures.

02:59:19.990 --> 02:59:25.740
So that said, AV archives, all
of AV archives has the problem

02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:29.030
of discovery and usability, right.

02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:30.330
It's time-based media.

02:59:30.330 --> 02:59:31.630
It takes time to use.

02:59:31.630 --> 02:59:36.850
We have a complete reliance
on texts in this model.

02:59:36.850 --> 02:59:39.540
Text enables discovery really.

02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:41.500
There was a point in
oral history's history

02:59:41.500 --> 02:59:44.120
where it was actually
seen as the only outcome.

02:59:44.120 --> 02:59:47.950
You know, Columbia University
actually erased their tapes

02:59:47.950 --> 02:59:52.140
after it was transcribed
which, you know, they greatly--

02:59:52.140 --> 02:59:57.040
they reject that now and regret it.

02:59:57.040 --> 03:00:00.570
But the model, even if you
didn't erase your tape,

03:00:00.570 --> 03:00:03.100 position:56%
the expectation was we're going to
transcribe this, and these are going

03:00:03.100 --> 03:00:04.890
to go on a shelf and people
are going to use them.

03:00:04.890 --> 03:00:07.880
And then they got digitized and
people are going to search them.

03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:09.780
The majority of reference
request that would come

03:00:09.780 --> 03:00:12.720
in to my shop would
be for transcripts.

03:00:12.720 --> 03:00:14.220
Just send me the transcript.

03:00:14.220 --> 03:00:15.950 position:56%
We don't have a transcript for that.

03:00:15.950 --> 03:00:18.720
Oh, and there's this
awkward silence.

03:00:18.720 --> 03:00:23.110
So, we've got this powerful
dependency on transcript,

03:00:23.110 --> 03:00:28.550
very few of us can actually
afford transcription at the scale

03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:32.060
of even a small archive
without a grant.

03:00:32.060 --> 03:00:37.550
And so, without grant, if we factor
out grants, if we were a startup,

03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:39.550
you know, this would be a situation

03:00:39.550 --> 03:00:41.990
that potential investors would
actually call a really bad

03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:44.170
business model.

03:00:44.170 --> 03:00:47.320
We're collecting on a
scale like never before.

03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:51.620
Our discovery interfaces are
really designed for photographs.

03:00:51.620 --> 03:00:57.380
And so, the usability factor falls
pretty short when you use systems

03:00:57.380 --> 03:01:01.170
like CONTENTdm or, you know,
other popular systems not to call

03:01:01.170 --> 03:01:05.230
out just them, to use audio
visual type of materials.

03:01:05.230 --> 03:01:13.060
So, in 2008, 2009, I started
drawing on napkins and working

03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:15.360
with programmers and
created a system called OHMS.

03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:17.750
So Oral History Metadata
Synchronizer.

03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:19.630
It was built for in-house only.

03:01:19.630 --> 03:01:25.620
It was really built to-- originally
to connect users to the moments

03:01:25.620 --> 03:01:27.750
in the audio or the video.

03:01:27.750 --> 03:01:31.360
So, you search on the word
bourbon, it takes you to the moment

03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.030
when the [inaudible] talks
about making bourbon.

03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:36.920
Originally, it was designed
just for transcription,

03:01:36.920 --> 03:01:38.400
connect you to just the moment.

03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:39.700
Very simple.

03:01:39.700 --> 03:01:44.090
And we actually had the financial
crisis in 2009 and as the person

03:01:44.090 --> 03:01:47.520
who was paying the bills realize
they couldn't afford transcription.

03:01:47.520 --> 03:01:51.670
And therefore couldn't
afford to use my own system.

03:01:51.670 --> 03:01:57.420
So, we put a little investment
into creating an indexing feature,

03:01:57.420 --> 03:02:00.400
where it was a lot like
the old school tape logs

03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:05.110
that you've been seeing on the
screen, where could we create a way

03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:10.020
where we could take
indexing, abstracting, logging

03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:11.940
and make it interact
with the players.

03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:13.470
And so, we did just that.

03:02:13.470 --> 03:02:18.040
We launched the indexing
feature in 2009-- or 2011.

03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:21.340
And since then have really
been primarily indexing our

03:02:21.340 --> 03:02:22.640
oral histories.

03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:25.860
We can index just to
describe what that means.

03:02:25.860 --> 03:02:30.590
From my perspective, you
basically listen to an interview,

03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:32.700
you hear something
important often correlating

03:02:32.700 --> 03:02:34.970
with the question prompt.

03:02:34.970 --> 03:02:38.800
And you tag that moment and
with each index section,

03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:41.670
you can have a title,
a partial transcript.

03:02:41.670 --> 03:02:43.480
A description of what's
being talked about.

03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:45.730 position:56%
You could use keywords and subjects.

03:02:45.730 --> 03:02:47.090
You can upload to [inaudible]

03:02:47.090 --> 03:02:49.880
to actually drive the
keywords and subjects.

03:02:49.880 --> 03:02:51.690
You can put in GPS coordinate

03:02:51.690 --> 03:02:55.280
so that the user can then
actually hear someone talking

03:02:55.280 --> 03:03:00.800
about some place and see that place
on a Google map simultaneously.

03:03:00.800 --> 03:03:03.710
You can also hyperlink
out to photographs.

03:03:03.710 --> 03:03:05.470
So, that's actually the part

03:03:05.470 --> 03:03:09.330
that really people have really
started to get excited about.

03:03:09.330 --> 03:03:12.050
Or the-- just the little
GPS and the hyperlink thing.

03:03:12.050 --> 03:03:13.840
We kind of just tossed in there.

03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:17.240
But the idea was to create a system

03:03:17.240 --> 03:03:20.050
that wasn't a new content
management system.

03:03:20.050 --> 03:03:22.100
I sit on a lot of these grant
panels that drives me crazy

03:03:22.100 --> 03:03:24.360
when people propose a brand
new content management system.

03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:29.450
Let's just make the ones we have
better and rally around together.

03:03:29.450 --> 03:03:31.550
And so, OHMS actually
was designed to work

03:03:31.550 --> 03:03:34.000
with any content management system.

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:37.630
So whether you're a
WordPress or MECA or CONTENTdm

03:03:37.630 --> 03:03:41.980
or the Digital Library of Georgia
It works the exact same way.

03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:45.820
So, I'm not going to get too far in
the weeds in terms of how it acts

03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:47.870
or how it is implemented.

03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:52.590
But the values that I think drove
the entire conversation here

03:03:52.590 --> 03:03:56.330
where we want to model, I want to
model that's effective, affordable,

03:03:56.330 --> 03:04:01.240
flexible, interoperable,
empowering, and sustainable.

03:04:01.240 --> 03:04:06.250
So, you know, the grant
business, you know, is fantastic.

03:04:06.250 --> 03:04:11.060
With a grant-- with a great-- even
a small grant and a programmer,

03:04:11.060 --> 03:04:14.800
you can actually achieve
magical innovation.

03:04:14.800 --> 03:04:19.860
But what happens is inevitably, the
grant will run out at some point.

03:04:19.860 --> 03:04:26.450
At which point, magical innovation
tends to fall away and we fall back

03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:29.260
into unsustainable
archival workflows.

03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:30.860
And so, we're trying
to actually come

03:04:30.860 --> 03:04:33.580
up with a model that
reverses the trend.

03:04:33.580 --> 03:04:39.790
And can we actually create
a baseline expectation

03:04:39.790 --> 03:04:44.760 position:56%
of Archival processing for oral
history collections or access models

03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:48.850
for oral history collections that
have magical innovation built in

03:04:48.850 --> 03:04:51.290
but don't require a grant
in order to implement.

03:04:51.290 --> 03:04:52.590
And we've done that.

03:04:52.590 --> 03:04:55.570
So, in addition to the Nunn
Center, I think there's

03:04:55.570 --> 03:05:00.700
over 250 OHMS accounts now in 18
different countries which is cool.

03:05:00.700 --> 03:05:04.580 position:56%
All because it's effective,
affordable, flexible, interoperable,

03:05:04.580 --> 03:05:07.410
empowering and ultimately
a sustainable solution.

03:05:07.410 --> 03:05:12.870
We have continued to innovate
after the grant ran out.

03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:14.700
I'm pretty excited.

03:05:14.700 --> 03:05:16.020
Last month or two months ago,

03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:18.650
we launched the capability
to do bilingual.

03:05:18.650 --> 03:05:21.780
So you can actually index in
two languages and the user gets

03:05:21.780 --> 03:05:24.190
to search or toggle
between the two languages.

03:05:24.190 --> 03:05:26.400
You can actually upload a
transcript and a translation

03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:28.760
and it does the same
thing, which is pretty cool,

03:05:28.760 --> 03:05:31.160
all without a grant which is cool.

03:05:31.160 --> 03:05:34.880
So the Nunn Center has really
rallied around this model.

03:05:34.880 --> 03:05:38.180
For us, it works amazingly well.

03:05:38.180 --> 03:05:40.540
We have a discovery
system that's pretty basic.

03:05:40.540 --> 03:05:44.030
But because of the
use of this system,

03:05:44.030 --> 03:05:46.410
what's happening is
pretty transformative.

03:05:46.410 --> 03:05:48.860
Again, remind you, we used to brag

03:05:48.860 --> 03:05:52.500
about 500 people using
our collections in a year.

03:05:52.500 --> 03:05:56.790
And now, it's averaging 10 to
12,000 a month all over the world.

03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:59.010
I think it was January.

03:05:59.010 --> 03:06:04.840
There was like 17,000, which
is not perfectly meaningful

03:06:04.840 --> 03:06:07.530
but is pretty incredible
in comparison

03:06:07.530 --> 03:06:09.420
to where-- from where we've come.

03:06:09.420 --> 03:06:12.880
So cool models are starting
to happen where, you know,

03:06:12.880 --> 03:06:15.480
my center is indexing
on a large scale.

03:06:15.480 --> 03:06:20.150
That means I've got five graduate
students indexing all the time.

03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:23.360
But we're also having more
professors from around campus start

03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:24.660
to get excited about this.

03:06:24.660 --> 03:06:27.840
I started to experiment
myself using OHMS indexing

03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:30.290
as a classroom activity
for my classes

03:06:30.290 --> 03:06:32.230
because I was developing the tool.

03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:35.620
But now, professors are starting
to actually latch on to this

03:06:35.620 --> 03:06:39.300
and realize that indexing is really
a deep engagement for students

03:06:39.300 --> 03:06:41.170
with this oral history material.

03:06:41.170 --> 03:06:45.180
It extends beyond the sort of
consumer model of student go listen

03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:47.060
to this oral history and learn.

03:06:47.060 --> 03:06:51.040
They are actually participating
in a creation or creative act.

03:06:51.040 --> 03:06:53.270
And the archive gets free labor.

03:06:53.270 --> 03:06:57.560
So we have student-- classes at
institutions around the country now

03:06:57.560 --> 03:07:01.370
that are actually indexing
our collections for us

03:07:01.370 --> 03:07:03.420
and it's pretty fantastic.

03:07:03.420 --> 03:07:05.500
So there's a pedagogical aspect.

03:07:05.500 --> 03:07:09.340
But, you know-- And really
I think the Nunn Center is

03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:14.060
about 2500 interviews out there
right now in the OHMS system.

03:07:14.060 --> 03:07:16.640
We're about to hit
10,000 total interviews.

03:07:16.640 --> 03:07:17.940
So, that's about a third

03:07:17.940 --> 03:07:22.700
of our collection is now
accessible via this interface,

03:07:22.700 --> 03:07:25.040
which is pretty exciting.

03:07:25.040 --> 03:07:26.440
Let's see.

03:07:26.440 --> 03:07:30.700
We do think a lot about some of
these other systems out there.

03:07:30.700 --> 03:07:35.840
So OHMS really is something that
we built selfishly for ourselves.

03:07:35.840 --> 03:07:40.270
We got the grant to make it open
source and free through IMLS.

03:07:40.270 --> 03:07:45.420
But really, you know, I'm
most worried about, you know,

03:07:45.420 --> 03:07:48.590
what system represents the
archive that I'm running.

03:07:48.590 --> 03:07:55.990
And so, we've scaled up in a big
way and learned some lessons.

03:07:55.990 --> 03:07:58.480
Not everything-- I knew this

03:07:58.480 --> 03:08:01.560
but I've just been really
reminded almost monthly,

03:08:01.560 --> 03:08:05.210
not everything needs
to be online right now.

03:08:05.210 --> 03:08:09.320
And so, fighting this impulse,
aggressively fighting the impulse

03:08:09.320 --> 03:08:14.240
of archival obscurity, you know,
to the other extreme of suddenly,

03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:16.020
we've got all of the stuff online,

03:08:16.020 --> 03:08:19.550
you wouldn't believe the takedown
requests that we're getting now.

03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:21.170
It's really astonishing.

03:08:21.170 --> 03:08:23.450
I'm so jazzed about discovery.

03:08:23.450 --> 03:08:28.250
I'm so excited that more and more
people are using our materials.

03:08:28.250 --> 03:08:30.220
But it is interesting.

03:08:30.220 --> 03:08:31.590
I love the calls, "Hey, I can--

03:08:31.590 --> 03:08:33.380
I found my grandfather,
great grandfather.

03:08:33.380 --> 03:08:34.680
I've never heard his voice.

03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:35.980
This is great."

03:08:35.980 --> 03:08:41.530
But also getting calls
like, "What the hell?

03:08:41.530 --> 03:08:45.700
You know, I had no idea my life
story was going to be, you know,

03:08:45.700 --> 03:08:47.840
bullet pointed to the
great degree of detail

03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:52.040 position:56%
and be the number two search hit if
you Google, when you search my name.

03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:53.580
I'm applying for jobs.

03:08:53.580 --> 03:08:54.880
What's going on?"

03:08:54.880 --> 03:08:58.100
I had a call just a couple of
months ago from a woman, totally,

03:08:58.100 --> 03:09:00.000
totally innocuous interview.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:01.830
I mean, it's a great interview.

03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:03.130
There's nothing in there

03:09:03.130 --> 03:09:06.720
that anybody would really possibly
think would be problematic.

03:09:06.720 --> 03:09:08.870
And the reality-- I called her.

03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:10.170
I-- We-- I said, "Do you mind

03:09:10.170 --> 03:09:12.580
if I ask you some questions
why you want this taken down?"

03:09:12.580 --> 03:09:13.970
Because all that she
gave me was this vague,

03:09:13.970 --> 03:09:17.990
"I'm reevaluating my
privacy, my online privacy."

03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:19.810
And so I called her
and talked to her.

03:09:19.810 --> 03:09:21.110
She's dating.

03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:24.180
And she said two men
actually quote back to her

03:09:24.180 --> 03:09:27.200
from her oral history
interview in first dates.

03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:30.590
And she said that's not supposed
to happen in a first date.

03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:33.830
And I said, "I agree.

03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:35.840
I'll take it down."

03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:39.540
And I think that's a great example.

03:09:39.540 --> 03:09:43.160
I have all kinds of examples
of so many, you know,

03:09:43.160 --> 03:09:45.550
from one our projects
who is HIV positive.

03:09:45.550 --> 03:09:48.010
And now, he's on the job market, he
doesn't want people to know that.

03:09:48.010 --> 03:09:49.310
And at the time he
did this interview,

03:09:49.310 --> 03:09:50.820
he really wanted to talk about it.

03:09:50.820 --> 03:09:52.120
But now, he doesn't
want it out there

03:09:52.120 --> 03:09:56.810 position:56%
and have it be the number two search
hit when you're searching Google.

03:09:56.810 --> 03:10:01.390
So we've had to really step
back I think pretty profoundly

03:10:01.390 --> 03:10:03.480
and think not just
about informed consent

03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:05.050
because we really need
to a better job of this.

03:10:05.050 --> 03:10:09.620
Because no matter what we're
saying to our people right now,

03:10:09.620 --> 03:10:11.340
it's not enough that
people that we're recording.

03:10:11.340 --> 03:10:17.780
And I know, we can't truly capture
the breadth of all that can happen

03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:20.890
to your interview, but we need
to do a better job and strive

03:10:20.890 --> 03:10:23.040
to do a better job
with informed consent.

03:10:23.040 --> 03:10:25.270
We need to do a better job
with informed accessioning too.

03:10:25.270 --> 03:10:28.160
Our archives need to know
what we have in these things.

03:10:28.160 --> 03:10:33.210
And so, one of the reasons we've
really put a lot of emphasis

03:10:33.210 --> 03:10:35.860
on indexing is we're able
to identify those things

03:10:35.860 --> 03:10:38.470
because indexing requires
deep engagement in thinking

03:10:38.470 --> 03:10:42.420
about the content, not just
mechanically transcribing something

03:10:42.420 --> 03:10:44.980
or even automatically
transcribing something.

03:10:44.980 --> 03:10:46.280
I'm the same as everybody.

03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:48.190
I would love to have automatic
speech recognition be the

03:10:48.190 --> 03:10:49.490
greatest thing.

03:10:49.490 --> 03:10:53.260
Right now, it is challenging
for oral history for a variety

03:10:53.260 --> 03:10:55.090 position:56%
of reasons, which we can talk about.

03:10:55.090 --> 03:11:00.390
But it also disconnects the
human element from the process

03:11:00.390 --> 03:11:01.790
and there's nothing more personal

03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:04.070
than this oral history
thing, I think.

03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:06.410
It's not historic photographs
from the '30s.

03:11:06.410 --> 03:11:07.730
This is somebody's life story

03:11:07.730 --> 03:11:10.340
and when you take a good
oral history interview

03:11:10.340 --> 03:11:12.030
that says, where were you born?

03:11:12.030 --> 03:11:13.500
Let's talk about your parents.

03:11:13.500 --> 03:11:17.030
Where did you go to school?

03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:18.330
You get their email address.

03:11:18.330 --> 03:11:19.850
You just reset their bank password.

03:11:19.850 --> 03:11:22.900
We need to think about this
thing that we're collecting

03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:25.730
and the implications
of it down the road.

03:11:25.730 --> 03:11:29.930
I think we've solved a lot of
the problems here on the backend.

03:11:29.930 --> 03:11:35.010
Now, we need to think about the
implications of our solutions.

03:11:35.010 --> 03:11:36.310
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Great.

03:11:36.310 --> 03:11:38.790
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: That was just good.

03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:40.090
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Yeah.

03:11:40.090 --> 03:11:41.390
Come on over.

03:11:41.390 --> 03:11:42.690
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: I'll just sit here.

03:11:42.690 --> 03:11:43.990
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Sure.

03:11:43.990 --> 03:11:45.290
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: All right.

03:11:45.290 --> 03:11:46.590
Do we sit this close and talk?

03:11:46.590 --> 03:11:47.890
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Sure.

03:11:47.890 --> 03:11:49.190
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: OK.

03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:50.490
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: I can
move over if it's weird.

03:11:50.490 --> 03:11:56.490
OK. So the American Folklife Center
sent out some spoken word materials

03:11:56.490 --> 03:12:02.130 position:56%
to participate in a project that
the New York Public Library is doing

03:12:02.130 --> 03:12:05.050
with the Pop Up Archive
and Moth, right?

03:12:05.050 --> 03:12:10.300
So they are sending a lot of spoken
word materials to Pop Up Archive,

03:12:10.300 --> 03:12:15.480
which then turns it in to text
and brings it back to you.

03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:18.590
So we participated in an
experiment with our materials

03:12:18.590 --> 03:12:21.070
and it actually turned out decent.

03:12:21.070 --> 03:12:23.380
I mean, it's not bad.

03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:28.800 position:56%
But-- so for people who are managing
large oral history collections,

03:12:28.800 --> 03:12:34.040
what kind of advice do you have for
looking at that, looking at OHMS

03:12:34.040 --> 03:12:36.300
and sort of carving a path?

03:12:36.300 --> 03:12:38.720
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Well, I think
there's a lot of systems out there

03:12:38.720 --> 03:12:40.060
that do a lot of different things.

03:12:40.060 --> 03:12:42.700
And, you know, one of the
things I like about OHMS is

03:12:42.700 --> 03:12:45.280
that I don't have a
dog in the fight.

03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:48.330
I don't really care
actually if anybody uses it.

03:12:48.330 --> 03:12:50.520
I mean, other institutions,
you know.

03:12:50.520 --> 03:12:54.850
It's something that we gave away,
but we love using it in-house.

03:12:54.850 --> 03:12:59.360
And I'm excited to see it
empowering other archives.

03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:01.850
But what it's done for us
is pretty transformative.

03:13:01.850 --> 03:13:05.760
I think just from the
perspective of indexing,

03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:10.640
we indexed last year
900 hours of interview

03:13:10.640 --> 03:13:15.260
in a single year for
my student budget.

03:13:15.260 --> 03:13:17.580
No grant, no special initiative.

03:13:17.580 --> 03:13:19.710 position:56%
My student budget was about $16,000.

03:13:19.710 --> 03:13:23.520
Now, we don't pay very well
in Kentucky of our students.

03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:27.840
But for $16,000, we accomplished
what would've cost us probably

03:13:27.840 --> 03:13:31.520
$180,000 in a transcript model.

03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:34.130
That's pretty revolutionary for us.

03:13:34.130 --> 03:13:37.800
And so, we are now putting
most of our emphasis on that.

03:13:37.800 --> 03:13:40.120
And I think a lot of people
are doing it sort of thinking

03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:43.970
about this is an index now, maybe
transcribe later or maybe we clean

03:13:43.970 --> 03:13:47.150
up the automatic speech
recognition that really still even

03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:51.420
when it's pretty good requires
a lot of attention and care

03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:56.270 position:56%
and feeding I think in order to
bring it up to standards with regard

03:13:56.270 --> 03:13:59.410
to having it be a verbatim
transcripts.

03:13:59.410 --> 03:14:02.290
But I really start to
rethink my views on that.

03:14:02.290 --> 03:14:03.590
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Yeah.

03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:06.380
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: I'm staring to think
about transcripts less and less

03:14:06.380 --> 03:14:09.390
as the thing and more and more
as just the descriptive metadata.

03:14:09.390 --> 03:14:15.240
And when we make that paradigm
shift, it removes the burden

03:14:15.240 --> 03:14:17.200
of perfection completely.

03:14:17.200 --> 03:14:20.820
So we're going to start
experimenting with the idea

03:14:20.820 --> 03:14:25.720
of taking some of the ugly,
automatically generated speech

03:14:25.720 --> 03:14:31.460
to text material and kind of make
it searchable but not readable.

03:14:31.460 --> 03:14:33.580
Make it part of the search things

03:14:33.580 --> 03:14:35.220
because some of it
can be really bad.

03:14:35.220 --> 03:14:36.910
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: But hide
it, right, on the interface.

03:14:36.910 --> 03:14:38.210
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: But hide it.

03:14:38.210 --> 03:14:39.700
Make it searchable, hidden,
but make it something

03:14:39.700 --> 03:14:42.770
that then can maybe connect to
a corresponding index point.

03:14:42.770 --> 03:14:46.640 position:56%
So we're thinking a great deal about
that and starting to experiment more

03:14:46.640 --> 03:14:47.940
and more with speech recognition.

03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:50.280
I love the idea of it.

03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:52.630
The idea of automating the
whole system, you know,

03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:55.710
is something that I think
makes me somewhat uncomfortable

03:14:55.710 --> 03:14:58.860
from a usability or from
an ethical standpoint

03:14:58.860 --> 03:15:03.310
of not knowing what we're putting
out on the internet when we do it.

03:15:03.310 --> 03:15:04.610
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Right.

03:15:04.610 --> 03:15:07.050
I mean, I think, you've
touched on it briefly, but yeah,

03:15:07.050 --> 03:15:10.280
how do you navigate than
tension between scaling access

03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:13.430
to these materials and also
being responsible stewards

03:15:13.430 --> 03:15:15.720
and it would seem like indexing
does give you a certain amount

03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:17.020
of check, right?

03:15:17.020 --> 03:15:18.500
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: We've
created a system, you know,

03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:21.940
I called it informed accessioning
and it's basically six questions

03:15:21.940 --> 03:15:24.680
that I have-- used to have
all my interviewers ask

03:15:24.680 --> 03:15:28.070
that basically all boil down to,
is there anything I need to know

03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:30.810
about this in here and
if this were your story,

03:15:30.810 --> 03:15:32.700
would you mind it going
online next week?

03:15:32.700 --> 03:15:34.000
And--

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:35.530
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: So you asked
that during the interview, right?

03:15:35.530 --> 03:15:37.800
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: The interviewers
are asking themselves--

03:15:37.800 --> 03:15:39.100
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Oh I see.

03:15:39.100 --> 03:15:40.400
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: -- this question
when they write out our forms.

03:15:40.400 --> 03:15:41.700
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: When they're
working on an interview, got it.

03:15:41.700 --> 03:15:43.000
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Yeah.

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:44.670
And there's turning in paperwork
for our interview and kind

03:15:44.670 --> 03:15:46.700
of telling us, hey, you
need to look at this.

03:15:46.700 --> 03:15:50.460
But I started having the indexers
do it because we started realizing

03:15:50.460 --> 03:15:54.430 position:56%
that we have all this legacy content
that's not being collected yesterday

03:15:54.430 --> 03:15:58.920
or tomorrow, that we have
very little amount of data for

03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:04.020
and again repeatedly finding really
profound examples of people talking

03:16:04.020 --> 03:16:07.920 position:56%
about very personal things that just
have no, no business being online

03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:10.920
or actually having-- you
know, being quite problematic

03:16:10.920 --> 03:16:12.460
if they were to go online.

03:16:12.460 --> 03:16:15.750
So building in the workflows
where all the indexers, you know,

03:16:15.750 --> 03:16:21.000
are closely considering these
questions I think has really done a

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:22.790
good job.

03:16:22.790 --> 03:16:25.660
We're teetering of the brink
of potentially being, you know,

03:16:25.660 --> 03:16:29.800
overwhelmed of suddenly we
had an influx of new projects

03:16:29.800 --> 03:16:32.190
and we brought in 600
some interviews last year,

03:16:32.190 --> 03:16:35.740
which is about five or
600 is now our average.

03:16:35.740 --> 03:16:40.230
And much more than that
would push us to the point

03:16:40.230 --> 03:16:43.300
where I would need far more
staffing to be able to have

03:16:43.300 --> 03:16:51.940
that closely curated hands on,
really conscientious approach,

03:16:51.940 --> 03:16:54.760
which I think is worth
retaining for sure.

03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:57.460
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Well so that
leads me to a question about your,

03:16:57.460 --> 03:17:01.100
the future plans for
OHMS and how you're going

03:17:01.100 --> 03:17:03.840
to keep it sustainable
and make is sustainable?

03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:05.930
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Well, I mean,
that's really popular,

03:17:05.930 --> 03:17:10.050
so I'm really excited about that,
but, you know, but that's the key,

03:17:10.050 --> 03:17:13.290
it needs to be more about--
not about us, and so,

03:17:13.290 --> 03:17:15.690
we're creating kind of a Jedi
council, I don't know what

03:17:15.690 --> 03:17:19.600
to call it yet, so I'm calling
it that, of institutions

03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:24.580
who have bought into it big, Yale,
University of Georgia has really

03:17:24.580 --> 03:17:27.960
into it big time, Brooklyn
Historical is into it.

03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:31.000
But really basically
creating a group of,

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:34.610
a consortial group that's going
to decide and drive development.

03:17:34.610 --> 03:17:37.980
You know, we went ahead
and made it bilingual.

03:17:37.980 --> 03:17:41.350
I think there's a-- I'm
taking ideas right now,

03:17:41.350 --> 03:17:43.000
because I'm reaching the
point where it's time

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:46.020
to apply for another grant.

03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:48.470
And I think-- and I'm doing--

03:17:48.470 --> 03:17:50.870
I'm kicking around the idea
of actually having it--

03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:54.030
having, you know, and I think this
comes from my visit with Kevin

03:17:54.030 --> 03:17:55.500
and talking about-- Kevin Bradley,

03:17:55.500 --> 03:17:57.750
you're going to talk
here from this afternoon.

03:17:57.750 --> 03:18:02.630
We're really having a desktop
presence, you know, that's local,

03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:05.450
that's not-- doesn't
require media to be streaming

03:18:05.450 --> 03:18:09.390
so that people can index restricted
material and feel safe about it.

03:18:09.390 --> 03:18:12.840
But also have the interviewers,
and this is me always thinking

03:18:12.840 --> 03:18:14.450
about workflow and efficiency.

03:18:14.450 --> 03:18:15.870
If I can have interviewers

03:18:15.870 --> 03:18:20.630
who are indexing material offline
before it even comes to the archive

03:18:20.630 --> 03:18:23.530
and I'm accessioning material.

03:18:23.530 --> 03:18:27.120
It has this level of structured
metadata, that's a dream.

03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:28.420
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Yeah.

03:18:28.420 --> 03:18:31.120
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: So, that's kind
of where I'm leaning right now.

03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:32.420
&gt;&gt; Nicole Saylor: Cool.

03:18:32.420 --> 03:18:33.720
All right.

03:18:33.720 --> 03:18:36.510
We have time for just
a couple of questions.

03:18:36.510 --> 03:18:40.610
[ Inaudible Remarks ]

03:18:40.610 --> 03:18:43.570
&gt;&gt; Alan: No, I can talk softly.

03:18:43.570 --> 03:18:46.710
Could you just talk through exactly

03:18:46.710 --> 03:18:50.480
like if I give you a
tape, what would you do?

03:18:50.480 --> 03:18:52.440
What you-- Is there a--
Do you use Dragon Speak

03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:54.490 position:56%
or something to recognize the words?

03:18:54.490 --> 03:18:55.790
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Right.

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:57.750
So we're not actively formally
using speech recognition.

03:18:57.750 --> 03:19:01.670
First, we digitize the tape, in
accordance with best practices

03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:03.550
and we'd accession that tape.

03:19:03.550 --> 03:19:07.110 position:56%
But at that point, let's say you
just had a name written on that tape

03:19:07.110 --> 03:19:08.410
and we didn't know
anything about it.

03:19:08.410 --> 03:19:11.300
Maybe we knew it was part of a
civil rights project, that's it.

03:19:11.300 --> 03:19:12.600
That's all we know.

03:19:12.600 --> 03:19:17.440
So, at that point, we'd-- you know,
if it fell into the queue of things

03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:20.500
that we were going to put
online, it would go there

03:19:20.500 --> 03:19:22.050
and we would index that interview.

03:19:22.050 --> 03:19:23.480
So somebody would listen
to that interview,

03:19:23.480 --> 03:19:25.740
and while they're listening to that
interview, they would be typing

03:19:25.740 --> 03:19:27.580
and they would be tagging
those moments.

03:19:27.580 --> 03:19:32.000
This is a major subject
transition tag and start typing,

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:34.910
and then rather than transcribe,
because we really don't know what's

03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:38.410
in there and I can't afford to
transcribe everything we bring in.

03:19:38.410 --> 03:19:42.260
And so at that point, we get a good
sense for what's in that interview,

03:19:42.260 --> 03:19:44.570
then we'd make the-- then we'd
actually write the description

03:19:44.570 --> 03:19:46.950
of the interview because
now we know what it's about.

03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:50.400
And then we'd actually make that
decision, do we press the button

03:19:50.400 --> 03:19:54.790
and make it go live to the
internet or not at that point.

03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:59.140
It's a good question.

03:20:00.440 --> 03:20:04.010
&gt;&gt; Let me ask about
a parallel activity

03:20:04.010 --> 03:20:05.550
and have you talk a little bit

03:20:05.550 --> 03:20:08.680
about what synergies
there may or may not be.

03:20:08.680 --> 03:20:13.370
In broadcasting as you may
know, there is now partly due

03:20:13.370 --> 03:20:15.950
to the Federal Communications
Commission rule making,

03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:18.090
a push towards what's
called time text.

03:20:18.090 --> 03:20:19.390
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Yeah.

03:20:19.390 --> 03:20:21.110
&gt;&gt; And as people put
their broadcast online.

03:20:21.110 --> 03:20:26.420
Time text is essentially text with
markup language and that, you know,

03:20:26.420 --> 03:20:27.790
tells you what the timing is.

03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:34.360
It's a standard that came from the
W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium

03:20:34.360 --> 03:20:36.620
and then it was further
standardized by [inaudible]

03:20:36.620 --> 03:20:39.700
in the United States
and EBU in Europe.

03:20:39.700 --> 03:20:42.090
So, it's a way that will now come

03:20:42.090 --> 03:20:46.670
in to the way broadcasts
are synchronized.

03:20:46.670 --> 03:20:52.370 position:56%
Is there anything about that that
is helpful to you or vice versa or--

03:20:52.370 --> 03:20:53.670
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Absolutely.

03:20:53.670 --> 03:20:54.970
I mean, one of my--

03:20:54.970 --> 03:20:56.270
&gt;&gt; Talk about that a little bit.

03:20:56.270 --> 03:20:57.570
That would be great.

03:20:57.570 --> 03:20:58.870
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: First I want to
say you're only just a slightly--

03:20:58.870 --> 03:21:00.630
you're only slightly
less intimidating now

03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:03.120
that you're retired.

03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:05.580
So, so so.

03:21:05.580 --> 03:21:10.600
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] but he's
still intimidating.

03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:11.900
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Right.

03:21:11.900 --> 03:21:14.510 position:56%
I think when we first started on the
OHMS journey, it really bugged me

03:21:14.510 --> 03:21:16.690
that there wasn't a good
reference point for that.

03:21:16.690 --> 03:21:19.850
And now that we're
pretty far into it,

03:21:19.850 --> 03:21:25.200
one of my obsessions is how can we
connect it to a greater standard

03:21:25.200 --> 03:21:27.010
with regard to time and text.

03:21:27.010 --> 03:21:29.920
And so that's definitely
something over the first year,

03:21:29.920 --> 03:21:35.120
that's one of the first mandates
really of the Jedi council,

03:21:35.120 --> 03:21:37.070
you know, the people
who we've put together.

03:21:37.070 --> 03:21:40.600
I shouldn't keep-- I shouldn't
have said that publicly, sorry.

03:21:40.600 --> 03:21:44.340
But basically, the group, that's
one of the top priorities,

03:21:44.340 --> 03:21:48.900
is how can we take this now and
fit it better into standards

03:21:48.900 --> 03:21:51.700
that are starting to
emerge and that's the one

03:21:51.700 --> 03:21:53.430
that everybody is talking
about really.

03:21:53.430 --> 03:21:54.730
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

03:21:54.730 --> 03:21:56.500
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: At least in my circle
that we're all talking about.

03:21:56.500 --> 03:22:00.130
&gt;&gt; Well [inaudible]
is great because each

03:22:00.130 --> 03:22:02.380
of those would reinforce
each other and so on

03:22:02.380 --> 03:22:05.310
and you'd get a broader
adoption and so on.

03:22:05.310 --> 03:22:08.510
I mean, it's what we dream
of when we talk of standards.

03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:10.080
Too often, it doesn't work.

03:22:10.080 --> 03:22:11.390
But sometimes it does.

03:22:11.390 --> 03:22:12.690
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: Right.

03:22:12.690 --> 03:22:14.820
Hashtag motion jpeg 2000.

03:22:14.820 --> 03:22:17.210
We've got to get that one too.

03:22:17.210 --> 03:22:19.950
But I think if we can really--

03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:23.400
and I really am not a fan
of reinventing the wheel.

03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:25.420
You know, and that's
one of my frustrations

03:22:25.420 --> 03:22:28.310
with digital humanities is this
impulse to create something nifty

03:22:28.310 --> 03:22:31.060 position:56%
and cool but again, not sustainable,

03:22:31.060 --> 03:22:34.530
not something that has
necessarily broad appeal.

03:22:34.530 --> 03:22:37.520
And so, we really have to I
think work together and rather

03:22:37.520 --> 03:22:39.930
than reinvent the wheel,
really start to connect.

03:22:39.930 --> 03:22:44.060
So, that's right in line with
where we're going with that.

03:22:44.060 --> 03:22:46.070
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask you.

03:22:46.070 --> 03:22:47.660
This may be a little tangential,

03:22:47.660 --> 03:22:51.180
but a lot of cultural heritage
archives are using crowd sourcing

03:22:51.180 --> 03:22:54.240
in order to do transcriptions, and
I see that with natural history,

03:22:54.240 --> 03:22:59.170
I see that with cultural materials,
see that with sociological stuff

03:22:59.170 --> 03:23:02.850
but what is your experience or
do you think there's a future

03:23:02.850 --> 03:23:07.550 position:56%
for crowd sourcing in audio recorded
interviews or oral histories?

03:23:07.550 --> 03:23:10.560
&gt;&gt; Doug Boyd: I think
particular early history is

03:23:10.560 --> 03:23:12.280
where I have an opinion.

03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:16.620 position:56%
And that-- a strong opinion, and
that's really a lot of our material,

03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:20.390
if it's going to be transcribed,
we don't know what's in it.

03:23:20.390 --> 03:23:25.830
And I have an-- a real discomfort
necessarily turning what I don't

03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:28.820
know is in there out to a crowd.

03:23:28.820 --> 03:23:32.140
Also, I have a discomfort opening
up the way my collection is going

03:23:32.140 --> 03:23:35.010
to be described to people
who actually are commenting

03:23:35.010 --> 03:23:38.040
on news stories about the
presidential election this year.

03:23:38.040 --> 03:23:40.840
You know, I mean anybody, just
opening it up and saying, you know,

03:23:40.840 --> 03:23:44.640
another certain ways we can
actually vet that automatically,

03:23:44.640 --> 03:23:45.970 position:56%
but there are certain ways we can't.

03:23:45.970 --> 03:23:50.880
And so, I'm a little nervous about
just opening the doors to that.

03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:54.650
And so, I'd rather have sort
of a curated form of that.

03:23:54.650 --> 03:24:00.190
Also, you need the crowd and
transcription is not a fun act.

03:24:00.190 --> 03:24:04.940 position:56%
No matter how you video game the
experience, I think, you either need

03:24:04.940 --> 03:24:10.370
to make it so partial that
it's not a big deal and so it's

03:24:10.370 --> 03:24:14.630
like the CAPTCHAs with
the home addresses.

03:24:14.630 --> 03:24:18.430
You know, or you need a
crowd that's just so massive.

03:24:18.430 --> 03:24:21.100
And so, I don't have that crowd.

03:24:21.100 --> 03:24:24.550
I can get-- I can walk into a room

03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:26.860
and get people excited
about indexing.

03:24:26.860 --> 03:24:28.160
Because it's actually fun.

03:24:28.160 --> 03:24:30.850 position:56%
It's actually engaging and that's
why we're getting all these students

03:24:30.850 --> 03:24:33.850
doing it in classrooms,
we're starting to experiment

03:24:33.850 --> 03:24:36.120
with volunteer groups
who are stakeholders

03:24:36.120 --> 03:24:39.330
in a particular project, who are
going to actually play a role

03:24:39.330 --> 03:24:41.760
on how this project gets
represented publicly.

03:24:41.760 --> 03:24:44.410
But to just sort of
open the doors wide,

03:24:44.410 --> 03:24:47.890 position:56%
it's not really what I'm leaning
towards right now because the nature

03:24:47.890 --> 03:24:50.480
of our oral and history
collection and because it's sort

03:24:50.480 --> 03:24:54.580
of the trust arrangement
we have with the people

03:24:54.580 --> 03:24:56.370
who were interviewed originally.

03:24:56.370 --> 03:25:00.280
Or a trust relationship
that the interviewer had

03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:01.990
but then gave the collection
to an archive

03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:03.350
that doesn't have that
trust relationship.

03:25:03.350 --> 03:25:09.010
So we're trying to be good
stewards of this process on my end.

03:25:09.010 --> 03:25:10.870
Someone's going to
take OHMS and do that.

03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:12.920
They're just going to open up
the doors and turn it again

03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:15.200
into a true sort of crowd
sourcing platform and I think

03:25:15.200 --> 03:25:16.750
that will work pretty cool.

03:25:16.750 --> 03:25:19.300
But, you know, I like
what NYPL has done

03:25:19.300 --> 03:25:21.810
with their transcription
tool for sure.

03:25:21.810 --> 03:25:24.310
I think if you haven't messed
with it, it's super cool.

03:25:24.310 --> 03:25:26.390
And we're over time--

03:25:26.390 --> 03:25:27.690

03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:31.590
So we'll leave it there.
