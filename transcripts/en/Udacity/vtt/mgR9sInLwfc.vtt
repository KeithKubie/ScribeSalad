Our students have all the knowledge they need to build a search engine,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but what are they missing?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, a few thousand of these.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're standing in front of the Google server rack.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is a web server, but it's using Ethernet to connect these different boards,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which are actually separate computers that they've put together in a rack.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
These are just generic PCs, because you can run a search engine at home on one computer,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but it's not going to have a very big index.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
How many are we talking about--10s?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Many, many, many thousand.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Google was not a particularly well-known one it its early years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Most of these search engines--today we think of them as being incredibly wealthy companies.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
At the time they were mostly losing money.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
They had venture capitalists put money in but they

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
basically didn't make enough money from selling ads to pay their bills.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Search engines actually go back before the web.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
On the Internet there were several search engines.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The closest to what we have today might be WAIS, done in the late '80s,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and that let you search different servers over the Internet.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Then we have, for instance, the CERN Virtual Library,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which was done by Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Web,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but that wasn't really like a modern search engine.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It was more like a library cart catalog where you have categories.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Early Yahoo was like that as well.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The one that got the most recognition was Alta Vista,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and this was kind of like the Google of its day in the late '90s.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
One that was a little bit different was Ask Jeeves,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which was a search engine, but it was also meant to be a natural language query.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You could say, "What's the capital of Spain," and it would give you the answer.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Google borrowed an idea from a little search engine called GoTo.com,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which was to not just have ads but to sell the search terms themselves.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So like when you go to Google now, and you see the "sponsored results,"

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
those are actual terms related to what you're searching for, but they're also ads.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That just took off. People really responded to that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That actually brought the entire search industry

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
from on its way down to being one of the most profitable parts of web commerce.
