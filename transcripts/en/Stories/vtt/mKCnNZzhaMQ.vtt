00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.370
LAURA LING: Dr. Tiffany
Anderson, superintendent

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.570
of the Jennings School
District, begins her morning

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.620
with a four-hour
commute to work,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.300
after which she can be
found, sneakers and all, out

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.000
on crossing guard duty.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.790
Anderson oversees seven schools,
3,000 students, and hundreds

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.110
of teachers and staff.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.010
But there's no job she won't do.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.220
TIFFANY ANDERSON: I bring
hot chocolate, coats.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460
I'm the first face
they see before they

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.860
walk through the door.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.380
LAURA LING: Jennings is a
town of 15,000 people just

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.190
outside St. Louis, Missouri.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.630
It borders Ferguson, which
was the center of protests

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810
following the shooting of
an unarmed black teenager

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.820
by a white police
officer in 2014.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910
Like Ferguson, Jennings
has a population

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.770
of mostly African
Americans, 1/4 of whom

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.290
live below the poverty line.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.880
LAURA LING: What was the school
district like when you first

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.890
arrived?

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.290
TIFFANY ANDERSON: Four years
ago, Jennings didn't really

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.280
feel like a community
that had hope.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.860
Almost every month,
I am attending

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.850
a funeral of either a current
student or a student's parent.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.930
And often those are
victims of crime.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.380
We have two students at one
of our elementary schools

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.810
where they literally had
to crawl out of the window

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.980
as their mother
was being stabbed.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.720
Things that we can't imagine.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.330
LAURA LING:
17-year-old Gabby Scott

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.972
is a junior at
Jennings High School.

00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:29.394
How old were you when you
found out you were pregnant?

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:30.060
GABBY SCOTT: 15.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.860
That was rough.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.900
LAURA LING: Did you cry?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.691
GABBY SCOTT: I did.

00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:34.460
A lot.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.162
So much I probably don't
even have tears left.

00:01:37.162 --> 00:01:39.620
LAURA LING: Just a few years
ago, many students in Jennings

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.850
were in danger of
not graduating.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.910
Dropping out was not
an unusual occurrence.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.520
Did you think about how
am I going to go to school

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.005
and have this baby?

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:51.546
GABBY SCOTT: That
was the first thing

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:53.682
that was brought to my mind.

00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:56.658
I don't think I'm going
to be able to go to school

00:01:56.658 --> 00:01:58.642
and be pregnant.

00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:01.770
LAURA LING: Do you think that
people had written this school

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.420
district off?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.160
TIFFANY ANDERSON: I
think in many ways.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.110
Because Jennings
has so much poverty,

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.937
people really weren't sure
if improvement was possible.

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:15.520
LAURA LING: With
grants, partnerships,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.610
and some creativity, Dr.
Anderson balanced the budget,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.970
launched a college prep
program, and brought back

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.380
arts education.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.410
She also began to
address issues that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.740
stemmed far beyond academics.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.200
TIFFANY ANDERSON: I learned that
food was the greatest issue,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.870
so we decided we would
open a food pantry.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.090
We give out 8,000
pounds of food a month.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.680
Approximately 200 to 400
people every two weeks

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.270
get food from Jennings.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.840
And then we looked
at health care.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.750
We have about two to three
mental health therapists

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.210
at every school.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.690
Washington University,
they agreed to partner,

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.562
and they provide a pediatrician.

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:53.520
So look, you break an
arm, just come to school.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.075
We got it.

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.450
LAURA LING: This is a place
where parents can come and do

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.730
their laundry for
free in exchange

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.034
for volunteering an hour
of their time at school.

00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.200
And it's pretty incredible,
when you think about it,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.820
because it's such a simple
way to get parents involved,

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.238
while at the same time
addressing the very real needs

00:03:10.238 --> 00:03:11.654
of many if these families.

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:13.862
TIFFANY ANDERSON: We generally
say, if all you can do

00:03:13.862 --> 00:03:17.010
is make it to school, we'll
take care of the rest.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.950
Food, clothes,
shoes, health care.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.647
LAURA LING: What
kind of changes did

00:03:20.647 --> 00:03:22.587
you start to see
in your students

00:03:22.587 --> 00:03:24.770
when you started to
remove those barriers?

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.180
TIFFANY ANDERSON: So when
kids knew that we cared,

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.207
there was almost like
this light bulb went off.

00:03:30.207 --> 00:03:31.490
This willingness to try.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.010
And we are now fully accredited.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.130
Four years ago we were
meeting 57% of the standards.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.902
We're now meeting 81%.

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:40.610
We've been exceeding
the state benchmarks

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.128
for two consecutive years.

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:47.380
LAURA LING: Dr. Anderson
also introduced a program

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.410
to support teen moms
like Gabby, as well

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.870
as parents in the community.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.950
It allowed Gabby to
stay focused on school

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.800
while raising her son Carter.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.112
On top of having a baby, you
are a straight-A student, right?

00:03:59.112 --> 00:03:59.820
GABBY SCOTT: Yes.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.452
LAURA LING: And you are
going to be class president.

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:03.160
GABBY SCOTT: Yes.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.110
And you're on your way
to being valedictorian.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.990
GABBY SCOTT: Yes.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.090
LAURA LING: How are you doing
this all and managing it all?

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.800
GABBY SCOTT: I have teachers
who are willing to work

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.840
with me and my time management.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.056
Carter comes with me to
my student council events.

00:04:19.056 --> 00:04:22.460
LAURA LING: If you were pregnant
before all of these programs

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.130
were introduced,
before Dr. Anderson,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.510
what do you think your
life would be like?

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.760
GABBY SCOTT: Probably would
have given up a long time ago.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.780
But with the support of
Jennings and their programs,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:36.860
it's been easier.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.700
We are all passing our tests,
willing to come to school.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.230
It's making us more
excited to be here.

00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:52.050
LAURA LING: This community
borders Ferguson,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.520
which has seen a lot of unrest.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.460
This is a critical
time in our country.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.860
Has that brought greater urgency
to the work that you do here?

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.360
TIFFANY ANDERSON:
I believe our role

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.598
is to show people that there
is a system of oppression,

00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:09.639
and to gain the greatest
amount of education they can

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.580
so that they have the
power to make changes.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.905
LAURA LING: Can this work be
replicated in many places?

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.988
TIFFANY ANDERSON: This
work we've done in Jennings

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:21.930
can happen anywhere, in any size
district, and in any community.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.174
Zip codes should not
determine the quality

00:05:24.174 --> 00:05:26.259
of education or health care.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.070
And we will not allow for that
to determine where kids end up.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:52.270
LAURA LING: To see how
this young woman conquered

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.201
incredible odds to become
a Gates Millennial Scholar,

00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:57.131
watch this next video.

00:05:57.131 --> 00:06:00.077
SUBJECT: Outside of my
house, it was a lot of gangs.

00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:03.514
And my sister was always
involved with them.

00:06:03.514 --> 00:06:06.951
I saw so many graphic things
that she went through.

00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:10.870
LAURA LING: Did you ever
think about joining a gang?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.370
SUBJECT: No.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.352
It made me more focused.

00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:13.840
I was always the
nerd of the family.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.280
LAURA LING: Please don't

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.113
