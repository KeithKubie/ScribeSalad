let's<00:12:43.290><c> assume</c><00:12:44.360><c> yeah</c><00:12:45.360><c> she's</c><00:12:45.870><c> gonna</c><00:12:46.020><c> be</c><00:12:46.110><c> trying</c>

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
let's assume yeah she's gonna be trying
 

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.010 align:start position:0%
let's assume yeah she's gonna be trying
to<00:12:46.649><c> bring</c><00:12:46.800><c> it</c><00:12:46.920><c> back</c><00:12:47.040><c> to</c><00:12:47.190><c> life</c>

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.020 align:start position:0%
to bring it back to life
 

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.269 align:start position:0%
to bring it back to life
and<00:12:49.020><c> then</c><00:12:49.230><c> maybe</c><00:12:49.380><c> we</c><00:12:49.500><c> won't</c><00:12:49.680><c> eat</c><00:12:49.829><c> these</c><00:12:50.010><c> snacks</c>

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
and then maybe we won't eat these snacks
 

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.650 align:start position:0%
and then maybe we won't eat these snacks
and<00:12:50.490><c> I</c><00:12:50.579><c> think</c><00:12:50.790><c> about</c><00:12:50.880><c> a</c><00:12:51.029><c> lot</c><00:12:51.360><c> of</c><00:12:51.420><c> them</c><00:12:51.510><c> have</c>
