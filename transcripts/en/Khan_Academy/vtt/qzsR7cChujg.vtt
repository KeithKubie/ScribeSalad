00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.600
- [Instructor] We have the
proportion x minus nine over 12

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.180
is equal to two over three,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.790
and we wanna solve for the x
that satisfies this proportion.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.640
Now, there's a bunch of
ways that you could do it.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.870
A lot of people, as soon as
they see a proportion like this,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.100
they wanna cross-multiply.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.470
They wanna say, hey,
three times x minus nine

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.320
is going to be equal to two times 12.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.680
And that's completely legitimate.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.000
You would get, let me write that down.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.330
So three times x minus nine,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.040
three times x minus nine
is equal to two times 12.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.810
So it would be equal to two times 12.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.450
And then you can distribute the three.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.090
You'd get three x minus 27

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.340
is equal to 24.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.480
And then you could add 27 to both sides,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.100
and you would get, let
me actually do that.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.440
So let me add 27 to both sides,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.680
and we are left with

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.050
three x is equal to,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.510
is equal to, let's see, 51.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.030
And then x would be equal to 17.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.490
X would be equal to 17.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.130
And you can verify that this works.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.060
17 minus nine is eight.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.520
8/12 is the same thing as 2/3.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.260
So this checks out.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.290
Another way you could do that,

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.000
instead of just straight up
doing the cross-multiplication,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.680
you could say look, I
wanna get rid of this 12

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.870
in the denominator right over here,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.680
let's multiply both sides by 12.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.900
So if you multiply both sides by 12,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.370
on your left-hand side, you are
just left with x minus nine.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.830
And on your right-hand side, 2/3 times 12,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.880
well, 2/3 of 12 is just eight.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.500
And you could do the
actual multiplication,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.020
2/3 times 12 over one.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.390
12,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.680
12 and three, so 12
divided by three is four.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.430
Three divided by three is one.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.380
So it becomes two times four
over one, which is just eight.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.890
And then you add nine to both sides.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.550
So the fun of algebra is that
as long as you do something

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.610
that's logically consistent,
you will get the right answer.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.410
There's no one way of doing it.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.630
So here you get x is equal to 17 again.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.562
And you can also, you can
multiply both sides by 12

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:07.560
and both sides by three,
and then that would be

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070
functionally equivalent
to cross-multiplying.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.900
Let's do one more.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.500
So here, another proportion,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.050
and this time the x is in the denominator.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.200
But just like before, if we
want, we can cross-multiply.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.450
And just to see where
cross-multiplying comes from,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.480
that it's not some voodoo,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.910
that you still are doing logical algebra,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.910
that you're doing the same thing

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.960
to both sides of the equation,
you just need to appreciate

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.870
that we're just multiplying
both sides by both denominators.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.340
So we have this eight right
over here on the left-hand side.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.900
If we wanna get rid of this eight

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.500
on the left-hand side in the denominator,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.900
we can multiply the
left-hand side by eight.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.500
But in order for the
equality to hold true,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.150
I can't do something to just one side.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.780
I have to do it to both sides.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.763
Similarly, similar-larly, if (laughs) I,

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:54.960
if I wanna get this x plus
one out of the denominator,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.620
I could multiply by x
plus one right over here.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.220
But I have to do that on both sides

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.250
if I want my equality to hold true.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.550
And notice, when you do what we just did,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.410
this is going to be equivalent
to cross-multiplying.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.860
Because these eights cancel out,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.680
and this x plus one cancels

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.940
with that x plus one right over there.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.730
And you are left with,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.670
you are left with x plus one,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.410
x plus one times seven,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.410
and I could write it as
seven times x plus one,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.040
is equal to five times eight,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
is equal to five times eight.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.700
Notice, this is exactly what you have done

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.400
if you would've cross-multiplied.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.440
Cross-multiplication is just a shortcut

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.280
of multiplying both sides
by both the denominators.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.600
We have seven times x plus one
is equal to five times eight.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.230
And now we can go and solve the algebra.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.620
So distributing the seven,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.350
we get seven x plus seven

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.330
is equal to 40.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.940
And then subtracting
seven from both sides,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.910
so let's subtract seven from both sides,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.690
we are left with seven x

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.330
is equal to 33.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.800
Dividing both sides by seven,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.100
we are left with x is
equal to 33 over seven.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.960
And if we wanna write
that as a mixed number,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.160
this is the same thing, let's see,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.993
this is the same thing as 4 5/7,

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:21.863
And we're done.
