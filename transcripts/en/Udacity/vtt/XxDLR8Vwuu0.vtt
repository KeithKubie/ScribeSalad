00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.830
So, I started small with
theft tools open, so

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.770
I'd get the resolution,
and I pulled the page out.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.189
All right, that's about 680 pixels, and

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.460
I think this still looks good, so
let's make it a little bit larger.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.280
Here I am at about 815 pixels.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.260
Still, I think that looks good.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.470
I think I can go larger.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.720
Okay, now I'm at 1130.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.960
Okay, this is definitely
way too large for here.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.840
Let's pull it back in a little bit.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.920
Around 850 pixels or so, I think
I'm about at my limit for how wide,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.102
I want this image to be, and for how
far apart I want these elements to be.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.982
So, for my answer I put 850 pixels, but

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:41.108
really like I said this
is an art not a science.

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:44.680
So if you didn't get the same
answer as me that's totally fine.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.590
This isn't the right answer but,
you know, it's what I think.
