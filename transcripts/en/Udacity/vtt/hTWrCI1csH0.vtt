00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.630
The next assignment takes the deep
networks that you've trained so

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.000
far and
turns them into convolutional nets.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.010
There are lots of architectures
that you could try on this problem,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.910
including inception.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.240
Note though that this is
where GPUs begin to shine.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.858
Convnets take a lot of compute.

00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:20.320
Well, the code in the assignment
should run fine on CPU,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.120
and that's all you really need
to complete the assignment.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.653
Doing a lot of exploration might not be
practical, unless you have a big GPU,

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.418
and modify the code to use it.
