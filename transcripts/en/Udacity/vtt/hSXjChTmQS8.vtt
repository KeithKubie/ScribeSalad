00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:05.177
To make things come full circle, let's go back to the first composite function we worked with in this lesson.

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:12.984
We started out with two equations: R(N)=15N and N(d)=4√d

00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:18.799
This first one shows the amount of money that Grant brings in depending how many glasses wiper sets he sells,

00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:25.998
and this second one shows how the number of wiper sets sold depends on the amount of money Grant spends on advertising.

00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:29.464
So what is R(N) composed with N(d)?

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:31.236
or (R·N)(d)?

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:33.267
Please write the expression right here.
