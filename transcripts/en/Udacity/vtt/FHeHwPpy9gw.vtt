00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.010
In the previous section,

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.620
we saw that rates compare two
quantities with different units.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.898
For example, 25 miles per gallon,

00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:15.200
$0.23 per ounce, or 0.7 hits per at-bat.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.230
These are all rates.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.650
But what if we want to compare two
quantities with the same units.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.600
Then we don't want rates.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.780
What we actually want
are called ratios and

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.549
they're very similar to rates but
the two quantities have the same unit.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.940
For example, let's say a TV
commercial says something like

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.370
three out of five dentists
recommend Toothtaste.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.690
Which of course is
the flavorful toothpaste.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.460
This is a ratio because what we're
actually saying when we say three out of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.680
five dentists, is three dentists out of
five dentists prefer this toothpaste.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.400
It compares dentist to dentist.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.840
Can you identify the following
examples as rates, ratios, or neither?

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.970
Eight out of ten cats prefer Whiskas,
gas costs $4.25 per gallon, out

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.280
of 500 graduates, 200 got business jobs,
and the Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.630
In each of these boxes,
enter either rate, ratio, or neither.
