00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.800
Hello, everybody. Thank you for being here.
I'm Meg Lota Brown. I'm the director of

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.160
the Graduate Center here at the
University. So welcome to this wonderful

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.160
resource which is John Singer, and we're
very fortunate to have him here. He's

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.559
He's the author of "Resume DNA: Succeeding
in Spite of Yourself," and he's also the

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.270
CEO of Professional Development
Strategies which is a Tucson based

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.190
company that equips clients with the
necessary tools to communicate their

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.679
strengths, and build and establish
professional networks, and secure

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.539
positions, get employed. He's a certified
professional resume writer and a career

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.739
coach with many years of experience, and
he's mentored professionals to identify

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.030
their unique skills and talents and
transition into meaningful and rewarding

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.120
careers. So he sounds like just the
person that we need. He's also worked as

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.120
a television writer and a member of the
Writers Guild of America, and he was

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.930
educated in business and marketing both
here at the U of A and at UCLA. In

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.280
addition to his own work as a writer, he
has a background in broadcasting

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.470
industry as a station owner and operator
and radio personality. So we're very

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.880
fortunate to have John here. Many of you
were here last week when he spoke to us

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.120
about, more specifically about resumes
and CVs, and today as you can see he's

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.180
speaking to us about strategic
interviewing and negotiating and

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:56.930
networking techniques. So please join me
in thanking John singer. [Audience applause]

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.460
Thank you, Dr. Brown and and thank you
and Dr. Hoit and David Bradshaw for

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.039
organizing this special event to help
people with career transition advice.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.849
It's a very special accomplished group
of people. The TMAY, tell me about

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.130
yourself. It's the opening statement in
an interview. It's important to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.549
immediately brand yourself as a
professional and show how your skills

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.769
and experience can solve the problems
within an organization. This allows you

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.730
to create an agenda of what you will be
talking about throughout the entire

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.010
interview. The TMAY empowers you to
control the interview from the onset and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.769
should be delivered in about 60 seconds
or less.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.660
This is that awkward moment in the
interview when they ask you to tell me

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.360
about yourself. When this request is made you need to be

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.700
able to present your unique skillset
without delay. I recently had a client

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.010
tell me that his first question was
would you like something to drink and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.440
his answer was, "No, thank you. I had a beer on my drive over." Uh, that didn't go over

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.739
very well. He didn't really know his
audience. We all know the elevator speech.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.950
It's used when you run into the decision
maker on the elevator and you have less

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.239
than 60 seconds to tell your story.
Most people freeze when they're asked

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.100
this question, "well, I like long walks on
the beach, pretty sunsets, and golden

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.139
retrievers." They just don't know how to
position themselves professionally. It's

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.500
difficult to talk about yourself at a
moment's notice, but you don't want to

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.200
miss a good opportunity. Several years
ago, our company had the bright idea of

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.319
creating videos of our clients to share
online. I instructed clients on how to

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.060
write a 60 second script, approximately
100 words, with a structured beginning

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.400
middle, and end. The opening included a
branding statement defining the level of

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.630
the professional, the middle section
communicated how the client does their

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.069
job, and the powerful close expressed
what the client could do for the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.370
employer's company. This video was
actually a

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.830
verbal version of the profile that they
had on their resume document. Clients

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.320
rehearsed their scripts in front of
mirrors so they could see how they

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.669
appeared when they performed. They used
tape recorders to hear their energy and

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.919
enthusiasm or lack thereof in their
voices. We would set a cue card up by the

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.100
camera. When the clients read their lines
it appeared as if they were speaking

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.680
off-the-cuff, 
looking deep into the eyes of their

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.300
audience. It was a good marketing tool.
The client could direct the potential

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.250
employer to a link with a brief profile
and a full resume in a little video box,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.570
at that time it was about the size of a
business card, that played the client's

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.440
commercial. That's why we call it their
commercial. The videos were pretty simple.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.669
The client was standing
in front of a white wall, the sound was

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.990
very tinny, their eyes were bouncing
around like pin balls. This is when

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.789
LinkedIn was in its infancy, but the
commercial, like LinkedIn, created an

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:08.160
online presence for the client. Well, the
idea started to take off and we quickly

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.900
improved the production value of the
videos. We would open with upbeat music

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.120
and an animated graphic with the client's
name filling the screen, fade in on the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.510
client dressed to the nines and nestled
in a stylish business office with a

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.750
music bed
humming underneath as they read from a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.770
teleprompter. As the client mentioned her
skill sets, bullet points would magically

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.380
appear over her shoulder showing her
impressive core competencies. Powerful

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.590
closing statement,
cut to animated graphic, music up and

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.150
under, fade to black.There you had it: the
60-second commercial. Well, these were

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:49.080
quite popular back then. HR managers and
C-level execs loved the new concept. They could

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.750
look beyond the paper resume and
actually see personality and credibility.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.740
They were motivated to meet the
applicant for an interview. Then YouTube

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.180
became very popular. Everybody and his
brother and sister were creating video

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.639
resumes. HR departments were inundated
with these moving pictures and online

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.160
links, so the fad faded quickly. There
were actually lawsuits filed against

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.528
companies in which applicants claim that
they were rejected due to their videos.

00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:24.360
You don't like the color of my
tie or my skin or my age.  This is when we

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.830
pulled the plug on this monster we had
created, but I always learned something

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.449
from all or most of my clients. I learned
a valuable lesson when we patiently

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.460
produced all of these commercials. Most
clients were a little clumsy in front of

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.699
the camera.
Some would stare at the lens speechless

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:45.180
with the glazed look in their eyes, their
only goal was to get through this

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:51.479
agonizing video without stammering
stumbling or embarrassing themselves. So

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:56.550
what did I learn from this? Well, when you
have a goal of successfully moving from

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.030
point A, which in this case was the
opening of the commercial, and reaching

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.919
point B, the close, everything in
between is incidental. The client had

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:09.750
already organized their thoughts and
written them in a script. We had edited

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.110
the script and they
became familiar with the structured

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.280
beginning branding statement, middle
accomplishments, and the end their

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.220
powerful close, which were all
customized for the job opportunity. When

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.000
they prepared this video presentation,
they really mastered the format and

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.600
delivery of an opening statement and now
they could do it at any time and in the

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.970
interview. Most job applicants fail to
take advantage of this perfect

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.770
opportunity to make a great first
impression. Out of nervousness, they may

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.289
talk excessively and reveal personal
information, which can be damaging/

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:50.760
Interviews are performances. Performances
must be practiced. You are being judged

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.789
the minute you open your mouth. Like it
or not, you are performing. And what's the

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:02.669
first rule of show business? Know your
audience. Be sure to address their needs,

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:08.550
find their pain, and show them how you
can solve their problems. Everything that

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:15.510
you share should be relevant to the job
and the company. When one of my clients

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.590
delivers their commercial in an
interview the interviewers jaw usually

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.120
drops. They're not used to this - that's a
good thing.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.580
The interviewer is delighted to hear a
structured statement that is

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.659
personalized to the company and the
position. The applicant has immediately

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:33.570
established a rapport and created an
agenda

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.399
of what they will discuss throughout the
interview. They have taken control in the

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:43.380
first minute of conversation. They can
now expand on the skills and talents

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.889
that they advertise in their opening
statement, and can easily refer back to

00:08:46.889 --> 00:08:51.609
these accomplishments that they
strategically inserted in the TMAY.

00:08:53.569 --> 00:08:59.399
I put my clients through a process. It
starts with a formal script. The content

00:08:59.399 --> 00:09:03.990
is structured and organized and includes
a power close. It's important to have a

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.990
definitive close. Wrap up the TMAY
with what you can offer the organization.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.720
Most applicants end their opening
statements with selfish pitches, "I'm

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.519
seeking an upper-level management
position in operations where I can grow

00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:24.449
within the company and take the
organization to greater heights." That's

00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:29.310
self centered. It's better to close with
what you can bring to the company, not

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.339
what you want for yourself. Better
example, "With my PMP certification,

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:38.639
expertise in lean manufacturing, and
application of Six Sigma principles, I

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:44.310
will increase productivity and profits
for a progressive organization."

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.910
That's much better.
Another important reason for the power

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.760
close, is to show that you've finished
talking.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:56.100
You're now turning the interview over to
the interviewer. I then have the client

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.829
read the script to me word-for-word.
They sound scripted, awkward, over-rehearsed,

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:06.029
but they're familiarizing themselves
with the structured beginning, the

00:10:06.029 --> 00:10:10.350
branding statement,  middle, their
accomplishments,  and end, a power close

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.970
which were all customized for the job
opportunity. We now discuss their

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:20.370
performance. Was she confident and
believable? How was her pacing and

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:28.079
enunciation? Was her energy consistent
from the beginning to the end? I then

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:33.120
have a client reduce the script to four
bullets, short sentences that summarize

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:40.019
the script. Bullet one: opening, it's your
branding statement. Bullet two: what you

00:10:40.019 --> 00:10:47.130
do. Bullet three: how you do it. In bullet
four: your power close.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.240
We then turned the script over and the
client presents their opening statement

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.920
from the bullet points. This allows them
to speak naturally, use their personality,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.350
and powerfully close their statement in
under one minute. It's amazing to watch

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:06.330
this transformation. The client speaks
with confidence, looks into my eyes, and

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.520
delivers the message with clarity and
conviction. It works every time. Few job

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.620
applicants open with clear and concise
statements. Again, you're taking control

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:20.820
of the interview in the first 60 seconds,
and you can now refer back to these

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:26.850
powerful skill sets throughout the
interview. So, when you're driving to the

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:32.430
interview, and you're organizing your
thoughts of your TMAY, ask yourself

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:39.210
the following questions. How am I
branding myself for this position? What

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:44.490
are the key components that they are
seeking for the perfect applicant? How

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:51.030
can I close by showing them what I am
qualified to do for this position? It's

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:55.530
easy to commit a few bullets to memory;
if you've already created a script, you

00:11:55.530 --> 00:12:00.240
can paraphrase from it naturally. If you
know yourself as a professional and know

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:05.550
how you can successfully accomplish a
company's goals and objectives, you can

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:12.090
deliver your TMAY credibly anytime,
anywhere. Always remember, in any

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.870
interview, always bring your three E's
with you.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:27.150
What are they? Energy, enthusiasm, and
energy. Now that your opening statement

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:33.420
is fresh on your mind, what else have you
done to prepare for the interview? Do

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:39.450
your homework on the company and the
position. Do your homework on yourself to

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:45.440
show your fit within the company and the
position. Anticipate interview questions.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.070
Prepare a list of questions that will
uncover problems or pain points within

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:56.670
the company, and be prepared to show how
you can solve these problems. What do you

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.810
plan to wear to the interview? It's
important to consider that.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:07.050
Always present yourself as a
professional. I often prepare my clients

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.890
a day before the interview by conducting
a mock interview and throw difficult

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:15.000
questions at them, rake them over the
coals. One morning I was coaching a

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.060
client who had an interview scheduled
for later that day. Mary Kay, that's her

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:26.880
name, was an animated Southern woman who
jingled with every gesture. She dressed

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:32.250
impeccably, but was quite over stocked
with her jewelry and perfume.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:36.029
Whenever she made a movement her gold bracelets
clanged and reverberated like Santa's

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:42.960
sleigh bells. Her overly applied
fragrance would make my eyes water and

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.910
it would linger in my office hours after
her departure. I knew I had to discuss

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.800
this with her. It wasn't going to be easy.
It was my job as her coach to

00:13:52.800 --> 00:14:01.320
diplomatically persuade her to reduce
her perfume and jewelry by 95%. So she

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.620
took it like I thought she would, and she
was a little frustrated and flustered by

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.400
my suggestions, but in her southern way
she found herself with her scarlet red

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:15.330
fingertips and gasped, "Well, I had no idea!
I'll certainly follow your professional

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:22.110
advice. You're entitled to your opinion,
bless your heart." Being from Oklahoma, I

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.970
know exactly what "bless your heart" means.
It is often applied as an antiseptic

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.950
after a cutting remark. "He's as dumb as a
bag of bricks, bless his heart."

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:37.500
Well, she followed my advice and did an
excellent job with her interview. She

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.770
called me the next day and was very
excited, and told me that she had

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:45.839
accepted an offer and started work that
following Monday. Well good for you, Mary

00:14:45.839 --> 00:14:51.690
Kay. Bless your heart. Always dress a
grade above or match the style of the

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:56.940
management team for the organization. It
shows you respect the interviewer and

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:06.870
the interview process. Well, this is the
exciting time of our talk. I have a

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.760
wonderful volunteer who is going to come to
our microphone, and I'm going to ask her

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.730
some interview questions. I'm not going
to be hard.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.449
She told me she just had an interview
today, which is great, and I said, "well

00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:23.010
after being in a room full of people,
every interview will be easy for you." But

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.880
please go ahead and step up and
introduce yourself.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:27.380
[Contreras] Hi, I'm Yissel Contreras.

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:35.449
[Singer] And tell us a little bit about
yourself.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.480
[Contreras] I am a neuroscientist with a background in chemical engineering, material science and semiconductor processing. I
like solving challenging problems by

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.699
using critical thinking and systematic
approaches. I like collaborating with

00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:57.240
others. Um.... [Singer] You're doing a wonderful job. Looks like you really listened to the

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.579
first part of this discussion. [Contreras] I like working on complex topics, and
I will perform any task with by

00:16:02.579 --> 00:16:08.190
exceeding expectations. [Singer] Very good, very
good. Well, let me ask you a few questions,

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:13.320
and answer them quickly, honestly. Try and
remember, you know, when you're talking

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:18.810
and giving me your answer to keep your
answers to about a minute, really no more.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.529
If the interviewer wants to know more, they'll ask you follow up questions and

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:27.899
you're invited to expand on that idea. So,
my first question to you: how do you

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:34.139
perform under stress in the workplace? [Contreras]
Well, I usually when facing a challenging

00:16:34.139 --> 00:16:40.620
like a stress environment, I develop a
plan. It's useful to know my strengths, my

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:47.370
resources, and also my time constraints.
So my basic approach is I'll develop a

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:57.319
plan, follow up with the people I need to
collaborate with, and probably just um....

00:16:57.319 --> 00:17:01.949
[Singer] That's good. I would have ended right
there. That was very good because what

00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:04.559
most people don't - there's a couple
things about that question that you need

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:08.100
to know. That was a how question. Whenever
you're asked a how question, they're

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:11.850
looking for your recipe or your formula
as to how you do something. When you ask,

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:15.780
you know, how do you do that? Quite well,
but that's what the magician says after

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.559
he performed his trick so he doesn't
have to explain to you how he did it. But

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:23.850
she explained how she performs in a
stressful environment so that was very good.

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.420
What you don't know, most people don't
know, about the stress

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:32.070
question is to an HR person or the
person asking you this question stress

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.360
is a four-letter word. I know it has six
letters in it I use my fingers earlier

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.100
to count it up, but it is a signal that
things are beyond one's control, it's

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.820
always used as a crutch or as an excuse
in the workplace, and it's used

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:51.090
frequently. So I suggest that you answer
the question, but redefine the word. Don't

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:56.580
repeat the word stress. Choose a word of
something you can control, and then of

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.760
course explain how you how you do that.
So I would answer it more like, "Well,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:05.940
certainly in our work environment, we're
faced daily with unexpected problems or

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:13.770
challenges. When I have an unexpected
problem arise, I analyze the problem. I'll

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:19.020
consult with my team. I want their input
on it. I go back and I work out a

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:23.430
solution. Then I implement the solution."
So I didn't use the word stress, I used

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:28.160
the word "problem" and a problem is
something that we can control. Very good.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:33.870
Here's sounds like an easy question, but
it's a loaded question. Would you be

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.770
willing to relocate?

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:42.000
[Volunteer] Um, yes, I would have no problem relocating.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.240
Okay I wanted to see
how long it took you to answer that. If

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.820
you pause too long, they assume that you
will not do that. The correct answer is,

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.810
"Certainly, depending on the opportunity,
I'd be happy to relocate." And that's also

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.080
true with the "what about excessive
travel?" Certainly depending on the

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.470
opportunity I'd be happy to do that. They
might want to move you to Denver in nine

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:05.820
months. That's why they ask this early on.
If you are not willing to relocate, the

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.780
interview is probably over in their mind.
You want to get to an offer at the end

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.270
of this interview, so you'll never get
there if you give a negative reply. And I

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.970
don't care if you're wearing an ankle
bracelet and the sheriff won't let you

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.770
leave the county, there might be a judge
that can give you a work release program.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:28.290
There is a way that you can relocate if
the opportunity is the best opportunity

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:36.030
for you. Next question. This is the Big
Kahuna of all trap questions, but I want

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:41.100
you to answer it just quickly and
honestly for me, please. Tell me, professionally,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:50.120
what's your greatest weakness? [Contreras] So I
sometimes tend to overthink when

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:59.399
planning something. So it means, um, I think
too much about the little details that

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:03.659
will come up in the future and need to
constantly remind myself that I must

00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:08.279
focus on the closest challenge at hand
and then the small details will be

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:15.480
addressed later. [Singer] And what is negative
about you overthinking something? Does it

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.149
slow you down? Are you... [Contreras] It can slow me
down so that's why I developed this

00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:27.360
strategy to constantly remind me this is
what's next and then I will face future

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.759
challenges when when it's time to do that. So it's it's a matter of the time

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:38.190
it consumes and the energy thinking
about problems that may not be there in

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:44.779
the future. [Singer] Okay, she's almost on to
something there. You know she admitted to

00:20:44.779 --> 00:20:49.470
overthinking things which slows her down,
she's tied into the minutia of the day

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.809
to day, and that could be a red flag, but
she did tell us how she was overcoming

00:20:54.809 --> 00:20:59.809
it. I don't know if she has overcome it
or not, the thing to remember here is to

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:03.690
never really admit to something that
they think you will bring to their table.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:08.940
So I would answer that question, if you
had asked me, I'd say, "I can't think of

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.440
any weaknesses that would apply to this
position but if any were pointed out to

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:18.059
me, I do my best to overcome them. Let me
give you an example. Earlier in my career

00:21:18.059 --> 00:21:23.490
when I was a younger manager, I was a bit
of a perfectionist, which i think is an

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.639
asset, but I always had to do things on
my own.

00:21:26.639 --> 00:21:32.850
And I was given my first project to
manage earlier in my career, and I went

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.360
ahead and did it all on my own and
ignored this wonderful team that was

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.759
sitting in front of me. Well, fortunately
for me a senior level manager came over,

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:45.509
and took me aside, and said, "John these
people are probably, no they are

00:21:45.509 --> 00:21:49.500
definitely a lot smarter than you are,
and you have this wonderful team here

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.950
and this is your chance to be a leader
to draw from their experience and lead

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:57.150
them on this.
So I followed his advice and the project

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.620
came out much better than if I just done
it on my own. That was the day I think I

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.860
became a leader and a good project
manager and I've been practicing it that

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:10.590
way ever since." So what did I accomplish
there? I didn't admit to anything that

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.240
I'm bringing to your company if you hire
me. I did answer the question, so I

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.860
brought up, like you, I brought up a
weakness and I showed you how I got

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.520
through that and I pretty much assured
you that I'm not going to bring it to

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:29.520
your company. So, always remember to put
it in your past. The similar question to

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.470
that would be give us three - they asked
this - give us three of your greatest

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:39.120
professional failures. And I would never
do that. I mean, you're not gonna get

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.140
points for telling the truth and giving
me your weaknesses and failures, so I

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:47.370
would think of maybe something that
potentially could have been a failure,

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:52.950
have catastrophic results, but I would
give them the story like I just told

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.880
that other story and walk them through
and show them how I saved it from being

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.300
a failure. It might not have been a
tremendous success, but that would be the

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:05.220
story that I would use. That's showing my
skill sets and how I can work on a

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:12.890
problem and solve that problem. Okay, this
is a question that many of you may hear

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:18.150
because of what you do and where you are.
"Do you expect any difficulties

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:23.960
transitioning from your world, your
industry, into ours?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.010
[Contreras] Possibly, yes. In my

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:30.090
experience I've made transitions between
disciplines and also between

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:34.170
environments for instance moving to
doing an undergrad in Mexico to doing

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.700
going to grad school here. And I
basically learned that in new

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:44.610
environments that there's basically two
things one is learning, the new language,

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:51.360
not only as Spanish from English but
also the new technical terms that are

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.840
associated with that environment or that
science. And the other is learning the

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.070
new rules. So it's all about being
flexible, and being adaptable, so even

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.570
though I am not an expert in industry,  I
know I would be able to adapt, to learn

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.540
the new rules
and I expect I expect not everything to

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:10.260
be perfect at first but I know I will
learn fast.

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.710
[Singer] Okay, that was good

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:17.860
explanation. I think what they're mostly
concerned about is the timeline. How

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.190
long is it going to take you to get up
to speed in their industry? They

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.930
obviously think that you have the right
skills, education, etc., to the interview

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.320
and have this job. Where they're mostly
concerned, you need to put them at ease

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.320
that it won't take us a long time, so I
recommend that you pick something that

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.510
you did in your past in your past
position where you were facing change,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.980
and you show them where you came in
under time, under budget very quickly.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.730
That you learn quickly. They're concerned
that you're going to take a long time

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:53.130
for you to get up to speed. So that's how
I would reduce it. I would always always

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:58.780
think of a story of accomplishment that
you can use in your answers. Last

00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.960
question.
Alright, let me set the stage, so the

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.480
person you're interviewing with is a
little concerned. He's very impressed

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.640
with you,
thinks you're wonderful. You have a

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.440
wonderful resume - not a long CV - it's a
two-page resume. It's beautiful

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:20.470
and he's worried that you're
overqualified, that you're gonna be bored,

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.930
that you're gonna leave, you're gonna go
work for his competition. That you're

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:26.890
ambitious, you want the next job. It's his.
He doesn't want to give it up. This is

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:33.310
what's on his mind, okay. Let's say you
and I talked before that interview, and I

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:37.270
told you, I said do you think you're a
little overqualified for this? You might

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.670
say, "yes I might appear to be, but this is
a great opportunity. I love the widget

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.320
industry. I would love to be a part of it
I love challenges. I I think this would

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:52.300
be a great opening for me in my career."
Well, I'm going to tell you that you need

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.050
to share that passion with them the next
day in the interview because that's

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.850
gonna probably be the elephant in the
room. They may bring it up, they might not.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.740
So I'll give you a good way of answering
that, but let's just assume that's what

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:11.470
is happening here. How are you going to
convince them otherwise? So my question

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:15.650
to you is are you overqualified for this
position?

00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:21.260
[Contreras] Well, I certainly believe there are,
possibly, many specialities in my

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:29.510
background and not all of them would be
utilized in this job, but this is... these

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.590
are highly specialized, tasks I would be
asked to learn how to specialize, so I

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:40.130
see it as an opportunity to learn.
Learning more in-depth about a specific

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:47.840
aspect of, let's say semiconductor
processing, much more than I would have

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:55.309
the opportunity to do that in academia,
so I I don't see it as being too simple

00:26:55.309 --> 00:26:58.130
or too easy but rather as an
opportunity to learn more in depth about

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.900
the specific area of what I learned

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.630
[Singer] Okay.
I like that explanation. I can give you a

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:11.440
fast way of making that much shorter and
using a magic word at the end of it to uh

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:18.170
hopefully seal the deal for yourself. I
would say, if you asked me that question,

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.290
and this is like the stress question, you
don't necessarily want to use the word

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.500
overqualified. So you say are you
overqualified for this position. I would

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:30.620
say, "No, I really don't think that I am.
You know, we've discussed your goals of

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:36.980
how to grow this organization. I have had
that same plan in my experience. I know

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.490
that I can help you get there. I know
there will be a lot of challenges. I

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:45.740
embrace challenges, they excite me. I
believe that I am not overqualified as

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.080
much as I'm prepared." So prepared is the
word and if you would have tacked that

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.320
on the end of what you just told me, I
think that would have made your answer

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:59.630
much better because that shows them that
you're prepared for people that are

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:04.280
older like me, I see a lot of younger
faces in here, but if I have a younger

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.270
candidate that I'm competing against,
when I say that I'm prepared they're

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.750
gonna be very interested in that. They're
paying for my experience whereas the

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:17.720
younger candidate might not know how to
get them to their goals. So by saying

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:23.510
you're prepared, I think, is a better way
of saying that you're overqualified. Well,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:28.000
thank you very much everybody give her a
round of applause. [Applause]

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:36.070
We have your resume on file and we may
give you a call soon. Before you go to

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:40.420
the company's website to fill out the
application, you need to have a good idea

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:46.420
of the compensation range for this
position in your market. If asked to

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.220
specify a salary, you don't want to come
in too low and certainly not too high. So

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:57.250
here's what you do. You go online and you
search for a free salary calculator, and

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.240
you can do this through Salary Wizard,
which I believe is part of Monster,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:07.480
salary.com. This is a free service. It
lists every job, really, you can think of

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.130
in United States, in every marketplace,
and it shows you different pay ranges in

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:18.070
those particular markets. In Tucson,
unfortunately, sometimes the same job at

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:24.040
Honeywell in Tucson, Arizona, would pay
more in Phoenix. So you really need to

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.230
understand what they're paying in that
market. So you open up the salary

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:34.150
calculator, and it usually asks you three
questions. What's the position? Let's say,

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:40.630
project manager engineer. What's the
industry? Aerospace. What's the market?

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.700
Tucson, Arizona. After you complete the
questions, you'll see results of various

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.190
levels for the position. Suppose this is
a level three job, as it was described,

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.210
and it's in the posting and level three
would pay the most.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.470
It's paying between seventy and eighty
five thousand dollars, so they publish

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:04.750
the range in this marketplace for that.
They also say that this level requires a

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:09.760
master's degree, a PMP certification, ten
years of experience. It lists all the job

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.300
responsibilities. And this is what you
saw pretty much in the job posting, so

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:17.650
you say yup this is the one. So now you
have an idea of what the range is for

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:22.360
that position. So now you need to
establish your acceptable salary range

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:26.980
and create a walkaway number in your
mind. With your skills education and

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.130
experience, you will show the company
where you can add value, and hopefully

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:34.990
break that $85,000 barrier, and we'll
talk about that a little bit later, but

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.340
you need to decide you decide that you
want to make at least $80,000 which is a

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:44.440
median number and
range. Later in the negotiation, if by

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:50.950
chance the company comes in with a low
offer like 68, you can turn around and

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:55.210
show them that, according to your
research, the job requires 80 thousand

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:59.830
dollars plus an experienced education
and credentials. So you can set them back

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.549
on track. They've seen these numbers as
well. So now you're prepared to tackle

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:10.269
the online application. One of the first
inquiries online usually is what are

00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:16.090
your salary requirements. So you enter
the word "open," and you immediately get a

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:21.100
bounce back. It says, "must enter a numeric
value." While this puts you at an

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.299
immediate disadvantage, at least you did
your homework and have established the

00:31:25.299 --> 00:31:29.769
documented salary range for this
particular market. If the position

00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:34.289
described is clearly level 3, you should
enter a median figure in that box,

00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:39.519
$80,000, and you'll be safe. You didn't go
to high you didn't go to low. If you're

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:44.049
invited for a face-to-face interview,
you'll be able to justify the $80,000

00:31:44.049 --> 00:31:48.700
figure and show where you can add value,
and, perhaps, you can move this number to

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:54.519
85,000 or beyond. During the interviewer
interview, the interviewer may ask you

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:58.690
your salary expectations. And this is
very uncomfortable and you want to

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:03.730
please them, and you don't want to be
rude, but you really need to stand up for

00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:09.450
yourself in this one. You might say the
average for this market is around

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:14.620
$80,000, your compensation could be more
it could be less. Let's discuss this

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.880
position and clarify the job
responsibilities as you see them, and

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:22.929
then I will be happy to give you an
answer of the compensation a little bit

00:32:22.929 --> 00:32:27.789
later. So what you're asking them to
do is describe what this job is to you

00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:32.559
and your company.
You know you might pay me $250,000 for

00:32:32.559 --> 00:32:35.559
this job if you expect me to rotate all the
tires in the parking lot and paint the

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:39.580
building three times a day. I just
will burn out very quickly. I'm sorry. My

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.539
point is you want to know what they want
you to do for this money, so it makes

00:32:43.539 --> 00:32:46.960
sense, it's logical for them to explain
this job to you so hopefully they will

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:52.570
go on and explain the job to you. Now the
interviewer might ask you another tricky question.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:59.050
What are you currently making? This is an
unfair question, and, as many of you know,

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:04.480
is actually illegal in many states right
now. So why give them a yardstick to

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.510
measure you by? Your best response would
be this, and I think it's a good one, "I

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:14.550
believe we can both agree that I'm
qualified for this position, but the

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:19.930
responsibilities posted for this job are
quite different than my current role, so

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:24.010
I believe it's unfair to compare the two.
Could we discuss this position further,

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.330
and after I understand your expectations
and responsibilities associated with the

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:34.570
job, I can give you an accurate answer?"
And that's just telling them, again, these

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:39.700
are two different jobs. I'm, It doesn't mean
I'm not qualified, but don't compare my

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:45.130
current job to this job. It's very
different. That will usually work, but

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.610
they'll definitely bring it up at the
end of the interview. During the

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:54.850
interview, they'll ask you behavioral
questions testing your management style,

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.050
your technical aptitude, your
communication skills. Then they will

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:02.620
reach a critical point of the interview
when they ask you if you have any

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:07.720
questions for them. I call this the
benchmark point of the interview. This

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.740
reveals they have given you a complete
description of the job and its

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:16.180
responsibilities in their mind.
Throughout the interview you've been

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.860
looking for holes on their side. What,
you're interviewing them as well. What

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:26.770
did they forget to mention? In other
words, what is there that you think you

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:31.270
can do for the organization that they
did not list as the job responsibilities?

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:35.190
This is where you can uncover areas
where you can add value to the position.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.860
So when you're asked, you should have a
list of questions that you're going to

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:42.490
ask them, but the first one you ask them
should be something like this, "Where do

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:46.870
you see the company, department, growing
in the next 6 to 12 months and what

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:52.740
areas do you wish to improve upon? What
goals and objectives have not been met?

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.920
This is where you will uncover problems
that you can solve. You're looking for

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.700
their pain, and if you take on these
additional responsibilities, you should

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:03.019
be paid for
this added value that you're bringing to

00:35:03.019 --> 00:35:08.269
the organization. The reason why we wait
until this point in the interview to

00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:13.910
bring up these topics of added value is
to show what we can do over and beyond

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.510
what they are expecting. They just
outlined what they thought this job was.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.210
Now you're showing them that you can do
more than that.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:25.190
Most of your competition will not be
doing that. If we had brought these

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.440
additional responsibilities up
prematurely,

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.640
they'd say, "Sure, we'd love for you to do
that. It's part of your job." And then they

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.150
would have absorbed those added
responsibilities and merged it into that

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:40.069
low salary base. The added value that you
bring to the position translates to the

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:44.930
highest end of the pay range and beyond.
So at this point if they ask you what

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:48.319
the position should pay, you can answer
with confidence because you've talked

00:35:48.319 --> 00:35:51.589
about the position and you've also done
your research. You would say, "According to

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:55.760
my research in the Tucson market for
this position that you describe, the

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:02.799
compensation is upward" - use that word -
"upward to $85,000. With the additional

00:36:02.799 --> 00:36:08.109
responsibilities that we just discussed,
the compensation would be in the mid 90s."

00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:13.059
So you've shown them clearly that if
you'd like for me to do these other

00:36:13.059 --> 00:36:17.119
responsibilities you're gonna have to
pay me more money. Money can also be made

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:22.549
in negotiating your benefits package, for
performance bonuses, additional time off

00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:27.619
stronger health care coverage, in 401k
matching. This is all covered in this

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:32.329
book that you will receive through David.
He's gonna send you an electronic copy of

00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:37.970
the book, and it's under the chapter
called "Well Played, Sir," and you'll see

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:43.119
several more strategies for negotiation.

00:36:43.269 --> 00:36:48.829
You should take advantage of every
networking opportunity you possibly can.

00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:53.509
Events such as today's meeting, industry
events, project management institute

00:36:53.509 --> 00:36:57.890
lectures - that's PMI. Any event where you
can meet a c-level decision maker,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:04.279
colleagues, or professionals in your
industry. We call this the unpublished

00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:13.220
job market. Nearly 70% of upper level
positions are secured through networking.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.100
Not online.
It's all about who you know and who they

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:23.980
know, so take it upon yourself to contact
local industry leaders and request to

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:28.900
have an informational exchange, either on
the phone or face-to-face. You're not

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.880
asking them for a job. You're exchanging
information. You're expanding your

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.300
network and hopefully you're gonna be
walking away with some referrals that

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:42.400
can lead you to opportunities to help
you advance in your career. How many of

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:50.550
you are active on LinkedIn? That's great.
It's better than last time.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:56.650
LinkedIn is an excellent online
networking tool. You should connect with

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:02.740
me. Look me up. I have about 2500
connections. And I'm not bragging or

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.300
boasting because I don't know any of
them really, but the point here is you

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:12.820
can see my connections. You can put in
Raytheon or Roche or see who I'm

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.950
connected to at those places, and then
you can connect with them through me. So

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:22.359
connect with me and expand your contact
base. If you have a hundred contacts,

00:38:22.359 --> 00:38:25.720
you should work on expanding it to three
hundred contacts within the next six

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:32.200
months. It's easy to do. Be sure you have
an updated profile and a professional

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.160
picture, not that little cartoon
silhouette they have there as a default.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.910
It's very important. They won't take you
seriously unless you have a picture and

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:44.859
not one with somebody's arm on your
shoulder or you in a crown. When you're

00:38:44.859 --> 00:38:48.520
on LinkedIn you can follow companies of
interest, you can join discussion groups,

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:53.160
you can start your own discussion group,
you can write articles and post them.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.890
You're showing you're an expert in your
field and you're really expanding your

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:01.150
network. And when you have an active
LinkedIn account, you will start

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.170
receiving postings because companies are
searching for people like you and they

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:11.560
will see your activity and they will
actually send you job postings. I coach

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.780
clients all over the US and beyond,
and they eventually find success, all of

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:22.840
them, but the clients who are successful
most quickly, are those who have proper

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:27.310
marketing collateral, an excellent
communication strategy as we discussed

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.850
today,
and they're totally committed and

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:36.090
engaged in their job search. My father
taught me the most important lessons

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:38.730
that I know about business and life,
really.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:43.440
A few of his many pearls of wisdom that I
want to share with you, they'll never

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:50.220
leave me. The first one, surround yourself
with people more talented than you. And

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:56.970
in my case, that's never hard to do.
There's a good example. Success is

00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:03.150
measured by how you have inspired others.
Do what you love and happiness will

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:11.330
follow. Never, ever give up. And most
importantly, go out and make it happen.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:16.050
One day he took me aside and made an
observation that I hope was a compliment.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:19.920
I still haven't really figured it out. He
put his hand on my shoulder, and with a

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:25.920
warm smile and his southern gentlemen's
charm, he said, "Son, you're the kind of guy

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:32.250
that will succeed in spite of himself." I
hope I haven't let him down. My parting

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:38.820
advice to you is visualize yourself at
your best and then go out and make it

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:46.659
happen. Thank you. [Applause]

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:53.950
[Attendee] On the overqualified question,  I
was in an interview where it did not

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:59.320
come up, but at the end of the interview I
was turned down by the employer with the

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.310
comment that they thought I was
overqualified for the position. So if they

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:08.680
don't bring it up,
should I, assuming that I think a lot of

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.820
industry people consider somebody who
has a PhD, at least for a certain

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.930
entry-level positions, by default
overqualified yet somehow also at the

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:22.150
same time not experienced enough? But so
how do you, like, if it's not explicitly

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.580
addressed, how to deal with that?

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.230
[Singer] The more
you interview, thank you, the more

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.680
you interview, the easier it will be for
you to weave certain things into your

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.490
conversation. This is part of your
strategy. So like I said earlier, that was

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.520
the elephant in the room. You might have
known that when you walked in there and

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.820
you were surprised he didn't ask you. You
might have been anticipating that with

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.500
your educational background, so I would
recommend that if you see something that

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:49.060
you know you can answer and put them at
ease, I would weave that into my

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.420
conversation. When they ask you if you
have any questions for them, it's your

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:56.860
turn to talk and you can give them any
information that you need, but show them

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:01.390
your passion. You know, don't just say it,
show it. And show them that you're

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.390
passionate for this type of position.
Tell them why it would be a great

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:11.920
position for you going from academia
into this field and that might work for

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.180
you.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:18.370
[Attendee] Good afternoon or good evening, and
thank you. The question is with regards

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:23.530
to ageism. That's the other elephant in
the room, particularly female ageism. So

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:29.230
how, what could you offer some elegant
responses or elegant anticipation since

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:30.698
that's in the room?

00:42:30.698 --> 00:42:35.410
[Singer] Great question. It is
out there, and many times they'll try and

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.890
find it through the applicant tracking
system as they're scanning resumes to

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:47.160
figure out how old you are. That's why on
the resume we never put years of degrees.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:54.460
You might have had an MBA from 1989.
That's wonderful but an MBA from 2015

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:58.270
would have been fresher and more
interesting to me. You also revealed your

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:03.640
age. So,
we, you know, we walk in there and they

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:09.550
see you, know what we look like, and so
that's obvious, but you're very vibrant

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:14.170
and age shouldn't be an issue. If they
ask you any questions about age, which we

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:19.480
know is off-limits, this is what I tell,
and particularly my female clients that

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.060
get asked "are you married? Do you have
any kids?,"

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.620
these are improper questions, and I
always tell them to answer with, "is that

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.000
important for this position?"
So age would be the same thing, is it

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.730
important for this position. I think we
go back to the overqualified question,

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.360
where I say prepared. I think you ought
to take a little language out of there

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.610
and, not to that question, but throughout
the interview, let them know how well you

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:50.230
are prepared for this job. Your age would
be an asset. Like I said to the other

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.860
person who's much younger than you,
so show them that, and if they're gonna

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.420
pay you and pay you more, it's worth it.
It's worth the investment and it's not

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.700
an age factor, it's an experience and
expertise. My company, we embrace age

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.200
because we know that they know their
stuff and we love to work with people.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:13.060
[Attendee] So that transitions to the second part of
the question which is, um, because of the age

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.160
and the experience you're too expensive.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.510
[Singer] They might think that and that's hard to

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:22.390
get around
and that's another elephant that might

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:27.780
be in the room. You might need to be able
to tell them if you are willing to work

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.930
for a certain salary that might be less
than what you were making it the last

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:36.820
job and you understand that in this
industry, based on your research, this

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.480
position pays a little bit less than
what I was making in my previous

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:44.560
position but I'm fine with that. I enjoy
the challenge. I want to have the

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.280
opportunity to work for this company, to
work with a large group of people, and to

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:54.130
grow with them. So the figure isn't as
important to me as the position. So you

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:58.690
want to try and get off that number. You
might have to take less. They should pay

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:04.120
you to the highest end of any scale
because you have that expertise. [Attendee] Thank

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.140
you. [Singer] Thank you.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:15.410
[Attendee] Hello and thank you. My question is about
salary and negotiation. How, what is a

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:20.390
political and appropriate way to ask
them, when they are asking me about

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:25.819
expected salary, how can I ask them am I
going to be paid as much as a male

00:45:25.819 --> 00:45:27.660
candidate is going to be paid?

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:32.380
[Singer] That's a
great question, particularly today.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.349
They'll never admit to that, they'll
never talk to you about that.

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:41.960
If they're practicing that, it's it's
wrong, but I think through talking to

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:48.079
other people in the organization or in
your market or in your industry to find

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:53.119
out are women being paid less than men
for the same work. It's something that

00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:56.750
needs to be brought up. It's a question
that you might, if you accept the job, and

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:04.190
if it's not too far, you know in a gap
from what the male is making, that your

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:07.940
counterpart that's working right next to
you, I would address that to the HR

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:16.369
department because that is very common
in these days and it's unfair. That is

00:46:16.369 --> 00:46:21.920
why I mentioned earlier that it's
illegal in many states - Massachusetts,

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.880
California, and a few others, and it's
gonna be widespread - to ask what you're

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.400
making.
They put that law into effect to protect

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.119
women because they wanted to see what
women were making so they could pay them

00:46:32.119 --> 00:46:36.589
less. So that's why that law went into
play. So it's it's on the minds of

00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:40.010
everybody. I think HR departments,
particularly these days, particularly

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.589
with things that are going on in the
workplace and then we hear about on the

00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:45.710
news, they're very sensitive to some of
these things where they might not have

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:49.040
been a few years ago and that would be
something you could discuss with HR.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.480
Or you could gently discuss it with them
during the negotiation. Once you reach

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:59.000
the negotiation, you have every right to
discuss that salary, what you're

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.410
contributing, and is that in line with
the other employees what they're making.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:11.720
[Attendee] Regarding networking, can you give
us more advices or details about how it

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.880
can we strengthen our networking?

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.000
[Singer] Can you repeat that. I didn't hear the

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.635
first part of the question.

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.210
[Attendee] Okay, regarding the network. [Singer] Networking?

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:26.119
[Attendee] Yeah, networking. So how can
what advice that you can tell us or

00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:29.020
advise us to strength our networking?

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:30.670
[Singer] Great question.

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:36.500
Networking should be something that you
do, even if you're in a job you're gonna

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:41.089
be in that job for 10 or 15 years. This
is why you see people going to events,

00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:45.200
um, having meetings with other people
over lunch. People that are their peers

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:50.720
in their industry. A way that you, and all
of you can strengthen your networking, is

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:56.000
through research. You might find a
company you want to work for. They might

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.560
not be offering a job right now, but you
want to target a decision maker - that's a

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:04.849
person one or two levels above your
desired position - and let them know that

00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:08.300
you would like to have a conversation
with them. You're not expecting them to

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.900
know of a job. You're trying to expand
your network. You believe that someone

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:15.020
with their background and expertise
would be a great resource for

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:20.270
information. Could we talk? And when you
go and you talk with them, you talk about

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:23.180
the industry, and you're sharing things
about yourself. They're learning about

00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:27.589
you, but you're not making this a job
interview. You came in there with the

00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:31.430
idea that you are going to talk about
the industry. So you're asking them

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:35.510
questions, they're asking you questions,
and you're developing a relationship and

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:39.680
you want to continue to nourish those
relationships throughout your career. So

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.890
you want to follow up with them. They
might be interested. Did you get that job?

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:47.210
Yes, I did. This is my new contact
information. Thanks for your help. I did

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:51.740
contact the person you were recommending
that I get in touch with. One of the

00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.369
greatest things about networking is if I
go and talk with you and we're chatting

00:48:55.369 --> 00:49:00.170
about your industry and exchanging
information, I'm also asking you who

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:04.070
would you also recommend that I speak to
within your company? Or who would you

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:08.980
recommend I speak to outside of your
company? Great, can I use your name?

00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:15.609
Wonderful, fantastic. Then I write a
referral letter to that person.

00:49:15.609 --> 00:49:21.560
Dear Mr. Johnson, in a recent
conversation with David Finer, he

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:27.200
suggested that I get in touch with you.
David, I am expanding my network in the

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.170
Tucson marketplace in the widget
industry and David thought you would be

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.859
an excellent source of information, so
based on his recommendation I would like

00:49:33.859 --> 00:49:36.980
to have a brief meeting with you. So I
just mentioned his name three times.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:42.020
You know David, you're gonna, you're gonna
see me. And this is how we expand that

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:47.960
network and we fall into opportunities
that aren't published online.

00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.500
[Attendee] I have a question about the salary negotiation
part of the interview. Is that a standard

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.400
part of like the first interview or the
second interview? If it doesn't come up

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.440
does that mean they've already made a
decision not to hire me?

00:49:58.440 --> 00:49:59.270
[Singer] Great question.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:04.099
It's rarely done in the first interview.
Usually in particularly upper-level

00:50:04.099 --> 00:50:07.700
positions, you your first interview might
be a phone screening, it might be a

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:13.190
screening face-to-face with someone in
HR or a hiring manager, and then you're

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:18.619
usually going to go through two or three
other interviews where they're getting

00:50:18.619 --> 00:50:23.540
very serious. They might ask you to work
a problem for them or create a

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.650
presentation just to see if you have the
right stuff or is she just what we see on

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.460
the paper.
So these discussions really happen later

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:36.830
in the second or third interview, but you
need to be prepared for them. In the

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:42.080
first interview you must be must be
prepared for them. So you can expect it

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.420
to come later, but it sometimes they need
somebody, they love you and what you do,

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:52.310
and they can hire you on the spot. I've
seen everything happen, but never accept

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:59.089
an offer on the day that it is extended
to you. Always tell them, you know, use the

00:50:59.089 --> 00:51:02.930
family card, I would like to discuss this
with my family could I get back to you

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:08.020
in the next two or three business days.
Sure. And also ask them, "Could you please

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:12.730
send me the job description that we just
discussed all the responsibilities and

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:17.660
give me your offer, along with your
benefits package, that way I can review

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.740
it with my family?" Well, now you have a
document, and that whatever number that

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.339
was, it's attached to these job
responsibilities, so they can't add more

00:51:25.339 --> 00:51:28.910
when you go to work for them or you go
to HR and you tell them I need to be

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:33.770
paid for doing Bill's job. Also, the
benefits package you can study closely.

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:35.630
Are the healthcare benefits better than
mine?

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:40.400
Great, yes they are. Oh they don't start
for 90 days, there's a probation period. I

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.920
was laid off my last job.
I have six people in my family. I have a

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:50.289
COBRA payment of $1,000 a month. I'm
gonna ask them, part of my negotiation

00:51:50.289 --> 00:51:54.880
will be, "can you cover my COBRA payments
while I'm in this probation period, or

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:59.109
could you reduce it to 30 days and still
cover my COBRA payments?" Yes, we'd be glad

00:51:59.109 --> 00:52:04.089
to. Now I just saved myself $3,000. So
there are always things within that

00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:10.900
benefits package that we can negotiate.
You know, I tell clients, my company

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:16.119
provides outplacement services for when
people get downsized, so I always ask

00:52:16.119 --> 00:52:22.839
them to negotiate outplacement services,
and out and negotiate the length of

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:26.799
their severance. And the person might say,
you know, "I haven't hired you yet. You're,

00:52:26.799 --> 00:52:32.079
you're trying to find out what I'm gonna
pay you when I fire you?" And I have them

00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:36.910
tell them, "Well, I don't know of a better
time to talk about it. Very gently, is

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:41.710
that that you know or is it that you
don't know? Could we talk to HR?" So you

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:46.480
could say that you know I would like to
have the severance extended to four

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:52.359
months. It's currently 30 days, according
to your company policy, and they could

00:52:52.359 --> 00:52:57.190
ask and there could be a thousand
employees a 999 have 30 days and you

00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:02.559
have three months. And it doesn't mean
anything to them it, doesn't cost them

00:53:02.559 --> 00:53:08.020
anything. It's like an insurance policy.
When I buy it, I'm bidding I'm going to

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:12.069
die. The insurance agent is betting I'm
going to live, so we're trying to

00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:16.280
determine how we're going to do this and
what the best rates will be.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:17.500
[Brown] John, I just want to

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.619
say thank you so much for being here, and
thank you to everyone who is here, as

00:53:20.619 --> 00:53:25.480
well. And also thank you so much to David
Bradshaw, whose name keeps being invoked,

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.580
and because he does so much. Thanks so
much.

00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:29.420
[Singer] Thank you, David.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:30.940
[Singer] And I would

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:34.799
like to thank all of you for taking time
out of your day to listen to these ideas.

00:53:34.799 --> 00:53:38.680
Enjoy the book. I think you'll get a lot
out of it. If you can walk away with one

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.920
or two good ideas, I think our time was
well spent. Thank you very much.
