Mobile screens are small,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.909
so apps often use iconography
to convey meaning.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.289
They're also full of images
and other visual content

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.818
that might not be obvious

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:21.249
and that is inaccessible to people
with impaired vision.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.288
To keep users informed, used Tooltips.

00:00:24.728 --> 00:00:27.601
Just wrap your content
with a Tooltip widget

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.440
and provide a message.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.599
Now, your icons and images
show Tooltips when appropriate.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.888
For example, when the user
taps through the UI,

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:39.071
or when they [long] press on it,

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.880
Tooltip exports the message
into semantics,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.049
so screen readers
will be able to vocalize them.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.330
You can customize your Tooltips
with vertical offset, height, and more.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.311
Some Material widgets, like <i>IconButton</i>,
already include Tooltips,

00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:57.630
so you can just provide the message text.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.421
For more info on those
and all the other widgets,

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:03.460
