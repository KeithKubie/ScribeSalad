1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,910
My wife told me that she thinks our
11 year old daughter is being bullied

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,660
emotionally by some girls at school.
As I drove into work,

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,690
I wondered if Jujitsu would give her some
tools to help her deal with emotional

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:16,420
stress and or bullying
that might be taking place.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,770
I think we all know they answer that Daca
will give to this question. Absolutely.

6
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,790
Jujitsu will help.

7
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:26,791
11 years old is a perfect age for getting
in there and you will learn too is she

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,820
will learn to defend herself for
real and physical confrontations,

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,860
which will give her a real confrontation,

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,830
which will give her confidence
because let's face it,

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,400
emotional and verbal bullying is
absolutely backed up by a either

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,200
clear message of possible violence or a
subliminal message of possible violence.

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,190
Right? I mean a big group of girl
that's getting picked on the, the,

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,740
the underlying messages there,

15
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,770
the implied messages there that it's,

16
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,340
it could go physical if it had to and
when that gets removed because the,

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,540
the daughter knows how to
now fight and defend herself,

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,520
that starts to impact these
emotional bullies as well. So yes,

19
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,390
absolutely get her training.
I would throw some boxing in there too,

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,090
just because that is a
pretty empowering thing.

21
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:26,960
You pointed out something that feels good
and you know what? While we're at it,

22
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,810
let's get some working out going
on. Right. Get a pull up bar,

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,180
get way of the warrior kid like,
no kidding.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,430
Absolutely get her way of the warrior
kid. Don't baby her too much. Yeah,

25
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,610
you gotta be careful of that because
she's your daughter and you say, oh no,

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,190
it's so horrible and these
girls are picking any, don't,

27
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,110
don't do that because guess what?

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,680
She's going to be dealing with this her
whole life. You're going to be good.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,550
There's always bullies in every
environment, in the in school environment,

30
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,740
in the work environment,
in everywhere.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,010
There's bullies and she's going to
have to deal with them. So don't,

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,460
don't baby her where she thinks that
you're the one that's going to save her

33
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:06,990
from it. Um, and I also think should
know that everyone gets bullied.

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,310
I got asked that when way the
warrior could came out. Someone said,

35
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,780
what did you get bullied?
And they think,

36
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:17,070
of course I would never get bullied
because I, I'm a big dude. Well,

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,670
guess what?
When I was nine years old,

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,730
I was a scrawny little nine year old kid
and every buddy that was 11 was bigger

39
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:27,430
than me and stronger than me.
Yeah.

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,230
And then when I was 11 everyone
that was 13 was bigger than me,

41
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,064
than stronger than me.

42
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,250
And when I was 14 everyone that was 16
was bigger than me and stronger than me.

43
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,710
So no matter who you are as a kid,

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,780
there's always somebody that's bigger
and stronger than you that's going to

45
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,160
bully you if they're a jerk.

46
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,780
So I think she should understand
that she's getting bullied right now.

47
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:50,090
But that's, that happens to people and
people get over it and get through it.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,960
And I, I, I do think you have to be, when
you say that you can't leave the imprint,

49
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:01,961
you can't overwhelm or and say everyone
gets bullied and you can always get

50
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,880
bullied in the office or,
you know what I mean?

51
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:07,450
Like I'm not saying to overwhelm or
you think that's just like, there's a,

52
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:10,580
there's a lot. Did you ever see the movie
that professional? Which one was that?

53
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,480
The French guy. And He, Oh yeah,

54
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,320
there's a great scene in
that movie where the girl is,

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,770
there's like a crazy fight going on
between her parents and the apartment.

56
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,080
They're yelling at each other and
screaming and just slapping people that

57
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,590
domestic violence is going on and she
comes out and she's sitting in the hallway

58
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,700
and she's crying and the assassin guy
kind of walks up the stairs and she looks,

59
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,040
and he looks at her and she
looks at him and she says,

60
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,020
is life always like this or does
it get better when you get older?

61
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,790
And he looks at her and
says, always like this. Yeah.

62
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,720
So you've gotta be careful that that's
not the message that you're sending. Now.

63
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:55,510
There's some reality to that
statement. Like, yeah, guess what?

64
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,860
Life is always going to be hard.

65
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,940
And you do want to give your kids enough
exposure to the hard thing so that

66
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:04,810
they're not weak. Yeah. And they don't,

67
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,870
they don't go into panic mode when
something tough enters their world.

68
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,050
So that's why things like dude get to and
working out are good and exposing them

69
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:18,250
and letting them experience
some hard things.

70
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,310
But again, you just don't
want to overwhelm her. And
that's that. And by the way,

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,540
you might as well start training Jiujitsu
to their dad. Get Mom in there too.

72
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,050
Yeah. Now you've got an excuse to get
down in that. Jim, did you get to one?

73
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,950
And I know that you don't train Jiu Jitsu,

74
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,000
cause if you did you wouldn't be asking
this question. You be in getting,

75
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,870
getting her training,
making that happen.

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,300
So emotionally bullied.
Right. So this is interesting.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,290
She's in the new warrior kid book,
the bully. There's a bully in there,

78
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,740
but he's not a bully like Kenny
Williamson who's a big strong bully.

79
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,640
He's a bully.
That's an emotional,

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,930
he kinda is d and every time there's
seems like there's going to be a

81
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,110
confrontation, he finds a way to
weasel out of it. Yeah. You know,

82
00:05:02,111 --> 00:05:05,170
so he'll harass people,
but then he'll get harassed people.

83
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,970
He knows perfectly how
to push the buttons.

84
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:09,970
That's what the marks are dealing with.
This kid named Nathan James.

85
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,950
Vaguely familiar. Nathan
James Causes Problems. Yeah,

86
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,540
there's some layers in that
name for sure that I saw this.

87
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,320
This makes a lot of sense to me cause
I have a daughter four and a half,

88
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:27,250
by the way, it goes to pre
k. It's like a preschool.

89
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,440
Is that the Jujitsu school?
She goes, no, no bra. Anyway,

90
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,230
so she instructor, she
told me one day, um,

91
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,530
she said that her friends,

92
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,630
I'm not gonna say their
name doesn't matter. Um,

93
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,110
she said this friend told
me that she's not my friend.

94
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,100
She's only this other girl's friend.
That's emotional.

95
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,080
That's emotional bullying,
right?

96
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,300
That right for the four and a half
year old version of, by the way.

97
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,040
So it gets way worse at 11, by the
way. And then probably way worse at 15,

98
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:08,510
16. It's just my assumption.
So what I told her,

99
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,690
not to say this is the right answer.
It may be something to think about.

100
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:15,830
So my daughter does Jujitsu,
has done Jujitsu,

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,580
double leg choke when like it.

102
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,560
Well that's what you want
to say. Oh, you'd smash the,

103
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:25,780
and she's bigger too. She's bigger
than, than everyone, you know,

104
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,000
she's going to be the way.
No. What'd you tell her?

105
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,420
My daughter's trained to be it a
nice [inaudible] so I always had this

106
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,400
underlying thing.
No matter if someone be's mean to you,

107
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,010
that doesn't mean you be mean to them.
That makes you mean person.

108
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,430
I said me and people will
be mean to other people.

109
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,400
Nice people tend to not be
mean to other people. Right.

110
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,820
That's really pretty basic stuff.
Fundamental, but she's fine. Yeah. Um,

111
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,880
so you just keep reminding her. So,
um, so I, I told her, hey, look,

112
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,120
if she doesn't want to be your
friend then she's not your friend.

113
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,570
And that's okay. Does that
mean you be mean to her? No,

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,020
but at the end of the day, Sheen, I said,

115
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:08,040
are you stronger than her? And she said,
yeah. I said, are you smarter than,

116
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,730
than there? She said, yeah, I, if
she is or isn't. Here's the thing,

117
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,590
it's the self empowering thing.

118
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,950
Just like how you said where she
knows you're Jitsu. She's smarter,

119
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,420
she's stronger,
she can do more pull ups,

120
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:19,970
you can do more burpees and
stuff like that. All this stuff,

121
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,710
it starts to form in her
head, hopefully goal. Yeah.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Hopefully it'll form in her head that
if they don't want to be my friends,

123
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:30,980
that's okay. That's no loss to me.
Maybe if someone who is strong like me,

124
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,510
smart like me and whatever,
like me didn't want to me. Okay,

125
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,470
maybe that's something, but this isn't the
case. You know? It's kind of that idea.

126
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,250
The, the, the thing of just
saying, oh yeah, that's okay.

127
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,710
Not everyone's going to want to
be your friend. That's okay. Yeah.

128
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,870
And some people are gonna like you
and some people aren't gonna like you.

129
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,300
That's okay. You just be nice
to everyone. That's fine. Yeah.

130
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,960
I've got to ask that question, but when
we did the one warrior kid podcast,

131
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,860
a bunch of people asked,
oh my,

132
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,730
I feel like people don't want to
hang around with me and I was scared.

133
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,270
That's okay. Yeah. That's okay.

134
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,280
You don't need to hang around
with people all the time. I don't,

135
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:06,230
I don't like even like
hanging around with people.

136
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,260
I didn't say that because I don't want
to turn it over to social person like me.

137
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:11,150
But yeah,

138
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,930
that makes it in that thing
or I think you just said were,

139
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,200
cause my daughter always asks, you know,
did people not want to be your friend?

140
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,200
Or um, what she'd like bump her
head real hard. She be like,

141
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:26,420
did you use to bump your head
when you were little? You know,

142
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:31,100
she always wants to know like, am I
alone in this whole whole deal? And men,

143
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,110
it seems like you're really helps.
When I say no,

144
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:36,440
I used to do all the time I show her
like my scars and stuff like that and

145
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:40,100
she'll be like, oh, and you can tell she
feels better about it. That's pretty cool.

146
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,490
It's weird. I think that would help
with the bullying thing and it's good.

147
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:47,900
Your daughter's smart and so she has the
capability of formulating that question.

148
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:51,320
I bet a lot of kids might
not be able to even say, hey,

149
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,720
did you bump your head too?
Whereas a parent,

150
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,660
if you did recognize that they probably
feel alone. And so if you say, Oh,

151
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,910
I know you bumped your head. I used
to bump my head too one time. Look,

152
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,530
I got a scar on my head.
It happened to me too.

153
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:06,390
So they don't make your kids
beg for a partner in the world.

154
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,080
Give it to him. Yeah. Follow the
Echo Charles model of parenting.

155
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,680
And that makes sense too
now that I'm thinking of,
because like even as an adult,

156
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,610
okay, so you got a kid and they're
like, hey, did you, I don't know,

157
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,550
did you bump your head like this and
get blood on your head and whatever when

158
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,790
you're little and you're like, you're
like, yeah, and if you add this,

159
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,800
and this is how I dealt with it,
right?

160
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,850
Because a lot of times like you give
him a little path. Yes, exactly. Right.

161
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,070
So you got, you know, you've
got this poor little kid.

162
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,940
The bumped her head and it's like, Dang,
I don't even, I've never felt this before.

163
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:37,950
There's a lot of paint. There's
blood. Whoa, that's scary.

164
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,780
I don't know really how to deal with it.
Right?

165
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,370
So of course you go to your dad and
then your dad's like, yeah, Hey, yeah,

166
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:47,940
I've done it. This is how I did it. This
is how I dealt with it. And she's like,

167
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:51,540
okay, maybe I can deal with it. And even
adult, because adults, we do that too.

168
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,700
You know, like, Dang, I'm
getting, I don't know,

169
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:58,620
audited getting audited who
first time, whatever, Jocko, hey,

170
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,600
you know, or you know, your friend
or whatever. I was like, hey,

171
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,940
I got audited and this way he cares back.

172
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,020
This is like how you deal with
it and all this stuff. Boom.

173
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,820
You feel better about it indeed. And more
empowered. And that's on top of that.

174
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:12,210
You did too. If I got audited out where
you're at and know what you do to that.

175
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,230
Not by the way,
chuck.
