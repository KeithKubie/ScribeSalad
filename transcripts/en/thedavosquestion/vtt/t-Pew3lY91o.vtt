00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
&gt;&gt; Hey YouTubers and the 500 million adolescent
girls that are out there in the world living

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.080
in developing countries, we had a meeting
today

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.480
that I just came out of where we had over
25 companies, and we had the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.819
head of UN Aid, UNICEF, the UN High Commissioner
for refugees.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.560
We had the head of some of the largest NGOs
in the world, and we all

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.890
got together and we talked about you, and
we talked about what we need

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.580
to do to change your challenges.
So obviously, the situation for adolescent

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.250
girls in the world is really
challenging.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.761
We talked about the unique challenges that
you face, and what we need

00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.710
to do and that's it time to stop talking about
it but actually really

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.620
take action.
So what we agreed to do was to count you,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.270
first of all.
Right now, the data that's collected around

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.560
the world by all these
important organizations doesn't reflect you,

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.190
doesn't break you into an
age group that can be identified.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.300
You're clumped into women or you're clumped
into youth.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.081
You're not identified.
So we agreed to do that.

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:05.590
Then we can do the most important thing which
is invest in you because

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.159
real money needs to go to programs that are
help improve your lives.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.240
So we talked about how we would specifically
do that and who would take

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.969
leadership roles to make that happen.
And then thirdly we talked about advocacy

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.409
and how we need to speak out
on your behalf, and give you a means to have

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.609
your voices heard so that
people can hear your stories and hear how

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:27.210
the life of a girl in poverty
is uniquely challenging, and uniquely needs

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.979
to be addressed by world
leaders around the world.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.179
If you care environment, you care about poverty,
you care about any

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.969
issue out there in the world, investing in
girls, in you, is the most

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.049
thing that we can do. And today there were
about a hundred important

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.590
world leaders who got together in a room and
made you a priority told

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.929
you, told each other what they were going
to do in front of each other

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.439
to improve your lives.
We're going to post the action plan, it's

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.950
a ten point action plan, and
we are going to post that on Nikefoundation.org

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.679
and UNFoundation.org
and the coalitionforadolescentgirls.org

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.109
And that's a group of all of us who are going
to work together to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.210
hopefully make your lives better.
So I hope this is good news for you.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.080
Thank you so much for putting the video together
and we hope you girls

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.330
have your chance to transform the world, your
family, your community

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.970
and your country because you're the most powerful
people in the world

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.220
it's just the world doesn't know it yet.
