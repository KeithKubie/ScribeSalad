00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; Technology has really moved to the Cloud
wholesale. We've become, you know, the number

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.240
one provider of email and collaboration systems
in the U.S. by a pretty fair margin over our

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.059
competitors. And that's pretty amazing to
see a market that, three years ago, nobody

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.269
was outsourcing, nobody was moving to the
Cloud. And now it's become the dominant way

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.699
that schools are delivering these services
to their students. And it's happening in the

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.679
Fortune 500, and every day, every week, you
know--not every day, I shouldn't say that.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.460
But every few weeks, we're turning loose another,
you know, 20,000 or 30,000-person company

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.350
who is moving all their employees to Google
Apps. And that's something we're doing with

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.850
a great record of success. We have not had
companies of that size go back once they go

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.460
to the Cloud. So it's a real testament that,
you know, once you go there and you see what

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.050
the future looks like, though it's certainly
not perfect today, nobody has any desire to

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.000
go back, and I think that's really exciting.
What I want to really say to our partners

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.980
that are here today is probably one of the
most common questions I get in the millions

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.260
of small businesses, large businesses, schools,
the City of Los Angeles, whatever, you name

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.450
all the people that are using Google, and
they say to us, "When is Google gonna do x,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.470
y, or z? When are you gonna build a CRM application?
When are you gonna build a blah-blah?" And

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.600
my answer usually is, "Probably never." And
we've really decided a long time ago, you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
know, we have to focus our efforts. There
are certain things--really when there's a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.740
consumer analog to this application where
we think we have some degree of expertise

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.180
to bring to the situation. And other than
that, we would really rather offer a platform

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.760
to others. And I think what you're seeing
today here is really the beginning of that,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.391
a platform where we want to have a lot of
people offering applications in the Cloud

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:43.760
that have some of the sensibilities that we
have about how to, you know, make these applications

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.350
useful and integrated. So I think this is
a great start to it. We are very excited.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.800
One of the things that it's gonna let us do
is put more energy toward our existing applications.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.970
And they are certainly far from perfect, so
we have a lot more work to do on those, but

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.900
we're excited to push forward the Google Apps
suite, we are very excited to have a lot of

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.330
partners in this now to, you know, allow a
business not just to move part of their world

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.180
to the Cloud, but to move their entire business
to the Cloud, and I think that's what this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.480
is all about. So we just want to say, first
of all, thanks to everyone who participated.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.950
The partners have been great working with
us to get this as far as we've come. You can

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.570
see here the list again. You saw it earlier.
But all the partners that have been involved

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.880
with us prelaunch. You can see the URLs. You
can go see the Apps Marketplace hopefully

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.300
live as I speak. And it's been a great experience.
I should also say, by the way, there'll be

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.660
some sessions related to this at Google I/O
in May in San Francisco. It is unfortunately

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.190
sold out. I think Vic is gonna have to look
for a bigger venue next year. But hopefully

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.460
a lot of you are already signed up for Google
I/O, and we look forward to take some more

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.260
big steps forward with this in May. So thank
you all for coming. And thanks for everybody

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.010
who's paid attention and stayed with us online.
And for those who are here at Google, you

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.719
can mix and mingle with the Google team and
with partners for a while now. So thanks again.
