1
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:01.460
Um,

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.460
I started last time and actually my whole lecture existed under the rubric of

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.960
this quotation from Sabbath Lily hawks.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.180
And I'm just gonna read it to you again.
Um,
I like his eyes.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.290
They don't look like they see what he's looking at,
but they keep on looking.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.800
So last time I suggested that what O'Connor asks us to see in her fiction is a

7
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:29.550
theological structure and a religious message.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.810
What I started to suggest at the end of class,

9
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.170
as I gave you the catalog of body parts lying around the text,

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.530
what I began to suggest is that if we actually see what we're looking at rather

11
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:52.071
than like Hay's not seeing what we're looking at,

12
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.580
we begin to see something that's harder to assimilate to that neat theology that

13
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:04.350
O'connor's letters and essays point us towards.

14
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.140
One kind of question then I was raising is what context do you use to read any

15
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.460
novel?
And today I'm going to suggest to actually,
well yes,

16
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:22.440
two additional contexts that we can look to,
to read the novel.

17
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.730
And I will,
uh,
I will let you know what those are when they,
when they come.

18
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:27.750
But be looking for that.

19
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.820
So 200 people show up to see esal hawks blind himself.

20
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.950
That's what we're told.
That's what the newspaper clipping tells us.

21
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.300
We show up to see O'Connor take her character's apart.

22
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.690
I began that catalog of body parts.

23
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:56.691
Today I'm going to extend and embellish the catalog of suffering and distortion

24
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.010
that we see in this novel.

25
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.220
And just to remind you of that catalog,

26
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:09.870
I just want to look at page 43 in your addition 47 in mine.

27
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.183
Um,

28
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.830
I noted that a lot of the potty body parts that we see in her pros are,

29
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.190
are parts of women's bodies.
Well,

30
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.930
the sense of the body as grotesque goes beyond just dismemberment.

31
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.250
There's a general ugliness of women that pertains in the novel.

32
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.420
And if you look on that page about in the middle,

33
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.410
this is Enoch describing his foster mother.

34
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.910
This woman was hard to get along with.
She wasn't old.

35
00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.170
I reckon she was 40 year old,
but she,
but she show was ugly.

36
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.650
She had,
these are brown glasses and her hair was so thin.

37
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:54.000
It looked like Ham gravy trickling over her skull.
Okay.

38
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.860
It's funny a little bit.

39
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.220
It's a picture as comparison heron gravy.
Um,

40
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.220
but it emphasizes that ugliness.
Now if you look on page 80,
um,

41
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.910
84 in my edition,

42
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.500
<v 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.440
<v 0>this is a woman climbing out of the swimming pool.</v>

44
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:17.580
Remember when Hays and Enoch are in the middle of the park at the swimming pool,

45
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:20.850
you know,
hiding in the bushes,
spying on the women.
Um,

46
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.040
here's one climbing out of the pool.

47
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

48
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.060
<v 0>First her face appeared at the bottom of the page.</v>

49
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.220
First or face appeared long and cadaverous with a bandage like bathing cap

50
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:38.221
coming down almost to her eyes and sharp teeth protruding from her mouth.

51
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.560
Then she rose on her hands until a large foot and leg came up from behind her

52
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.970
and another on the other side.
And she was out squatting there,
panting.

53
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.890
She stood up loosely and shook herself and stamped in the water dripping off of

54
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.570
her.
She,
she comports herself like a dog in this scene.

55
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.380
Okay.
So she shakes it as if she had for,
to shake.
Um,

56
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.310
but registered the weirdness of this sentence.

57
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.080
Then she rose on her hands until a large foot and leg came up from behind her.

58
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.380
It's as if they're sneaking up behind her.
It's as if they're separate from her,

59
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.150
not part of her body at all.

60
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.230
So even when you see O'connor describing the emergence of a body from the water,

61
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.981
a moment when you'd think the whole body would be most on view or most pertinent

62
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.950
to describe what you have is almost a distortion of our senses.

63
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.510
A distortion of vision,

64
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.460
so that we see even in a woman climbing out of the water,

65
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.840
her legs,
her feet as dismembered from the rest of her body.

66
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.930
<v 0>There is a critic at the University of Michigan.
Her name is Patricia Yeager.</v>

68
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.040
She wrote a very compelling argument about O'Connor's fiction,

69
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.000
not about wise blood in particular,
but about her stories.

70
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.570
And in that essay she argues that O'Connor's grotesqueness,

71
00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:11.810
especially the grotesqueness of the women,
uh,

72
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.870
figures in her novels is all wrapped up with a culture of southern womanhood.

73
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.040
It's a culture of beauty that requires all kinds of grooming practices to form

74
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:30.971
and shape the body in such a way that it can appear socially in a decorous way.

75
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.240
So Yeager argues that what we see in scenes like this is the registration of the

76
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:42.830
violence of those practices of beauty.

77
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.330
So she does not let these things sit in the text to be assimilated to a

78
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:55.230
theological structure,
but she brings them out.

79
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:57.460
And by reading things like,
um,

80
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.530
contemporaneous autobiographies from southern women that she's chosen from the

81
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:03.920
Canon,
um,

82
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.260
and just accounts of what was required of women,
etiquette and so on,

83
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.740
she weaves a reading of passages like this into that kind of context to suggest

84
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.700
that O'Connor's vision of violence has more to do with being a woman in the

85
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:26.861
south than it does with the stated religious concerns that O'Connor talks about

86
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.670
in her letters.
Now remember as I mentioned,

87
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.880
O'connor suffered from Lupus and she was disfigured by this disease especially.

88
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:42.590
She was on crutches for a long time and for periods of time could not walk at

89
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.930
all.
Her legs would swell up.

90
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.900
There's a lot of imagery of swelling,

91
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.110
of distortion and distension of the body that some critics point to her

92
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.160
biography to explain.

93
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.520
They look at her experience of her own body.

94
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.340
And when you think about Yeager's argument,

95
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.460
that kind of distortion of the body in the context of a social culture that

96
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:10.040
really emphasizes the control of a woman's body,

97
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.290
then you begin to see the power of the tension that we can read into moments

98
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:18.830
like this.
But I would suggest,

99
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.140
and actually Yeager suggest this too,

100
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.500
that the violence of southern culture goes way beyond just the violence of the

101
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.580
culture of femininity,
the culture of the southern woman.

102
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.540
And so let's look a little bit and extend the catalog.

103
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:41.090
Another category of violence we have is murdered children,
murdered,

104
00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.560
and also just generally neglected or abandoned children.

105
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.720
Enoch,
if you'll recall,

106
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:52.130
was traded by his father off to the Bible woman with the gravy hair.

107
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.820
So that bespeaks the pain.
And last time I,
I,
um,

108
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.380
read you a passage where Enoch begins to tell that story in this very pitiful

109
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.710
way.
I'm getting no sympathy from Hays.

110
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.000
So clearly he feels the abandonment from his father.

111
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.650
If you look at,
um,
page one 20,

112
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.580
in your addition one 22,
if anyone has mine,

113
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.210
this is a little story that Sabbath Lily tells to Hays while they are,

114
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.360
um,
supposedly seducing each other.

115
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.470
Don't try this on your next date.
I don't think it works very well.

116
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.120
So this was her story.
There was this child wants,

117
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:42.920
she said,
turning over on her stomach that nobody cared if it lived or died.

118
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.860
It's kin centered around from one to another of them.

119
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.390
And finally to his grandmother,

120
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.500
who was a very evil woman and she couldn't stand to have it around because the

121
00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:54.020
least good thing made her break out in these Wellbe's.

122
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.700
She would all itching and swole,

123
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.990
even her eyes would itch her and swell up and there wasn't nothing she could do,

124
00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.720
but run up and down the road,
shaking her hands and cursing.

125
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.060
And it was twice as bad when this child was there.

126
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.400
So she kept the child locked up in a chicken crate.

127
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.660
It seen it's granny and hellfire,
swollen burning.

128
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.820
And it told her everything I had seen.

129
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.290
And she got so swollen until finally she went to the well and wrap the well rope

130
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:22.890
around her neck and let down the bucket and broke her neck.

131
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.610
What'd you guess me to be 15 year old?
She asked seductively.
Okay.

132
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.220
Yes.
Very romantic story.

133
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:35.490
Sabbath tells to our friend Hayes,
um,

134
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.800
these images of babies abandoned here.

135
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:41.760
It's called an it.

136
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.380
Children are often called it in O'connor's fiction especially I would note if

137
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:50.970
they're,
if they're female children,
uh,
normally called it.
Um,

138
00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:56.420
Lily herself is a child who is completely unloved by her father.

139
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.820
Her father just wants to get rid of her and is willing to collude with her to

140
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:07.290
try to make,
uh,
to try to make Hayes take her off his hands.

141
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.980
And remember the story of her naming her mother gave birth to her on a Sunday

142
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.370
and right after she was born,

143
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.870
gave her the name Sabbath then turned on her side and died.

144
00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.430
So poor Lilly is also,
uh,
an orphan,

145
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:30.930
at least in the emotional sense.
Um,
if not in actual reality,

146
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.760
her father of course had run off from her mother.
Um,
uh,

147
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:39.600
right after she had gotten pregnant and then I suppose he came back.
Um,

148
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:45.030
so children are deeply abused and neglected.

149
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.740
What else do we have on two 31?
Just to add to this catalog,

150
00:10:49.741 --> 00:10:54.630
we have murdered,
abandoned,
neglected children.
We also have police brutality.

151
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.000
Um,
two 31.
Now,
let me see.

152
00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:01.110
I may not have gotten the right page number for you guys for this one.

153
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.440
This is right when Hays has been found in the ditch by the two policemen.

154
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:07.710
And maybe you recall it.

155
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.610
Hayes asks,
uh,
whether it's day or night,
this is bottom of two 30.
It's a day.

156
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:23.370
The thinner one.
The cop said,
looking at the sky,

157
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.960
we got to take you back to pay your rent.
I want to go on where I'm going.

158
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.810
The blind man said,
you got to pay your rent first.

159
00:11:30.811 --> 00:11:32.550
The policeman said every bit of it.

160
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.320
The other perceiving that he was conscious hit him over the head with his new

161
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:41.490
Billy.
We don't want to have no trouble with him.
He said,
you take his feet,

162
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.720
he died in the squad car but they didn't notice and took him on to the land.

163
00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:50.550
Ladies,
she had put him in her bed and when she had pushed them out the door,

164
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:54.370
she locked it behind them and drew up a street chair and sat down close to his

165
00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:58.510
face where she could talk to him.
Um,
here,

166
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.930
this image of a man obviously in indigent found on the road and then

167
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.800
gratuitously abused by the police echoes the earlier moment when the policeman

168
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:15.490
pushes his car off the road and,
and down the hill.

169
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.183
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.250
<v 0>These are instances where police are using their power utterly on their own</v>

171
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.930
authority with seemingly no check with point with,

172
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.490
with excess force.

173
00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:32.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:36.420
<v 0>Remember again,
this is the south.</v>

175
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:42.860
We all know that these kinds of violence,

176
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:49.010
official violence were part and parcel of southern culture towards African

177
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:51.683
Americans.

178
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:52.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

179
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.590
<v 0>What I think O'Connor is doing here is taking some of that reality and injecting</v>

180
00:12:59.431 --> 00:13:01.290
it into Hayes's narrative.

181
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:06.510
So these are the kinds of images that the civil rights movement really brought

182
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:10.740
to light here.
We see them in relation to Hays,

183
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.700
but overt racism is there too.

184
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.120
And if you look on page 67 in your book,

185
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.470
and this is on 71 in mine,

186
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:29.030
<v 1>yeah,</v>

187
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.230
<v 0>you will see that.</v>

188
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.980
<v 0>O'Connor does not hesitate to use the word nigger in the dialogue of her</v>

190
00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:40.280
characters.

191
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.420
Now the narrative voice does not use that word,

192
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.950
but here it is on the bottom of 71 her characters are perhaps typical poor

193
00:13:52.851 --> 00:13:57.210
southerners.
Well,
what do you want to pay for it?
The man asks,

194
00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.510
this is Hayes bises buying his Essex.

195
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.600
I wouldn't trade me a Chrysler for an Essex like that.

196
00:14:02.601 --> 00:14:05.360
That car yonder ain't been built by a bunch of niggers.

197
00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.930
All the niggers are living in Detroit now putting cars together.

198
00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.730
He said making conversation.

199
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.120
I was up there a while myself and seen I come home.

200
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.610
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

201
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.550
<v 0>she's invoking in a very casual way,</v>

202
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:24.510
the southern racism of the poorer white,
uh,

203
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.770
working and,
and uh,
working class.

204
00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:33.440
This is just part of her representation of the place,

205
00:14:33.441 --> 00:14:38.210
part of her representation of these characters.
It's a kind of realism of course.

206
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:42.500
Nevertheless,
there it is in front of us.
And again,

207
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:44.420
I call you back to that quotation.

208
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.350
What are we going to see when we look at the fiction?

209
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.660
Do we see what's in front of us?

210
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.930
So this is one of the things that O'Connor puts in front of us on page one 74,

211
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.130
uh,
again,
you check in and see if this is the same in your addition.

212
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.810
Generally annoyingly,
it's sometimes four pages different earlier.

213
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.780
Sometimes it's too,
so I tried to get them all,

214
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:13.850
but I think I didn't look this one up.

215
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.800
This is Enoch stealing the new Jesus.

216
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:25.470
He had dark his face and hands with Brown shoe Polish so that if you were seeing

217
00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:27.970
in the act he would be taken for a colored person.

218
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:32.230
Then he had sneaked into the museum while the guard was asleep and it broken the

219
00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:34.780
glass case with a wrench he borrowed from his landlady,

220
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.850
then shaking and sweating.

221
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.970
He had lifted the shriveled man out and thrust him in a paper sack and had crept

222
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:44.380
out again past the guard who was still asleep.

223
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.710
He realized as soon as he got out of the museum that since no one had seen him

224
00:15:49.841 --> 00:15:51.370
to think he was a colored boy,

225
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.570
he would be suspected immediately and would have to disguise himself.

226
00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:00.670
That was why he had on the black beard and dark glasses.
Okay,

227
00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:02.290
so there's a certain sense of humor here.

228
00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:07.291
So Enoch goes in black face to commit the crime so that if he seen he won't be

229
00:16:07.991 --> 00:16:08.920
taken for White,

230
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.660
but then he realizes a black person just by definition is suspicious.

231
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.190
So he has to now disguise himself from being a black person.

232
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.460
This is partly EasyKnock sort of craziness,

233
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.560
but the joke relies on the fact of racial profiling.

234
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.060
It relies on the fact that it's very plausible to think that at this moment in

235
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:37.090
the south,
to walk down the street as a black person,

236
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:42.130
to drive a car as a black person would be a risky endeavor in some places in the

237
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:45.760
city.
So it's a joke,

238
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:50.050
but it's a joke that rests on a very dark reality.

239
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:52.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

240
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.740
<v 0>So what you have then</v>

241
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:02.510
is a set of things that were put before us that we are asked in a way not to

242
00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:07.890
respond to.
Let's look at one more example.

243
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.590
This is on page one 59.

244
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.840
This is a silly example.

245
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.500
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

246
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.750
<v 0>this is when Hoover shouts and note,
um,</v>

247
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.540
in connection with my lecture last time I talked to you about pigs and why they

248
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:29.930
are pigs all over landscape.
Well,
whoever shouts a shout is a bay,

249
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.793
a little pig.

250
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.020
So she's continuing that metaphor with his name or that trope with his name.

251
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.840
This is a haze being approached by Hoover shouts,

252
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.370
my name is Hoover shouts the man with his head in the door growled.

253
00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.410
I known when I first seen you that you wasn't nothing but a crack pot.

254
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.940
He's opened the door enough to be able to slam it.

255
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.730
Hoover showed Scott his head of the way but not his thumb.
Uh,

256
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.400
how all arose that would have rented almost any heart.

257
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.860
Hayes opened the door and release the thumb and then slammed the door again.

258
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:13.740
How arose that would rent almost any heart.
What you want to ask about.

259
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:16.920
All these things that I'm putting in front of you are,

260
00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.280
are they supposed to rent our hearts?

261
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.520
I don't think we're meant to feel much for Hoover shouts here.

262
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.430
He's a figure of critique.

263
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.580
He's a figure of a of satire.

264
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.910
He's the charlatan preacher.

265
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.030
We're certainly not meant to identify with him or to sympathize with him,

266
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.740
but here you can't help but thinking about someone getting their thumbs smashed

267
00:18:50.581 --> 00:18:54.990
in the door and then it gets more intense.
Of course,

268
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.090
on page two oh six

269
00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.033
<v 1>okay,</v>

270
00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.700
<v 0>that's two Oh four and in this edition,</v>

271
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:05.570
<v 1>yeah,</v>

272
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.730
<v 0>when Hays commits murder,</v>

273
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.140
so here we have the murder scene

274
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:18.800
take off that suit.
Hayes shouted and started the car forward after him,

275
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.240
solace began to Lope down the road,
taking off his coat as he went,

276
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:27.590
take it all off.
Hayes yelled with his face close to the windshield.

277
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.680
The prophet began to run in earnest.

278
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:35.830
He tore off his shirt and unbuckled his belt and ran out of his trousers.

279
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:39.620
He began grabbing for his feet as if he would take off his shoes too,

280
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.150
but before he could get at them,
the Essex knocked him flat and ran over him.

281
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.790
Hayes drove about 20 feet and stopped the car and then began to back it.

282
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.210
He backed it over the body and then stopped and got out.

283
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.700
The ESIC stood half over the other profit as if it were pleased to guard what

284
00:19:58.701 --> 00:20:00.320
had had finally brought down.

285
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:05.830
The man didn't look so much like Hayes lying on the ground with his face on his

286
00:20:06.021 --> 00:20:08.360
face without his hat or suit on.

287
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:13.220
A lot of blood was coming out of him and forming a puddle around his head.

288
00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:18.790
He was motionless all but for one finger that moved up and down in front of his

289
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:21.470
face as if he were marking time with it.

290
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.980
Haze poked his toe and his side and he wheezed for a second and then was quiet.

291
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.200
Two things I can't stand.

292
00:20:30.201 --> 00:20:34.790
Hayes said a man that ain't true and one that mocks what is,

293
00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:38.540
you shouldn't ever have tampered with me if you didn't want what you've got.

294
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:43.700
The man was trying to say something,
but he was only wheezing.

295
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.120
Hey is squatted down by his face to listen.
Give my mother a lot of trouble.

296
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.410
He said through a kind of bubbling in his throat,
never give her no rest.

297
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.680
Stole their car,
never told true to my daddy.

298
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.520
Give Henry what never give up.
You shut up.
Hayes said,

299
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.930
leaning his head closer to hear the confession to old where it still was.

300
00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:09.850
Got $5 for it.
The men gasped.
You shut up now.
Hey said Jesus,

301
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.650
the man said,
shut up now.
Like I told you,
hey,
said Jesus,
help me.

302
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:19.540
The man we used,
Hayes gave him a hard slap on the back and he was quiet.

303
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:23.121
How many of you,

304
00:21:23.121 --> 00:21:28.121
when you read that felt like a character who mattered to you had died?

305
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:35.510
Just so you guys are exceptionally,
exceptionally sympathetic.

306
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.433
I commend you.

307
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.980
It's hard to feel too much for this prophet and I would argue that his

308
00:21:44.121 --> 00:21:47.930
confession at the end is part of what makes it quite difficult.

309
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.040
It's such a kind of trivial set of things that he begins to recite,

310
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.250
or at least he recites them in such a cliched way.

311
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.830
I gave my mother trouble.
I was a bad boy.
Uh,

312
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.130
I took some money to tell where the still was.

313
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.960
These are such sort of cliched southern Isms that you start to see this

314
00:22:15.381 --> 00:22:17.240
character as a caricature.

315
00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.760
He's very hard to see as a human being.

316
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.260
And yet I would contend that the part about the Essex actually running over him

317
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.440
is,
is quite compelling.

318
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.420
At least I feel it when I read it in a more abstract sense.

319
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:41.290
I feel the violence of it when I read those passages.

320
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.000
So there's a sense in which you have to ask,

321
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.670
is this meant to rand our hearts?
If Hoover shows thumb in the door,

322
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.370
doesn't quite do it.
Does this do it?

323
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.690
<v 0>Does southern racism do it?</v>

325
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.790
Does the dismemberment of women do it?

326
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.780
What is the point of putting these on the page?

327
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.750
And if you think about the way some bodies literally explode,

328
00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:15.610
think of the new Jesus.

329
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.800
Remember when Hays takes that little shriveled body from Lilly and throws it

330
00:23:23.441 --> 00:23:27.590
against the wall,
the head pops and outcomes,

331
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.230
dust and trash.

332
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

333
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.430
<v 0>If bodies are exploding here,</v>

334
00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:38.440
why are we not asked to care?
And if we aren't asked to care,

335
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.560
what is it that we're asked to do or to think in response to these things now.

336
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:47.970
Okay.
Patricia Yeager in her argument,

337
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.380
rejects what has typically been offered up as a way to account for these things.

338
00:23:52.381 --> 00:23:57.210
And that's the religious reading.
She says to dismiss that violence,

339
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.143
<v 1>it's</v>

340
00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.860
<v 0>into an old and comfortable theology is simply not to see it,</v>

341
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.060
not really to see it,

342
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:11.270
not to notice that O'Connor put it there in such a sharp and compelling form.

343
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.700
I want to change tack for a minute and now I'm going to veer into that second

344
00:24:18.701 --> 00:24:22.780
kind of context that I said I was gonna talk about today.

345
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:29.100
There is something else I think we're meant to see that is neither theology nor

346
00:24:30.881 --> 00:24:32.320
southern context.

347
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.830
And I want to show you that now by looking at chapter seven starts on one 15 in

348
00:24:40.121 --> 00:24:42.820
your book,
a one 17 in this edition.

349
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:47.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.810
<v 0>Just want to read the opening.</v>

351
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:55.811
I'm going to treat this chapter as a sort of microcosm of the book with respect

352
00:24:57.921 --> 00:24:58.970
to its craft.

353
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.800
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.390
<v 0>Let's look at how this opens.</v>

355
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:04.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

356
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.260
<v 0>The next afternoon when he got his car back,</v>

357
00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:10.640
he drove it out into the country to see how well it worked on the open road.

358
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.780
The Sky was just a little lighter blue than his suit.
Clear.

359
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:17.090
And even with only one cloud in it,

360
00:25:17.091 --> 00:25:20.300
a large blinding white one with curls and a beard.

361
00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.960
Notice that image of the cloud,
the blinding white cloud.

362
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.443
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.590
<v 0>It's very hard not to see it as a symbol.</v>

364
00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.140
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

365
00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.530
<v 0>What kind of symbol is it?
Well,
it's a god symbol.</v>

366
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:38.800
<v 1>It's</v>

367
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.800
<v 0>even got that typical children's book iconography of the curls and the white</v>

368
00:25:45.701 --> 00:25:46.690
beard.
Okay.

369
00:25:46.691 --> 00:25:51.340
So this is like your children's book representation of the Christian God,

370
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.970
and there it is as a blinding white cloud.

371
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.580
You wouldn't even need the curls and the beard.

372
00:25:59.150 --> 00:25:59.350
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.370
<v 0>If you just had the blinding in the white.
And of course,
uh,
as we go on,</v>

374
00:26:03.371 --> 00:26:06.810
as I'll show you,
the curls in the beard are pared away.
And your,

375
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.700
your left more with that blinding whiteness.

376
00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:10.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

377
00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:15.940
<v 0>So the blinding white cloud begins this chapter and what happens of course</v>

378
00:26:16.821 --> 00:26:21.290
thereafter as you'll remember,
is that lily pops up from the back seat.
Hi.

379
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:22.780
She,

380
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:27.780
he didn't know that she was there and she's got a hand full of Dandelions and

381
00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:33.780
she's painted her mouth read with lipstick and she's trying to seduce him.

382
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:39.570
And he had in fact given her this little,
um,
sort of seductive note,
um,

383
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.680
earlier suggesting that he wanted to seduce too.

384
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.830
And he still has in his mind that he should do this.

385
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:52.850
And his point is to do it so that he will prove that he needs no redemption and

386
00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.420
that there is no sin.

387
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.780
The problem here is that lily is interested in the seduction precisely because

388
00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:05.040
she sees it as a kind of sin.

389
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:06.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

390
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:11.510
<v 0>So if the,
to enter into this seduction,</v>

391
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.440
they do so agreeing on the same act,

392
00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.680
but completely diametrically opposed on its theological meaning or it's

393
00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:22.160
metaphysical meaning.

394
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:28.600
And so what you'll notice in this chapter is an extended example in one of the

395
00:27:31.101 --> 00:27:36.101
only extended conversations of the book of that phenomenon I talked about last

396
00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:39.090
time,
where the characters just,
uh,

397
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.320
don't seem to register the existence of the other person at all.

398
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:47.650
So Hayes,
as I argue last time,
is kind of insulated.

399
00:27:47.651 --> 00:27:50.770
Even his senses are insulated.
He can't hear things,

400
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.900
he doesn't see what's in front of him.

401
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.620
He doesn't seem to be in his context physically at all.

402
00:27:57.370 --> 00:28:00.340
He doesn't seem to register the pain of other persons.

403
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:05.290
Sometimes he doesn't even seem to register the existence of other persons.
Well,

404
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.790
this is an example.

405
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.500
This conversation have completely missed signals between the two of them.

406
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:18.120
Sabbath Lily tells the story of wrestling with her identity as a bastard.

407
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.490
And on one 19,

408
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.520
you get her account of her writing to the advice columnist Mary Brittle about

409
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:31.800
the problem of being a bastard.

410
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.010
And what kind of sexual play is appropriate for a bastard given the fact that

411
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:40.410
the Bible says a bastard shall not enter the Kingdom of heaven.

412
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:44.010
So she's trying to figure out really whether she should sleep with someone

413
00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:47.460
because you know,
what does she have to lose?
She can't get into heaven anyway.

414
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.680
So she says,
Dear Mary,

415
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:53.490
I am a bastard in a bastard shall not enter the Kingdom of heaven as we all
know.

416
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.820
But I have this personality that makes boys follow me.

417
00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.770
Do you think I should neck or not?

418
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.780
I shall not enter the Kingdom of heaven anyway,

419
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:05.760
so I don't see what difference it makes.
And then she writes back,
Mary,
brutal,

420
00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.840
dear Sabbath light necking is acceptable.

421
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.980
But I think your real problem is one of adjustment to the modern world.

422
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.250
Perhaps you ought to reexamine your religious values to see if they meet your

423
00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:21.840
needs in life or religious experience can be a beautiful addition to living if

424
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:24.420
you put it in the proper perspective and do not let it.

425
00:29:24.421 --> 00:29:28.590
I think this is a misprint.
Do you have there?
Uh,
I think it's warp.

426
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.270
Warp.
You read some books on ethical culture.

427
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:38.690
Clearly O'connor is offering us Mary Brittle as the butt of her critique.

428
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:45.770
The shallow modern thinking of the enlightened psychologically and ethically

429
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.660
modern person

430
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.220
Sabbath in this figure in this chapter is,

431
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.250
is an odd Christ figure.
She is a Christ figure.

432
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:05.251
Remember how she hides and skips from tree to tree in this scene when she's

433
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:09.310
teasing Hayes towards the end of it?
Well,

434
00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:14.311
that tree is also the image of the cross that uh,

435
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.460
that is,
um,
part of Christian tradition.

436
00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:24.030
There are lots of hymns that talk about the tree as the cross or the cross as

437
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:27.280
the tree,
um,
for example.

438
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.860
But it's the figure,

439
00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:34.180
the ragged figure that moves from tree to tree in the back of Hayes's mind.

440
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.850
That's the Christ that won't let him get away.

441
00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.220
So Lily actually embodies that Christ like figure.

442
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.020
So for all her
impurity,

443
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.263
<v 1>yeah.</v>

444
00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:54.290
<v 0>O'Connor presents her in contrast to marry brittle as understanding something</v>

445
00:30:57.691 --> 00:31:02.220
fundamental about the world and what's important in the world that,
um,

446
00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:06.570
that much more plausible people don't understand.

447
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

448
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:14.130
<v 0>So this is a moment when Sabbath tempt Hays back to belief and Hayes's</v>

449
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:23.250
meditation on or his wrestling with the question in this chapter of whether a

450
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:27.010
bastard can be in the church without Christ.

451
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.860
And he comes to that point where he says,
no,

452
00:31:29.861 --> 00:31:34.861
a bastard can't be part of the Church without Christ because the word bastard

453
00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:39.250
would just simply not mean anything.
So you can't say that

454
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:44.320
and it takes them a long time to wrestle with this as Sabbath.

455
00:31:44.321 --> 00:31:49.321
Lily talks to him and he comes to this moment and so when he comes to that

456
00:31:49.811 --> 00:31:50.710
conclusion,

457
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.150
he also rejects her advances.

458
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.770
It's coming to that conclusion that's so preoccupies him that he rejects her

459
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:04.540
advances Sabbath.
If she had been able to seduce him.

460
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.840
I want to suggest O'Connor I think is suggesting would have drawn him back into

461
00:32:11.321 --> 00:32:15.940
the realm of belief.
What leads,

462
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:18.850
what leads Hayes on

463
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.970
through this scene is that blinding white cloud.

464
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:30.390
Here it is as they decide whether to turn off the road and enter the field where

465
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:34.420
Sabbath,
we'll try to complete the seduction.

466
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.560
The blinding white cloud is a little ahead of them.
Moving to the left.

467
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.510
Why don't you turn that down?
That dirt road,

468
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:45.500
she asked the highway forked off onto a clay road and he turned onto it.

469
00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.520
It was hilly and shady in the country,
showed two advantage on either side.

470
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:51.440
One side was dense honeysuckle,

471
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.190
the other was open and slanted down to telescoped view of the city.

472
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.430
The white cloud was directly in front of them.

473
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.560
So here the city is at a distance.
We're in a pastoral space,
a beautiful space.

474
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:08.540
And this is all sort of under the guidance of this white cloud,

475
00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.860
this blinding white cloud.
And of course,
you know,
I don't have to say to you,

476
00:33:12.861 --> 00:33:15.590
I'm sure,
blinding white cloud.

477
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.910
Why is this the blinding white cloud?
Well,
this is all about blinding.
This book.

478
00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:26.390
It's about aces,
failed blinding of himself for Christ.

479
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.880
And it's about in the end finally Hayes's successful,

480
00:33:31.881 --> 00:33:36.050
blinding a kind of blinding that um,

481
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:41.080
I would argue were meant understand as a final clarity of vision that to be

482
00:33:42.171 --> 00:33:44.690
blind is to see properly.

483
00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:49.430
So the blinding white cloud has this cliched,
God had imagery,

484
00:33:49.431 --> 00:33:50.990
the curls and beard in the beginning.

485
00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.730
It takes on this leading aspect in the middle of the chapter.

486
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.160
And then if you look at the end,

487
00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:01.800
<v 1>yeah.</v>

488
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.770
<v 0>Uh,
this is at the very end of the chapter.
A few pages on</v>

489
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:11.480
this is after the man from the filling station has given haze some gas and not

490
00:34:12.571 --> 00:34:17.460
charged him for it,
a very unusual act of kindness in this novel.

491
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.180
Um,
he leaves the haze,

492
00:34:24.181 --> 00:34:28.140
drove on leaving the,
the man,
uh,
who has helped him.

493
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:33.680
The blinding white cloud had turned into a bird with long thin wings and was

494
00:34:34.861 --> 00:34:37.650
disappearing in the opposite direction.

495
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:43.740
There's a perfect circularity to this symbolism.
It's at the beginning,

496
00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.220
it changes in the middle and arrives at the end.

497
00:34:47.221 --> 00:34:52.221
And by the end it has changed from the cliched image of the Christian God to a

498
00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:58.680
less farcically cliched image of the Holy Spirit.

499
00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:02.940
The bird ascending the white bird.

500
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.490
It's moving in the opposite direction,

501
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:10.730
suggesting that haze in this scene has missed his chance.

502
00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.500
It was presiding over Sabbath.

503
00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:20.501
Lily's attempt to seduce and he was so absorbed in the question of whether a

504
00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:23.480
bastard could be in the church without Christ,

505
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.840
that he doesn't follow her into the sin that would in fact be the catalyst for

506
00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:34.730
his redemption.
And so the cloud departs at the end.

507
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.920
I have to say this is incredibly heavy handed.

508
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.450
If we think about the religious reading and think about religious symbolism,

509
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.610
this is hardly innovative.

510
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.963
<v 1>Okay,</v>

511
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:56.810
<v 0>and I would suggest to you that O'Connor,</v>

512
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.420
well,
I don't know,
did O'Connor know that it was heavy handed?
I don't know.

513
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.950
What is true about O'connor is that she was trained to write stories like this.

514
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.390
Flanner O'Connor,
and this is again that context coming in.

515
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:19.650
Flannery O'connor was a student at the Iowa writer's workshop,

516
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.090
very prestigious writing program.
Even then,

517
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.980
it was a very prestigious writing program.

518
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:32.150
There is a peculiarity for writing in the second half of the 20th century,

519
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.190
and here I'm drawing on another critic from Ucla.

520
00:36:35.191 --> 00:36:36.480
His name is mark [inaudible] girl.

521
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:42.170
He has argued that what is historically novel about this period

522
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:49.800
is that writers have consistently been located in universities.

523
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.370
They've been trained at universities.
They have taught at universities,

524
00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.080
they have gone to creative writing programs,
embedded within universities.

525
00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.260
They have held visiting positions,

526
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:09.980
they've done readings and they have written books whose primary readership is

527
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.340
around a seminar table or intellectual hall like this.

528
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:23.970
His argument is that a kind of formal structure characterized by the principle

529
00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.490
of unity,

530
00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:36.450
a formal structure that was in that simplified version that was at the very

531
00:37:38.651 --> 00:37:43.300
heart of the most powerful critical movement of the early 20th century and that

532
00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:47.110
is the new criticism.
The new criticism is a,

533
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:52.510
a way of reading that was has its roots in high modernism and it emphasizes the

534
00:37:56.051 --> 00:37:58.630
writers,
usually the poets,

535
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:03.960
the poets ability to create a beautiful whole consistent internally structured

536
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:15.600
literary object that stands outside of history in a certain way that is

537
00:38:18.341 --> 00:38:19.420
autonomous.

538
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

539
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.520
<v 0>and so this view of the artwork,</v>

540
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.560
probably you have experienced it if you've taken other English classes and in

541
00:38:30.561 --> 00:38:33.200
fact I've been producing it for you in my readings.

542
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:39.310
This motive reading looks for those tropes that unify a work.

543
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:45.690
It looks for that circularity that I've described in this little chapter tracks

544
00:38:46.781 --> 00:38:49.840
the symbols.
There's more to it than that.

545
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:52.300
It also looks for ambiguity.
Oh,

546
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:56.200
Connor says about her symbols that they should keep on deepening,

547
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:59.980
that they should never be reduced to a simple equation.

548
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.040
X Equals y cloud equals God,

549
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.120
that they should have a sense of mystery about them.
Well,

550
00:39:07.121 --> 00:39:11.140
this was part and parcel of what a new critical reading practice would look
like.

551
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.600
And it's still extremely powerful in our classrooms.

552
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.390
We do a lot of close readings now.

553
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:20.080
We put our close readings to different kinds of uses.
And Mark,

554
00:39:20.081 --> 00:39:25.081
my girl has done readings of lots of different novelists that reveal,

555
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:30.960
or his argument is that they reveal how the writing program and its tenants have

556
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.680
shaped contemporary fiction in a profound way.

557
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:41.550
The implications of this are large and important for how we understand the

558
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:42.484
period.

559
00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:44.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

560
00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:48.020
<v 0>So what you see in O'connor is,
uh,</v>

561
00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.790
to borrow a phrase from girls title,
uh,
on his,
uh,
his essay on this,

562
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.620
um,
Flannery O'Connor,
B a m f,
a,

563
00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:03.710
the product of a,
of a mid century American institution.

564
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:04.760
The writing program.

565
00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.160
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.870
<v 0>I would suggest,
and this is the third kind of context,
uh,</v>

567
00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:16.550
I want to give you today that the three I've given you

568
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:22.220
O'Connor's letters,
her theological commitments,

569
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.460
southern context,
southern social context,

570
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:30.560
the new critical writing program,
the institutionalization of modernism.

571
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:32.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

572
00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.580
<v 0>These things are not in fact separable from one another.</v>

573
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:37.670
<v 1>Okay.</v>

574
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.500
<v 0>Because in my own work,</v>

575
00:40:39.501 --> 00:40:43.640
I'm writing a book on religion and fiction since 1960.
Now,

576
00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:47.780
this is a little bit before this period,
but what I have discovered,

577
00:40:48.170 --> 00:40:52.370
what is really been known for a long time,
but nobody's really made much of it,

578
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:57.440
is that the new criticism is deeply religious in and of itself,

579
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.760
new critical writers of theory.

580
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.440
Many of them were in fact Catholic and many of them were southern.

581
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:12.790
There are social and religious elements that infuse their literary theory.

582
00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.490
So that to argue that the poem is this unified whole

583
00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.140
and that what you should do with a poem is show it's Honus read it in order to

584
00:41:28.341 --> 00:41:29.510
see its wholeness.

585
00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.440
See how it embodies a formal beauty,

586
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.330
a formal order.

587
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.560
This looks very much like the kind of metaphysical order that I was drawing out

588
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:47.711
of the Catholic version of what O'Connor's doing in her novels,

589
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:51.710
her version of what she's doing in the novels where you have that transcendent

590
00:41:51.711 --> 00:41:52.544
sky.

591
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.810
And there's this sense of an ordering that seeps down into the material world.

592
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:02.050
That moment when Hays thinks that he's somehow,
uh,

593
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:06.380
seeing broken off pieces of something that once happened to him.

594
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.700
There's this latent order everywhere.
And for O'connor,

595
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:13.340
it's part of this moral religious order,

596
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.930
this redemptive order that Catholicism,
uh,

597
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:19.100
is for her.

598
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.360
The new criticism sits in a kind of

599
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:28.790
a deep analogy to that way of thinking about religion.

600
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.300
That's why I think O'Connor founded so,
uh,

601
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:39.340
comfortable to learn and practice the new critical tenants of formal,

602
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.200
uh,
construction of the literary.

603
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.340
That's why she produced story after story after story that can be read in these

604
00:42:48.681 --> 00:42:53.681
formal ways with these symbols that accrue meaning and deepen and change over

605
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.080
the course of the novel or the story.

606
00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.750
So her commitment to the new criticism girl argues that,

607
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.590
um,

608
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:08.590
that O'Connor found the new criticism comfortable because Catholicism had taught

609
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:11.240
her to be obedient,

610
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:17.500
that it was a matter of obedience to a formula that allowed her to produce what

611
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:20.930
she produced on the page.

612
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.360
I would argue with differently that there is something in fact,

613
00:43:26.361 --> 00:43:31.361
religious about the new criticism that made it particularly comfortable for

614
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:34.100
O'connor two and habit.

615
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:43.200
Now I want to conclude by pointing you towards Lolita.

616
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:49.280
Today the question of torturing your own characters has come up.

617
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:55.170
Yeager calls it with respect to O'connor and aesthetics of torture.

618
00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:01.010
I want you to think hard about whether this is a way of understanding Lolita

619
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.590
when we read it,

620
00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:10.610
so have that in your mind and think about the ways that violence is or is not

621
00:44:11.791 --> 00:44:13.920
presented to us in Lolita.

622
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:19.980
The way that we're asked either to attend to language or to see through it,

623
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:25.560
ask those questions about whether we're being asked to identify with certain

624
00:44:25.561 --> 00:44:26.970
characters or not.

625
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:32.630
How is the distance between reader and character between reader and what's on

626
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:38.790
the page?
How's that mediated?
How's that policed?
How's that structured?

627
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:45.030
So think about that as you start to read Lolita.
Um,
I'm going to stop there.
