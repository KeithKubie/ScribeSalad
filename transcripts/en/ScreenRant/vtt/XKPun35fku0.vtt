00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.840
Pixar Animation Studios is the most successful
computer animated movie studio on the planet.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.690
A subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company, Pixar
has produced sixteen feature films to date

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.430
- pretty much all of which have been universally
acclaimed - and there are another five planned

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.391
over the course of the next three years.Pixar
can hardly put a foot wrong, and their movies

00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.230
have won countless awards - including multiple
Oscars.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.310
Their movies genuinely stand up to some of
the best non-animated offerings of all time,

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.800
but they are by no means flawless.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.480
Like any other movies, they contain mistakes
- some of which are pretty damn hard to spot

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.180
- and that's what this video's going to be
about.Here are ten shocking Pixar movie mistakes

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.780
you definitely missed.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.320
Inside Out
The brilliant and unique Inside Out is set

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.110
inside the mind of a young girl called Riley
Andersen, where five personified versions

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.410
of her emotions attempt to successfully navigate
her through life.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.750
Right at the start of the movie, when Riley
has just been born - in a scene that was used

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.829
for one of the movie's many TV spots - her
mother can clearly be seen to be wearing glasses,

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.269
but when her mother becomes visible from Riley's
own point of view, she suddenly isnt wearing

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.250
any - and there's really no way she could
have removed them in the time between the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.250
scenes.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.610
Ratatouille
In Ratatouille, there is a scene in which

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.170
food critic Anton Ego makes a negative remark
about Chef August Gusteau, comparing him to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.780
Chef Boyardee as an insult.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.450
However, although Chef Boyardee as a brand
is known for its pre-made canned pasta, the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.990
fact is that the real Chef Boyardee - whose
real name was Ettore Boiardi - was a top class,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.990
world famous chef.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.420
He was known for being the head chef at the
Plaza Hotel in New York City, and he even

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.619
catered for president Woodrow Wilson's wedding
in 1915.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.909
To use a comparison to him as an insult really
makes no sense whatsoever.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.840
The Good Dinosaur
The Good Dinosaur takes place on a fictional

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.350
Earth in which dinosaurs never became extinct,
so we can't pick out the usual dinosaur movie

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.860
mistakes, like how they shouldn't be co-existing
with humans or certain animals, but there

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.729
certainly are plenty of others.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.009
One example is when Spot, the young caveboy,
finds four other humanlike creatures and approaches

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.009
them.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.200
Arlo, the young Apatosaurus and the movie's
main character, is shown using his nose to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.729
draw a circle around them in a close-up shot.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.290
However, it is clearly shown in other shots
that he is standing much too far away from

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.560
them to be doing it.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.060
Monsters, Inc.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.690
In Monsters, Inc., when the main character
Sulley - voiced by John Goodman - runs into

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.870
the locker room to shove the toys from Boo's
room into a locker, it is clearly locker number

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.880
193 that he is seen putting them into and
slamming with both hands.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.660
However, when the camera angle changes, the
locker his hands come away from is, bizarrely,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.860
number 190, even though his hands absolutely
didn't move from one locker to another in

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.160
between the two shots.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.500
Cars
Cars follows the adventures of a number of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.580
anthropomorphic cars and vehicles - including
a stock car called Lightning McQueen, voiced

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.720
by the hilarious Owen Wilson.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.840
After Lightning catches up with a truck he
thought was his buddy Mack, he turns left

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.230
at a junction from what is clearly an asphalt
road.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.790
However, while the turn is actually taking
place, the shot seems to show the road as

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.550
being made from gravel or dirt.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.540
Apparently, a miraculous transmutation occurred
within a split second of the camera angle

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.480
changing.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.730
Brave
Set in the Highlands of Scotland in Great

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.010
Britain, Brave tells the story of a princess
named Merida - voiced by Kelly Macdonald - who

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.940
defies an age-old custom by expressing a desire
not to be betrothed.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.500
In one particular scene in the movie, when
her family are eating dinner, there's a blatant

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.560
factual error occurring.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.980
They're all munching down on potatoes, which
wouldn't have actually been possible.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.220
The movie is set in or around the 11th century
- in medieval times - and potatoes simply

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.700
weren't introduced to Scotland, or anywhere
else in Great Britain for that matter, until

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.520
around 500 years later.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.400
Up
There is a scene in Up in which the young

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.650
version of Carl Fredricksen breaks his arm
and an ambulance inevitably turns up to take

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:37.650
him to the hospital.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.890
This was when Carl was 8 years of age, which
would have been in the 1930s.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.790
Back then, ambulance sirens were mechanical,
but the siren that sounds in the movie is

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.980
a modern electrical siren, which wasn't actually
invented by Motorola employees Ronald H. Chapman

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.870
and Charles W. Stephens until 1965, around
thirty years after that scene would have taken

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.150
place.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.490
Toy Story 3
In the opening sequence of Toy Story 3, we

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.320
see Mr. Potato Head in his "One-Eyed Bart"
persona - One-Eyed Bart being a nefarious

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.960
bandit character that Andy often portrays
Mr. Potato Head as.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.480
Seconds later, Andy's mother walks into his
room with a video camera, and Andy even refers

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.100
to the character as "Bart" while making Woody
arrest him.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.932
The problem is, when Andy shows Mr. Potato
Head to the camera, he clearly and miraculously

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:20.932
has two eyes.

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:24.440
Not only did the second eye appear out of
nowhere, it also makes no sense that Andy

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.790
would be calling him by the name of a character
who's only supposed to have one eye.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.430
The Incredibles
In The Incredibles, there is a clipping from

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.900
a newspaper shown of an article that criticises
and condems superheroes.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.400
Under the headline "Super Menace To Society",
there is a paragraph with a mistake that can

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.930
only be put down to someone who worked on
the movie mishearing their instructions.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:50.040
The term "innocent bystanders" is actually
misprinted as "innocent by standards", which

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.700
really makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.120
Finding Nemo
Finding Nemo - a wonderful movie in which

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.630
the titular clownfish goes missing - is explicitly
set just off the coast of Australia, which

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.410
means that one character in the movie really
shouldn't be in it.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.650
That character is Nigel - a brown pelican
voiced by Geoffrey Rush.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.310
The problem with Nigel is that brown pelicans
- Pelecanus occidentalis, to get all technical

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.230
on you - don't exist in Australia.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.930
The only pelicans there are Australian pelicans,
otherwise known as Pelecanus conspicillatus.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.940
Brown pelicans are only found in the Americas
and if, somehow, one of them found its way

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.250
to Australia - which is incredibly unlikely,
if not absolutely impossible - then it would

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.170
undoubtedly be caught and destroyed, thanks
to Australia's extremely strict quarantine

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.170
laws.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.330
