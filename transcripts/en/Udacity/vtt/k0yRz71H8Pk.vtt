00:00:00.324 --> 00:00:03.939
&gt;&gt; Next, we're going to travel by the
internet all the way to Australia and

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:05.292
speak to Grahame Grieve.

00:00:05.292 --> 00:00:08.251
Who for many years was chief
technology officer of Castro,

00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.512
a laboratory information
systems company.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:14.529
Today, he is a consultant
on interoperability.

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.700
His company is called
Health Intersections.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.658
Well, Grahame, I want to thank you
very much for being with us today.

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:25.072
I know it's either early or
late in Australia.

00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:29.705
I'm not quite sure which, but can we
begin with your telling us a bit about

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:33.610
your background and what led you
into the world of standards?

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.430
&gt;&gt; Initially, I start working
as a laboratory scientist.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.374
After a stint doing that,
I got engaged with a vendor that

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:46.083
was selling information system.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.510
I transferred to working for them.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.568
For a number of years, I worked as
the development leader that vendor and

00:00:54.568 --> 00:01:00.920
much of the work that we did at the
vendor, maybe 80 to 90% of the work for

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.422
awhile was daily integration
of one kind or another.

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:10.287
I increasingly got involved with
the HL7 side of the integration

00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:12.414
with the clinical systems.

00:01:12.414 --> 00:01:17.788
And personally, more and more
interested in the standards community.

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:22.581
The community space and that lead me to
become more involved in actual service.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:27.128
And eventually, I left the vendor and
set myself up as a freelance

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:32.860
consultant contractor doing inter
offerability of various kinds.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.620
&gt;&gt; Well, that's interesting and
it makes sense, because as you and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.740
I both know clinical labs are among
the first entities in healthcare to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.489
adopt standards.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.990
So segueing forward all
the way to March 2011 and

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.950
what I view as a famous blog post
entitled The Rise and Fall of HL7,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.870
you said that we can create
complex standards, but

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.330
the market would ultimately reject them.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.465
Can you explain what you mean by that?

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:04.083
&gt;&gt; Well, we had spent at that stage,
10 or 15 years creating very

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:08.542
complex standards that set out
to define the nature of reality.

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:13.364
The natural meaning of
clinical information and

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:19.260
pursuit of getting full
control over that complexity.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.660
We had developed ever more
complicated specifications.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.390
The people just couldn't
make them work and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.080
the market had rejected the more
complicated variants of those.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.893
The implementation of it
cost billions of dollars,

00:02:36.893 --> 00:02:40.566
national programs that squandered
a great deal of money for

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:44.620
other reasons than that alone,
but definitely for that reason.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.594
Even the simpler ones now that
are going to market are going to have

00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:54.395
a very big market backlash,
that's quite evident right now.

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:59.692
And by that, I mean, CDA that,
it's got a real impotence in the market,

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:02.604
but impotence will generate reaction.

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:09.562
And it was clear that we could
continue pushing complicated

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:14.638
specifications, but
ultimately the market would say,

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:19.926
even if you impose this
[INAUDIBLE] government regulation,

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:26.503
we're not going to do it and I just
haven't needed to find a fresh approach.

00:03:26.503 --> 00:03:31.050
&gt;&gt; So in that same blog post
that you stated the problem,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.408
you proposed a solution around
JSON Web Services combined with

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:42.792
a simpler data model derived from the
RIM and this is come to be called FHIR.

00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:46.123
Can you explain what
FHIR is to the students?

00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:49.084
&gt;&gt; So we started by looking and saying,

00:03:49.084 --> 00:03:55.002
people out there who are looking out
there and doing interoperability and

00:03:55.002 --> 00:04:00.349
getting Getting kudos for
doing it well, how they do it and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.572
the answer was invariably,
restful web services.

00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:10.359
It's a mixture of a set of
technologies and a set of paradigms

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.827
about how information is exchanged
that make the solution simple,

00:04:16.827 --> 00:04:21.951
stable, easy to use and
a whole variety of contexts.

00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:26.247
And technically, very scalable.

00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:30.408
Also, there is a great deal
of solid collaboration,

00:04:30.408 --> 00:04:35.310
frameworks around security and
authentication and so forth,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.023
which have all developed
in support of the web.

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:42.084
FHIR is just taking those
base technologies and

00:04:42.084 --> 00:04:45.917
welding those with what we
know about health information.

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:51.197
About getting solid, reliable,
safe exchange of health information and

00:04:51.197 --> 00:04:56.057
just combining those two to produce
a easier to use specification for

00:04:56.057 --> 00:04:58.850
exchanging healthcare information.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.062
&gt;&gt; Well, to do that FHIR attempts
to define a subset of HL7 RIM

00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:10.123
that meets most day to day clinical
needs even for complex patients.

00:05:10.123 --> 00:05:14.440
And as I understand it, that's being
defined as standards really should be

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.250
through a collaborative process.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.415
Can you explain that process,

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:23.339
how is FHIR actually being
defined at the detail level?

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.906
&gt;&gt; Fundamentally it's
a nuturative process.

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:29.307
We have what are called
Domain Committees.

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:34.533
They're gatherings of domain
experts from around the world.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:41.848
In particular, clinical or business
process specialties within health care.

00:05:41.848 --> 00:05:46.388
We work with those
Domain Committees to clarify

00:05:46.388 --> 00:05:50.926
the requirements that are common and
shared and

00:05:50.926 --> 00:05:56.386
then we draft the standard
based on those requirements.

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:59.766
Then we work with a bunch
of implementation programs,

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:04.616
external programs, vendors and then
we hold connect-a-thons where anyone

00:06:04.616 --> 00:06:06.755
can come and try these things out.

00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:11.430
I have a bunch of different tryout
programs, where we iterate those to

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.677
where we think it's something that we
can actually use in the specification.

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:22.066
Then we as HL7 balance that,
which process where all HL7 members

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:26.890
can vote on the quality of
the standard and ask for changes.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.715
Once that's balanced and then we
publish that as a draft standards,

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:33.227
then the process starts again.

00:06:33.227 --> 00:06:35.698
Eventually, in a couple of years time,

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:39.925
we'll push it through to becoming
a full blown normative standard.

00:06:39.925 --> 00:06:44.175
But we're not in any hurry,
because we want to really run that

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:48.588
interaction cycle as much as we
can before we give it to normative

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:53.248
standards are not changeable and
everyone's committed to them and

00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:58.590
we want to get as much iteration done as
we can before that we get to that point.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.393
&gt;&gt; So, I'm sure that feedback
from actual adopters of FHIR is

00:07:03.393 --> 00:07:05.708
important to this process.

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:08.273
How is FHIR option going?

00:07:08.273 --> 00:07:13.734
How widely is it being used today and
are you pleased with where we're at?

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:17.272
&gt;&gt; When we first laid out
the project plan for FHIR,

00:07:17.272 --> 00:07:22.902
we expected that we would get a little
bit of adoption interest at this phase.

00:07:22.902 --> 00:07:27.110
We've just published a first draft,
it's effectively an early beta.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.760
We expected that we'd have a little
bit of engagement with a few users,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:40.430
particularly in the space of personal
health record access crossing the web,

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.850
because the target
technologies batch and

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.610
that personal health access, because
it's basically new space and there's not

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:55.370
a lot of established interfaces and
communities and ecosystems.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.947
It's not working out like that,

00:07:56.947 --> 00:07:59.889
we're getting a whole lot of
adoption in a whole lot of areas.

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.304
Suppose that we can deal with and

00:08:03.304 --> 00:08:09.131
it's really ten fold more
adoption than we expected.

00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:14.020
We didn't expect that,
just because of the change part that is

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.818
an early beater and that all of
the implementors need to accept

00:08:18.818 --> 00:08:22.898
that the specification is
still subject to change.

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:26.416
And therefore, the implementations
will have to deal with that.

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:29.534
We didn't expect that to be the case and

00:08:29.534 --> 00:08:33.693
it's just that the overall
advantages of FHIR are so

00:08:33.693 --> 00:08:37.947
compelling that it's driving
strong adoption now,

00:08:37.947 --> 00:08:42.783
rather than having people wait
to see how things developed.

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:47.074
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that you in the FHIR
community are in the right place at

00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:51.818
the right time, as adoption of digital
records has grown exponentially at

00:08:51.818 --> 00:08:56.810
least here in the United States where
the government is promoting it heavily.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.740
People are beginning to recognize that
with that interoperability, the benefits

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.723
of these systems or many of the benefits
won't really be recognized and so

00:09:06.723 --> 00:09:09.873
the attention is clearly
turning to interoperability and

00:09:09.873 --> 00:09:13.685
people are looking for a workable
solution and there you are with one.

00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:17.178
So congratulations, but
one final question.

00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:21.567
As you look out a few years, what do
you think we might be with respect

00:09:21.567 --> 00:09:25.965
to health data standards, FHIR and
interoperability in general?

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:32.079
&gt;&gt; I think first of all,
that data exchange is not something that

00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:37.732
solves any problems and
that's what we're working on.

00:09:37.732 --> 00:09:41.373
We're working to make
data exchange cheaper, so

00:09:41.373 --> 00:09:45.708
that it becomes just easier to
actually exchange data, but

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:50.210
the start of that comes
nearly from stretching data.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.001
Beyond that, once we can exchange data,

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:57.878
we need to have interoperable workflow,
interoperable paths of care.

00:09:57.878 --> 00:10:00.004
Right now, those things can't exist,

00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:02.639
because of data
interoperability blocks those.

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:08.560
So, I expect we'll have increasing
focus on clinical interoperability

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.954
rather than health information
interoperability and

00:10:12.954 --> 00:10:18.025
that will become more and
more evident over the next few years.

00:10:18.025 --> 00:10:23.251
Looking past that, I would really
like to see an environment

00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:28.690
where healthcare data availability
is no longer the problem.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:33.708
Right now, it's a big problem for
people within the healthcare process,

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:38.091
the providers of the healthcare and
a big problem for consumers,

00:10:38.091 --> 00:10:42.094
although a lot of them aren't
even able to recognize that.

00:10:44.492 --> 00:10:50.489
I'd like to take that away, so the
question is no longer data availability,

00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:52.720
but what do you do with that?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.362
I think that we'll increasingly
see the adoption of health two,

00:10:59.362 --> 00:11:04.302
which people often call patient
centered healthcare that

00:11:04.302 --> 00:11:07.439
does depend on facile information.

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:12.464
I think that we will see
aggregation towards a number of

00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:18.256
very few providers of very large
healthcare record systems and

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:23.174
a huge differentiation in
the provision of access and

00:11:23.174 --> 00:11:27.654
control and
exchange of the information between

00:11:27.654 --> 00:11:32.259
the various records on
the very large providers.

00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:40.195
And those very large providers
will probably aggregate

00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:45.687
out of consortiums of large
healthcare provider networks,

00:11:45.687 --> 00:11:50.209
which I forward there and
or national programs and

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:55.074
it'll probably cross
jurisdictional boundaries.

00:11:55.074 --> 00:11:59.202
Those are the things that we're
starting to see happen now, but

00:11:59.202 --> 00:12:02.879
they are still a long,
long way away from being reality.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:07.632
&gt;&gt; Well, I think you're absolutely right
on all and I particularly like your

00:12:07.632 --> 00:12:11.178
comments earlier on about
the need to develop better and

00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:14.741
more standardized clinical processes and
workflows.

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:19.347
That is clearly going to be
the next challenge after we have

00:12:19.347 --> 00:12:22.169
sufficiently standardized data.

00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:25.467
It's been great chatting with you.

00:12:25.467 --> 00:12:29.520
I'm sure the students have gained
a lot from this discussion and

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.446
I can only thank you again for
taking the time,

00:12:32.446 --> 00:12:36.295
either very early or very late
in your day to be with me today.

00:12:36.295 --> 00:12:37.141
Thank you very much.

00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:38.135
&gt;&gt; Pleasure.

00:12:38.135 --> 00:12:38.920
Thank you.
