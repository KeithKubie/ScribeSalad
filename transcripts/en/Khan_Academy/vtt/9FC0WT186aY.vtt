00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.947
- [Voiceover] We've
got three bananas here.

00:00:02.947 --> 00:00:04.373
One, two, three.

00:00:04.677 --> 00:00:06.430
So I'm starting with three bananas

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.057
and I want to add some number of bananas

00:00:10.057 --> 00:00:12.687
so that I end up with 10 bananas.

00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:13.848
So this is what I'm starting with.

00:00:13.848 --> 00:00:15.090
I'm starting with three

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.157
and I want to end up with 10.

00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:19.153
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:20.649
eight, nine, ten.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:24.134
So what do I have to add to the three

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:25.979
to get to 10?

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.779
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.133
and try this out on your own.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.617
So let's work through this.

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.615
So let's just start adding bananas.

00:00:35.615 --> 00:00:36.666
So that's three.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:41.279
So now let me add a fourth.

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:43.298
That would be my fourth banana.

00:00:43.997 --> 00:00:45.701
Five bananas.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.244
Six bananas.

00:00:48.803 --> 00:00:50.461
Seven bananas.

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:52.400
Eight bananas.

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:54.977
Nine bananas.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.659
And ten bananas.

00:00:57.997 --> 00:00:59.715
So how many bananas did I add?

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:02.258
So now I added some
number of bananas here.

00:01:02.258 --> 00:01:04.835
So in total I have one,
two, three, four, five,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.282
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:10.377
So how many did I have to add to the three

00:01:10.377 --> 00:01:14.575
in order to get to the total of 10

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:16.500
in order to get this 10 right over here?

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:18.218
We could just count these.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:22.155
This is one, this is two, this is three,

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:26.983
four, five, six, seven.

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:29.694
I added seven bananas.

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:34.906
I added seven bananas to
the original three bananas

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:36.276
to get to 10.

00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:38.791
So three plus seven is equal to 10.

00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.914
And you can see that what
we have on this left side

00:01:41.914 --> 00:01:44.561
is indeed equal to what
we have on the right side.

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:47.161
On the left side we have
one, two, three, four,

00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:49.750
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten bananas

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.780
and on the right hand side
we have one, two, three,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.889
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:01:55.938 --> 00:01:58.954
So they are indeed equal.
