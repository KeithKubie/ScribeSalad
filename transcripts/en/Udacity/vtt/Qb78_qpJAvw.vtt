00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.170
Now, there's actually another property of sound that we haven't talked about.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.893
And that property is called timbre. So, let me give you an example of this. I'm

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:10.420
going to play a couple of sounds for you. So, first little to this.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.048
[SOUND].

00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:13.314
And now, listen to this. [SOUND].

00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:14.672
Could you tell the difference?

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:17.095
&gt;&gt; Yeah, One was a guitar and one was a piano.

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:19.999
&gt;&gt; Now, there's interesting that you could distinguish because they both had the

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.904
exact same pitch. And they had the same volume. So, this difference between the

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:26.450
sounds is what's called timbre.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.508
&gt;&gt; So, this is basically the difference in the quality of the sound.

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:32.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could think of it like that. Which sort of leads to the next

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.445
question.

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:36.670
&gt;&gt; Is that what property the sound wave makes as perceived timbre?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.935
&gt;&gt; Right. And it's the wave's complexity.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:43.406
&gt;&gt; That's the property of the sound wave that let's us perceive timbre. And what I

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:47.140
mean by that is like this like this, this is what we would call a pure wave.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.730
[SOUND].

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.799
But some waves are complex, like this one.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:51.384
[SOUND].

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:56.354
And it's this complexity that allows us to perceive a wave's timbre.

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:58.914
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think this makes sense, but it's a lot of information, let me make sure

00:00:58.914 --> 00:01:00.154
I understand.
