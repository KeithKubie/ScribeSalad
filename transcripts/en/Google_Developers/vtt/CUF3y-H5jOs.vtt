00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:09.400
Brian: Where are we?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.000
Ben: This is
the last stage of the journey.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.167
We finally made it.
This is it.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:13.701
Brian: How do we know
this is the place?

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.901
Ben: This is where
he writes his code, I'm sure.

00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:17.400
It's where the emails
have been coming from.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.667
Brian: are you sure?
Ben: Yeah.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.434
We've been tracking
his IP address right here.

00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:23.934
This has gotta be the building
where the genius lives.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.534
Brian: This is private property.
I don't think we should be--

00:00:25.534 --> 00:00:26.634
Wait, where are you going?!

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:27.734
Ben:
No one's ever seen him.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:28.968
Brian: We can't go in there.

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:30.033
Ben: We've gotta find
him--come here.

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.734
Oh, my God! Look at this.
Brian: Wow.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:32.901
Ben: I don't know if
we're supposed to be--

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.234
Brian: This is really freaky.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.000
Ben: No, come on.
Down here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.067
You know, he works alone.
I'm sure of that.

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:41.567
Brian: Wait, so who reviews
his code?

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:42.934
Ben: Nobody reviews his code.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.200
What do you think, we're worthy?
He's a genius.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.567
I mean,
he's all over the internet.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.200
Brian: But he works
with a whole team.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.067
I mean, what if he gets stuck
down a rat hole?

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.033
Ben:
You think he wants feedback?

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.400
I mean, that's ridiculous.
Who's gonna give him feedback?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.501
You know what happened
to the last guy

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:55.667
who gave him feedback?

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.367
Do you remember what happened?

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.567
Wait, wait.
This could be it.

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:02.000
No, wait.
I hear something in here.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.367
I hear something.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.234
We're gonna go in.
Are you ready?

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:06.501
Are you ready?
You gonna come with me?

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:07.501
Ben: We need to go.
Brian: You gonna go first?

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.634
All right, I'm going in.
Ready?

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.234
Let's go.

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:11.701
Oh, my God!
Genius: Who are you?

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.868
Brian: Are you the genius?
What are you working on?

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:15.100
&gt;&gt; He's writing code,
I'll bet.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.200
Genius: Hey, no, stop.
Don't look at that!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.267
Get out of here!
