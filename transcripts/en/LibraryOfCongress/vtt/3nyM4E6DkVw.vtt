00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.330
&gt;&gt; The Law Library of Congress
has an account of many trials

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.500
in its rare book collection.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.800
This is an account of the
trial of Richard Lawrence

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.370
for his attempt on the life
of President Andrew Jackson.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.330
This item was printed by
William Mitchell, who operated

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.320
out of 265 Bowery
in New York City.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.500
Mitchell printed a variety of
titles in the 1830s and took

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.760
on a partner in 1837
named Turner.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.390
Other Mitchells continued to
operate out of the same address

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.560
into the late 19th Century.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.890
On January 30, 1835, an
unemployed painter by the name

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.760
of Richard Lawrence made the
first attempt on the life

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.500
of a sitting U.S. President,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.120
President Andrew Jackson
President Jackson had traveled

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.480
to the Capitol Building

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.780
to attend a Congressional
funeral in the House Wing.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.430
As the President
exited the funeral,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.410
he approached the east
portico of the Capitol.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.930
Lawrence drew a pistol
from his pocket and fired,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.240
but only the cap fired.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.790
Even though he was 67
and in poor health,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.880
the President charged
Lawrence with a cane.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.320
Before the President
could reach him,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.350
Lawrence produced a second
pistol and pulled the trigger.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.630
This pistol also misfired,
allowing the President

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.610
to reach Lawrence, who
ducked to avoid being struck

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.430
by the President's cane, which
is what you see depicted here.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.730
The President reportedly
yelled, "Let me alone!

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.030
Let me alone!

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.860
I know where this came from."

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.750
Lawrence was then
subdued by onlookers

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.490
and the President was taken by
carriage to the White House.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.850
The political environment of
the time was highly charged due

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.900
to the President's veto of the
bill to reauthorize the charter

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.800
of the Second Bank
of the United States.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.160
Some believed Lawrence was the
instrument of a Whig conspiracy,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.560
including the President himself.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.880
Despite these early claims,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.100
scholars now believe
Lawrence acted alone

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.480
and of his own accord.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.030
Lawrence claimed that the
President had killed his father,

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.980
a claim that was quickly
revealed to be false.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.720
Lawrence also said he
was King Richard the III,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.750
and the President's
opposition to the Second Bank

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.570
of the United States had
denied him the ability

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.110
to receive a dispensation
owed to him by Congress

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.670
To bolster his claim
he was a monarch,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.210
Lawrence dressed the
part of royalty at trial,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.260
sporting a shooting
jacket and cravat

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.480
that you see depicted here.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.940
He also expressed some
indignation at the fact

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.400
that he was being
judged by commoners.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.090
After the jury was instructed,
Lawrence said, "It is for me,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.180
gentlemen, to pass upon
you, and not you upon me."

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.510
The jury found Lawrence not
guilty by reason of insanity

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.580
and he was confined to an
asylum for the remainder

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.200
of his life before
passing away in 1861.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.510
