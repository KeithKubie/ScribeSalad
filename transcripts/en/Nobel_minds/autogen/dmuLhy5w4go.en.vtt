so my name is Kip audience on I'm a
 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.380
so my name is Kip audience on I'm a
mechanical engineer from Copenhagen

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
mechanical engineer from Copenhagen
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.540

visiting the nobel museum as a tourist

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
visiting the nobel museum as a tourist
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.000
visiting the nobel museum as a tourist
today I'd like to ask a question of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
today I'd like to ask a question of
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.350
today I'd like to ask a question of
forwards it's a universe hoped thank you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
forwards it's a universe hoped thank you
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.230
forwards it's a universe hoped thank you
I can you're asking is the universe

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
I can you're asking is the universe
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450
I can you're asking is the universe
curved the answer is yes in four

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
curved the answer is yes in four
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.580
curved the answer is yes in four
dimensions Einstein showed us that in

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
dimensions Einstein showed us that in
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.349
dimensions Einstein showed us that in
four dimensions space and time are

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359
four dimensions space and time are
 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.420
four dimensions space and time are
curved by the action of gravitation

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
curved by the action of gravitation
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.640
curved by the action of gravitation
which comes from the presence of mass or

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
which comes from the presence of mass or
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.130
which comes from the presence of mass or
mass and energy and so yes in four

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
mass and energy and so yes in four
 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.620
mass and energy and so yes in four
dimensions the universe is curved but if

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
dimensions the universe is curved but if
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600
dimensions the universe is curved but if
you would take the three-dimensional

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
you would take the three-dimensional
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.979
you would take the three-dimensional
slice of the universe where all of the

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989
slice of the universe where all of the
 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.060
slice of the universe where all of the
space that you're thinking about is the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
space that you're thinking about is the
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.569
space that you're thinking about is the
same time after the Big Bang then that

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
same time after the Big Bang then that
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610
same time after the Big Bang then that
space that three-dimensional space is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
space that three-dimensional space is
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860
space that three-dimensional space is
flat in other words in that space the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
flat in other words in that space the
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750
flat in other words in that space the
sum of the angles of the triangle is 180

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
sum of the angles of the triangle is 180
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.209
sum of the angles of the triangle is 180
degrees it's a bit of a surprise but a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219
degrees it's a bit of a surprise but a
 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799
degrees it's a bit of a surprise but a
wonderful discovery of very recent

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809
wonderful discovery of very recent
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900
wonderful discovery of very recent
measurements that we were able to answer

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
measurements that we were able to answer
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.840
measurements that we were able to answer
your question that way
