00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.400
another kind of weather more traditional

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.189
way to think about whether is what the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.170
air is doing on planets that have

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.019
atmospheres and moon doesn't have an

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.519
atmosphere so we don't think about him

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.400
whether Mars has an atmosphere jupiter

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.080
has an atmosphere Saturn Uranus Neptune

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.310
a couple of moons have atmospheres so so

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.330
when you study those you see interesting

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.010
patterns you see storms you see Eddie's

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.559
which are these are tiny littles spiral

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.350
patterns of air that might be their

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.600
version of a tornado and so I think you

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.670
can only really deeply understand

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.579
whether on earth once you study the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.620
weather on other planets a planet that

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.620
rotates faster than Earth when rotates

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.359
less fast when it has higher gravity

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.850
lesser gravity and you can see the full

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.140
range of how weather takes shape in the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.729
full spectrum of planets that are out

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:09.810
there and then you find out where earth

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.409
fits

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.900
hello that's why that's that way because

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.700
this is what happens in that extreme and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.900
that's what happens in the other extreme

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.090
so that's really what

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.830
when I think of space whether that's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.049
what i would like to reflect on

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.020
tornadoes are way more fun and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.390
snowstorms and if you just watching

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.820
weather phenomenon tornadoes or are any

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.210
seni cyclone just to think about the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.549
energy it contains and what it's doing

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.049
with that energy

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.720
what in the weather system was the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.110
precursor conditions to that storm way

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.299
more fascinating to study the snowflakes

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120
coming out of the sky

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:57.459
