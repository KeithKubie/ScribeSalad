we are seeing now climate impacts that

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
we are seeing now climate impacts that
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.180
we are seeing now climate impacts that
are tremendously costly and tremendously

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
are tremendously costly and tremendously
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.059
are tremendously costly and tremendously
challenging and EPA's role is to try to

challenging and EPA's role is to try to
 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.000
challenging and EPA's role is to try to
make turn that challenge into a positive

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
make turn that challenge into a positive
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.249

recognize that the time for action is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
recognize that the time for action is

recognize that the time for action is
now so in many ways the the problem that

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
now so in many ways the the problem that
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.540
now so in many ways the the problem that
we had in the past was twofold people

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550
we had in the past was twofold people
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.689

that might happen but it's taken so long

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180
that might happen but it's taken so long
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.030
that might happen but it's taken so long
to take action those predictions are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
to take action those predictions are
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.069
to take action those predictions are
already here and frankly we never

already here and frankly we never
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.590
already here and frankly we never
predicted the kind of impacts that we

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
predicted the kind of impacts that we

kind of big debate you know the big

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
kind of big debate you know the big
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.720
kind of big debate you know the big
debate among the scientists is that

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
debate among the scientists is that
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.119
debate among the scientists is that
seven ninety seven percent of them know

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
seven ninety seven percent of them know
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100
seven ninety seven percent of them know
it's happening and are really worried

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
it's happening and are really worried
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.770
it's happening and are really worried
about it three percent are skeptical

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
about it three percent are skeptical
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.369
about it three percent are skeptical
that's not a balance that's an

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379
that's not a balance that's an
 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.229
that's not a balance that's an
overwhelming majority and that needs to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
overwhelming majority and that needs to
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.140
overwhelming majority and that needs to
drive the decision especially in a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
drive the decision especially in a
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.270
drive the decision especially in a
democracy that's how we work with

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
democracy that's how we work with
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.969
democracy that's how we work with
working really hard with faith leaders

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
working really hard with faith leaders
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950
working really hard with faith leaders
in this country because many of the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960
in this country because many of the
 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050
in this country because many of the
people listen to their faith leaders for

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
people listen to their faith leaders for
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.910
people listen to their faith leaders for
direction and the faith leaders are

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
direction and the faith leaders are
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.370
direction and the faith leaders are
extremely concerned that climate change

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
extremely concerned that climate change
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399
extremely concerned that climate change
is an issue which most importantly and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
is an issue which most importantly and
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200
is an issue which most importantly and
more significantly impacts low-income

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
more significantly impacts low-income
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.929
more significantly impacts low-income
and minority communities the least of

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939
and minority communities the least of
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.840
and minority communities the least of
these are going to be the most impacted

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
these are going to be the most impacted
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120
these are going to be the most impacted
in a changing climate so we are moving

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
in a changing climate so we are moving
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.080
in a changing climate so we are moving
with with an ecumenical constituency in

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
with with an ecumenical constituency in
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969
with with an ecumenical constituency in
the faith community to bring this

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
the faith community to bring this
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219
the faith community to bring this
message to their constituents and it's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
message to their constituents and it's
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.830
message to their constituents and it's
extremely important to recognize your

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
extremely important to recognize your
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.190
extremely important to recognize your
own limitations about who who you're

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200
own limitations about who who you're
 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.530
own limitations about who who you're
good at talking to and who's going to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
good at talking to and who's going to
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.810
good at talking to and who's going to
believe you and who the people you're

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
believe you and who the people you're
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.450
believe you and who the people you're
trying to influence listen to because we

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
trying to influence listen to because we
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.510
trying to influence listen to because we
can talk all we want about the science

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
can talk all we want about the science
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450
can talk all we want about the science
at EPA but you need to put that into

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
at EPA but you need to put that into
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090
at EPA but you need to put that into
people's homes and ears in a way that

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
people's homes and ears in a way that
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.249
people's homes and ears in a way that
they're going to listen absorb and know

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
they're going to listen absorb and know
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.609
they're going to listen absorb and know
they can be part of the solutions moving

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
they can be part of the solutions moving
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.219
they can be part of the solutions moving
forward that gets them off the diamond

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
forward that gets them off the diamond
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.390
forward that gets them off the diamond
bills the constituency's you need to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400
bills the constituency's you need to
 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.699
bills the constituency's you need to
exceed and something this is that is

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709
exceed and something this is that is
 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.130
exceed and something this is that is
really as big as this the challenge of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
really as big as this the challenge of
 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.850
really as big as this the challenge of
climate change is enormous for us and so

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860
climate change is enormous for us and so
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.710
climate change is enormous for us and so
you need to attack that from all

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720
you need to attack that from all
 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.509
you need to attack that from all
different angles and make sure to get

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519
different angles and make sure to get
 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.089
different angles and make sure to get
everybody engaged I don't need to fight

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099
everybody engaged I don't need to fight
 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.940
everybody engaged I don't need to fight
the climate deniers now that's not what

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950
the climate deniers now that's not what
 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.610
the climate deniers now that's not what
I think we need the rallying cry needs

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620
I think we need the rallying cry needs
 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.130
I think we need the rallying cry needs
to be what actions do we take that are

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
to be what actions do we take that are
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.770
to be what actions do we take that are
going to address climate both from you

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780
going to address climate both from you
 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.750
going to address climate both from you
know we need to mitigate and make sure

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
know we need to mitigate and make sure
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.970
know we need to mitigate and make sure
that we're reducing those impacts but

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
that we're reducing those impacts but
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.890
that we're reducing those impacts but
also let's do it in a way that grows a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900
also let's do it in a way that grows a
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.530
also let's do it in a way that grows a
low-carbon economy let's make the united

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540
low-carbon economy let's make the united
 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.319
low-carbon economy let's make the united
states flourish because we stood up to

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329
states flourish because we stood up to
 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.620
states flourish because we stood up to
this problem and we took action
