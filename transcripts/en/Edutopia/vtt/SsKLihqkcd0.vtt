00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:03.446
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, friends, who
wants to do the breathing technique?

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.936
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: One of the things
that actually improves the architecture

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:10.126
of the brain is movement and
physical activity. In this classroom,

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.486
you can really see the
mind-body connection

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:16.036
and how both the mindfulness activities

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:19.426
and the movement activities
allow children

00:00:19.556 --> 00:00:24.376
to free their brains and
be prepared to learn.

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:48.236
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: Throughout the
morning, we'll either stop

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:51.396
and do a breathing technique,
some kind of mindfulness strategy,

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:56.056
or a movement break understanding
that, one, little kids can't attend

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.976
for that long, or be
still for that long. Two,

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:02.046
if we do have a certain percentage
of kids with toxic stress,

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:05.306
they have high amounts of
cortisol and the way to release

00:01:05.306 --> 00:01:06.756
that is through physical movement.

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:11.396
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: Cortisol, and a fight
or flight reaction, will make it hard

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:13.866
to pay attention to learning.
Very often,

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:19.276
practices like movement breaks enable
children to get more self-regulated

00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.876
and calmer, and therefore
open to a learning experience.

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:28.626
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Many teachers will lead
activities themselves. Some will project

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:31.636
images and using a person
onscreen who helps take kids

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:33.276
through a different movement activity.

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:36.076
&gt;&gt;Student: First we are
going to do the pretzel.

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:43.556
&gt;&gt;Falon: So they got to do the pretzel.
So they breath in, deep inhale, exhale,

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:50.736
deep inhale, exhale. Basically,
just to relax them, calm them down.

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:53.796
&gt;&gt;Student: Next we are going
to do the breathing ball.

00:01:55.286 --> 00:01:58.296
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: Our PE teacher and
our yoga teacher that we contract

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:01.036
with have also taught the teachers
different strategies to use,

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:04.426
and so you'll see them
implementing that throughout the day.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:07.876
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Sometimes you may feel
nervous, you may feel a little anxious,

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:13.406
you may not know what to do, but you can
always stop, take a deep breath, and...

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:14.750
&gt;&gt;Student: Relax.

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:15.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Relax.

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:18.266
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: This idea of children
sitting for long periods of time,

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:23.646
they aren't naturally wired to do that.
So rather than put them in a position

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:28.126
where they have to act out to
demonstrate that they need to be able

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:33.086
to move, building in movement
breaks means that they will get some

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:38.036
of the stress relief, some of the
energy release that they need in order

00:02:38.036 --> 00:02:41.236
to be able to get calm again
and pay attention to learning.

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:45.896
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: In fact,
physical activity is equally important

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:49.566
for adolescents and adults
to keep the mind clear,

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.976
to relieve stress, to be ready to learn.
