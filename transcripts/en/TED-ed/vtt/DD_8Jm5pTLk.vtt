00:00:13.895 --> 00:00:14.819
When I was a kid,

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:16.127
my understanding of the seasons

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:18.124
was that December and January were cold

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:19.634
and covered with snow,

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:21.970
April and May were bursting with flowers,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.571
July and August were hot and sunshiny,

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.770
and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.234
It was just the way the world worked,

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:31.901
and it was magical.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:33.319
If you had told me back then

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:35.193
that one-third of Earth's population

00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:36.862
had never seen snow

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:40.741
or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day,

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.403
I would have thought you were crazy.

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:45.412
But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.040
only happens in two regions on the planet.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.044
And, even in those two,

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:50.583
the seasons are reversed.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.584
But why?

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.421
A lot of people have heard of an astronomer

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:54.895
called Johannes Kepler

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.343
and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical

00:00:57.343 --> 00:01:00.093
and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.011
It was a big deal when he figured this out

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:03.346
several hundred years ago.

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:05.890
His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.175
that astronomers were having

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:09.166
with planetary orbit measurements.

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.318
While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular,

00:01:12.318 --> 00:01:14.274
those pictures in our science books,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.774
on TV, and in the movies

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.113
give an exaggerated impression

00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:19.355
of how elongated our orbit is.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:22.741
In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle.

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:25.785
However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse,

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:27.370
even though it doesn't look like one,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.867
and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center,

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:31.459
it means that our distance from the sun

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.125
does change through the year.

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.108
Ah-ha!

00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:37.504
So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun!

00:01:37.504 --> 00:01:39.337
Well, no, not so fast.

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:41.405
The Earth is actually closer to the sun

00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.315
in January than we are in July

00:01:43.315 --> 00:01:45.764
by 5 million kilometers.

00:01:45.764 --> 00:01:48.023
January is smack-dab in the middle

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:49.649
of the coldest season of the year

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.261
for those of us up north.

00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:52.398
Still not convinced?

00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:53.524
How about this:

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.607
Summer and winter occur simultaneously

00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:57.233
on the surface of our planet.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.572
When it's winter in Connecticut,

00:01:58.572 --> 00:02:00.194
it's summer in New Zealand.

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:01.822
So, if it's not the distance from the sun,

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.111
what else could it be?

00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:04.533
Well, we need to also need to know

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:06.325
that the Earth doesn't sit straight up.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.622
It actually tilts.

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:09.411
And that axial tilt of the Earth

00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:12.290
is one of the main reasons for the seasons.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.201
The Earth spins on an axis

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.169
that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.549
At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.092
with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space.

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:24.171
Together with the tilt,

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:26.150
the spinning and revolving causes the number

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.264
of hours of daylight in a region to change

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:29.434
as the year goes by,

00:02:29.434 --> 00:02:30.935
with more hours in summer

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:32.948
and fewer in winter.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:35.938
So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up.

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:38.483
After the sun sets, it has time to cool down.

00:02:38.483 --> 00:02:39.354
So, in the summer,

00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:42.493
any location that's about 40 degrees north of the equator,

00:02:42.493 --> 00:02:44.114
like Hartford, Connecticut,

00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:45.907
will get 15 hours of daylight each day

00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:47.934
and 9 hours of darkness.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.105
It warms up for longer than it cools.

00:02:50.105 --> 00:02:52.218
This happens day after day,

00:02:52.218 --> 00:02:54.406
so there is an overall warming effect.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.239
Remember this fact for later!

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.945
In the winter, the opposite happens.

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:00.033
There are many more hours of cooling time

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:01.243
than warming time,

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:04.703
and day after day, this results in a cooling effect.

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:06.830
The interesting thing is, as you move north,

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.252
the number of daylight hours in summer increases.

00:03:10.252 --> 00:03:13.376
So, Juneau, Alaska would get about 19 hours of daylight

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:17.603
on the same summer day that Tallahassee, Florida gets about 14.

00:03:17.603 --> 00:03:20.376
In fact, in the summertime at the North Pole,

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:22.555
the sun never sets.

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:26.056
OK, then, it's all about daylight hours, I've got it!

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:29.077
Well, no, there's another important piece to this puzzle.

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:30.959
If daylight hours were the only thing

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.602
that determined average temperature,

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:34.516
wouldn't the North Pole be the hottest place

00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:36.163
on Earth in northern summer

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:38.113
because it receives 24 hours of daylight

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.577
in the months surrounding the summer solstice?

00:03:40.577 --> 00:03:41.910
But it's the North Pole.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.455
There's still icebergs in the water

00:03:43.455 --> 00:03:44.748
and snow on the ground.

00:03:44.748 --> 00:03:46.431
So, what's going on?

00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:47.373
The Earth is a sphere

00:03:47.373 --> 00:03:49.883
and so the amount of solar energy an area receives

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.343
changes based on how high the sun is in the sky,

00:03:52.343 --> 00:03:54.426
which, as you know, changes during the day

00:03:54.426 --> 00:03:56.168
between sunrise and sunset.

00:03:56.168 --> 00:03:58.672
But, the maximum height also changes during the year,

00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:01.015
with the greatest solar height during the summer months

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:04.059
and highest of all at noon on the summer solstice,

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.354
which is June 21st in the northern hemisphere

00:04:06.354 --> 00:04:09.176
and December 21st in the southern hemisphere.

00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:10.859
This is because as the Earth revolves,

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.227
the northern hemisphere ends up tilted away

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:14.904
from the sun in the winter

00:04:14.904 --> 00:04:16.197
and toward the sun in summer,

00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:18.491
which puts the sun more directly overhead

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.334
for longer amounts of time.

00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:23.205
Remember those increased summer time daylight hours?

00:04:23.205 --> 00:04:26.334
And solar energy per square kilometer increases

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:28.376
as the sun gets higher in the sky.

00:04:28.376 --> 00:04:30.340
So, when the sun's at an angle,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.754
the amount of energy delivered

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:34.960
to each square of the sunlit area is less.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.840
Therefore, even though the North Pole is getting 24 hours

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.220
of daylight to warm up,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.850
the sunlight it receives is very spread out

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.979
and delivers less energy than a place further south,

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.604
where the sun is higher in the sky

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:48.856
because it's more tilted toward the sun.

00:04:48.856 --> 00:04:51.027
Besides, the North Pole has a lot to make up for.

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:53.569
It was cooling down without any sunlight at all

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.944
for 6 months straight.

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.698
So, as the seasons change, wherever you are,

00:04:57.698 --> 00:05:00.660
you can now appreciate not just the beauty of each new season

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.424
but the astronomical complexity

00:05:02.424 --> 00:05:04.621
that brings them to you.
