00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.060
Susan has 96 minutes to
complete a test at school.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.340
The test begins at 1:59 PM.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.940
And Susan has volleyball
practice at 4:00 PM.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.740
How much time will Susan have
between the end of the test

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.750
and the beginning of
volleyball practice?

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.640
Let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.410
So the test begins at 1:59.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.124
So it's a very strange
time to begin a test,

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.290
but let's just go with that.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.630
So let me draw a
little time line here.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.030
So let's say that
this is 2 o'clock PM.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.650
Then we're going
to have 3:00 PM.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.990
Then we're going to have 4
o'clock PM, which is also

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.960
when volleyball practice begins.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.440
So this is volleyball practice.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.760
It's going to start then
and then go on from 4:00 PM.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.000
And then the test
begins at 1:59.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.850
So let me continue
the number line.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.530
So this right over
here is 1:00 PM.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.900
So the test is going to begin at
1:59, so 1 minute before 2 PM.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.950
We know that there are
60 minutes in an hour.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.460
So 1:59 is 1 minute
before 2:00 PM.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.210
So I'm not drawing it
completely it scale,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.640
but this right over
here is 1:59 PM.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.220
So we use 1 minute
to get to 2:00 PM.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.440
And then, let's see, we have
to get up to 96 minutes.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.430
So then you get another 60
minutes to go to 3:00 PM.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.580
So, so far, we've
used a cumulative 61.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.654
So this is 1 minute.

00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:42.570
So this is how long the
test has been going on

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.403
since the beginning.

00:01:43.403 --> 00:01:48.360
So 1 minute by 2:00 PM,
61 minutes by 3:00 PM.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.225
If we go all the way to 4:00 PM,
that's going to be another 60.

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:56.110
That'd be 121 minutes, which
is longer than the actual test.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.952
So we know that the
entire test is 96 minutes.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:00.660
So we're going to get
to some point right

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.140
over here, some point like this.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.030
That's 96 minutes.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.590
And what we need to figure
out is, is what is left over?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.355
What is this distance
right over here?

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:14.490
Or what is this
time, this difference

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.690
in time right over here?

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.176
And so to figure
that out, we had

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:19.950
to figure out the time at
which 96 minutes have passed

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.950
since the beginning of the exam.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.090
So at 3 o'clock, 61
minutes have passed.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.500
And so if we, if we say
well how many more minutes

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.430
have to go on for
the end of the test?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.420
It's going to be 96 minus 61.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.600
So the amount of time that
elapses past 3 minutes

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.930
is 96 minus 61,
which is 35 minutes.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.717
So this right over here
is going to be 3:35.

00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:50.800
And so now our question
is, how much time is there

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.800
between 3:35 and 4:00 PM?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.950
Well, once again, 60
minutes in an hour.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.020
4:00 PM is essentially
the 60th minute.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:09.360
So if we take 60
minus 35, we get 2:25.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.300
So she has a total of 25
minutes remaining after the test

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.580
before she has to get
to volleyball practice.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.560
Just as a review.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.660
One minute between 1:59
and 2:00, then another 60.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.870
That gets us to
61 total minutes.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.160
Then another 35 minutes gets
us to 96 minutes have passed.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.810
And that also gets
us to 3:35, which

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.255
means we have 25
minutes until 4:00.
