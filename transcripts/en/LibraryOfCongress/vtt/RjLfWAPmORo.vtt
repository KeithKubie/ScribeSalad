00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.530
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: I'm John Fenn from
the American Folklife Center

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.240
at the Library of Congress and I'm
here today with Ledward Kaapana,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.970
slack key guitar player,
ukulele player and singer.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.210
And we're going to chat a little
bit about Hawaiian music, culture,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.920
language and get your background.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.760
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
We're going to have fun.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.680
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: we're
going to have fun.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.460
So, I know you talk a lot
about family and learning how

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.760
to play as a young child.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.280
Why don't you give us a
brief overview of growing

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.680
up with all this music around you
and how you picked up the guitar.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.760
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Well, Because
living in Kalapana we were

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.650
so isolated from everything else.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.020
No electricity, you know, learn
how to live the old style,

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.370
we went fishing, we went
hunting, you know, swimming.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.970
And besides all that there's music.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.370
My dad, my mom, uncles and
aunties, they all played music, so,

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.900 position:56%
I was so fortune, growing up every
day, every day I hear music and back

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.340
in those days my family
no one plays music.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.980
They played from the heart,
you know, from within.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.730
So, that's way I learned
how to play this music.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.690
Down the keys, you know, it would
be the major keys like G, F, A,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.920
anything after that would have been
second F, Second A. Which I found

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.390
out A7 is second A,
C7 is second F, so,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.710
then I had all my uncles
they all played music.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.150
Uncles and aunties they
all play slack keys.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.750
&gt;&gt; so, as I was growing up I
could see all the different style.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.910
So, I learned by watching how
they fingered the keyboard

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.210
and how they tuned.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.350
I remember all the tunings
as I was growing up.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.370
&gt;&gt; Which tuning do you
use most often now?

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: we call this the
tera fast [assumed spelling] tuning.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.050
What it is the standard
tuning on the guitar,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.410
the first string right here, so
this would be an E. so, what I did,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.030
I dropped that E down
to a D, so it's a D now.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.330
the sound of the E would be here.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.320
So, I went down to D. And this
stays the same, this is a B string.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.490
Stays the same right
here, this is a G string.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.860
And then right here the
fourth string it's D

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.600
and then the fifth string from
the A. I tuned it down to G.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.910
And then the sixth string is like
the first string, from an E I went

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.430
down to a D. So, there's two
D's and we treat these --

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.490
one here, one there, this is octave
and the other one is right here.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.670
So. This all the D notes.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.970
And then you have the B's.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.590
Then I have two G's, the third
string and the fifth string.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.100
And when you strum
against the strings

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.820
like this it's a G major chord,
on a standard [inaudible],

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:40.080
the standard when you have
to hold the G like this.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.540
now I don't have to, I just go...

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.120
And that's what's lucky,
we tuned the guitar,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.870
so we call this a tera fast tuning.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:56.520
And the technique of playing
this style the thumb does all the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320
base notes.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.040
[ Guitar Strumming ]

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.170
So the thumb is doing.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.510
and then the finger does
all the melody chords.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:22.040
[ Guitar Strumming ]

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.120
So, you have the base going steady

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.880
and then the finger's doing
all of the melody chords.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.090
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: You make
it sound so easy.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.390
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: it is.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.390
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, when you were
younger and there was music all

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.530 position:56%
around you, did someone put a guitar
into your hand and say, "Here,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.600
play," or did you pick one up out
of your own out of inspiration?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.020
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: When I was young
we couldn't touch the guitars.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.260
All we could do was watch
them play, you know.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.770
you know, living in Kalapana we're
so isolated from everything else.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.080
So, we used to have
parties that goes

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.960
on for months, not weeks, months.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.660
and from the first
house to the last house

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.260
in Kalapana we were all related.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.960
So, everybody we would share
whatever we could bring.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.260
You know, we're fishing, some were
hunting, and we all shared the food

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.660
and the parties keep on going.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.210 position:56%
So, the only time we could touch the
guitar is when they were all drink.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.100
You know, they having fun.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.170
After that we don't
touch it when they --

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.980
you know, because they don't
want you to touch the guitars,

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.890
because they don't want the
guitar brake or, you know,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.640 position:56%
so we don't touch it, so I just sit
there and observe what is happening,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.810
how they tune the guitar
and I'm just listening.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.650
And the trick is the
ear have to be good

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.310
to know what you're doing, yeah.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.720
Have to really listen.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.600
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, you start
playing when you were 4?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.140
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: When I was
6 years old I played ukulele.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.440
I started with the ukulele.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.740
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.490
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah,
started with the ukulele and then

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.020
as the years went on I
started playing this.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.320
we were getting older already.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.670
When I was about 8 years old
I could touch the guitar.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.970
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.240
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: And I
start playing like, you know,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.280
strumming all the rhythm.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.140
My dad and them playing the music.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.850
And then my mom says, "Oh, you
got good rhythm, you know,"

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.380
because we listening
it and we playing it.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.820
And finally we were able to play
with them at parties or whatever.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.120
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.090
And in that situation would you
learn by playing or would an uncle

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.060
or your dad sit down
with you and teach you.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.360
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Oh, no.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.580
they didn't teach us.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.110
I learned by watching what they
did and remember what they did

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.470
and that's how I learned, you know.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.950
Same like them, you know, just knew
the music keys and the tune in,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.710
I remember all the tune ins.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.860
But my uncle used to be kind
of one step ahead of us,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.720
because he knew I wanted to
learn how to play the guitar.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.740
So, what he would do, because he
know every time he put the guitar

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.180
down I grab the guitar
and forget the fingerings.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.660
Not knowing that every time he put
the guitar down he always slacken

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.930
on the other string that I
would see it, he puts it there.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.230
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Keeping
you on your toes.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.530
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
keeping me on my toes.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.920
Until I finally found
out what he was doing.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.190
So, I guess, he puts it down there,
he walks outside of the house

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.670
and he's outside listening
and he's having fun.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.100 position:56%
Because in Kalapan we don't have
electricity, so we don't have no TV.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.510
I was like the cartoon actor
for him and he's laughing.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.010
So, finally I caught on because
the thing that he sound --

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.460
I see his finger like this.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.190
sounds good, yeah?

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:44.830
So, the next thing I know, he slack
this string so it wouldn't sound

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.820 position:56%
like this, it would sound like this.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.120
I said, something wrong
with this string.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.000
And then I found out, I
tune it up, you know, soft.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.630
And I said, ah, there's the
note, because my ears are good.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.770
I knew what he was doing.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:07.470
I slack another string
on him, put it down.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.770
he caught on.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.050
He look at me and he says, "Oh, you
smart, now I'm going to teach you."

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:17.220 position:56%
And when he say he's going to teach
me, all he does is just plays guitar

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.560
and tells me watch what he's doing.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.860
yep.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.260
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: And what
about the singing?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.180
You learned to sing
from your mother?

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: yes, from my mom.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:34.240
Then the little key key, the high
falsetto singing I learned it

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.540
from a gentlemen back in 1963.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:44.700
He came -- because, by the 7th
grade we were playing music.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.420
I mean, me and my brother,
we were just jamming.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.960
We were playing like professions.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.110
So, the gentlemen came
in and asked my daddy

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:56.910
if we could take off
and play with him.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:02.530
So, we were only 8, we played in
the night club that served liquor,

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:07.560
so my dad and mom had to come
there and we had child labor board

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.690
and that gentlemen used to
sing all the time falsetto.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.350
The last song I did
that's the song he sang.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.750
And just watching what he did.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.740
And it just came out natural.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.820
You know, like watching
how they play music.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.950
I just listen to him and
it just came natural.

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:26.870
And after that I see
all the guys singing,

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.110
before they called it falsetto.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.350
I used to ask him,
I said, "Gentlemen,"

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.120
his name was David Chung, he's
best already, I said, "David,

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.790
how do you sing high like that?"

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:49.320 position:56%
He said, "Well, when I was a baby,"
yeah, I says, "I used to cry a lot."

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.850
Oh, yeah. I said, "yeah,
I used to scream and cry."

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.140
But he was just joking.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.160
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: It seems like
humor is a big part of -- KL

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:05.280
&gt;&gt; yeah, that's why I'm like
this, always having fun.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.850
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, you're playing
with your brother at a young age

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.340
and then you two started
a group together, correct?

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.400
When did Ohana start?

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.280
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
Ohana started in 1972.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.580
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.880
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Our first
CD we did in Waikiki --

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.480
we played at a club called Chuck
Sellers [assumed spelling].

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.650
In 1972 we had our first album.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.880
It was called, "Young
Hawaii place, Oh, Hawaii."

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.470
So, it had me, my three
brothers and my cousin

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.990
who named Dennis Bravower
[assumed spelling],

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.180
they were singing all
this high falsetto.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.570
At the time, at the time I
think I only sang two songs,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:52.020
because I was more guitar player
and I was more singing harmony.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.970
I love the -- three
point harmony, yeah.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.910
Dennis sing high falsetto,
my brother used

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.270 position:56%
to sing the alto and I used to sing.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.540
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: What inspired
you three to start the group?

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:09.840
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
Listening to my dad.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.470
We all grew up in Kalapana.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:15.250
Yeah, as we were young, that's
all we hear every day and listen

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.750
to them sing, so my mom
had all the song books.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.730
She was singing all the words and I
grew with there, and just you hear

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.860
that every day and you get
so used to hearing that

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.600
and you start singing
without playing,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.290
we just sing along with them.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.100
It starts from there.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.180
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Now, the group,
Ohana is credit as being part

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.520
of a resurgence of
traditional Hawaiian music

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.320
and culture in the 70s.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:45.050
What was your connection to that
movement or your interest in it?

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.580
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: my
collection to Ohana?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.320
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: No, to the
movement to the resurgence

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.280
of traditional Hawaiian music
and culture and language.

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.780
It was part of that
whole cultural movement

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.870
and the group is often credited to
be part of that, but I'm wondering,

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.630
was that part of your
interest in forming the group,

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:03.470
or because you did the young
Hawaii, sings Hawaiian.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.770
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: no, I guess

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.290
from the time we group
up it was so natural.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.810
We always played music, my
cousin used to live not too far.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.380
We could walk down the road.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.330
And every time, we played, in
Kalapan, from the first house

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.860 position:56%
to the last house every plays music.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.160
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.510
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: all the
family, they all have their own.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:25.260
And then the further in Kalapala
you go, the better the music is.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.560
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.470
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: We
come from the last house.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:30.770
I'm just joking.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.070
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: I'm sure you're not.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.400
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Lot of humor.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.460
Yeah, but, you know, we were young,

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.130
so we just continued the
tradition, we just carried on.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.570
And then at that time, they
didn't know, I didn't know --

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.680
I never had the idea I was going
to be an entertainer today.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.420
Not, you know, wasn't in my
mind what I was going to do.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:57.040
Didn't' even know until we started
playing music and because back

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.560
in that day when you played music
nobody got paid to play music.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.040
We used to play parties,
my mom and dad,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.730
we called it kakua
[assumed spelling].

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.210
Kakua means free.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.990
So, we used to go to parties, every
family goes and they play music,

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.950
nobody gets paid, we
just have a nice time.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.340
And finally we played and
we got money involved.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.170
It was interesting to us.

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:23.570
So, you know, the money, plus we
were traveling all over the place,

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.810
without paying for our, you
know, tickets to fly here.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:32.270
We get used to that and as the
years went on it became one

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.750
of the things I love to do.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.740 position:56%
and today I'm just sharing the music

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.970
and whatever kind of
stories I can share.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.700
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: I want to go back
to slack key a little bit.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:51.880
What -- for you, what
defines slack key?

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.350
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: What defines
slack key, what defines slack key?

00:13:55.350 --> 00:14:00.680
To me when I first heard
slack key my dad then --

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.630
it's just the style and just
how the thing grabs you.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:11.100
growing up you hear this music and
then it makes you feel good inside.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:16.340
Especially some of us we
hear this music and it kind

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.870
of heals, the music heals.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.050
So, we felt -- I just fell in love.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.360
And the more I hear it the
more I want to do it, so.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.290
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, it's not
necessarily a set of tunings are --

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.390
it's part of how you grew up.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.490
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah, grew up
and learn how to play from within.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.050
We always play from within.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.030
So, when I play that style of
music the reason why I like it is

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:49.060 position:56%
because slack key it comes from here
and to me there's no stress, no --

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.370
the more you play and the more
better you feel and it's open

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.450
to all the feelings, you know.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.520
how can I say this?

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.470
anyway, it comes from the
heart, from inside, yeah.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.180
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: That's a
good enough definition.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.390
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: No, but, because
of this music and what it does

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.340
to people, you know, I go into the
hospital and see patients like that

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.520 position:56%
and I play for them and I see tears
come under their eye and I see them,

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.720
you know, they're so happy.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.820 position:56%
Some shows that I determine on the
road, there's people in a wheelchair

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:29.660
that comes inside and people
that have to do dialysis.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.910
There's one lady that come in
there and she said, "You know, sir,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.780
I was supposed to go to dialysis,
I'm so glad I came here."

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.080
I said, "Why?"

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.560
She said, "I feel more better
than going to dialysis."

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.930
It just makes me feel good in side

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.630
and I just say mahalo [assumed
spelling] to the lord above.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.810
We call it [inaudible], yeah.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.190
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, I noticed in
your playing earlier today a lot

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.150
of influences of other
styles of music too.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.450
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yes, yes.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.160
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: a lot of
jazz phrasings and record.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.870
And a little bit of
blues thrown in there.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.910
so, it seems to me like
slack key is also open

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.900
to inclusion of other sounds

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.160
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: I guess for me
because I love all the other types

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.550
of business besides Hawaiian
music I just love it, so,

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.940
when I play my guitar
it just comes natural.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.300
You know, like, I always say that
I can do that one song 10 times

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.800
and the same one song 10
times will sound different,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.080
because there's a lot of feelings.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.350
So, it's feelings from inside
that come out into my guitar.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.090
We sometimes get surprised,
like, "Oh, something new,"

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.420
you know, like, it just comes.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:45.600
Where I'm not reading, I have to
read the song sheet and it's going

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.320
to be the same over and over.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.970
That's why I love slack key.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.270
That's what it does for me.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.570
That's what it does.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.510
make me put more in and just enjoy.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.920
And I've been enjoying
this all my life.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.990
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, how
do you teach that.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.410
Because you teach -- do
you teach slack key notes?

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.710
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah, I do.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.940
That's the hardest part for
me, you know, teaching --

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.330
I can teach, it would take forever.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:18.360
So, what I tell the people
is bring their cell phone

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.160
or camera to video what I'm doing.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.620
But before they do that I say
I play the song for you then.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.120
So, I play the simple
-- and I play real slow.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.030
If I do a song, I say, okay, let
me show this, show them this song

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.330 position:56%
and the song would be slack key
lullaby and the song goes like this.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.510
So, I go. I play slow for them.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:51.260
[ Music ]

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.510
So I tell them that's part one and
then part two would go like this.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:18:06.040
[ Music ]

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.230
So, I do that slow as I
can and then they listen,

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.610
so that I can get them
familiarized with the melody.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.040
I say this is how the melody go.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.920
And I say -- it's only two keys,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.930
it's just back and
forth, G, D7, G, D7.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.360
And that's all you use.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.580
And I say, you listen
how the melody go.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.340 position:56%
So, I said, "Now, take your camera
and I play the whole song for them."

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.970
After the whole song is done and
then part from one to two and --

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.820
and by the end of the class
you're playing the song.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.290
And then if they're not all
there, they got it on the video

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:49.260
where they can go home and see the
rest, because it's not on paper.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.510 position:56%
And the good thing about it is when
they got it, they say, "Mr. Kapana."

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.810
I say, "yes."

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.110
"Oh, we got it."

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.410
Yeah, let me hear it.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:59.050
And I hear the -- and
I say, "Oh, good job."

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:00.350
Let me see.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.650
They give me the guitar.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.560
So, I play the song
again and they look at me

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.880
and they say, "Mr. Kaapana."

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.180
I say, "Yes."

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.880
They go, "you didn't
teach us that part."

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.400
So, -- so I'll tell them, oh,
I have to save some for me.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.410
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, if someone
watches that video and practices

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:23.290
for 40 years, they could be okay.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.590
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yes.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.890
So, that's the way I teach.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.400
It's not -- I mean, when I first
started teaching it was real

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.560
stressful for me because I
don't write nothing down.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.180
because I don't know
how to write down,

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.780
but I just know how to play it.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.050
So I told -- you know, all
those teachers that teach,

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.970
I try to go to the class, I ask
them, "Can I come see your class?"

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.270
they said no.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.520
They don't want me to
come to their class.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.820
They said, you know, they tell me,

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.330
"Why do you want to
come to the class?"

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:57.110 position:56%
I just want to see how you teach the
student, that's all I want to know.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:00.800
And they tell me, "You just
teach them the way you learned."

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.100
And I said, "Really?"

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:06.780
And there's a gentlemen back
in Hawaii, she's icon too,

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.200
her name is Ozzie Kultonic [assumed
spelling], so I asked Ozzie,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.500
Ozzie said, "No, Led, you
teach them the way you learned,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.800
that's the best way."

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.100
I said, "Why?"

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.400
She said, "Because it's from here."

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.710
And I tell you, for ever since
that time I teach them like that

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:25.830
until I would -- I said,
"You just want" I said,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.640
"I can't have somebody
write the tab out."

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.070
Oh, no, no, no, we
don't want to tap,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.390
we just want to play
the way you play.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:32.690
I said, "Okay."

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.240
Then just sort of do the
video and help them, yeah.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:41.650
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Are you finding
that there's young players

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.160
who are wanting to learn slack key?

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.150
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: There's
quite a few back now, you know,

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:50.670
new generation coming up
and they play slack key.

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:54.180
The reason why because they
watch -- because from Ohana,

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.780
the generation they
learned from there.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.430
You know, the first time they
ever heard three guys, you know,

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.840
singing all this high music
and three part harmony

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.380 position:56%
and to hear all this music going on,

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.920
we just inspired all
the next generation

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.300
and it started from
there until today.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:15.150 position:56%
So all these young ones -- once in
a while they go on and do their own,

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.800 position:56%
you know, regular music or whatever
they love, but they always come back

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.510
to the tradition and
carry on the music.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.810
So.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.870
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Is there
one person who's credited

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.980
with establishing slack key
as an approach to music?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.280
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: as one person?

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.120
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Yeah, is there a story
about the first slack key player?

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.420
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: The only guy

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.870
who would know would be Gabby
Pianute [assumed spelling].

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:40.220
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay, yeah,
that's the name of that --

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.010
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah, yeah,
Gabby Pianute, that's the only one.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.170
As I was growing up, you know,
he was one of my inspiration,

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.800
Gabby, all the ones before me.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.620
[inaudible], you know, Ray
Connie, I was inspired by them.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.200
But, yeah, Gabby was
the one that I know

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:03.020
who that people that
know him top today.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.320
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.810
You also teach ukulele,
or just guitar?

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:09.110
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: ukulele too.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:10.410
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Yeah?

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:11.710
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
The same way, yeah.

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.010
I love ukulele.

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:14.310
You know.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:16.820
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, there are
techniques in playing that can go

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.590
between guitar and ukulele?

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.430
Like with your fingering or your --

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.760
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: My -- you know,

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.840
I play my ukulele the
same way I play my guitar.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.090
The only difference about the
guitar I got two strings more.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.610
But, you know, all the
fingering they're all the same.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:36.090
I play, like, I look at
the finger part I just know

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:37.390
where everything is.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.690
same like the ukulele.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:44.010
Only thing, there's a ukulele
you have only four strings,

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.940
so sometimes I hit each
string two more times.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:53.750
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: To make up --
it's a musical mathematics.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.390
Just have fun with it.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.690
Yeah.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:02.200
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Now, when you're
going to compose a song

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.130
or arrange another
song for a recoding,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.560 position:56%
how do you choose whether you're
going to do it on ukulele or guitar?

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.440
Or do you choose, does the
instrument just tell you

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.740
which one to --

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.270
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: No,
I just think about it.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:18.510
I sit down -- well,
sometimes I don't think,

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:22.970
I just start playing the song and
it comes, you know, like, I'm --

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:26.770
especially on the stage when I'm
playing live in front of everybody,

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.850
all these things out of
the blue sky just comes.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.900
And some get up and look at me and
say, "Where did you get that from?"

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.030
I say, "it just comes."

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:43.630
It reminds me of when I was going
to school I used to be in the band.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:48.160 position:56%
I used to read all these notes, all
these sharpest, I used to, you know,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.710
in the class in band and the band
teacher is go, you know, reading.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.680
I play my horn and the next thing
I hear these notes in my head,

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.900
and look at the song, hear
the notes and I just play on.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.840
And the band teacher stops
the whole class, stop, stop.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.160 position:56%
He looks at me, goes, "Mr. Kaapana?"

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.460
I say, "yes."

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.330
He goes, "What's that
note on your music sheet?"

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.950
And I go, "It's not there."

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.800
And he goes, "Play the
notes on the sheet."

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.030
Okay. I play the note
and I hear it again.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.780
so, I keep on creating -- after
that class is over he said,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.080
"Okay, everybody, you go.

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.380
Mr. Kaapana, you stay back."

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.050
I say, "Oh, I'm gonna get it."

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.250
I stay back and he walks up to me
and he goes, "Mr. Kaapana," I said,

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:36.510
"Yes," he says, "Where
do you get the notes?"

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.220
I said, "Well, you
know, it just comes,

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.800
I hear it in my head
and I just play."

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.020
And he goes, "you know
what that is?"

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.370
I said, "Nope."

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:48.750
He said, "That's gifted."

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.070
Oh, thank you.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:54.610
after that, that's why I didn't
read notes, I just play it.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.420
he goes like that, he smiles.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:05.800
Everybody got music sheet
accept me, I just got a stand.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.100
[inaudible].

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.250
I just got that black stand there.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.170
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So what can you
tell me about Just Press?

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.350
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Just Press.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.430
Okay, Just Brass is --
Just Press is my uncles,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.640
because they don't read notes in
Kalapana, He's always pressing

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.500
on his guitar, so he said, when
I asked him what he's' doing,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.840
he looks at me, he
don't know what key,

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.690
he just looks at me,
tell me, "Just press."

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.990
I said, "What?"

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.290
yeah, just press.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.620
So, I start pressing
and he looks at me

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.390
and he tells me, "Press
the right key."

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.040
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So there's some
learning with that step.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.460
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.240
So, that's where Just
Press came from.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.540
Yep.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, is that an approach
you use in your own playing?

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:59.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah, there's I
do, it's called, Its All She Dragged

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:02.870
and Sweet Georgia Brown,
but we call it Just Pressed.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:04.680
and I mean, I'm overhanded
the guitar.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.290
I play on the guitar and
talk and bells and everything

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.540
and running my fingers
down like this.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:10.950
we call it Just Pressed.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.530
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Can you
demonstrate that for us.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.830
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Nope.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:18.620
No, the reason why, the song is
-- you have to have accompany.

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.920
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Oh, okay.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.220
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
Because we read them

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.720
in the back, it doesn't come out.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.020
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: It doesn't work.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.400
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: you know,
like playing bells on top,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.510
like my dad used to
play Maui chimes.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:35.070
[ Music ]

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:41.190
&gt;&gt; So, just press.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:46.940
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Now, the technique
of the bells or the chimes --

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: The chimes, yeah.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:56.430
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: is that something
you learned growing up?

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.730
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: yes.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:14.270
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: yeah, okay, so
you would watch people do that.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:21.020
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: I used
to watch my dad do that.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.390
that's' where I learned
that son, from my dad.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:34.380
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Are there other
techniques that you developed later

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:40.640
on in your career by
continuing to just press?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.940
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.020
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Because I
notice when you were playing

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:53.150
on stage you were doing a
lot of muting of the string.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:59.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah, yeah,
that's why I created -- [inaudible].

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:13.550
If I'm mute I go -- wait.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:33.210
[ Music ]

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.640
So, I'm just hitting
the strong like this.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.940
muffling the string, yeah.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.240
Stuff like that, yeah.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.660
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: And is that
common slack key in general?

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.020
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Not
during -- my dad --

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.270
I think my uncle Fred used
to do a little of that.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.100
So, I think that's
where I picked it up.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.400
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.650
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
How am I feeling --

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.820
I think it's the right one
to do, I just put that in.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.700
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: throw it in there.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.140
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Just throw
it in and hopefully it works.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:11.060
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: I think the
evidence indicates it does.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:15.380
You've also played with players
in a bunch of different styles.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.680
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yes.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.980
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: You know,
people from --

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.210
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: I did I
think 1992 it was called Masters

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.740
of the Shoe Strings.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.960
Yeah, with Jerry Douglas,
Del Farlow,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.340
the jazz guitar player,
Wade Anderson.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.340
Quite a few people.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.150
Rockabillies, Albert
Lee, he was there.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:42.480
Yeah, we traveled all over,
all over the United States.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.290
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Did you pick
up any techniques from them

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:47.690
or were you just teaching them?

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.230
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: No, we sit down

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.470
and Hawaiians we call it conna
kopila [phonetic spelling]

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:57.760
where we just jam and everybody
just having fun watching different.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.020
We all have our own style.

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:03.630
To sit down and play we
just giggle like, oh, wow.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:09.580
You know, Ray Flack, I remember
Ray Flack he goes on the stage,

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.880
first time I see him,
the stage is all dark

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.980 position:56%
and all you see is this spotlight on
his back and his back facing the --

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.540
and somebody goes,
"There's Ray Flack."

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:27.150
And he goes like [blows] and all
this dust, you know, and he goes,

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:32.020 position:56%
bang, and more dust and then he
starts -- you know, say, "wow, man."

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.570
I just like, oh, man,
I have to follow him.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:37.870
I'm the next guy.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.170
I said, "Oh, man, that's
a hard act."

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.070
and I say -- but you know,

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.510
let me tune this guitar,
I show you what I do.

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:48.740
[ Guitar Sounds ]

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.610
Because -- see, I had
to follow him, I said,

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.510
"I got to get something
down," you know.

00:30:53.510 --> 00:31:02.040
[ Guitar Sounds ]

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.380
So I did a song called, my
uncle taught me this song,

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.510
it's called monolo --
monolosaki [phonetic spelling].

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.440
[ Music ]

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.290
And he over hands the guitar
like this and he says,

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:16.940
"The song that will start called
the Hawaiian [inaudible]."

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.510
You know, he said, "all you
have to do is watch the hand,

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.100
and it never leaves the
-- or watch the fingers,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.430
they never leave the hand."

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.510
So, and the song go like this.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:32:03.220
[ Music ]

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.400
So, I did the song right after him.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.700
She said I have to go on there.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.150
I said, "oh, I got to do the song."

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:14.630
So I did the song and in my pocket
I had this battery fan, you know,

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:18.340
on the airplane I turn on the
fan it was hot in the place.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:20.750
So, I got this fan,
huh, I take the fan off

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.620
and people all clap, yeah, yeah.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.190
Then after the song's done, I
take the fan out, I go like this.

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.430
You know, my fingers, you know
my fingers, to go like this.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:31.730
they started clapping.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:35.380
So, I walked in the back in
the back into the dressing room

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.360
and Ray Flack he's back
there and he looks and me

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:40.670
and goes, "Gee, I like your act."

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:43.060
I tell him, "I like yours too."

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.150
We had good fun after that,
we started sharing music

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:50.180
and just having a ball
in the back there.

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.520

that sounds pretty fun.

I got to know all of them so good.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:33:01.970
I mean, I learned so much from them
about getting real professional

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.710
on the stage and complimenting
one another, it was awesome, yeah.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.220

-- so that was a tour.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.010

done recordings with others,

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.360

exploring all these styles,

After [inaudible], you know.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:44.570
But one thing -- one thing about
playing with any artist, you know,

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:52.900
I play with all kinds of music,
I'm not afraid to play with anybody

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.820
because you got to pay attention.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.350
The ears to me is the
most important.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.420
So, I listen to what they're doing.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.590
you know, when we go out
there and do festivals,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.650
especially when we
staying at the hotel,

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.720
you got all these blue grass
players, country western,

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.440
they all in the lobby playing.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.220
I walk in the room and so I'll
just pick a band and I say,

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:15.520
"Hey, can I join you guys?"

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.200
They say, "Yeah, sure, come in."

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.980
So, I jump in with
the blue grass guys.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:27.260
They're playing and while they're
playing I hear how the music going

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.600
and I'm ready in the back of them.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.440
They don't tell me, "Oh,
we're in the key of G

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.740
or we're in the key of A."

00:34:31.740 --> 00:34:34.530
I just hear that, I find it and
I'm already behind them playing it

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.940
and they look at me like, wow.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:42.970 position:56%
Because to hear this Hawaiian flavor
mixing up with the blue grass.

00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:44.860
So, they tell me, "You
want to take one?"

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.840
Yes, so I take a lead, they
look at me and they go,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.250
"Whoa, take another one."

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.690
Sure, I take another one.

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:53.530
And then it goes around,
right, everybody takes one.

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.480 position:56%
So, they goes to the next guy, says,
"Oh, it's your turn," the guy says,

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.040
"Nuh uh, not after this guy."

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.570
I say, -- you know, we
all have fun and then --

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.030
they tell me, "How you
learn how to play?"

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.740
I said, "Oh, I just listen."

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.970
I said, I don't -- if you know
the music they're playing,

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:16.350
but I have real good ears, I
just listen and I'm right there

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.970
with them, just having fun.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.960 position:56%
And got to come from inside, always.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:25.630
If you really pay attention
and I always said the ears got

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.340
to be good listening
to what's happening.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.480
If not, if you don't listen
good, you know, I going to be all

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.560
over the places instead
of paying attention.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.600
Like back home I always tell them,
when I used to play in a group,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.520
you know, we always call a
guest artist to come on stage,

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.560
so I always tell them,
somebody come on the stage.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.540
You got to pay attention, pay
attention to what they're doing.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.180
Huh? They tell me, "Huh."

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.690
I say, "Yeah, because if
you think you know the song,

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.430
you don't know a song, they're
going to do the same son, you know,

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:58.510
but everybody got their own style."

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.680
So you got to listen to the
beat, how they sing them,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.030
because I told them,
you know, the guy came,

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.410 position:56%
he's singing the same song, this guy
I know, he's paying attention, no,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.300
he knows the song,
so he plays the song.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.880
Next thing I know, the
guys not even over there,

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.450
and this guy's changing key on him.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:16.750
See, you got to pay attention.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.040
The guy doesn't sing like
you, he sings his way,

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.850
so you got to pay attention
to whoever comes on the stage.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:25.090 position:56%
Like, me, if I go on stager to play
for somebody, I got to pay attention

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:28.960
to what he do so I can be right
behind him complimenting or yeah.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.690
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, it
seems like to me, I mean,

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.560
part of the stories you've been
telling about growing up with

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.670
such music around you and the
tradition of slack key is something

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:46.000
that is flexible, so you're
continuing it be exploring it

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.300
and expanding it.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:53.680
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: it actually,
yeah, yeah, and sharing it.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.980
Yep.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.280
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.370
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: And besides
slack key I do a standard tune.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.490
I love standard tuning, because
the standard tuning you can play

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:04.330
anything, you know.

00:37:04.330 --> 00:37:05.670
I'm all over the guitar.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.650
The slack key you're
limited to certain.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:13.710
The reason why I play slack
key was because I play solo,

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.950
so I try to make the music full
and I'm singing [inaudible].

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.560
So, that way it sounds
there's somebody

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.350
in the back helping you playing it.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.650
So you sound full.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.810
So, that's why I always
play slack key.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.270
But if I play with a
group I tune it up.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:36.710 position:56%
And when I play [inaudible], so when
I turn my guitar up to standard,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.600
Josh says, "Oh, no,
it's kick ass time."

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.720
He knows, he just knows.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:45.660
And when I -- he says,
"Oh, he's going to --

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.920
" There's no limit on the standard.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.950
To me no limit you do
anything you want to do on it.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.820
I just -- I mean, you
got everything,

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.210
I can play any kind on this.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:01.480
I can do it on the slack key tune,
but the slack key tune you have

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:04.920
to work harder than
the standard tuning.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:09.050
Yeah, the standard tuning, I
love standard tuning, I love.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.280
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: When you were growing
up, with people switching back

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.450
and forth between slack key
tuning and standard tuning,

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:18.330
with those month long parties
and the musical environment

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:21.470
or did you learn slack
key tuning initially?

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:23.990
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: I learned
slack key from my dad.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.860
My dad and my uncles
they awfully standard.

00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:34.790 position:56%
And my dad played guitar, he played
saxophone, piano, violin, auto harp,

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:38.570
ukulele, you know,
they all played that.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:44.460
You know? So, then I played
learning slack key from my dad.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.530
My mom taught me how to
play standard tuning.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:50.740
She told me, you have to learn
how to play the standard tuning.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.530
I'm glad, and the first
standard tuning was the key of C,

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.930
and I was so small
and I had to stretch.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:59.710
And, you know, I said -- oh,
you got to keep on practicing.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.280
Kept on practicing until
your fingers get used to it.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.790
And then my uncle told
me you have to use pick.

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:10.570
Because in Kalapana we
don't have no electricity,

00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:12.390
so nobody can use guitar,

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.510
so I started with holly pick
before I could play without pick.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:19.010
So, now I play with pick, so
I cannot play without pick.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.610
I don't have the pick, I
can't even play the guitar.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:23.960
I mean, my fingers
get all tangled up.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.350
The picks -- one thing with
the pick, the note is clearer.

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:33.620
I can go loud, I can go
soft, in between, you know.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.630
There's actually, you know, so, so
that's why when I play with guys

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:41.860 position:56%
with acoustic they playing without
picks my guitar is louder than them.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.130
so, when it comes to their turn
to play the lead I just back off

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.720
on my picking, because I go soft,
you know, if I'm picking loudly,

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.510
if I'm picking loud it go --

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:59.110
[ Music ]

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:00.910
Then if I bring it down a little.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:05.220
[ Music ]

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.420
So, I just kind of
lighten up on the picks.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:08.720
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: That's
your volume control.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.020
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA:
Volume control, yeah.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.320
I think, yeah.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.130
So they can hear his guitar,
because he doesn't have a pick.

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.230
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Do you play
electric guitar also?

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:24.940
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Oh, I love
it, actually, I got a 335.

00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:26.530
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: You'll have
to bring that along.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:27.880
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: teach
that -- yeah, I got songbird,

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.740
got actually -- yeah, electric.

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.270
Like playing the electric
typewriter.

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:42.890
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: What kind of stuff do
you like to play on your electric?

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.190
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Pipeline.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:45.490
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Pipeline.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.970
I came across a video
of you playing Pipeline,

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:49.270
while writing some [inaudible].

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.620
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Ghost
writers, yeah, all that, yeah.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.920
I do that.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.520
I do that, yeah.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.740
Well, Ohana, we were
playing all electric.

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.040
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Oh, okay.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.340
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: I had a 335.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:04.880
My cousin had a 350
Gibson and my brother,

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.450
he plays bass, so,
it was all electric.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:13.350
Even in the [inaudible]
I was playing electric.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:18.010
Then, because I started
playing solo,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.880
so I ended up playing acoustic.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.530
Good for slack key
the acoustic guitar.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.390
But I do miss electric.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:32.730
I love playing electric.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:37.810
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, your solo career,
you've been solo for some time now.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.110
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:45.640
I think I've been solo since 1989.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.370
19 -- yeah, 1989 when I first came
up for the Smithsonian playing

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:55.120
on the Mall with Uncle Rick
Honey and then Nancy [inaudible],

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.880
all of us came up,
I started from there

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.870
and from there I went solo
the first time in my life.

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:06.350
From here they flew me all the
way out to Nashville to play

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:08.640
and [inaudible] went to Atlanta.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.350
So, we were separated and I
said, "Oh, man, I don't know."

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:17.470
First time through Nashville, I
don't know what I'm going to play.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:21.710
So, I go in the hotel and I start
practicing, "sweet little honey,"

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.860
and I'm doing all these
English song.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:27.780
Beyond the reef, songs
that I don't do back home.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.850
I said, oh, because
I want to make sure

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.290
that when you stop singing the
Hawaiian music I sing that.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.810
when I went to the club and
play they were asking me

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:43.230
for all the songs that I
threw out of my repertoire --

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:48.800
I threw it out and started to
bringing the pearly [inaudible],

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.660
how about singing [inaudible].

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.350
So, when they say that I
knew they came for Hawaii.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.350
And some other ones said,
[inaudible], you know,

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:59.120
they mentioned all
this Hawaiian song.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.760
I fell right in the
groove and I start playing.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.060
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Okay.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:05.100
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: So,
from the time I was in --

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:09.900
the first solo G, so from this
time in I wasn't afraid after that.

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.650
I started playing all this
music and continue to play.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:19.890
Every -- I found out the more you
play the guitar the more you find

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.190
things on the guitar.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.490
There's never an ending.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:23.790
You know, I keep on playing

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.240
and I find all this stuff
and I get so surprised.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.530
Oh, I kind of school myself.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.920
All the years I lost out.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.310
Ohana, back home there's
entertainers they go --

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:40.040
they play when they work.

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:43.070
After the job is done the
guitar goes in the case,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.110
don't come out until the next week.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:49.470
I used to do that then I
started bringing the guitar out,

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:53.950
then I started playing, that's
how I got better and better,

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.450
because I could hear all the
fingering and all the changes.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:00.620
So, I [inaudible] man, I should
have done this a long time.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:04.900
[inaudible] I told
you how many times.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.530
Yeah, but I learned something.

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.130
And I said, "You know what,
every time I grab my guitar

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:13.560
and I play I always find
something else there."

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.740
This morning, there's many more,
you just got to look for it.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:20.470
It's there.

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:23.710
So, I just work on it.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:27.260
I just love to play now, you know.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.650
Every chance I get.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:30.870
I'm in my garage, you
know, I'm [inaudible].

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:37.390
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: So, you've
played all over the world?

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:38.690
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yes.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.970
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Do you have a
favorite place that you've played

00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:45.970
or some place that you haven't
played that you want to get to?

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:47.270
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: No.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:53.940
I guess I just love traveling and
I'm meeting new people, you know.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.960
The next thing you know when I'm
back in Hawaii they come and say,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.330
"Remember me, you know,
you came here."

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:00.050
I say, "Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes."

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.730 position:56%
But sometimes I don't remember, you
know, so many faces have been going.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:08.850
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: Do you have a
list of places you've played.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:11.150
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: I went
to Paris, I went to Paris,

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:13.870
I went to Japan, I went to Germany.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:17.420
I went all over the
United States just --

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.090
&gt;&gt;JOHN FENN: And people are always
wanting to hear the Hawaiian.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:22.450
&gt;&gt;LEDWARD KAAPANA: Yeah,
yeah, every place I went

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.720
to was always Hawaiian music.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.390
And they always say, "Oh, man,

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.300
you think you bring
back so many memories.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.240
You take me back to
our younger days."

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.190
I say, "Thank you, man, I feel
great you say, thank you so much."

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.220
I mean, to me it's a blessing

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:36.520
and I always say [speaking
foreign language] the lord

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.440 position:56%
above for all these blessing who are
open in my heart and go out there

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.920
and share this with the world
and, you know, bring it home.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.020
And the next thing you know
you have all these fans

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.320
from all over the place.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.520
And today it's more
like on Facebook,

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.500
so many friends and
they can see you.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:46:00.750
And some will come to Hawaii, you
know, it's nice that you meet,

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.140
you know, families like that.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.030 position:56%
They come to the shore and they say,
"Hi, Mr. Kaapana, you don't know us,

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:11.830
but we know you through YouTube,
we watch you on YouTube."

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:15.230
So, they come to the show and they
see it and they go, "You know,

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.670
you're better than YouTube.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:18.250
You see on YouTube it's okay,

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:22.340
but when you see me live is
another different whole ball."

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.530
They've seen what's happening
on my guitar and they in front

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.040
and it's just like overwhelming.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.800
Your [inaudible], anybody
can be, you know,

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:36.380
I just love to share
the world, you know.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.640
I always tell myself, I'm
going to [inaudible] forever,

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.780
so then, just give it here.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:43.080

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.820
I share -- I make everybody happy.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.440
If you're happy, I'm happy.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.740
