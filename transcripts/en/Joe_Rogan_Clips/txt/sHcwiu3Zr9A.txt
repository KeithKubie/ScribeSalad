Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. So when you decide to move or you taking anybody with you, you go solo. I'm going to start off going solo. Um, I would like to get, you know, my brother to come visit. I'd like to get my mom to come out really as many them out there. Yeah. Yeah. And, and just cheap and just kind of simple living my end. My mom, I don't think she's ever left the country, so I think it'd be really cool for her to go out there, but at the moment I'm just really like, this place is great for my career right now, Greg from my training. So I just want to get there asap out. Get back to work. Sorry. How do you account for Jet Lag? Like, do you, do you just, uh, like do you give yourself enough time to adjust to the time difference?

Speaker 1:          00:46          You know what, the whole time I was there, I would, my sleep schedule was off. I never adjusted. So I was going to bed maybe 2:30 AM every morning then like get up, run at five and then, you know, get tired later. Get tired later. Yeah. Weird, right schedule is all off. And then when I came back it took me like a week or two to adjust. So I was disappointed how stupid my body was. Yeah. Hey dummy, go to bed now I'm telling you, you just go to bed now. Like, like I didn't know my body had such a rigid schedule. When you jack that thing sideways and you're on the other side of the planet that your body just really doesn't know what the fuck is going on. Seriously. And then for me being stuck in that plane for so long, yeah. I was like, ah, yeah, you're too big for them.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Little seats too. So when you do that, if say if you have a fight in Vegas, you're going to go from Thailand to Vegas. Do you show up two weeks early? Yeah. Well this is my first time flying back to the states after being in Thailand and I flew a week early. No, I flew two weeks early. One Week I stayed in Vegas and then fight week stayed in Atlanta. And look, I think that was perfect timing. Oh, that's good. So like you get a little difference in time between those weather too, man. It's so hot. Like we train outside and it's humid and hot. So, um, between every round it feels like, you know, like the third round of a fight. If they were going into the championship rounds, I've never been there, but I'd imagine that it feels very shitty and uh, that's how it feels.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Every round in Thailand, just like you're covered in sweat, hot, thick. Yeah. That was probably like my fifth round or something like that. And when we do it, I was dead by this point. Um, shout out to the editor for making me not look as tired as I was. Yeah. So what we're looking at folks for the people who are just listening as a bunch of videos of you training, strength and conditioning palling up against the wall. So you get getting everything down there. Yeah. That's Joseph Hanley right there. He was on the, uh, on the ultimate fighter, I forgot what season they called them. Leah notice he's a black belt out there and he helped me out a lot. Man, there's, you run into so many different people and he's like, yeah, like black belt, any type of grappling you want, any positions you want to work, like we'll go over it, we'll create a system, whatever.

Speaker 1:          02:56          And so he was really big help and this preparation for this fight. Yeah. A bunch of free spirits live in there. Right. So many, so many. But everybody's down there with a goal and they want to get in shape. They want to get healthy or, yeah. Spiritual path, whatever it may be. Yeah. There's something romantic about the ex pat living in Thailand having a good time, you know, something romantic about that. So it's interesting. Yeah. That's really cool. Yeah, I mean that whole culture man, I mean the, the tie and Moyie Thai culture. What a phenomenon. If you look at combat sports and then this one that it's so tied into these stadiums, it's so tied into gambling and betting. It's so, I mean, kids get indoctrinated into it at a very young age, young, super young. There's not, there's guys at the gym that I was at, um, little kids, they'd come right after school and they go to Muay Thai training and their training just like the older guys and then they go right back to the home, like home, eat dinner.

Speaker 1:          03:51          But that's just their lifestyle so that it starts as a kid. It's like go to school, Moy, Tai, go sleep. And then as an adult it's like Moy Moitai feed your family. Moitai feed your family. These guys live at the gym. It Jesus, they live at the gym and they go home maybe two days after a fight just to take care of their families and then come right back to the gym and you're ready for the next height. Now of course, at Tiger Moitai, you know, you've guys, everybody knows diff, various people in different organizations. UFC Bella tour would have you, uh, one FC. But what about those guys that are fighting in those little small tie gyms and stadiums? Like, how much access do they have to grappling or how about, do they ever, do they, are they satisfied to just do more tires here at all?

Speaker 1:          04:38          Like a movement in Thailand and my MMA, especially at tiger, um, a lot of those guys are coming over to the MMA and learning, Jujitsu and wrestling. One of the guys I was learning to clinch from, um, he was like, um, he's got probably 300 fights, um, 300 Muay Thai fights and he started training MMA and taking him and may fight. So it's deaf there. They're definitely opening their mind to it and hopping in there and there's access in Bangkok, it's a little different. Um, cause that's very like stadium based, you know, like high level Moitai and uh, they're not too focused on in May, there are a couple of MMA gyms, but if you want to do that, if you want to get the best of both worlds, it's in, it's implicate a tiger. So in, is there any MMA at all in Bangkok?

Speaker 1:          05:24          Uh, they got a couple of places but nothing with like at like providers or any high level fighters. But they do have, they do have maybe three or four MMA gyms there with just guys stopping in or guys who practice, you know, a little bit of everything. I'm always really interested in countries that figure something out better than everybody else when it comes to leg kicking and look, nobody figured it out any better than the tie. It's like no one argues that, right? No seriously. And their shins man, like I think they're just, that's done for, they don't even feel the front of their legs anymore cause they can kick anything and they're getting kicks checked. There's guys that Joe, they'll fight one night at the stadium, go five rounds and then sleep and maybe the next day go fight like another small event or a smaller event sometime even in the same night.

Speaker 1:          06:12          And it's like, man, aren't you like your shins? Don't hurt your elbows. No hurt, nothing in these guys. They're just like, they're bulletproof. They're used to this man. It's crazy. Wow. And their first time in my life, I go into a locker room and the red and blue corner is both in the same room, probably as big as this studio. And they're all getting their hands wrapped together, getting massaged out together. Everything, no weird energy in the room like, you know, in the UFC, like they separate us. We have to kind of be separate whatever purposes. But like in Thailand they're just like hanging out, same room, you know, talking, whatever, and then they just go fight right after. It's so weird, like the piece, it's, it's so weird man. It was the first time I experienced that and I was like, maybe I can start lightening up a little bit.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Like it's only a fight. And that's kind of something I had to tell myself. Um, for this one I had to like really fall back and rely on my training because I was really nervous. I was nervous to start, um, to try the new stuff that I learned out. I never through many leg kicks in any of my fights. Um, I'd never really did that stance. Everything that I did was pretty much brand new. Um, and I was really nervous. I was like, what if it doesn't work? You know, like so many different, so many different feelings. And, um, for this one, I, the only thing I can tell myself as like, rely on your training.

Speaker 2:          07:30          Okay.
