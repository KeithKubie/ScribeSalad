YOU'RE DOING THIS
TO SCREW WITH ME.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.969
WELL, FINE. YOU WANT
A PET HOBO, HAVE AT IT.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.604
BUT IF YOU
LET THIS ONE DIE,

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.073
IT'S THE LAST PET
YOU WILL EVER GET.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.942
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:16.710
