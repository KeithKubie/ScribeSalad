MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.580
We've had a little bit
of a snafu with

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.570
our live stream today.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.290
So if you just go to this link
up here, or click the link

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.590
inside this pre-recorded thing
here, you'll see the actual

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.550
video of Jake Archibald and Addy
Osmani talking about Dev

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.370
Tools in relation to
Chrome or mobile.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.850
If you're watching this live
now, I'm sorry for actually

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.780
the mistakes that we've made.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330
Sounded really bad, actually.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.600
It's basically we pre-recorded
the show.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.260
And the actual quality of the
show when we broadcast it live

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.960
wasn't great.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.450
And we want you to have the
best quality possible.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.130
So go and look at this link.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.720
And you'll be able to see
everything that happens and

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.110
that we talked about
around Dev Tools.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.010
See you soon.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.260
Bye bye.
