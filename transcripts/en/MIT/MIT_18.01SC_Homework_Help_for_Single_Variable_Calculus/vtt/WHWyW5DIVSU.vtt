00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.189
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:11.730
Today we're going to work on a
problem involving differential

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.430
equations.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.860
I'm going to read it to
you, give you a little hint,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.340
give you some time
to work on it,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.810
and then I'll be back
and work it out for you.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.210
So, the problem is to
find a function y equals

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.240
f of x that has the following
two properties: d squared

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.119
y dx squared is equal to 6x.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.410
And just to remind you what
this means, this is really,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.940
this is the second derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.900
So, the second derivative with
respect to x should be 6x.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.210
And the second
condition's kind of long,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.070
but it says the graph of the
function in the xy-plane passes

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.880
through the point (1, 1) with
a horizontal tangent there.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.240
So let me give you one hint.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.920
And that hint is that there are
some initial conditions buried

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.420
in here.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.940
That's why we have
this condition.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.390
So I'm going to give
you a little bit of time

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.940
to work on it and I'll be back
and I'll work it out with you.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.650
Welcome back.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.370
Hopefully you were
able to start at least

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.710
solving the problem
initially, give yourself

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.890
a little direction.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.460
So let's see how you did.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.240
OK, so the first thing
I would like to do

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.570
is try and figure out maybe
what the first derivative

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.490
of the function y
equals f of x is.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.410
I have its second
derivative, so in order

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.370
to find the first
derivative I want

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.000
to find, ultimately, a function
that when I take its derivative

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.500
I get 6x.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.390
Right?

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.530
So, we can think about this.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140
Maybe the easiest
thing for us to do

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.970
would actually be to
consider another function

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.600
whose derivative is 6x.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.380
And we'll know that's dy dx.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.070
So I'm going to say this: dy--
sorry-- d squared y dx squared,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.780
I'm going to say is the first
derivative of another function,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.402
we'll say dw/dx.

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:02.860
And the reason I'm
going to do that

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.100
is so we're not too
nervous about how

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.630
we solve this problem.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.800
So let's just assume that.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.890
So I'm introducing
another function w,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.930
which is the first
derivative of y with respect

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.980
to x, ultimately.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.600
Because its derivative
is the second derivative

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.130
of y with respect to x.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.420
So let's see how to solve the
differential equation dw/dx

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.040
equals 6x.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.870
Now you may be able
to do that right away.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.100
You may see what
this is right away.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.516
If you're a little
nervous, we can

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:33.050
do a separation of variables.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.910
So right away, maybe
some of you can

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.430
see that this will be
2x-- sorry-- 3 x squared.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.100
But let's just double-check.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.450
So, separation of
variables, on this side

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.810
we get the integral of dw.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.000
On this side we get
the integral of 6x dx.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.480
Here we get a w.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.290
And here, again we
get, we should really

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.740
do 6 x squared over
2 plus a constant.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.060
So that's 3 x squared
plus a constant.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.940
I'm going to write
c_1 here because we're

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.990
went to need a little
bit of information.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.370
We're going to need
another constant later.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.860
So we actually now know the
derivative of y with respect

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.360
to x.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.342
What we found here, I'll
just write that in, is dy/dx.

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:28.550
Again, let me remind you why.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.540
We had-- we were saying
the second derivative of y

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.170
with respect to x we're
going to call dw/dx.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.200
So when I took an integral
of dw/dx, I got w.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.410
So that means I've taken
one antiderivative here

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.120
and so now I have dy/dx.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.241
So this is dy/dx.

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:50.830
I'm going to draw a line
and now we want to find y.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.250
And again we can use
separation of variables.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.350
Or this time I'm
just going to do

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.610
the problem without
separating variables,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.456
because I actually know what an
antiderivative is of this, what

00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:03.410
an antiderivative
is of this, and then

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.150
I need to add one more constant.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.340
So I can say that y is
definitely equal to x cubed

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.600
plus c_1*x plus c_2.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.315
And let me just again,
let's see why that is.

00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:18.330
Right?

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.840
This antiderivative
of this is x cubed.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.530
Antiderivative of
this is-- it's a

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.130
constant so its
antiderivative is c_1 times x.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.930
And then I have to add
on another constant

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.510
because I have a whole
family of possible solutions.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.990
So here I have y.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.850
And now I need to figure
out how to use number two.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.860
Maybe before you even go
on, you want to check,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.700
does this really
satisfy number one?

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.420
So if we wanted to
check that, we just

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.100
take two derivatives
of this expression

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.460
on the right-hand side.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.570
Two derivatives of this is 0.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.370
Two derivative of this is 0.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.240
And two derivatives
of this is 6x.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.600
So I do indeed get what I want.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.480
So now we definitely
can go on to number 2.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.137
OK?

00:05:01.137 --> 00:05:01.970
So, what do we have?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.510
Number two, it says we have
some initial conditions here.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.510
The graph in the xy-plane
passes through the point (1, 1)

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.550
and it has a horizontal
tangent there.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.960
Now what does that
actually mean?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.918
Let's think about that.

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:21.215
That actually means that
two says f of 1 equals 1.

00:05:21.215 --> 00:05:22.970
Right?

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.410
y is equal to f of x.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.060
So we can write
this also as f of x.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.410
So two, the first part
says that f of 1 is 1.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.910
And what does this
second condition?

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.326
Let's check this
second condition.

00:05:33.326 --> 00:05:35.670
It says it has a
horizontal tangent there.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.760
Horizontal tangent means that
its derivative at that x-value

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.040
is 0.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.790
So let me write down
that in a nice form.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.904
The derivative at that
x-value is equal to 0.

00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:49.320
This is a little
different, maybe,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.653
from what we've seen previously.

00:05:50.653 --> 00:05:54.100
In the lecture you saw examples,
at least-- certainly, where

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.760
you had one initial condition.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.460
Here we need two
initial conditions.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.450
And you see why, is because we
actually have two constants.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.587
Where did that come from?

00:06:01.587 --> 00:06:03.920
It's because we started with
a second derivative instead

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.370
of just the first derivative.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.810
So that's kind
of, that's why you

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.330
see more initial conditions than
maybe you've seen previously.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.570
So, let's plug these in
and let's see what we get.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.400
If f of 1 equals 1, then
let's evaluate that.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:26.250
f of 1 is equal to 1 cubed
plus 1 times c_1 plus 1 times--

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.910
or just 1, or c_2 there, sorry.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.780
There's no x there, so just c_2.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.454
And that all has to equal 1.

00:06:33.454 --> 00:06:35.370
And then let's look at
what the derivative is.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.520
The derivative is
still over here.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:44.600
So f prime at 1 is equal to 3
times 1 squared, so 3 times 1,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.880
plus c_1.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.410
And the condition says
that equals 0, equals 0.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.490
So we can read off.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.045
The nice thing is this is system
of equations but one of them

00:06:55.045 --> 00:06:58.460
is very easy to solve initially,
then we can substitute.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.420
So what does this say?

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.990
Well 3 plus c_1 equals 0.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.660
So c_1 is equal to
minus 3, negative 3.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.374
If I plug in negative 3 for
c_1, in this expression,

00:07:10.374 --> 00:07:15.010
in this equation up here, I
get negative 3 plus 1 plus c_2

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.910
has to equal 1.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.640
If I subtract the
1's from both sides

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.580
I get negative 3 plus
c_2 has to equal 0.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.610
So c_2 has to actually equal 3.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.076
So the final, final
answer is evaluating,

00:07:30.076 --> 00:07:35.150
or plugging in the c1 and the
c2 in for the constants there.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:42.820
The final, final answer is
x cubed minus 3x plus 3.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.290
So we started with a
differential equation and two

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.720
sets of initial conditions.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.690
And we came up with one
solution that satisfies that.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.730
Now you can look
at this, you could

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.020
graph this on a
calculator or computer

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.020
and look and see if it satisfies
that it actually passes

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.250
through the point (1, 1) and
has a horizontal tangent there.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.840
But we know, based on our
work, that that actually

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.230
should happen.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.993
So I think that's
where I'll stop.
