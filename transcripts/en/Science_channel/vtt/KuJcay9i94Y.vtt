00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.834
Man:
WHEN WE PUT ON A SPACE SUIT,

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:10.200
YOU'RE PRESSURING DOWN FROM 14.7
TO 4.3 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.067
Man: SO IF WE HAVE THE SAME
PRESSURE AS ON EARTH,

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:14.968
14.7 PSI, IN OUR SPACE SUIT,

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:16.767
WE WOULD BE BLOWN OUT
LIKE THE MICHELIN MAN.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.267
YOU'D BE SO PRESSURIZED

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.234
THAT YOU COULDN'T, YOU KNOW,
YOU COULDN'T REALLY MOVE.

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:21.601
YOU'D BE LIKE THIS.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.067
YOU'D BE FLOATIN'
IN SPACE AND DOIN' THIS.

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:26.868
SO WE LOWER THE PRESSURE
TO 4.3 PSI

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:29.634
SO WE HAVE ENOUGH PRESSURE
TO BREATHE FOR OUR LUNGS.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.968
BUT WE CAN ALSO MOVE
AROUND IN THE SUIT.

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:35.067
Man: A SPACE SUIT WEIGHS
ABOUT 275 POUNDS,

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.434
WHICH WOULD MAKE IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER ON EARTH.

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:40.033
BUT IN THE WEIGHTLESSNESS
OF SPACE, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.601
Man:
IF YOU CAME OFF STRUCTURE

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:43.434
AND STARTED FLOATING IN SPACE,

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:45.267
YOU COULD REEL YOURSELF BACK IN

00:00:45.267 --> 00:00:47.300
TO THE SPACE STATION
OR THE SPACE SHUTTLE.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.334
Man: BUT IF YOU UNTETHER,
ONE OF THE THINGS

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:52.767
THAT CAN HAPPEN IS THEY CAN FALL
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE OF EARTH

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:54.133
AND BASICALLY BURN UP.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:57.901
BUT THERE IS A RESCUE
DEVICE CALLED A SAFER...

00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:59.367
Man:
WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO FLY AROUND

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:01.067
LIKE GEORGE JETSON,
LIKE A JET PACK.

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:02.400
Narrator: BY USING YOUR SAFER,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.801
YOU CAN RETURN SAFELY BACK
TO YOUR SPACECRAFT.

00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:09.968
[ OPERA MUSIC PLAYING ]

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.868
Man: WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT
THE PLANET

00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:15.367
FROM THIS VANTAGE POINT,
IT BLOWS YOUR FRICKIN' MIND.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.801
IT'S ON MY BUCKET LIST.

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:22.467
NASA, PLEASE LET ME
GO TO SPACE.
