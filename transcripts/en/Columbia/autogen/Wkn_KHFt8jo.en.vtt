00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 align:start position:0%
discussion we just now realized maybe
 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.030 align:start position:0%
discussion we just now realized maybe
part<00:00:41.210><c> of</c><00:00:41.270><c> being</c><00:00:41.420><c> a</c><00:00:41.540><c> leader</c><00:00:41.750><c> is</c><00:00:42.050><c> taking</c><00:00:42.500><c> risks</c>

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 align:start position:0%
so three of our bosses and numerous
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.140 align:start position:0%
so three of our bosses and numerous
other<00:00:48.470><c> administrators</c><00:00:49.190><c> are</c><00:00:49.519><c> actually</c><00:00:49.879><c> in</c><00:00:50.000><c> the</c>

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
other administrators are actually in the

after<00:00:53.809><c> this</c><00:00:53.930><c> I</c><00:00:54.199><c> think</c><00:00:54.440><c> was</c><00:00:54.830><c> the</c><00:00:54.890><c> sentiment</c><00:00:55.489><c> so</c>

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
after this I think was the sentiment so
 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.229 align:start position:0%
after this I think was the sentiment so
just<00:00:57.080><c> a</c><00:00:57.199><c> little</c><00:00:57.440><c> bit</c><00:00:57.589><c> of</c><00:00:57.860><c> logistics</c><00:00:58.850><c> about</c><00:00:59.120><c> the</c>

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of logistics about the
 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.270 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of logistics about the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
way the panel will go I've asked each of
 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.630 align:start position:0%
way the panel will go I've asked each of
the<00:01:01.699><c> panelists</c><00:01:02.540><c> to</c><00:01:02.839><c> introduce</c><00:01:03.320><c> themselves</c>

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 align:start position:0%
using one slide in about two to three
 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.289 align:start position:0%
using one slide in about two to three
minutes<00:01:06.979><c> so</c><00:01:07.280><c> we</c><00:01:07.490><c> should</c><00:01:07.700><c> run</c><00:01:07.880><c> through</c><00:01:08.150><c> those</c>

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 align:start position:0%
minutes so we should run through those
 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
minutes so we should run through those
fairly<00:01:08.750><c> quickly</c><00:01:08.960><c> I've</c><00:01:09.229><c> got</c><00:01:09.950><c> a</c><00:01:09.979><c> list</c><00:01:10.250><c> of</c><00:01:10.460><c> about</c>
