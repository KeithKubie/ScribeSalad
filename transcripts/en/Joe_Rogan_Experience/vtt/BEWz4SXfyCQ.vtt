00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.510
To one phone number live.
First of all,
cheers gentlemen.

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.860
Let's have a little bit of toast.
Relax.
Bob,
thank you very much for doing this.

3
00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:13.060
I really appreciate it.
I understand that you've told the story many,

4
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:17.230
many times.
You've been grilled many,
many times and it's very stressful for you.

5
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:19.240
So I've,
I really,
really appreciate your time.

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.430
For people who don't know the story,
um,
there is a documentary,
um,

7
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.550
Jeremy Cor,
bell has a documentary out right now.

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.580
It's called Bob Lasar area 51 and Ufos and flying saucers and flying saucers,

9
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.040
not 51 and fly.
It's okay.
Um,

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.600
I first heard your story decades go,
I've uh,

11
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.440
I told you last night we went out to dinner.

12
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.170
I've seen pretty much every interview you've ever given.

13
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.540
I've followed the story incredibly closely,

14
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.430
but for people who don't know the story,
let's give them the bullet points.

15
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.490
You used to work at area 51 and area 51.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.980
Got You.
You went like,
Huh?

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.510
<v 1>Well,
you know,
we want to be accurate.
Okay.
Area as for s four,</v>

18
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.510
it's about 15 miles south of area 51.
Okay.
But,
um,

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.950
you worked in,
what would do,
how would you describe it?

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.850
I guess within the area 51 compound,

21
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.450
you can call that a subset of area 51.
And yes.

22
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.170
<v 0>You got that job.
Before that you were working,</v>

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.780
<v 1>before that I had worked at Los Alamos national labs in New Mexico</v>

24
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.980
<v 0>and you were involved in</v>

25
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.200
<v 1>what kind of work?
The nuclear weapon development physics.
I mean that's,</v>

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.790
they do everything there.

27
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.500
<v 0>So how do they approach you to say,
Hey Bob,</v>

28
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.880
why don't you come on out to the Nevada

29
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.810
<v 1>desert?
Well,
the way this went down was,</v>

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.480
um,
at that time it was 1982,
I,

31
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.040
um,
I put,
uh,
a jet engine in my,

32
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.310
my Honda and Los Alamos put it on the front page of the paper.

33
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.750
He said,
you know,
uh,
Los Alamos man physicist at the lab,
you know,

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.630
built this 200 mile an hour,
you know,

35
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.910
on the jet card that I drove to work every day.
So,
uh,

36
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.760
so I was known in Los Alamos,
the guy with the weird car and you know,

37
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.150
you could hear it from,
you know,
a mile away.
Anyway,

38
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.450
the day that came out on the front page of the paper was the day Edward Teller,

39
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:31.451
the father of the hydrogen bomb was giving a lecture down there at the lab and

40
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.510
we didn't have much going on that day in our group.

41
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.050
And I asked if I could go down there.
And,
um,

42
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.100
I went down there early and ed teller was outside leaning on a brick wall there

43
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.790
and reading the front page of the paper.
Now this the guy out of history.

44
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:53.090
So I introduced myself,
Hey,
I'm the guy you're reading about there.

45
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.330
And we talked for a little while and it was cool.
Uh,
you know,

46
00:02:56.331 --> 00:03:00.620
fast forward two years later I had moved out to Las Vegas and had,
you know,

47
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.060
left Los Alamos and,
you know,

48
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.490
went on to other things and I wanted to get back into the scientific community.

49
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.870
Yeah.
I left start other businesses and,
and that sort of thing.

50
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:15.520
So I sent resumes out and one of them went out to ed teller and referenced our

51
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:20.380
meeting,
you know,
back back in the day.
And,
uh,

52
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.400
anyway,
he remembered me and gave me a reference,

53
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.870
somebody to contacted Eg and g.
And that's pretty much how it started.

54
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.813
So

55
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.190
<v 0>you get a phone call or a letter,
like what do you get?</v>

56
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.980
<v 1>Well,
I got a,
what did I get?</v>

57
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.220
I got a letter initially and went down for an interview probably a couple times

58
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:48.550
and it was down at,
uh,
Eg and g special projects,
which was,
um,

59
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.790
at McCarran airport at that time out in Las Vegas.

60
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.800
<v 0>And did they give you any sort of job description of what you were applying for?</v>

61
00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.130
<v 1>Um,
they said it was for,
I can't remember exactly what they did.</v>

62
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:04.110
This was a long time ago,
but I think it was,
um,

63
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.750
advanced propulsion or something like that.
Something relatively generic.

64
00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:12.470
And they said it's in a remote area.
Um,
you know,

65
00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:17.180
it's going to be some days on,
some days off.
And um,
you know,

66
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:20.390
it was kind of a,
it was kind of a,

67
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.220
not exactly a full time job,

68
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:25.940
but you might have to be out there for two weeks at a time and take two weeks

69
00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:29.720
off.
So it was kind of,
uh,
the work schedule would be kind of broken up.

70
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.650
<v 0>And did they seem attractive to you or did it seem weird?</v>

71
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.910
Wehrly wasn't,
yeah.

72
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.650
<v 1>Where'd,
because people that work at the test site,</v>

73
00:04:37.651 --> 00:04:40.830
anybody that's familiar with the area up there,
um,
you know,

74
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:43.120
working at the nuclear test site,
uh,

75
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.090
or at the tone of pod test range north of there,
that's typically how things go.

76
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.630
<v 0>So you had known about it from the scientific community because the area 51 at</v>

77
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:57.080
that time was anything about area 51 okay.
So they just said it was in,
uh,

78
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.150
you know,
in a remote location and you just know it was up at the test site.

79
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.450
Right.
So,
but there was no mention of area 51 at that time.

80
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:08.230
So they've done hundreds of nuclear tests in Nevada,

81
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.090
in Nevada that that whole area was,

82
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.270
there's been just giant chunks of Nevada that people,
yeah,
there's a

83
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.540
<v 1>big piece of Nevada and it's split up into different areas.</v>

84
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.890
There's a nuclear test site,

85
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.730
there's area 51 there's the tone of pod test range north of that.

86
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:22.750
There's little sub areas.

87
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.690
There's areas where they test chemical weapons and things like that.

88
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:28.810
So it's all broken up as a gigantic test area.

89
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.890
So take me back to first day on the job,
you accepted job,

90
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.120
they take you out there.
Yeah,
it's um,

91
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.220
the first day really I didn't really get to see a whole lot.

92
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.200
The first day was essentially just paperwork.

93
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.230
That's when I flew into area 51 proper and I left a McCarran airport and flew

94
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:55.190
what they call the Janet flights.
Just,
um,
you know,

95
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.760
a passenger plane from Las Vegas to area 51,

96
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.420
and it was really just going through a mountain of paperwork that day,

97
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.440
uh,
from security clearances to,
um,
God.
There was,

98
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.220
it was like two or three hours of just solid paperwork and that was,

99
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.290
that was really an uneventful first day.

100
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.360
<v 0>When did things get weird?</v>

101
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.960
When did you realize that at what point in time did you say,
Hey,

102
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.200
this is not normal work?

103
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.200
Like this doesn't even seem like it's from this planet?

104
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.860
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.401
<v 1>That,</v>

106
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:38.080
I can't tell you what day that occurred on because so much time has gone by the

107
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.200
days of kind of fused into one and I can't separate the days.

108
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.910
<v 0>Was it a slow burn or was there a moment of recognition?</v>

109
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.130
<v 1>Well,
they're the,
the first inkling I had was when I,</v>

110
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.720
I came in normal.
There's this facility that is at s four.

111
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.790
It's in the side of a mountain.

112
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
And normally we had pulled in with the bus and gone around the front through a

113
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:03.260
normal double door.

114
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.730
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.310
<v 1>This time that I went in there were hangar doors open.</v>

116
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.170
I went into the hangar door and in the hangar door was the disc,

117
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:14.150
the flying saucer that I worked on.

118
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.220
I saw it sitting there and we walked by it.

119
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.900
It had a little American flag stuck on the side and I thought,
oh my God,

120
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.750
this finally explains all the flying saucer stories.

121
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:28.120
This is just an advanced fighter and it,
this is fucking hilarious,
right?

122
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.130
So I went by,
I slid my hand alongside it.

123
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:34.760
I got reprimanded immediately for touching the thing.
And,
uh,

124
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:37.220
there was a guy in armed guard that followed it's in and just said,

125
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:41.270
keep your eyes at forward in your hands at your site and just walk in the door.

126
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.710
So that was the first time I'd seen anything.
That was weird.

127
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.840
It was some time later that I was introduced to my,
um,

128
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.660
my lab partner Barry and we had some of the sub components of the craft,

129
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.210
uh,
in the lab and Barry was very anxious to get a new lab partner.

130
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.270
So he was very talkative and couldn't wait to show me different things.

131
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.460
And it was in the demonstration of the reactor working where it caught my

132
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:15.461
attention to where this is technology that doesn't even exist.

133
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.540
So I mean that was the first time I knew that this is

134
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.900
<v 0>really something different.
What was it,
what was it?
What was the,</v>

135
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.290
what was it about this reactor that made you think that it didn't exist

136
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.250
<v 1>technologically?</v>

137
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.880
Well it was that I actually have to back up cause there were some briefings that

138
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:41.140
I read it before that,
that
um,
you know,

139
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:44.740
certainly gave me the impression that this is going to be a weird job.

140
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:47.120
But this was the first hands on thing.
Uh,

141
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.280
this was a small reactor about the size of a hemisphere,

142
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.410
about the size of a basketball on a metal plate.

143
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.780
And when was running it produced a gravitational field,

144
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.020
the gravitational field of its own.
Now this is something that we can't do.

145
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:03.150
We can't produce any gravity.

146
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.170
The only way we get gravity is from large quantities of mass.

147
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.430
But there's no machine we can have that turns on that makes gravity like,
uh,

148
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.120
you know,
you can turn on an electromagnet and it makes a magnetic field.

149
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.760
We can't make a gravitational field.
Anyway,

150
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:21.180
this device was producing that and Barry said,

151
00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.810
almost like he was bragging.
Go ahead and try and try and touch the sphere.
And I,

152
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.170
I couldn't,
it would,
it pushed my hands away.

153
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.140
Just like two light poles of a magnet.
So that was a,

154
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:33.350
so like when you take two magnets and trying to press them together and then

155
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:36.660
yeah,
you have this,
each other,
yeah.
That kinda could cushion feeling,

156
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.300
but you can't,
you can't get them together.
The closer you put them,

157
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:42.080
the more they push button.
You felt that physical with my hand.
Yeah.

158
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.280
Now there's nothing,
there's nothing that does that.

159
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.110
And that immediately caught my attention going,
wow,
this is something else.

160
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.010
What was your thought like when you felt that and you knew that there was

161
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:57.240
nothing that you're aware of that could pretend that that connected me to the

162
00:09:57.241 --> 00:10:02.241
briefings that I read on the first day at s four was that,

163
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.030
uh,
you know,
everything that I had read was apparently accurate.

164
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.260
What were you reading?
I read,
it was kind of an overview.

165
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.220
This project was to back engineer the alien craft and specifically it was to try

166
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.970
and back engineer and see if we can duplicate the technology with available

167
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.030
materials.
Now to do this,

168
00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:30.140
they split the project into,
you know,

169
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.840
many different pieces for several reasons.
They do,

170
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.680
they do this on all classified projects.
So,
uh,
nobody has the complete story,

171
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.320
but,
uh,
they compartmentalize everything.

172
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.450
Now we have the power and propulsion system.

173
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.800
So what have briefings they gave me were like a one or two page overview of some

174
00:10:46.801 --> 00:10:50.250
of the other projects that were going on,
you know,
on the craft.

175
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.230
The only reason they do that is just in case what you're working on is connected

176
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:58.170
intimately in some way that we don't know up to one of the other projects.

177
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:02.850
You have to know their,
excuse me,
their existence.
So,
um,

178
00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.950
you know,
I,
but again,
everything from metallurgy to um,

179
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.230
you know,
weapon,
potential,
the craft and these were all,
you know,

180
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.270
essentially very short briefings,

181
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:20.271
but mine was just power and propulsion and it made it very clear that what I

182
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:24.840
read was accurate.
So when you're reading that,

183
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:26.790
before you actually saw the reactor,

184
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.210
what were your thoughts on what they were describing?

185
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.690
If you knew that something like that didn't exist and they're describing it and

186
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:40.880
the briefings,
what did you think you're going to see?
I really,
I,

187
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.800
I didn't know at the time.
I mean,
I was reading,
I thought,

188
00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:48.210
is this some kind of test?
Um,
see if you're crazy.
Well,

189
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:50.460
not to see if I'm crazy to,
uh,
you know,

190
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.240
a lot of times they'll take an real high security,
uh,
jobs.

191
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:59.560
I mean,
they'll intentionally insert nonsense into them.
Um,

192
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.880
whether it's to confuse the fact or if for someone was to leak it out,
uh,

193
00:12:03.881 --> 00:12:06.790
they would carry that information along and know where it came from.

194
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:10.870
So I read through the documents,
but you know,

195
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.220
I didn't know if this was,
you know,
part of some kind of test or,
um,

196
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.300
you know,
or,
or what,
or was it potentially realistic?
I mean,

197
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:24.301
I had really didn't consider it being all that possible as far as being,

198
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.210
uh,
the actual thing that I was going to work on at the time.

199
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.740
How did they turn it on there?
The reactor?
Yeah.
You react.

200
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.340
It can be turned on or turned off in a lot of different ways.
Um,

201
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.970
the way Barry showed me at the hemisphere is removed.

202
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.510
There was a small tower in the middle.
When you put the hemisphere on,

203
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.650
the reactor activates,
the reactors,
shuts down.
It's,

204
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.870
it's load sensing.
So if there's,
if there's no load on the reactor at all,

205
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.570
it shuts down.
When there's a load present on it,

206
00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.670
it starts up again load meaning you can get centered in electrical load.

207
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.330
So although it doesn't necessarily operate electrically,

208
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.140
there's no wiring that connects any of the sub components together whatsoever.

209
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:15.190
They just have to be in the immediate vicinity.
It's a,
it is,

210
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.440
but the stuff is borderline magic and that's essentially where we left it,

211
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.850
you know,
when I left the project,
so there was no progress made.

212
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.240
There was some progress.
I mean,
we did identify,

213
00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:32.290
at least we think some processes and,
and had a rough idea.

214
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.650
We think of what was going on.
But,
um,

215
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:40.180
I think this is a problem that they've had for a long time.
And,

216
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.480
um,
you know,
the,

217
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.030
I was replacing somebody that Barry worked with prior to me and I think there

218
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.440
was some horrific accident that I didn't have a whole lot of information on.

219
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:54.340
But you know,
Barry alluded to that horrific accident.
What,

220
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.900
where someone died or yeah,

221
00:13:55.901 --> 00:14:00.010
where somebody died because they were trying to tamper with things or figure out

222
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.020
how something worked.
Yeah.
The reactor in particular,
but yet he let you touch it.

223
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.360
Yeah.
I think what they were trying to do was cut into one now they had,

224
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:14.290
they had more than one there and that was supposedly there was an unannounced

225
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:18.400
nuclear test and that's what it was at the time.

226
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.420
Remember they was still do an underground nuclear tests at the test site.
Um,

227
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.560
but from what I understand,
according to Barry,
there was an attempt made.

228
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:29.710
Now this must've been a pretty desperate attempt because it's not very

229
00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.970
scientific process to cut,
you know,
analyze something that way.

230
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:36.410
But it looked like they used a plasma cutter or something.

231
00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:40.900
I got to cut into an operating reactor.
How many of these things did they have?

232
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.970
They had nine,
nine craft altogether.
I only got hands on with one of them.

233
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.990
So I can't really say what the,
you know,
how the others operated?

234
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.690
Did you see the other ones?
Yeah.
At one time.
And only one time,

235
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.400
the bay doors between the hangers were all open and I could see all the way

236
00:14:58.401 --> 00:14:59.234
through.

237
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.230
<v 0>And were they all exactly the same?
No,
they were all different.
Different shapes.</v>

238
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:08.760
Yeah,
but they were all from somewhere else.
Yeah,
absolutely.

239
00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:10.223
Now,

240
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.260
did anyone make any attempt to explain or to tell you where they came from?

241
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:17.940
<v 1>No.
No.</v>

242
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:22.520
No one is the least bit interested in letting everybody know all the facts that

243
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.710
they wanted to give you the minimum information that's necessary to complete

244
00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:29.460
your task so you're not getting the story of where they came from.

245
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.440
You're not getting the story of what,

246
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:36.000
how much progress other people who are making you just focus on the small

247
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:36.800
component,

248
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.800
<v 0>but they gave you some indication that they'd been working on these for awhile.</v>

249
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.190
<v 1>Yeah.
When do you think they acquired these?</v>

250
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:49.290
I really couldn't say.
I think they've been around for awhile.

251
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.390
<v 0>So they bring you into this room,</v>

252
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.420
you see this reactor working you,

253
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.890
you realize this is nothing that as far as like the scientific community at that

254
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:05.900
current time has the ability to create
[inaudible].

255
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.980
What is your life like from that moment on?
Is that where everything changes?

256
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.270
Cause you do you,
I mean,

257
00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:16.340
I would imagine the moment you actually make contact with something that's extra

258
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:17.000
terrestrial,

259
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.780
whether it's an object or a being something where you can actually absolutely be

260
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:24.860
certain.
It's not from here.
You're whole paradigm.

261
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.250
The whole world you live in is now a different place.

262
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.920
<v 1>This is the only time it became exciting,
you know,
the rest of the time though,</v>

263
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.750
it was really an,
an ominous feeling being at work.

264
00:16:36.751 --> 00:16:40.950
But at that time it was exciting.
I mean,
this was,

265
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.060
now I knew we were on the absolute bi actually beyond the cutting edge of

266
00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:46.380
science.
And I was,

267
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.420
I was so absolutely excited to be there every single time.
I was,

268
00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:57.060
um,
you know,
it,
this was a fantastic opportunity.
And um,

269
00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.330
however,
in,

270
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.450
in short order it began to concern me,

271
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.200
we really have no idea what we're talking about.

272
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:12.950
And the excitement kind of turned to dread at some point because the amount of

273
00:17:15.691 --> 00:17:19.080
power we're dealing with is astronomical.

274
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.970
I mean to affect gravity,
to produce the effects like this equipment does,

275
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.430
takes huge amounts of power.

276
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:31.260
And I've given the example before of you know,

277
00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:34.380
taking a small portable nuclear reactor and you know,

278
00:17:34.381 --> 00:17:36.720
putting it back into Victorian Times,
you know,

279
00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:41.310
with the scientists at the time and just dropping it or in a room and they come

280
00:17:41.311 --> 00:17:45.390
and look at it and see that it's producing power and wonder how it works at.

281
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.280
They start taking it apart and as soon as they,
some of the shielding off,

282
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.160
the people are going to drop dead because of the radiation inside.

283
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:58.350
Now the people have no idea that he radiation even exist back then,

284
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.920
but anybody that comes in to check on them,
we'll also drop dead.

285
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.930
And you know,

286
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.060
there's no reason that that exact scenario couldn't happen with what we're

287
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:13.890
dealing with.
We have no idea how the physics operate within this thing.

288
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.620
The power levels are,
are,
like I said,

289
00:18:16.621 --> 00:18:20.790
astronomic like it's incredibly dangerous to tinker with something like that.

290
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.530
And you know,

291
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.340
in some respects we were Guinea pigs just try to find out how to make this
thing.

292
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:31.590
<v 0>So they had had a series e as far as you surmised that a series of different</v>

293
00:18:32.081 --> 00:18:34.180
scientists try to back engineer this thing,

294
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.180
try to figure out what this thing was and they would bring in new people and

295
00:18:37.181 --> 00:18:38.320
like let's throw Bob at it.

296
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.450
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
And they know,
I don't know how many,</v>

297
00:18:41.451 --> 00:18:46.280
but I knew there was certainly one before me and I knew he died during the

298
00:18:46.281 --> 00:18:49.670
analysis of the or the reactor itself and

299
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:55.610
<v 0>you don't know how many have worked on it and no one gave any good,</v>

300
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.470
<v 1>been there for 50 years.
It could have been there</v>

301
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.600
<v 0>five years.
Instructions.
What are they saying?</v>

302
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.180
Like w when they're giving you direction,
the showing you all this stuff.

303
00:19:04.181 --> 00:19:06.580
Like what,
what are,
what are they saying specifically?

304
00:19:06.581 --> 00:19:07.480
What are they asking of you?

305
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.250
<v 1>Well essentially what they ask is,</v>

306
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:14.240
is what I said we are just to gather as much information as possible,

307
00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:18.160
find out how it operates and see if we can duplicate it.
So I was relieved

308
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.690
<v 0>where it was from.
They never let you ask questions about where it's from.</v>

309
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.700
<v 1>Well if the information I read in the briefings was accurate,</v>

310
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.570
now what I do have to say is the information that pertained directly to the

311
00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:35.630
reactor was accurate.
What I read

312
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:37.743
<v 3>did,</v>

313
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.270
<v 1>I mean did jive with reality.
Um,
in terms of how,</v>

314
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.460
in terms of how it was made,
how,
what we saw,
how it operated,
the materials,

315
00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:51.720
how it,
you know,
turned on and what was discovered,
uh,
uh,

316
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.640
discovered about it.

317
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.330
<v 0>I'm sorry,
the Migraine is really making it hard for me to think here.</v>

318
00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.170
We talked about before the podcast should tell everybody Bob was getting a

319
00:20:01.171 --> 00:20:03.160
migraine.
I know you're very stressed out by this.
Was,

320
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.010
is one of the reasons why I appreciate you doing this.

321
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.800
<v 1>Um,
where was,</v>

322
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:11.430
I already explained it and uh,

323
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
so there was some paperwork that indicated that this was from the Zeta Reticuli

324
00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:21.120
star system now.
Yeah.

325
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.830
Now how they obtain that,
I haven't,
I haven't the slightest idea,

326
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.740
but it wasn't just from the Zeta Reticuli star system.

327
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.310
It was what they calledZ r three.

328
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.410
So it was a third planet in that star system.

329
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:39.650
So there was no other information about it other than that supposedly whether

330
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.260
craft came from now,
is that true?
I don't know.
I have no way of verifying that.

331
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:47.070
But that was printed in the same materials that referenced the reactor.

332
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.820
Now I looked that stuff up when I went home and uh,
Zeta,

333
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:54.850
particularly as a binary star,
um,

334
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.450
two stars that orbit orbit one another and it's only visible in the southern

335
00:20:58.451 --> 00:21:01.180
hemisphere and it's about 30 some odd light years away.

336
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.300
So that's literally all the information I have about that.

337
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:07.090
I don't know how they found out it came from there.

338
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.830
<v 0>And you also probably have some suspicions that they give you some</v>

339
00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:14.490
disinformation like you were talking about before where they would,
yeah,
yeah,

340
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.730
too.
I mean,
if you ever decided to talk about this,

341
00:21:17.731 --> 00:21:21.420
they added a bunch of nonsense to make whatever is factual look ridiculous.

342
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.190
<v 1>Right.
Or be able to trace it down like,
hey,
this fax came out and you know,</v>

343
00:21:26.191 --> 00:21:28.050
this Lasar guy said at cat,
you know,

344
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.470
came from Zeta Reticuli so they knew who it was.
Would it be made bread?

345
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.490
Zeta reticulate we like,
what in the fuck is this?
Well,

346
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.790
reading all of this stuff,
it was,
what in the fuck is this?

347
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.740
Like why did I sign up for this week?
To me this was cool.
This was interesting.

348
00:21:43.741 --> 00:21:47.170
I said I was just excited to be out in a secure area,
you know,

349
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.220
in the middle of the desert.
I said,
this is awesome.
How old are you going on?

350
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.410
I guess as in my twenties

351
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:55.780
<v 0>yeah,
so you'd probably like totally geeked out.</v>

352
00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.790
<v 1>Oh yeah,
this was,
this was great.
I mean,
I was excited so I didn't care.</v>

353
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:02.430
I reading through everything.
And

354
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.400
<v 0>so you read through all the Zeta particularly thing,</v>

355
00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:07.820
but then when you see the actual star ship with the little American flag sticker

356
00:22:07.821 --> 00:22:11.510
on it,
well that was,
was that later or before

357
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:13.833
<v 2>that?</v>

358
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.710
<v 0>That was before.
So before.
So you see the thing before and you say,
Oh,</v>

359
00:22:18.711 --> 00:22:23.570
this is the way it was that before hard.
So many years.
Yeah.
I can't either way.

360
00:22:23.571 --> 00:22:24.100
It doesn't matter.

361
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.450
<v 1>The days of fused together,</v>

362
00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:28.720
it's so hard to separate what happened in eighth visit.

363
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.140
[inaudible] the thought process when you read that it's from zero typically.

364
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.850
Yeah,
it,
it,
it didn't hit me like a ton of bricks or anything.
It's just like,

365
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:42.100
yeah.
Okay.
And I think it was bullshit.
I don't know.
It's just weird now.
I don't,

366
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.390
I mean,
because when I read it,

367
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.770
I hadn't verified anything and this was just a bunch of stuff I was reading and

368
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.980
I thought maybe after this they're just going to give me a test and see what I

369
00:22:50.981 --> 00:22:55.660
can remember and crazy information and then it would,
but um,

370
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:59.980
like I said,
when I finally went in with Barry,
um,

371
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:05.160
and had hands on experience with what they were talking about,

372
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.830
it dot gone a completely different meaning.

373
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.480
<v 0>So there's a plate,</v>

374
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:12.690
there's this thing that looks like a half a basketball and when it's on,

375
00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:16.050
you can't come anywhere near it.
You can't touch it.
Right.
How is,

376
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.680
what is gravity about that?
Like the I,

377
00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:22.200
the concept of gravity in most people's gravity's bringing something yeah.

378
00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:25.030
<v 1>Towards it.
Right.
Well,
I guess you would say it's anti gravity.</v>

379
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.750
It's gravity shifted 180 degrees.
It's a,
you know,

380
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.113
anti gravity.

381
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.280
<v 0>And did they have any understanding about what could possibly create this</v>

382
00:23:36.771 --> 00:23:37.604
effect?

383
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:41.870
Did they have any areas where they'd like you to look into?

384
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.503
<v 1>No,
they,</v>

385
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.140
<v 2>yeah.</v>

386
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:51.140
<v 1>Well they knew there was a fuel source in it and they were proficient at making</v>

387
00:23:52.831 --> 00:23:56.190
it work.
And again,
my analogy to something like this,

388
00:23:56.191 --> 00:24:00.120
as you can drop on motorcycle off in the wagon train days and just leave it with

389
00:24:00.121 --> 00:24:03.810
the keys parked outside,
you know,
somebody's place,
everybody,

390
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.380
I'll come around it and they'll poke and prod and eventually they'll turn the

391
00:24:07.381 --> 00:24:11.370
key,
get it to start and become proficient at writing it.
Yeah.

392
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.510
But they won't be able to understand what the hell is going on.

393
00:24:15.511 --> 00:24:18.900
They won't be able to make the plastic fender much less anything else.

394
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.510
And I think that's exactly the state we were at.

395
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.200
We played around with the parts long enough before I got there where they could

396
00:24:25.201 --> 00:24:27.510
make the reactor operate.
Um,

397
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.340
take the fuel out and know that it makes it work.
Um,

398
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:36.420
how exactly what was going on,
uh,
in the reactor,

399
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.050
a marine main of mystery at the time.
Um,

400
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.310
I think we made some progress on what was going on inside,

401
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.520
but I don't think anybody really knew anything.

402
00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:50.550
They could just watch what was going on and make note of it.

403
00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:54.390
How long were you there?
I'd say about six months or so.

404
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.170
And what progress was made while you were there?
Well,

405
00:24:58.171 --> 00:24:59.580
we came up with a bunch of,

406
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.670
<v 2>yeah,</v>

407
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:04.850
<v 1>reasonably good ideas about how the reactor worked.</v>

408
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.640
And one of them was the base,

409
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:10.770
the square base of it was essentially like a cyclotron,

410
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:13.970
which is a small particle accelerator,
a circular one.

411
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.290
Particle accelerators of Linear Particle accelerators are just,
uh,
you know,

412
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.730
long tube essentially in the accelerate particles with high voltage and you
know,

413
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:25.010
radio frequencies until they reach high speeds.

414
00:25:25.011 --> 00:25:28.460
But a cyclotron does that and a smaller circular area.

415
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.880
And there's this very heavy element fuel element one 15 something that wasn't on

416
00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:39.830
our periodic charts at the time,
but it is now.
It is now.
Yeah.

417
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:44.100
When did it become on the periodic table now?
The way the charts now,
you know,

418
00:25:44.101 --> 00:25:46.010
I don't remember.
Do you remember when they,

419
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.510
<v 4>uh,</v>

420
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:51.510
2004 Darmstadt Germany I think is where they first fabricated for atoms that

421
00:25:51.551 --> 00:25:55.180
lasted 220 milliseconds.
The items,
it's nothing.
Right.

422
00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.820
And then it later was discovered a couple more times.

423
00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.860
They could fabricate it then they gave it,

424
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.010
they gave it a place then on the periodic chart after that called the Muskogee.

425
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:04.450
Liam.

426
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.140
<v 1>So they told you about this stuff in 1982?</v>

427
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:14.330
Yeah.
Well we can automate it to what,
what year was this?
It was 88,

428
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.390
88 and 89 when I was there.

429
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.690
[inaudible] 82 [inaudible] 82 was when you were at Los Alamos.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

430
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.890
So 88 89 they told you about this stuff.
So this was not like,
no,
they didn't,

431
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:25.120
they didn't tell me about it.

432
00:26:25.121 --> 00:26:29.050
That's one of the things that this group came up with the um,

433
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.950
um,
I keep losing my train of thought with this thing.
So this one area,

434
00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.420
this,
this element one 15 was the fuel.

435
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.830
Yeah,
it was the fuel.
Um,

436
00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.010
<v 4>the,
the world were,
forgive you for having a migraine.
I could,</v>

437
00:26:54.011 --> 00:26:58.630
I guess it's really hard to
give you more.
Yeah,
definitely.

438
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.990
As I say,
one thing,
you know,
bought for the last 30 years,

439
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.860
people have just been on the attack on Bob,
you know,
getting to know him,

440
00:27:05.861 --> 00:27:07.720
the personal effects on his life.

441
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:12.160
It's really hard to understand unless you meet his family and his wife.
I mean,

442
00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.550
this is the last thing he wanted to fucking do was have to talk.

443
00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.760
<v 0>Yeah.
We should explain that.
Jeremy,
you and I had this conversation.</v>

444
00:27:18.761 --> 00:27:22.720
I watched your documentary.
We had this conversation and I said,

445
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:27.490
I have to talk to them.
Yeah.
The document there was,
there's been detractors,

446
00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.820
there's been a bunch of people that called bullshit on many of the things that

447
00:27:30.821 --> 00:27:32.800
you've said,
but over time,

448
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.090
many of the things that you talked about,
even in the 80s,

449
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.540
have proven to be true.
Things that people said were not true.

450
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.450
We're proven to be true.
Element one 15 was one of them.

451
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.810
<v 1>Right,
right,
right.
Uh,
element one 15,</v>

452
00:27:47.811 --> 00:27:51.350
the fuel they had was stable.
In other words,
it didn't decay.

453
00:27:51.351 --> 00:27:54.020
It wasn't a meeting radioactivity.
Um,

454
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:58.610
when they synthesized the two or three atoms of the one 15,

455
00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.230
uh,
it did decay and it was not a stable element.
So they're,

456
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.680
they're kind of two different things,
but this is kind of typical elements,

457
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.151
always have,

458
00:28:08.151 --> 00:28:12.620
are pretty much always have a stable isotopes and unstable isotopes.

459
00:28:12.621 --> 00:28:17.450
Like I think cesium as like 30 on stable isotopes to it.
So,

460
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.800
all right,
well,
hydrogen for example,
you're familiar with hydrogen gas.
Um,

461
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.450
it's stable.
It's not radioactive,
but there's also two other types of hydrogen,

462
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:32.060
deuterium and tritium.
And Deuterium isn't radioactive.

463
00:28:32.061 --> 00:28:36.350
It's another stable isotope of hydrogen,
but Tridium is radioactive now.

464
00:28:36.351 --> 00:28:40.160
They're all hydrogen,
but they just have a different amounts of neutrons.

465
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.720
So it's the same thing with other elements and element one 15,

466
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.660
depending on the amount of neutrons it has,
uh,

467
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.980
designates the isotope.
But it's one 15,

468
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:55.370
they will continue to take,
uh,

469
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.600
or experiment and try and make one 15 at different isotopes.

470
00:28:59.601 --> 00:29:02.060
And I'm sure eventually they'll come up with a stable version,

471
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.750
but it's the taste stable version that has the properties that we're talking

472
00:29:05.751 --> 00:29:06.130
about.

473
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.090
<v 0>So they somehow or another had acquired a stable version.</v>

474
00:29:10.091 --> 00:29:13.450
Did they say that the stable version had come with this craft?
Right,
absolutely.

475
00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:14.410
Came with the graph.
Yeah.

476
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.680
So at the time you having a firm knowledge of the periodic chart and knowing

477
00:29:20.261 --> 00:29:21.820
what was real and what wasn't real,

478
00:29:21.821 --> 00:29:26.650
what was your reaction to having this stable element one 15 that wasn't even

479
00:29:26.651 --> 00:29:27.660
supposed to exist?
Well,

480
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.500
<v 1>everything was impossible,
right?
I mean down,
down to the metal.</v>

481
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:36.590
I did get a chance to look inside the craft on only one occasion.

482
00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.440
And this was important because,
um,
where are the reactors?

483
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.210
Sat might have been critical to how it operated since everything operates

484
00:29:46.211 --> 00:29:50.680
without any inner connections.
So the placement of components might be critical.

485
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.660
So they allowed me to go inside and,
and look at it.
Um,

486
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.140
<v 0>sure.
Again,
I forgot where the hell I am.</v>

487
00:29:58.141 --> 00:30:02.370
So you're going into this craft and what are you thinking when you were inside

488
00:30:02.371 --> 00:30:03.660
of it?
Like what are you seeing?

489
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:08.750
<v 1>It's um,
it's a very ominous feeling because it's,</v>

490
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.680
there are no f,
first of all,
everything is one color.

491
00:30:12.681 --> 00:30:17.600
It's like a dark pewter color.
And there are no right angles anywhere.

492
00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:21.260
It's as if somebody took a,
I've said this before,

493
00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.380
somebody took on a model out of and fashioned it out of wax and then he did it

494
00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:28.850
just for a short time.
So everything melted.

495
00:30:28.851 --> 00:30:30.800
Everything looks like it's fused together.

496
00:30:30.801 --> 00:30:35.090
Everything has a radius of curvature or to,
uh,
items,
meat.

497
00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.860
It's a,
it's a really weird looking thing.
But,
um,

498
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:42.680
uh,

499
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.680
there was almost nothing other than a small foldable hatchway that,

500
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.560
um,
that looked recognizable.
Everything was,
uh,

501
00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:56.510
was really unworldly to pick on it.
A way to describe it.

502
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:57.780
<v 0>So you,</v>

503
00:30:57.781 --> 00:31:01.620
you get inside this thing and it's designed for something that's much smaller

504
00:31:01.621 --> 00:31:02.640
than a human being.
Yeah.

505
00:31:02.641 --> 00:31:05.130
You can't really stand up till you get to the very center of.

506
00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:09.960
And how tall are you?
I'm five.
10.
And what do you think this was designed for?

507
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.960
I'd say something close to half my height.
Wow.

508
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.650
So these little three foot tall ish creatures.

509
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.390
<v 1>Yeah.
And that the seats were small too.
I mean,
obviously it was made,
you know,</v>

510
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.040
for something,
something small,
but there is no,
like,
there's,

511
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.020
there's nothing else in there.
There's just seats,

512
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.980
the reactor and some of the sub components.
There's no,
there's no control panels.

513
00:31:32.981 --> 00:31:37.150
There's no bathroom.
There's no,
no decorative,
uh,

514
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:41.690
components or artwork or anything that you would recognize or trim.
I'm in.

515
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.580
It's just a very bare bones thing.
You're not seeing any screens.

516
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.411
Well,

517
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:52.411
there are archways around it at that are part of the superstructure and that one

518
00:31:53.351 --> 00:31:57.610
of the archways can become a transparent,
when I was in there,

519
00:31:57.611 --> 00:32:02.611
there was another group working on one of the archways and you could call that a

520
00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:03.760
screen

521
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.560
<v 0>more or less.
So through that archway it would be,</v>

522
00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.350
it would maintain the solidity,
the,
the solid,

523
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:16.420
whatever metal it was.
Yeah.
But you could sit.
Just became transparent.
Yeah.

524
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.360
I saw that happen once or twice before I left.

525
00:32:19.361 --> 00:32:21.210
Did you ask any questions about what the no,

526
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:23.220
there's no asking because no one's asking the question now,

527
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.090
but when you watch something become transparent and you realize it's still
there,

528
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:29.170
but you can now see through it.

529
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.250
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean now that's not that impressive.</v>

530
00:32:32.251 --> 00:32:36.090
We do have some liquid crystal materials that are like that,
you know,

531
00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.160
they never seen in smart glass.
Yeah.
They call it smart glass.
So this is just a,

532
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.380
and I don't know if the craft is made of,
you know,
in advance metal or a ceramic.

533
00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:50.270
It was cold to the church.
So,
um,
you know,
I would lean more towards a metal.

534
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.390
You're not allowed to ask questions.
No,
the only,

535
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:58.580
they work on the buddy system so I can only exchange ideas and talk to Barry.

536
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.710
Now this really interferes with science because science is based on free

537
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:07.790
discussion and ideally you get a bunch of guys together,
exchange ideas,

538
00:33:07.791 --> 00:33:10.220
work on problems and that's how things move forward.

539
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:14.540
But they're so over the top concerned about security.

540
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.010
They split everything off and everybody becomes stagnant.

541
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:20.780
It,
it,
it,

542
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:25.550
it just destroys any of the progress you can make or at least makes it go so

543
00:33:25.551 --> 00:33:29.420
slow.
Um,
they,
I think they wound up shooting themselves in the foot,

544
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:34.190
<v 0>which is probably why they are arrived at this bottleneck that they need to get</v>

545
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.120
this madman with a jet powered Honda come in and see what he could do.

546
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.290
<v 1>I think that was an act of desperation.</v>

547
00:33:40.291 --> 00:33:42.840
I think they wanted someone that's thinks out of the box and let's,

548
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:45.720
let's just give this guy a try here because they weren't,

549
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.370
and they might've done this four more times since uh,
you know,

550
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.750
up to the point in time today,
assuming they're still working on this thing.
And

551
00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.050
<v 0>when you see this craft and you're inside,</v>

552
00:33:58.051 --> 00:34:03.051
was there any indication that there was an area that they would use to control

553
00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:07.060
it?
The pilot was there,
a pilot seat was theirs.

554
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.800
<v 1>There were three seats.
They sat around.
Uh,</v>

555
00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.610
the reactor was in the dead center of it and then equidistant around.

556
00:34:14.611 --> 00:34:19.080
There were three seats and that's all there.
There was a,

557
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.420
a large,
you would,
they're not consoles.

558
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:26.610
There are large rectangular objects also spaced equidistant around the center.

559
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.520
Um,
there's nothing on them.
There's no buttons,
there's no lights.
There's,

560
00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:33.450
and they look the same color,
the same,
everything is the same color,

561
00:34:33.451 --> 00:34:35.910
different shape,
right.
And,
um,

562
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:40.210
directly underneath them there's three levels in the craft.
Uh,

563
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.890
the main level is what we're talking about directly under that.

564
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.440
Those are the gravity amplifiers,

565
00:34:46.441 --> 00:34:50.700
the big rectangular objects underneath them are the gravity of mentors that look

566
00:34:50.701 --> 00:34:55.290
like,
for lack of a better word,
a trashcan hanging on a pipe,
three of those.

567
00:34:55.620 --> 00:35:00.120
And then the top layer,
I,
this is just my personal belief,

568
00:35:00.121 --> 00:35:02.670
I think that has to do with that,
uh,
uh,

569
00:35:02.671 --> 00:35:05.820
navigation or their version of a computer,
uh,

570
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:08.250
with some planar panels,

571
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.280
sensor panels around the craft that we would call port holes,

572
00:35:11.281 --> 00:35:13.710
but they're not portals,
they're just black areas.

573
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.360
And I think that just determines its position in space.

574
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:19.620
But I was,

575
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:24.830
I physically was in the center section and I stuck my torso in the bottom

576
00:35:25.171 --> 00:35:29.640
section and hung upside down so I could see how the gravity amplifiers were

577
00:35:29.641 --> 00:35:33.840
positioned.
What is the,
the roughly the size of this thing?
It's a,
I think it,

578
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.120
I don't remember from being there,
but,
um,
after all this stuff was over,

579
00:35:39.121 --> 00:35:43.860
I had a John Andrews,
a guy from the testers model corporation and you know,

580
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:47.880
we sat down and tried to figure out from what I saw,

581
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.580
um,
and known sizes of things and we came up with 52 feet in diameter.

582
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:59.550
And I think that's a small,
yeah.
So I think that's a fair reasonable guess.

583
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.460
<v 0>Now you said there's nine of them and you got a brief glimpse at the other ones</v>

584
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.080
were the,
how were they different?

585
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.620
<v 1>Oh,
they looked completely different.
One looked like a,</v>

586
00:36:08.621 --> 00:36:10.690
I called a Jello mold and it,

587
00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:14.470
it looked like a classic Jello mold with a rippled sides to it.

588
00:36:14.471 --> 00:36:19.270
One was a very flat disk.
Um,
you know,

589
00:36:19.271 --> 00:36:20.740
like,
uh,
oh,

590
00:36:20.741 --> 00:36:24.640
I don't like a straw hat or something like that that was sitting up on its edge.

591
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.680
And the thin part of it had,
it looked like a projectile had been fired through,

592
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.443
um,
the edge of it.

593
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:35.830
So I don't know if they were attempting to see if the metal could be penetrated

594
00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.810
or if something or if that's where the thing came from.
Maybe it was shot down.

595
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.410
Um,
but that was the only one where I saw there was,
you know,

596
00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.820
actual physical damage

597
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.460
<v 0>and that one was roughly the same size.
They're all,</v>

598
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.860
<v 1>yeah,
they were kind of too far away to,
to tell</v>

599
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:57.870
<v 0>and did.
There was several teams that we're working on the propulsion systems,</v>

600
00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.550
there's different teams that were work on these different aircraft.
I,

601
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.620
I don't don't know.

602
00:37:02.621 --> 00:37:07.621
I could only assume right now when you're sitting in this thing and you're

603
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.180
looking at this other worldly craft,
your,

604
00:37:13.181 --> 00:37:16.360
your goal is to try to figure out how this thing functions,

605
00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:20.140
your goals to try to figure out how this reactor it,
I mean,

606
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.770
it would imagine they would give you more time than just one day to check that

607
00:37:23.771 --> 00:37:24.190
out.

608
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:29.170
<v 1>Oh yeah.
It wasn't one day,
right?
Yeah.
I mean this is,
Barry was there,</v>

609
00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:32.470
I think Barry was sleeping there.
I'm sure they had.

610
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.630
Now that that isn't weird.

611
00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:37.600
I mean up at the tone of Pod test range where they work on stealth fighters,

612
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:38.261
you know,

613
00:37:38.261 --> 00:37:43.261
you go I think three weeks on one week off and you stay up there too.

614
00:37:43.271 --> 00:37:46.900
So it's not weird to stay up at the test site.
Right.
So,
um,
yeah,

615
00:37:46.901 --> 00:37:47.734
I think he pretty,
anyway,

616
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.730
that didn't mean he acted like he's been up there for a long time.
Um,

617
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:56.740
but I'm still there.
Yeah,
we knows you.
Do you do you have contact with this guy?

618
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.930
No.
Oh No.
I wish I did.

619
00:37:58.931 --> 00:38:03.931
I kind of thought he was gonna come out after I did and I think I took so much

620
00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:08.740
flak and it's so much shit for what went on.

621
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:10.090
I think I actually,

622
00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:15.091
I wound up helping security there and everybody became afraid of doing or saying

623
00:38:15.671 --> 00:38:16.570
anything after that.

624
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.880
<v 0>So what kind of reports did you have to give?
Like,</v>

625
00:38:20.881 --> 00:38:22.590
so you're not making much progress,
right?

626
00:38:22.591 --> 00:38:25.590
You're just trying to figure out what this thing is and it seems impossible.

627
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.510
<v 1>Well,
we didn't personally make them.
I mean we were always,</v>

628
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:34.280
there was never a lot of information that we gained.
Um,

629
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.480
the,
you would call them,
our supervisor was,

630
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:42.070
the name was Dennis Mariani and kind of a military looking guy.

631
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.990
And he would routinely pop in,
you know,

632
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.760
during the day and you know,
hey,
what's going on guys?

633
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.760
And he would essentially relay,
enter any information,

634
00:38:51.761 --> 00:38:53.620
anything new we came up with.
I mean,

635
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:57.490
he was our go between where we presented him the information.

636
00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.220
Then he took it to wherever they were,
you know,

637
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.630
assembling all the data from everybody.
No,
I assume you're working normal days,

638
00:39:04.631 --> 00:39:07.510
like you need an hour day.
No,
no,
no.

639
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:11.950
It was really weird that I would be only called in on certain times on certain

640
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:14.680
days and they would be weird hours too.

641
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:17.620
Most of the time was later in the evening.
I mean,

642
00:39:17.621 --> 00:39:20.830
I can get a call at 11 o'clock at night and they'll say,
you know,

643
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:23.050
it's now 11 o'clock,
um,

644
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.330
by 1145 you need to be at McCarran terminal.
And,
um,

645
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.800
you know,
we'll let you know and uh,
we have more information.

646
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.780
But what did you do while you were there?
If you're looking at this object,

647
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:39.460
this reactor,

648
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.300
and you can't figure out what it is or how it works other than the fact that

649
00:39:43.301 --> 00:39:46.450
works on this element that we don't even know about it.
Sure.
I mean,

650
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:49.570
the thing was to what you do and you know,

651
00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:54.760
with anything,
if you're trying to analyze it,
all you can do is perform a test.

652
00:39:55.510 --> 00:40:00.040
And all we did is try and come up with every kind of test we possibly could.

653
00:40:00.041 --> 00:40:01.720
I man,
we tested,
you know,

654
00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:07.750
it violated a lot of what we thought was impossible to violate.

655
00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.940
I mean,
one of the first laws of thermodynamics,
I mean essentially any machine,

656
00:40:12.941 --> 00:40:15.940
any device that operates always makes extra heat.

657
00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:20.890
Nothing works at a 100% efficient.
Even the headphones you're wearing,

658
00:40:20.891 --> 00:40:22.350
anything that takes power,

659
00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.440
some of that power is going to be con converted to heat and it's just wasted.

660
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:31.150
This didn't,
I mean we looked at,
back then we had infrared cameras.

661
00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.080
There are different today,

662
00:40:32.081 --> 00:40:36.700
but back then you had a poor liquid nitrogen into the camera to cool the sensor

663
00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:40.780
down and um,
and get these infrared images you've seen.

664
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.950
But it never got,
no matter what the load was on the reactor,

665
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:50.170
it never got above the ambient temperature,
which is impossible.
I mean,
you're,

666
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.243
you know,

667
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:56.170
pulling out huge amounts of power and nothing ever gets warm.

668
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.210
Um,
we tried measuring magnetic fields and there was,
was nothing there.

669
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:04.120
So we started playing around with the,
uh,

670
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.220
emission from the emitter is the gravity wave itself and saw what we could do

671
00:41:09.221 --> 00:41:11.170
with it and how it was focused.

672
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:16.171
So we really spent all our time just trying to see what the stuff can do and

673
00:41:18.041 --> 00:41:21.100
what we can control.
So you were seeing what it could do,

674
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:25.960
would you couldn't ever figure out how it was doing it?
No,
not really.
I mean,

675
00:41:25.961 --> 00:41:30.000
we really,
we really could only use,
uh,
uh,
come up with a best guests.

676
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:35.430
And now I can't say we high that I could absolutely state for certainly are

677
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.160
certainty how anything actually worked.

678
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.720
<v 0>Now,
how did you know at all how they were piloting it?</v>

679
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.800
Because some,

680
00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:52.100
they were doing some tests where they're having these things fly around in the

681
00:41:52.201 --> 00:41:56.670
sky and this is what gets us deeper into your story.

682
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.230
Right.
Um,

683
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:05.910
<v 1>I was out there for a one test.
Um,
right.</v>

684
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:10.840
In fact,
I was in with Barry in the lab and Dennis came in and said,

685
00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.610
uh,
we're about to run a test.
Why don't you guys come out?
Or He's,

686
00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.360
I think he said,
Barry,
why don't you come out here and bring Bob with you?
Uh,

687
00:42:19.361 --> 00:42:24.361
we went out there and the craft was already outside the hangar and was just

688
00:42:25.391 --> 00:42:26.680
preparing to lift off.

689
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.520
Now they were in communication with somebody in the craft.

690
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:35.020
So there's a person in the present.
Yeah,
there was certainly a person in there.

691
00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:38.530
Now it's not a comfortable place to be in cause it's small.

692
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.600
So the guy has to be sitting on the floor in the middle.
Uh,
my best guess,

693
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.930
and this is the same specific craft that you cause you were the,

694
00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.120
that was the only craft that you weren't the only one that I touched and worked

695
00:42:49.121 --> 00:42:53.710
on.
Um,
and it,
it quietly lifted off the ground,

696
00:42:53.711 --> 00:42:58.711
which was incredibly impressive to see a quietly or silently what's well quietly

697
00:43:00.821 --> 00:43:05.170
because it did it make sure it reduced.
Um,

698
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.790
a little corona discharge from the bottom at corona discharge is kind of a high

699
00:43:09.791 --> 00:43:14.080
voltage brush,
little bluish glow discharge.
As it was lifting off the ground.

700
00:43:14.081 --> 00:43:17.980
You can hear a slight his sound now as soon as it cleared the ground by about

701
00:43:17.981 --> 00:43:20.620
five or 10 feet,
maybe even less than that,

702
00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.500
the hissing stopped and the blue go disappeared.

703
00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.540
So it lifted off quietly and then it hovered silently if you want to be

704
00:43:28.541 --> 00:43:32.980
specific.
Wow.
So then what kind of maneuvers was doing?

705
00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.550
It took off for that particular time.
It took off,

706
00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:41.290
moved a little round around to the left and right and then sat back down.
The,
um,

707
00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.990
the craft itself.

708
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.193
<v 5>MMM.</v>

709
00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.760
<v 1>They communicated with it with a wreck because I saw the guy talking,</v>

710
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:56.640
uh,
and a regular VHF radio to the person in the craft,

711
00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.650
and I even saw the frequency that was on the,
the frequency counter or the,
uh,

712
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:04.860
communication,
the transceiver there.
Um,

713
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:10.320
but what's weird is he shouldn't be able to communicate with the craft,

714
00:44:10.321 --> 00:44:12.180
with a radio.
The radio,

715
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.790
the radio wave should bend around the craft.
I mean,
it,

716
00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:19.920
it shouldn't be possible at every single thing about these,

717
00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.630
the craft and the way they operated didn't make any sense to us.

718
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.780
I mean,
that's something we talked about for awhile after.

719
00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.840
Why should the frequency bend around the craft?
Well,

720
00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:35.640
you really have to look at the way the gravity wave comes out of the craft as a,

721
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.960
the reactors in the center and there's a wave guide that goes up to the top.

722
00:44:39.961 --> 00:44:43.500
There's actually a small appendage that sticks out at the top of the craft and

723
00:44:43.501 --> 00:44:47.100
it produces a heart shaped gravitational distortion around the craft.

724
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.430
Now if the craft is sitting in the air and you walk underneath it and look up,

725
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.750
you actually cannot see the craft,
the light bends around it.

726
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.880
You're bending,
gravity bends light,
it bends radio waves.
It's um,

727
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:04.020
it,

728
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.970
it shouldn't be possible to communicate with a craft that has an envelope around

729
00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:11.430
it that's distorting all forms of energy.

730
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.970
But they were apparently in contact with it

731
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:19.830
<v 0>somehow or another suit through some unexplained way that they bother explaining</v>

732
00:45:19.831 --> 00:45:22.200
to you.
[inaudible] so this thing gets up.

733
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:26.730
It just does some very simple maneuvers.
Left,
right,
left,
right,
goes down.
Um,

734
00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.510
and did they discuss this with you?
I mean,
they said they wanted you to see it.

735
00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.420
<v 1>No,
they do.
They just want it now.
They,
they,
they didn't discuss anything with me.</v>

736
00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:38.520
It set at,
sat down.
We looked around for a bit and Barry's said,
let's go back.

737
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.350
We went back in the lab.
All we got to do is see it.
Um,
you know,

738
00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.660
fast forward,
um,
to some months later,
uh,

739
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:50.620
I did have the test flight schedule of the craft.

740
00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:54.550
Now they had times they had designated high performance tests.

741
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:59.410
This obviously wasn't one that was a high performance tests.
The uh,

742
00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.670
high performance tests went,

743
00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.590
goes above the mountain range and they do much more radical moves with the
thing.

744
00:46:05.591 --> 00:46:05.771
Look,

745
00:46:05.771 --> 00:46:10.540
this is a prized item and they're not doing anything like taking it out of the

746
00:46:10.541 --> 00:46:13.730
atmosphere or flying around to other countries or anything like that.
This,

747
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.270
they just play with this thing right over the test site.
Um,

748
00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:19.480
but they were doing some radical moves with it.

749
00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.170
And since I had the test flight schedule,
statistically

750
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:30.210
the amount of traffic and the surrounding areas on the highway was lowest on

751
00:46:30.761 --> 00:46:34.300
Wednesdays.
And that's why Dennis Dennis told us that,
uh,

752
00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:39.340
all the test flights occurred only on Wednesdays because it'd be the least

753
00:46:39.341 --> 00:46:41.290
chance at anyone would see what's going on.

754
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:43.610
<v 0>And this was before the,</v>

755
00:46:43.611 --> 00:46:48.611
the government had expanded the forbidden territory around area 51 and papoose

756
00:46:49.631 --> 00:46:50.900
lake and all that stuff.
Right?

757
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.630
<v 1>Yeah.
I think that occurred after my story came out.</v>

758
00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.530
Then people started going up on the mountain tops and trying to look down into

759
00:46:59.531 --> 00:47:03.790
there and they kind of freaked out and then did the land grab and pushed

760
00:47:03.791 --> 00:47:07.720
everybody back.
But yeah,
that,
I think all of that occurred long after.

761
00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:11.380
I'm sorry that I came out.
So

762
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.540
<v 0>you were working there and while you're working there,</v>

763
00:47:14.541 --> 00:47:18.620
you're under this crazy schedule.
Forgive me for explaining your story,

764
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:23.690
but you,
uh,
would get these phone calls,
you would have to go to the,

765
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:29.290
to the airport at 11:00 PM and your wife started thinking you were having an

766
00:47:29.771 --> 00:47:30.604
affair.

767
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:36.430
<v 1>Yeah,
apparently.
So I'm now,
I did give my permission to have,</v>

768
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.470
you know,
as,
as part of the,
you know,
security clearance process.
Um,

769
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.610
I gave her a written permission to have the phones monitored and things of that

770
00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.750
sort.
So they weren't doing any covert stuff.
They,
um,
you know,

771
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:54.751
with any [inaudible] or which is civilian top secret clearance or military top

772
00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:59.830
secret clearance,
they go talk to friends and you know,
play places you've been,

773
00:47:59.831 --> 00:48:02.440
make sure you're not connected to foreign countries,
but you know,

774
00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.830
monitoring your phone is nothing unusual.
However,

775
00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.340
they insisted that,
you know,

776
00:48:09.341 --> 00:48:12.940
you don't even talk to your loved one,
to your partner,
to your wife,

777
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.800
whatever about what's going on.

778
00:48:14.801 --> 00:48:19.120
So she was essentially in the dark and didn't know the phone was being
monitored.

779
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:24.720
Well part of the security clearance is that not only do you not have any

780
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:28.390
connections to foreign countries in our,
in a maniac,

781
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.350
but you have to have a stable home life too.
Uh,

782
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.600
well she started having an affair with a flight instructor.

783
00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:39.010
Now they were monitoring this on the phone and they knew it and I didn't.

784
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.380
So they stopped me coming in and their attitude at the time was,

785
00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:49.600
um,
we need to see how this is going to play out and if Lazara is going to get a

786
00:48:49.601 --> 00:48:53.440
little weird or anything.
So let's just,
you know,

787
00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:58.000
hold them off from coming in and uh,
you know,
see what happens.

788
00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:02.110
And they explained this to you.
What was happening?
Well after the fact.
Yeah.

789
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:07.410
Cause time kind of went on and there were guys that were following me around and

790
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:10.000
I started getting a little concerned going,

791
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:15.001
well jet or they booted me out of the project and if so,

792
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:20.030
they're not just going to let me hang out at home and go get a new job knowing

793
00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.500
what I know.
So as time went on,

794
00:49:23.501 --> 00:49:28.260
I started getting a little concerned and I took my closest friends and just kind

795
00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.620
of got together and said,
hey,
remember that job I told you about?

796
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.070
This is what's going on.
And uh,

797
00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.880
like you don't need to take my word for it Wednesday night,

798
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.730
we need to all go out here.
I want to show you what's going on.

799
00:49:42.731 --> 00:49:46.480
So I took everybody and we went out to,
um,

800
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:51.390
members since I had the test flight schedule and went outside the base,
um,

801
00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.790
out into the desert.
And so everybody could see,
you know,

802
00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:57.880
one of the high performance tests and uh,
you know,

803
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.920
left quite imprint on everybody.

804
00:49:59.921 --> 00:50:04.090
So they knew I wasn't in this video is of these tests,
right?
Yeah.
But remember,

805
00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:04.924
this isn't the,

806
00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:09.070
it's in in the dark in the 80s or the big monster size cam quarter.

807
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:13.030
And you've got,
you know,
our bright light jumping around.
But uh,
yeah,

808
00:50:13.031 --> 00:50:17.050
I mean we did video of it [inaudible] by today's standards.
It's,

809
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:21.120
but it's your video specifically available,
the video that you took.
Yeah.

810
00:50:21.121 --> 00:50:25.810
Well George Knapp has it.
It's is it,
do you have no idea Jeremy?

811
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:28.070
I show clips of it in my film.
It's,
it's

812
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.440
<v 4>online and someone did a deep analysis of it.
It was interesting,
uh,
to,</v>

813
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.070
to take a look at how this microphone on to phrase this from your face.
Right.
Um,

814
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:41.480
you know,
to see how his video looks now.
But as far as video evidence,

815
00:50:41.481 --> 00:50:41.930
I mean we're,

816
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:45.260
we are talking eighties campers and the most important thing is the human story

817
00:50:45.261 --> 00:50:49.100
here.
Everybody that he took up there on three separate occasions,

818
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:53.540
they don't all like each other.
They don't all talk.
They all agree on one thing.

819
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.770
They saw something that night at the exact point in time and space that Bob was

820
00:50:57.771 --> 00:51:01.280
our said,
remember this is 1750 and 70 miles south of here.

821
00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:06.050
51 no one even knew really about area 51 we're talking papoose lake and they all

822
00:51:06.051 --> 00:51:09.800
agree they saw something that night they had never seen before and they've never

823
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:11.750
seen sense right when he said it.

824
00:51:11.751 --> 00:51:13.880
So that's one of like the six things where I'm like,

825
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:17.480
how did he know you can dismiss him?
I tried to dismiss it,

826
00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:21.290
but somethings we can't get around and end.
There's about five or six of them.

827
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:22.580
How did he know about it?

828
00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.130
<v 1>If Jamie wants to find that video right now,
what would he look under?</v>

829
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:32.350
<v 4>Bob Czar Ufo,
s s four area 51 just kind of like that.
Uh,</v>

830
00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.940
so it's like the sub s for Ufo video.
Bob was our it guy does an analysis,

831
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:41.640
but you're,
and that analyzing these eighties videos,
right?
He,

832
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.480
from the very beginning,
Bob never said,

833
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.390
I have proof of my story and I'm gonna tell the world.

834
00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:49.720
He said at the very beginning,
I cannot prove my story.

835
00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:51.610
That's not why I'm telling this.

836
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:56.140
George Knapp convinced him to tell people and he lived through it and I didn't

837
00:51:56.141 --> 00:51:58.660
believe it either until I talked with George.

838
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:02.300
<v 0>Okay.
So you,
you film these,</v>

839
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:05.840
this test flight one test fine and then you get caught.

840
00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:11.840
<v 1>Actually it was I think a third time because we went out there the first time</v>

841
00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:17.910
everybody saw it.
Everybody was amazed because it did some radical maneuvers.

842
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.160
And um,
you know,
everybody had a lot to say about it.
Maneuvers

843
00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.370
<v 0>seen,
I've seen the video.
It doesn't,</v>

844
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.790
I don't think there's something we have now that does that.
No.

845
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:30.060
In terms of like a human piloted craft.
I mean,

846
00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.470
I don't know obviously with [inaudible]

847
00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.540
<v 1>no,
it's,
it's impossible.
Nothing can move like that.</v>

848
00:52:34.541 --> 00:52:39.090
And remember we didn't start filming from the very beginning,
you know,
the core,

849
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:41.290
we were waiting for something,
you know,
to happen.

850
00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:45.160
The craft took off and I came flying at us,
stop,
you know,
turned it around,

851
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:48.120
triangle flew back and then you know,
after did some,
you know,

852
00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:52.780
amazing stuff to get the camera and the new we started filming so it doesn't

853
00:52:52.781 --> 00:52:55.740
have all of it on there.
Just has some,
the way I describe it

854
00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:57.730
<v 0>to my friends and they said,
what does look like?
I said,</v>

855
00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:01.600
take a laser pointer and then have a wall and then move it around the wall.

856
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.510
Like you know how it moves around the wall.

857
00:53:03.511 --> 00:53:07.300
It doesn't seem like it has anything to do with inertia or physics or it's not

858
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.760
impeded in any way by the atmosphere.

859
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:13.990
<v 1>Yeah,
that's what it looks like.
You're essentially separated from reality.</v>

860
00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:19.020
As crazy as that sounds with being an in case it's an on gravitational envelope,

861
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:24.460
inertia is not going to affect it.
And you know,
this is uh,

862
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.740
this is how some of those recent sightings of Commander David Fravor,

863
00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:31.140
I'm sure you've heard of the ticktack Ufo.

864
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:35.700
I mean he describes exactly that the thing operates exactly the way I was

865
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:40.110
describing.
That's why he was interested to talk to me.
Um,

866
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:45.090
but we saw this and you know,
on the way home it's like,

867
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.720
hey,
we got away with it.
We should try it again,
the next test flight date.

868
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.940
So this became a thing to do.
And I think it was on the,

869
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.190
the third time that we got caught.
I mean,

870
00:53:56.191 --> 00:54:00.630
we started becoming a little careless.
I think we took a motor home out there,

871
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:05.550
you know,
I mean it was like this stupidest thing you could possibly tailgating.

872
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.750
Yeah,
it was ridiculous.
And um,
again,
you're in your 20s.
Yeah.

873
00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.210
And you know what was funny was,
um,

874
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:18.230
we went out there and my friend Jean Huff and I were leaning on the front of the

875
00:54:18.331 --> 00:54:23.331
vehicle and just for some reason we just started talking shit like,

876
00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:28.350
uh,
well I hope they realize that,
uh,

877
00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:31.860
I don't remember what we're saying,
but you know,

878
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:36.510
that it's something about attacking the base or something along those lines and

879
00:54:36.511 --> 00:54:40.930
stealing the craft or something like that.
So I'm crazy.
And,
um,

880
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.290
then about 20 feet in front of us,

881
00:54:43.291 --> 00:54:47.610
we see a little green light fall on the ground and roll to us.

882
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.430
And unbeknownst to us now it's pitch black.

883
00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:51.990
You can't see your hand in front of your face.

884
00:54:51.991 --> 00:54:55.560
There were a bunch of guards standing right out there and they had a night

885
00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:59.220
vision scope where they were like from here to the wall looking at us,

886
00:54:59.221 --> 00:54:59.970
listening to us.

887
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:02.910
And the guy dropped it in the scope rolled over to us and you could see the

888
00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:07.530
green screen,
you know,
we turn the lights on and all these guys are there.

889
00:55:07.531 --> 00:55:10.530
So it was uh,
yeah.
Yeah.

890
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.650
So we did incredibly stupid stuff and got caught as we should have.

891
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.980
Cause so when they catch you and they bring you in,
then what happens?
Well,

892
00:55:16.981 --> 00:55:21.981
I went in for debriefing the following day I went to Indian springs air force

893
00:55:22.141 --> 00:55:22.561
base,

894
00:55:22.561 --> 00:55:27.561
which is kind of a defunct based that they used to use if the nuclear test site.

895
00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.980
And this is when they brought out,
um,

896
00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:37.230
the transcript of the phone call with my wife and,

897
00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.510
you know,
they sat me down and we said,
you know,

898
00:55:39.511 --> 00:55:43.860
when we meant to keep this secret,
we met,
you can't tell your friends.
Right.

899
00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.950
You know,
and it just being sarcastic and trying to,
um,

900
00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:52.890
and then they got real serious.
Uh,
but this is where they,
you know,

901
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:55.800
took the transcript out and were reading me what,
uh,

902
00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.610
my wife and you know,

903
00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:04.470
our friend we're talking about and uh,
I don't know.
It was a hard time.

904
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.880
So what happens from there?

905
00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:08.200
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

906
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.120
<v 1>What did they do with you?
Why don't they arrest you?
I don't think,</v>

907
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:16.000
I don't know why.
I'm not sure they exactly,
they knew what to do,

908
00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:20.050
but they did let me go that night and I went home.

909
00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:25.300
And this is kind of when the most part started because you're realizing that

910
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:29.380
you're being monitored.
Yeah.
Now,
yeah.
Now I know not only am I being monitored,

911
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:32.200
but now I know I'm in trouble.
And,
uh,

912
00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:35.890
it wasn't a short time after that that I contacted,
you know,

913
00:56:35.891 --> 00:56:40.510
at that time the only investigative reporter I had heard of in Las Vegas was

914
00:56:40.511 --> 00:56:43.060
George Knapp and,
um,
you know,

915
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:46.330
told him some of the story cause I had no idea what the hell was going to
happen.

916
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:47.203
<v 6>And at that point,</v>

917
00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:52.100
so George Knapp tries to dissect your story,

918
00:56:52.101 --> 00:56:54.740
tries to find holes in it,
tells it,

919
00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:57.080
puts it online and makes everybody aware of it.

920
00:56:57.081 --> 00:57:00.490
And that's how I found out about it.
Yeah.
To make a long story short hand,

921
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:05.210
w what happens yet to really make a long story short,
what happens from there on,

922
00:57:05.211 --> 00:57:07.670
I mean,
do they contact you and say,
hey Bob,

923
00:57:07.671 --> 00:57:09.230
it's probably a good idea if you shut up.

924
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.600
<v 5>How</v>

925
00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.900
<v 6>well they tried to label you as crazy was there.</v>

926
00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.020
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

927
00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:21.520
<v 1>there were a boy,
there were a lot of things that happened at,
you know,</v>

928
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:25.950
between that point.
Um,
I'm leaving out a lot of stuff,
uh,

929
00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:30.850
to fill in the story.
Uh,
we'd have to go back to Los Alamos and,

930
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:35.650
and
well,
I really don't want to talk about that.
The,
um,

931
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.240
<v 6>top secret weapons stuff that you were working on?</v>

932
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.060
<v 1>No,
I'm talking about the one 15.</v>

933
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:46.400
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

934
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.510
<v 1>Well,
I dunno.
I have to think about how I had,
what is the problem</v>

935
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.980
<v 6>with this?
I don't want to get myself in,</v>

936
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:58.130
<v 1>don't more trouble by admitting something.
So,
um,</v>

937
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:59.660
I just have to dance around a cup.

938
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.330
<v 6>Well,
just during the filming of the movie,</v>

939
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.180
people thought this movie's great by the way.
Thanks Joe.
And uh,

940
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.060
it's on Netflix right now for anyone who wants to check it out.

941
00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:11.630
And if you're one of those people like me who,
um,
you know,

942
00:58:11.631 --> 00:58:14.410
I've always loved the idea of Ufo shows.

943
00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:19.520
I became extremely weary talking to people who are Ufo believers and Ufo

944
00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:20.240
fanatics.

945
00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:23.210
Cause there's so many of them that are full of shit and not just full of shit.

946
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.390
They're,
they're childish lead delirious,

947
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:30.200
like the way they talk about things.
I mean,
there's so many people that are,

948
00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:32.150
that I'm in contact,

949
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.690
they reach me in the night and they explained to me what we're doing to the

950
00:58:35.691 --> 00:58:38.300
ocean is wrong.
And like,
you know,
like,
okay,

951
00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:41.150
this is one of the reasons I didn't want to do the show.
I'm sure

952
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:43.740
snow.

953
00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.350
<v 1>Yeah.
Well it's,
I mean,
it's no joke.</v>

954
00:58:46.351 --> 00:58:51.150
We've had people literally camp out on our front lawn and uh,
you know,

955
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:54.750
in some ways I can relate to some of these people.
You know,

956
00:58:54.751 --> 00:58:58.520
maybe some of them did really have some kind of experience or saw something and

957
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:00.600
all their friends think they're crazy.
But Hey,

958
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:05.780
now there's this guy I heard on the radio and a l e t knows I'm not full of

959
00:59:06.151 --> 00:59:07.710
Shit.
So I gotta talk to him.

960
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:12.570
And so most of the correspondents I get are people trying to get ahold of me

961
00:59:12.571 --> 00:59:16.380
going by bu you gotta listen to me,
I'm,
I'm coming to talk to you.
I'm,
you know,

962
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:20.160
I'm driving from Oklahoma or whatever and,
and,
and,

963
00:59:20.190 --> 00:59:22.010
but some of them are fucking

964
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.590
<v 4>batshit crazy on there.
They're frightening.</v>

965
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.820
There's a lot of schizophrenia that are involved in the conspiracy world.

966
00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.860
So there's a lot of people that have real issues.

967
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:34.850
It would be a disservice to your audience to not say that.

968
00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.450
We have to look at what's going on now and understand.

969
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:42.860
I've heard on your show a bunch of stuff about what's going on now and to not

970
00:59:42.861 --> 00:59:45.050
really understand what's going on now.

971
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:50.300
You can't see Bob's story in the correct light after 30 years and at some point

972
00:59:50.301 --> 00:59:53.470
we should just touch upon that.
Um,
the,

973
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:58.070
the biggest being that things like the ticktack Ufo case that came out,

974
00:59:58.071 --> 01:00:01.280
I've heard people even on the show say,
oh,
there's a glitch in the radar.

975
01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.400
That's a data port perspective.
You just don't know yet what's really going on.

976
01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:09.800
Commander Fravor I was able to get the interview with him to talk to him way

977
01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:12.950
before it became public.
I got that from him.

978
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:18.020
He sought other pilots sought,
this is a big thing that's going on right now.

979
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.790
They had more settings on the east coast recently.
Cubes with,

980
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:26.000
with spherical or is these are not aerodynamic and these are the people we trust

981
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:29.750
to defend us on nine 11 come out of favor protected Los Angeles on nine 11.

982
01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:34.040
So we trust them,
but they're not trained observers.
Radar.

983
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.740
Individuals see these things and the big,
the big one,

984
01:00:36.741 --> 01:00:39.320
just to throw it down so we can consider a story a little differently.

985
01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:40.430
There's more depth to it.

986
01:00:40.431 --> 01:00:44.690
The big one is the United States government has admitted that they had been

987
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:47.240
continuously studying the UFO phenomenon.

988
01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:51.680
That program was called a tip advanced Eris or sorry,
uh,

989
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.820
was called all SAP.
That that's the mother program.

990
01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.690
George Knapp got that out.
They,
they,

991
01:00:57.691 --> 01:01:01.370
they announced through the New York Times about a tip,
but all SAP,

992
01:01:01.371 --> 01:01:04.970
these acronyms,
all SAP advanced aerospace weapon systems,
applications program.

993
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:07.430
Who Cares?
That was the mother program,

994
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.300
so they've admitted we didn't stop sending your foes in 1969 with project blue

995
01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.890
book.
We don't think it's crazy.

996
01:01:12.891 --> 01:01:15.110
We're actually want to reverse engineer the technology.

997
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:18.080
That's why on your other show he said,
what's his AAV thing?

998
01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:20.570
It's like they're making up another Ufo name.
We'll hold on.

999
01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:23.300
There's a reason because in the documents,
the Dhi,

1000
01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.050
the dia documents that George Knapp released that everybody said was fake till

1001
01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:30.410
now they know is real.
They call them Aavs,

1002
01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.330
which is advanced aerospace vehicles.
People are getting the acronyms wrong.

1003
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:39.650
So the reason for the terminology change is so that we can mimic what we're

1004
01:01:39.651 --> 01:01:42.530
reading in the dia documents.
People can look for that now.

1005
01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:47.570
So they changed the names to get people away from Ufo or UAP even like Hillary

1006
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:51.310
Clinton said on air,
right.
So what are you talking about?
Hold guns.

1007
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.150
Hillary Clinton informed the public on Jimmy Kimmel.
Oh Jimmy,

1008
01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.040
we don't call them Ufo is anymore.

1009
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.390
We call them Uaa ps unidentified aerial phenomenon.
Right.

1010
01:02:02.391 --> 01:02:06.140
So she kind of was giving them,
the Clintons are very into the UFO topic.

1011
01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.640
Senator Reed,
you know,
he,
he's done a lot for the,
for the subject of study of it,

1012
01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:14.390
right?
So she informed the public so they could look for the right term.

1013
01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:18.530
So these terms are important because the dia in those documents,

1014
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:23.070
they had calling them a views for quite some time now and they changed the name

1015
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:26.770
to anomalous.
No,
that,
that's kind of a misnomer know.

1016
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.560
So they always mess around with things,
but it's actually advanced.

1017
01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.660
<v 0>Right.
But when they're describing it in the news,</v>

1018
01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:35.520
they were calling an anomalous totally for you.

1019
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.930
<v 4>Totally.
And that's cool.
They were also saying anomalous aerospace threats,</v>

1020
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:43.320
a t right,
cause they want the sense of a threat.
Right.
So,

1021
01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.940
so my point is all of the,

1022
01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:48.870
if people don't know this now and they think this stuff is,
is fantasy,
this,

1023
01:02:48.871 --> 01:02:51.510
this part of it that we're studying it,
that we take it seriously,

1024
01:02:51.511 --> 01:02:54.810
we're spending money on it and that we're getting great data from,

1025
01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:58.170
from visual pilots to radar.
That's why we know it's aerospace.

1026
01:02:58.171 --> 01:03:02.670
They dropped from 80,000 feet.
But guess what?
That's the top scope of the spy.

1027
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:06.510
One radar is 80,000 feet.
So the radar system they were using,

1028
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.570
it was coming from above that.
So my point is this,

1029
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.990
if you don't understand that this is happening,

1030
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:17.130
you're just behind the curve because you don't have the information because of

1031
01:03:17.131 --> 01:03:18.930
the stigma that you're talking about.

1032
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.600
I saw you get totally upset with the UFO topic.

1033
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:25.590
I met you first when you get totally upset with you off a topic.
It's the people.

1034
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.340
When,
when you,
when you're doing your whole this Mike,
I'm sorry man.
When you're,

1035
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.550
when you're doing your show,
you know,
the Joe Rogan questions,
everything.

1036
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:36.660
I could see how,
how frustrating is,
trust me,

1037
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:39.810
I had been frustrated to how luckily my mentors George Knapp,

1038
01:03:39.811 --> 01:03:42.810
and he's taught me the pitfalls,
pitfalls as I went through it.

1039
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:47.880
My whole point in this rant right here is just that we have to now look at Bob's

1040
01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:52.260
story.
But knowing the facts,
not someone saying it's a bird,

1041
01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:56.490
it's a plane.
It's a glitch there or not.
And so if you don't know that,

1042
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.250
you just don't have the information yet.
Not yet.

1043
01:03:58.510 --> 01:04:01.430
<v 0>Knowing the facts as we know them in 2019 not 19</v>

1044
01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.580
<v 4>absolutely.
And so what is,
he said that has come true.</v>

1045
01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:09.790
He's totally unimpressed with it,
right?
What does he said?
This come true.

1046
01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:14.410
So I was like,
Bob,
they've announced gravity as a wave.
You were right,
man,

1047
01:04:14.411 --> 01:04:17.740
you're vindicated.
And he looks at me and he's like,
well,
if you think about it,

1048
01:04:17.741 --> 01:04:22.390
Jeremy,
I had like a 50 50 chance.
He was not very impressed,
right?

1049
01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.940
But under they announced gravity is a wave.

1050
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.680
So they detected in a sense the attempted gravity waves.
Then who is they?

1051
01:04:30.550 --> 01:04:31.390
You might know more.

1052
01:04:31.391 --> 01:04:34.270
There's two black holes that were colliding and that's how they were able to

1053
01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:34.790
detect.

1054
01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:35.870
<v 1>Yeah,
somebody's bill.</v>

1055
01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:38.660
I don't know which group it was or what part of the government.

1056
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:43.130
That's what Google's for.
Yeah,
what did,
but they,
um,
you know,

1057
01:04:43.131 --> 01:04:47.960
built a gigantic gravity wave detector and pretty much detected

1058
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.450
<v 4>did there such things as great as</v>

1059
01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.290
<v 0>first observation of gravitational waves.</v>

1060
01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:56.920
It says it was in 2016.
Okay.

1061
01:04:56.921 --> 01:05:01.390
The first observation of gravitational waves was made on 14th of September,

1062
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:02.740
2015 as announced by

1063
01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:08.920
the Lig Leo and Virgo collaborators on the 11th of February,
2016.
Previously,

1064
01:05:08.921 --> 01:05:13.300
gravitational waves had only been inferred indirectly via their effect on the

1065
01:05:13.301 --> 01:05:17.350
timing of pulse.
Ours in binary star systems downtown.

1066
01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:18.790
Um,

1067
01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:23.790
<v 6>the way form connected by both Lig oh Ligo observatories mashed to predictions</v>

1068
01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:29.710
of general relativity for gravity,
for a gravitational wave

1069
01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:32.200
<v 3>feminine</v>

1070
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.540
<v 6>emanating from the inward space,</v>

1071
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.460
trying to get this from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes

1072
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:42.190
around 36 and 29 solar masses.

1073
01:05:42.191 --> 01:05:47.191
And the subsequent ring down of the single resulting black hole.

1074
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:51.120
<v 1>Whoa.
Well that,
I mean he,
yeah,
no,
he was out in the 80s.</v>

1075
01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:55.380
The predominant theory was gravity is produced by gravitons.
Okay.

1076
01:05:55.730 --> 01:06:00.000
Part of theoretic theoretical particles.
But um,
they're not,

1077
01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.590
<v 6>there are waves.
They're not particles.</v>

1078
01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:05.250
And so the thought is that the way we experienced gravity,

1079
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.580
it's based on mass,
which is why the moon,

1080
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:13.170
which is roughly one quarter of the size of the earth has won six of the earth's

1081
01:06:13.171 --> 01:06:16.440
gravity.
So there's some sort of a computation you can make based on mass.
Right?

1082
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.140
<v 1>And,</v>

1083
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:21.520
and remember we can observe the effects of gravity,

1084
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:24.550
but we have no idea what it is.

1085
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.160
All we can do is observe it and we can't make it.

1086
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.390
The only way you can make gravity is just put more mass together and it's just a

1087
01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:33.850
product of gravity.
But if you can make a,

1088
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:38.860
if you have a machine that makes gravity,
you can pretty much do anything.

1089
01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.950
You can affect time,
you can have force fields,

1090
01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:45.280
all that stuff that's in science fiction becomes reality.

1091
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.370
If you have a machine that can make gravity,

1092
01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.930
and what we worked on in the desert was a machine that makes gravity,

1093
01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:58.030
<v 6>I love your analogy of dropping off a small nuclear reactor to the Victorian</v>

1094
01:06:58.031 --> 01:07:00.310
era.
I love that,
that analogy,

1095
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:04.240
because back then that was impossible.
That was magic.

1096
01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:06.850
What you're talking about here,

1097
01:07:06.851 --> 01:07:10.570
the fact that they just discovered this four years ago,

1098
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:15.070
that this is a wave and we are,
as much as we know and as impressed as we are,

1099
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:19.900
as we should be with how much more technologically advanced we are than every

1100
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:21.070
other creature on this planet.

1101
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.960
We're still in many ways in the adolescence of technological and yeah,

1102
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:29.060
<v 1>absolutely.
Absolutely.
If even adolescence</v>

1103
01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:34.310
<v 6>and when you're talking about this binary star system and Zeta ridiculous lie</v>

1104
01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:38.730
and who knows how much longer were these things have been around than us,

1105
01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:43.650
who knows what their evolutionary cycles been?
Who knows what I mean?

1106
01:07:43.651 --> 01:07:46.230
We might be talking about something that's a million years more advanced than
us.

1107
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:51.520
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah.
It could easily be.
Now I'm not in,
believe it or not,</v>

1108
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:55.220
I'm not into Ufo hose.
I don't follow those stories or you know,

1109
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:59.620
even to your experiences.
No,
I'm fascinated with the technology and I,

1110
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:04.140
it really irks me.
Like every night I go to sleep that,
you know,
I don't,

1111
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.490
that it was my own doing essentially,

1112
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:13.550
that that prevented me from continuing on in the,
in the project.
I mean,
it's the,

1113
01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:19.030
that to be on that cutting edge of technology is so alluring to me.
Right.
But

1114
01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:20.580
<v 4>yeah,</v>

1115
01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:22.170
<v 1>you know,
by the same token,</v>

1116
01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:25.350
I don't really care that there's aliens are where they come from.

1117
01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:28.800
I mean the price is the technology and that's what I'm fascinated by.

1118
01:08:28.801 --> 01:08:32.820
But so I don't listen to Ufo stories and that sort of thing.
But George Knapp is,

1119
01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:33.750
um,

1120
01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:38.310
I mean he's the guy that as the context and tries to thread everything together.

1121
01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:42.900
And what he recently told me is he found,
I don't know,

1122
01:08:42.901 --> 01:08:46.080
it was either documentation or people that he spoke to.
It's at this,

1123
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:51.150
the existence of this project,
the project that I was on,
it's something that they

1124
01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.840
seem to take out every eight or 10 years.

1125
01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:58.090
<v 4>So that's a very specific memo.
And this is actually,</v>

1126
01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.850
this is the first time I'll be very clear with people about it.

1127
01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:04.810
It's a big topic of conversation right now.
It's called the Wilson memo.

1128
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.333
You can look it up.

1129
01:09:06.610 --> 01:09:11.380
Admiral Wilson met with a scientist who actually was featured in one of my
films.

1130
01:09:11.890 --> 01:09:15.130
Everybody has been debating whether or not this document,

1131
01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:18.010
I'll be conversation with a,

1132
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.400
with an sitting out role at the time is a real document.

1133
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:24.430
It's an actual conversation that happened in this document is where everybody

1134
01:09:24.431 --> 01:09:26.740
wants to know the world is going crazy right now on the UFO world.

1135
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.020
I'll tell you straight up right now,

1136
01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:34.530
I'm in the position to know and it is a real document that it is real.

1137
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.190
So the conversation you read in that,
that conversation was had,

1138
01:09:39.191 --> 01:09:43.270
I can't attest to everything.
You're not being very clear.
Sure,
please.
No problem.

1139
01:09:43.810 --> 01:09:47.740
So there was a document that is circulating right now that is really big.

1140
01:09:47.741 --> 01:09:50.560
It's going around everywhere.
People are asking,
what is this document?

1141
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:54.160
It's called the Wilson memo is what?
How you can find it online.

1142
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.530
There were the Wilson leak.
Third is Jimmy's.
Got It.

1143
01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:02.230
The Wilson memorandum use of human volunteers.
No,
that's not it.

1144
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.090
Yeah.
So,
uh,

1145
01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:08.830
Admiral Wilson meets with this scientist and they have this discussion,

1146
01:10:08.831 --> 01:10:12.040
oddly enough,
that special projects at Eg and g and I,

1147
01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.200
if I remembered the documents from 2001,

1148
01:10:14.201 --> 01:10:17.140
I'm telling everybody right now it's real and we'll see.

1149
01:10:17.141 --> 01:10:19.990
My history is pretty good with like say something's real or not right.

1150
01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:22.120
So here we go.
Document comes out,

1151
01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:27.150
they meet at Eg and g special projects in 1989 they stumble into a problem.

1152
01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:29.710
This happens,

1153
01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:34.450
they put the technology away and then they bring it back out and see if material

1154
01:10:34.451 --> 01:10:37.510
science has caught up and if they can make any progress.

1155
01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:40.150
So this document kind of talks about this process.

1156
01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:44.260
The big thing I get from it in a lot of it's vindicating to Bob and one of the

1157
01:10:44.261 --> 01:10:49.150
things that's vindicating besides the Eg and g thing is that private industry.

1158
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:53.620
So this guy's an admiral and he says,
I sh I found out about your SAP,

1159
01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:56.710
your special access program.
I need to know about it.

1160
01:10:56.890 --> 01:11:01.890
And he's going to a private part of industry and he has denied access and he

1161
01:11:03.161 --> 01:11:04.000
says,
you know,

1162
01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:08.620
I should be running this program and they were able to deny him access.

1163
01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:11.680
So I think the takeaway here is check it out.

1164
01:11:11.710 --> 01:11:15.120
I'm telling you that that is an actual correct.
That is a leak.

1165
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.580
Now everything's set in that document.
I don't know.

1166
01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.550
<v 0>What are you talking about?
What is that in that document?</v>

1167
01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.653
<v 4>It's,
it's a,</v>

1168
01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.740
between a scientist and an and admiral that are sitting and they're having a

1169
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:29.580
meeting and they're talking about,
um,
the,
the search for the UFO subject,

1170
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.830
the search to get special access program,

1171
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.750
access to all of these different things like reverse engineering programs.

1172
01:11:37.290 --> 01:11:40.400
So in this document they talk about it.
Uh,

1173
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.960
I believe that this document,
the,

1174
01:11:42.961 --> 01:11:45.570
the person that went was employed by Robert Bigelow.
You know,

1175
01:11:45.571 --> 01:11:48.150
one of the guys that has a couple of orbiting satellites and all that stuff.

1176
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:51.420
Who's going to guy own skin Walker ranch?
No,
he's not.

1177
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.230
He was the guy that owned skin walker.
Yeah,
he used to own it.

1178
01:11:55.231 --> 01:11:58.680
There's a new owner and I,
I interviewed him for my other film,

1179
01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:03.540
but there's a new owner and you'll be hearing a lot more about that soon.
But uh,

1180
01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.470
like it'll just,
there's,

1181
01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:07.260
there's stuff that you'll be hearing about skin walker ranch in cause there's a

1182
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:11.820
new owner.
Anyway,
the whole point of this,
you know,
insertion here is just that,

1183
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:16.610
that document kind of validates a lot of this idea.

1184
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:20.400
Bob Just said that they make a little progress then they can't go anywhere.

1185
01:12:20.401 --> 01:12:23.610
They tuck it away and then they bring it back out,
you know,

1186
01:12:23.611 --> 01:12:27.360
10 years later and start working on it.
What is the limiting factor?

1187
01:12:27.361 --> 01:12:30.630
I think Bob should speak on this,
but it's the material science.

1188
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.350
<v 1>Yeah.
That's really where physics is.
So I can,
I can see them doing that.
I mean,</v>

1189
01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:40.340
I didn't have any,
uh,
information on that,
but I think what,
you know,

1190
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:43.600
George uncovered is probably accurate that,
uh,
you know,

1191
01:12:43.601 --> 01:12:47.050
we try and do what we can and once we reach a roadblock on,

1192
01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:52.060
we really can't figure it out.
It's just frigging wait,
put the thing away,

1193
01:12:52.061 --> 01:12:55.510
wait for science to catch up.
And,
you know,
a decade later,

1194
01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.750
let's take the project out again and see,
all right,
now where can we go?

1195
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.640
<v 0>But there's gotta be someone who remains informed.
Right?
Oh yeah.</v>

1196
01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:06.590
You've got your scientists like you and bury you got your people that you

1197
01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:08.450
compartmentalize.
You got these people working on this.

1198
01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:11.450
There has to be some people that know everything.

1199
01:13:11.451 --> 01:13:15.890
You've got security and then someone's going to be in the outside saying,
hey,

1200
01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:19.070
we need people to guard this building.
Don't let anybody in for 10 years.

1201
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1202
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:23.270
I think a lot of that is private industry and I think that's how they keep it.

1203
01:13:23.271 --> 01:13:27.380
Yeah.
I think that's how they literally,
because the government is just so leaky.

1204
01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.970
I think that's kind of what that is.

1205
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:33.040
<v 4>That's what the document kind of proves you just articulated that,
that um,</v>

1206
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.530
it is in control of private industry.
What private industry,

1207
01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.370
<v 0>some aerospace company something.
I Dunno.</v>

1208
01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:39.250
<v 4>Yeah,
they wouldn't,
they wouldn't,</v>

1209
01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:42.240
the guy with the admiral wouldn't name it in the car.
Right.
In the conversation.

1210
01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.140
Yeah.

1211
01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:47.190
<v 0>So they still have these things supposedly,</v>

1212
01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:51.290
<v 1>I would guess,
I mean,
I don't have any information</v>

1213
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:57.260
<v 0>asked anyone that has any inkling of any idea of where they'd got them or how</v>

1214
01:13:59.071 --> 01:13:59.904
they got them

1215
01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:04.800
<v 1>now.
But um,
something must have been said to me,
um,</v>

1216
01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:09.450
from Barry and,
but I,
I,
it was just too long ago and I,

1217
01:14:09.451 --> 01:14:13.630
I can't quite remember what it said,
but it,
it just left a seed in my mind.

1218
01:14:13.631 --> 01:14:16.990
I think at least one of them was part of an archeological dig.

1219
01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:23.050
So it's old something that one,
at least one of them is old.

1220
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:24.460
I don't know if it was the one I worked on,

1221
01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:28.840
but I remember something to do with an archeological deg.
Whoa.

1222
01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:32.350
So that's a,
that means it's not just old.
It's ancient.

1223
01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:35.380
<v 4>That'd be a great Steven Spielberg movie.
Yeah.
All right.</v>

1224
01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.510
That's all of it would when he said that for the first time.

1225
01:14:41.170 --> 01:14:42.440
That's a freak out right there.

1226
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:45.970
And just a couple of dudes with some brushes looking for a tie,
ran a source,

1227
01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:48.730
rex bone and metal.
And when did they find it?

1228
01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.400
You know that they have nine of them.

1229
01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:53.440
<v 1>Well,
and how could we have not heard about that?</v>

1230
01:14:53.441 --> 01:14:57.550
What about the guys with the brushes?
How could you uncover something like that?

1231
01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.700
<v 4>Joe's newspaper at home does,
I mean they set it on that first day.
Oh,</v>

1232
01:15:01.701 --> 01:15:04.700
you mean the Roswell daily record when you told me,
yeah,
I have a cover.

1233
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:06.920
What does this here,
Jamie is the document,

1234
01:15:06.921 --> 01:15:11.000
but I had to do some digging to find it.
Yeah,
it's just kind of,
yeah,

1235
01:15:11.001 --> 01:15:14.090
so this is where they meet at Eg and g and this is Admiral Wilson and there's a

1236
01:15:14.091 --> 01:15:17.360
lot more coming out.
Now.
I want to be clear.
George didn't put this out,

1237
01:15:17.361 --> 01:15:21.900
he didn't leak this out to anybody.
This is,
I can tell you how I courted this,

1238
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:26.270
this conversation.
So this was an employee of at the time,
Robert Bigelow,

1239
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:27.980
and this is in 2002,
right?

1240
01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.570
Do you remember when he had that government contract called [inaudible]?

1241
01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.030
The world all knows about now.

1242
01:15:32.031 --> 01:15:34.820
And he had nits that studied the ranch that 22 million.

1243
01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:37.520
Everybody is saying it was for a tip.
Um,

1244
01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.770
advanced airspace threat identification program.

1245
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:45.640
The $22 million was for all SAP that was pushed through through Congress three

1246
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:47.750
congressmen,
right.
And astronaut.

1247
01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:52.130
It was pushed through and that's what that $22 million,
by the way,

1248
01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:55.070
they spend more money on Viagra every year.
Then they do study in Ufos.

1249
01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.020
If it was just this program,
which I think is funny,

1250
01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.780
it'll be probably in the middle of have more money.
They probably do that.

1251
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:05.030
You never know how it seeds into population.
But Anyway,
uh,
this program,
uh,

1252
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:07.480
this is what was the mother program.
So it,

1253
01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:12.140
it got the 22 million and really it was to study skin Walker ranch.
Oddly enough,

1254
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:15.440
that 22 lane all was inspired by the phenomenon.

1255
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.990
They were seeing it skin walker ranch because the scientists,

1256
01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:22.790
they're seeing vehicles come through like a space in the sky.

1257
01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:27.020
We went there,
I went through,
yeah,
you interviewed me.

1258
01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.500
A bunch of people that seem full of shit,
but a couple of them,
but this very,

1259
01:16:30.501 --> 01:16:33.440
very interesting.
Totally theirs.
But if you look,

1260
01:16:33.441 --> 01:16:36.080
I spent a lot of time in the area.
I'm not talking about those stories.

1261
01:16:36.081 --> 01:16:40.070
I'm saying there were scientists hired by the government right through big low

1262
01:16:40.071 --> 01:16:43.520
to study the ranch because they thought it was important and you know,
whatever,

1263
01:16:43.521 --> 01:16:46.820
whatever the point is that 22 million was to study that.

1264
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:50.810
Then we have a tip which is like an auxiliary kind of program of military

1265
01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:52.820
settings like commander flavors and that sort of thing.

1266
01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:58.210
This document is just one of those things that has now come forward that um,

1267
01:16:58.490 --> 01:16:59.660
through the big low studies,

1268
01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:03.230
it was government funded and then it was personally funded and then government

1269
01:17:03.231 --> 01:17:04.550
funded.
Um,

1270
01:17:04.551 --> 01:17:08.180
it's just one of those things that kind of shakes you because you've got this

1271
01:17:08.181 --> 01:17:10.010
military guy can't get

1272
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:15.070
<v 6>access because of the private industry that's holding these non-terrestrial</v>

1273
01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.550
materials.
They can't study it.
So that's the,
the claim right now.

1274
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:24.260
Give it some time.
Let people dig more into this.
It's fascinating man.

1275
01:17:24.710 --> 01:17:29.090
So you are essentially,

1276
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:33.950
you're,
you're,
you're kicked out,
right?
You're,
you're out of this program.

1277
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:36.530
You can't work with these crafts anymore.

1278
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:39.740
And do they give you any threats?

1279
01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:43.250
Do they tell you what you have to do from here on out?

1280
01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:47.810
<v 1>Yeah.
Well,
I mean the way it ended was,
um,</v>

1281
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:52.380
I told George Knapp all this stuff and um,
you know,
he said,
well,

1282
01:17:52.381 --> 01:17:54.780
let's just get it on tape.
Should something happen.

1283
01:17:54.781 --> 01:17:57.600
At least we have a record of it.
And um,

1284
01:17:58.530 --> 01:18:00.930
I don't remember what the impetus was,
but um,

1285
01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:05.280
at some point George wanted to air it and he said,
you know,

1286
01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:10.020
you make the call on it and look,
if at any point you change your mind,

1287
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:11.610
uh,
we won't air it.

1288
01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:15.750
And it came down to the day where George wants to put her on the five o'clock

1289
01:18:15.751 --> 01:18:18.660
news.
You said eight,
this is important stuff.
People have to know about it.

1290
01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.200
And I thought it was too,
either.
It's kind of a crime.

1291
01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.360
I know you've got to keep the technology secret,

1292
01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:29.310
but you can't not tell everybody that this stuff is going on,
that we have,

1293
01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:34.020
you know,
actual hardware from another civilization.
It's a big fucking deal.

1294
01:18:34.230 --> 01:18:37.890
You know,
probably the biggest one there ever was.
And,
um,

1295
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:43.140
George said,
you know,
today's the day we got her,
put her down the news,

1296
01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.550
there's something to that effect.

1297
01:18:44.551 --> 01:18:49.020
And when it came right down to the time to air it,
I changed my mind and I said,

1298
01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.120
we're not doing it.

1299
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:56.190
And that's what turned into the famous wrestling match between me and George

1300
01:18:56.191 --> 01:18:59.760
trying to get the tape.
But he won because it was a bigger guy.

1301
01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:03.390
So you actually physically wrestled?
Well,
I think it was more of a pulling match.

1302
01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.260
We were,
I don't think we ever hit the ground,
but uh,
he got the tape,

1303
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.950
you put it in the player and boom,
five o'clock news was on.
And then,
um,

1304
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:15.120
I got a call after that and then they said it was from Dennis.
He said,

1305
01:19:15.121 --> 01:19:18.870
do you have any idea what we're going to do to you now?
Any hung up the phone?

1306
01:19:18.871 --> 01:19:20.970
That was the last communication I had with them.

1307
01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.640
<v 6>And what has happened to you since then</v>

1308
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:26.770
<v 1>after that?
Um,</v>

1309
01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.470
a lot of people I have known,
um,

1310
01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.740
either were audited by the IRS.

1311
01:19:35.741 --> 01:19:40.600
People had anybody I know that had clearances that worked in secure programs,

1312
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.760
had the clearance as Paul's,
one of them,

1313
01:19:42.761 --> 01:19:47.761
a friend that one of mine that Jeremy knows he's on camera with me soon,

1314
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:51.370
he'll tell the story now that he's out of work up there.

1315
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:55.210
He was working up at the Tonopah tests range waiting for his clearance to come

1316
01:19:55.211 --> 01:19:59.020
through.
And you know,
they,
they pulled that it would,
it became,

1317
01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:01.870
it's like if they can get the person that's involved,

1318
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:05.890
they just create a problem for everybody that's around them.

1319
01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:11.020
And so mean the way it turns out,
it hurt a lot of people's lives that,
uh,

1320
01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.120
I was connected to.

1321
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.050
And that's an effective way of shutting someone up.

1322
01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:18.960
So I feel that by coming forward and going public,

1323
01:20:18.961 --> 01:20:22.320
they couldn't just snuff you out.
That was,
I mean,
that's what I was told.

1324
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.430
And George and everybody,
you know,
said that you can't,
oh,
it's an uncertainty.

1325
01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.800
It's public.
There's,
you know,
no one will touch you.
And I,
I,
you know,
I,

1326
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:33.510
I fell for it,
um,
and I,

1327
01:20:33.610 --> 01:20:37.060
I just wish you didn't.
Yeah.
Sometimes.
Sometimes when it's,

1328
01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.550
it's overstress and people were camping on your lawn.
Yeah,
but it's a,

1329
01:20:40.590 --> 01:20:43.700
this is gonna make things worse doing this.
No,

1330
01:20:43.701 --> 01:20:46.610
this is going to make things better.
Trying to tell him,

1331
01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.470
how is this gonna make things right?

1332
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:48.790
<v 0>Well,</v>

1333
01:20:48.790 --> 01:20:52.300
because you're getting a real chance to explain yourself in a way that's going

1334
01:20:52.301 --> 01:20:56.860
to make people who are not only work in the government,

1335
01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.920
people that are police officers and firefighters and first responders and

1336
01:21:02.141 --> 01:21:07.030
doctors and scientists,
they're going to emphasize,
emphasize,
empathize,

1337
01:21:07.031 --> 01:21:09.040
and n empathize with

1338
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:15.790
what it must be like to be a person like you in your 20s who gets thrust into

1339
01:21:16.041 --> 01:21:21.041
this world unknowingly and confronted with one of the most,

1340
01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:26.560
if not the most important discovery in the history of human beings.

1341
01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:31.010
The big question,
are we alone?
It's the number one question.

1342
01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:34.610
There's two questions,
right?
What happens when we die and are we alone?

1343
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.680
Those are the two big questions,
right?

1344
01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.750
And if we're not alone and someone knows we're not alone,

1345
01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:47.080
and these some people who know we're not alone or these bungling sort of,

1346
01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:52.740
<v 1>even if they weren't,
it's a crime that they're not telling the rest of us.</v>

1347
01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:55.940
<v 0>What do you mean?
I don't mean bundling in terms of they're incompetent.
I mean,</v>

1348
01:21:55.941 --> 01:21:59.270
they can't be competent.
It seems to me to what you're describing,

1349
01:21:59.271 --> 01:22:01.640
that no one can be competent with this technology,

1350
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:07.030
like the victory Victorian era scholars analyzing some sort of a nuclear

1351
01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.650
reactor.
There's,
there's no way.

1352
01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.090
<v 4>Why do you think the are,
why do you think they're not telling us?</v>

1353
01:22:12.091 --> 01:22:14.160
Let's just make an assumption that this is true right now.

1354
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:19.020
Why do you think that they're not telling us that our government doesn't tell us

1355
01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:19.790
what's your best?

1356
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:24.290
<v 0>Well,
let me put it into you.
What would you do if I'm the president,</v>

1357
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:28.010
okay.
And I get this information,
what do I do with this?
What do I do with this?

1358
01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:31.040
There's something that we don't know.
There's something we don't understand.

1359
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:33.200
There's some thing that came from another world we got,

1360
01:22:33.201 --> 01:22:36.590
it's tucked away in the mountains.
And,
uh,
I just want you guys to know about it.

1361
01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.050
Hey,
sleep tight.
Hey American Natto is on tonight.

1362
01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:40.070
Who Do you think's going to win?

1363
01:22:40.290 --> 01:22:42.090
<v 1>Yeah.
Who's going to win?
America's got talent.</v>

1364
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:43.663
<v 4>That data.</v>

1365
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.950
So one is uncertainty and the other one is what Bob and I've talked about a lot.

1366
01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:51.670
Absolutely not knowing what to tell people because you don't really understand

1367
01:22:51.671 --> 01:22:53.620
it yourself.
Even though you've got,
what do you say?

1368
01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.720
You as you want to run a government,
you want to get people to pay their tax,

1369
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:59.950
but there's something else.
Yeah.
When you say you have these objects,

1370
01:22:59.951 --> 01:23:03.400
fine with impunity,
right?
And yet,
but you have someone else.
Well not only that,

1371
01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.040
what can you say?
Like how do you really know?

1372
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:09.880
<v 1>I think it's mainly the technology.
They just want to keep the technology.</v>

1373
01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:13.470
So you have great,
because there's,
yeah,
whoever gets this,
there was this dude,

1374
01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:18.340
you,
you control the,
where you,
because you literally become invincible.

1375
01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:23.140
Once you master the technology,
you can't,
you cannot penetrate afield like that.

1376
01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:25.960
So I imagine that's,
I know it's all science fiction,

1377
01:23:25.961 --> 01:23:28.000
but science fiction turns into science fact.

1378
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:32.750
If you have real force fields around aircraft and battleships,

1379
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:37.390
you,
you win,
you win,
you can force your will upon anybody.

1380
01:23:37.690 --> 01:23:42.160
And uh,
like I said,
there's so much more to this story.
When I was first there,

1381
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.840
um,
there were Russian scientists at us for that was,

1382
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:48.400
this was early on in the project.

1383
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:51.610
So this was before operation paperclip became public as well.
Right.

1384
01:23:51.710 --> 01:23:54.630
I would imagine that was,
I don't know what the dates are.
When was,

1385
01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:58.300
when did that was [inaudible] 98 I think 98 yeah.
Yeah.

1386
01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:02.170
I don't know the dates on it be roughly 10 years later operation paperclip

1387
01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:05.650
becomes freedom of Information Act.
We said that Russia,
not Germany,

1388
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:09.040
he's never at Russian scientists.
Yeah.
But I mean Russian scientists,

1389
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.540
a lot of them came from Germany.

1390
01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:13.690
A lot of those littles rocket scientists that work with NASA,

1391
01:24:13.691 --> 01:24:17.950
they all came from Nazi scientists.
Got It.
So some Russians got some of them.

1392
01:24:17.951 --> 01:24:22.870
I just know then at some point there was intense cooperation with Russia even

1393
01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:26.060
exchanging some ideas on nuclear weapons and you know,

1394
01:24:26.190 --> 01:24:29.470
emp tests and like things we would never have discussed with them.

1395
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:32.260
But at the same time it was in the late eighties.

1396
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:37.770
They were involved in actually in the area at as far with us and got to

1397
01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:40.850
communicate with these guys.
Or you saw them?
No,
I knew they were there.

1398
01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:43.420
Barry Barry would talk about the comedies that were there,

1399
01:24:43.570 --> 01:24:47.830
the comedy and the counties.
And that was back when they were the commies.
Yeah,

1400
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:51.430
they were real economies.
Um,
and um,

1401
01:24:53.020 --> 01:24:54.880
at some point it wasn't our group,

1402
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:59.910
but at some point there was a big discovery made and this did not happen when I

1403
01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:04.660
was there.
It happened in between my trips to there.
And after that,

1404
01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:08.260
apparently they decided it was just too cool to share with anybody in.

1405
01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:11.230
The Russians were never allowed back on the base after that.

1406
01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:14.590
But you don't know what the discovery?
No,
no.
Like I said,
it wasn't my group.

1407
01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:19.300
So one of the other groups really found out something,
but the,

1408
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.960
you know,
in typical American fashion it was that.
All right,
this is ours.

1409
01:25:22.961 --> 01:25:24.190
You guys get the hell out of here.

1410
01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:29.020
Was there any inkling that any other government had something similar?

1411
01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:31.510
No,
not nothing that I had heard.

1412
01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:34.660
So that was the thing that always freaked me out was why if,

1413
01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:37.830
if something was so superior to human beings,

1414
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.410
almost like visiting an ant colony,
like why would you go to the Queen?

1415
01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.280
I don't give a fuck who the queen is.
I'm a human.
I'm so superior to ants.

1416
01:25:45.281 --> 01:25:48.130
I don't care who you have running your hive,
I'm just going to study it.

1417
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.090
I think it's who got it,
who got it.
Look at the,
you know,

1418
01:25:52.091 --> 01:25:56.380
rocket technology in Germany,
but they got nine of them.
Yeah,

1419
01:25:56.410 --> 01:25:58.390
that doesn't make sense to me either.

1420
01:25:58.450 --> 01:26:02.320
So they were either in the same area or you know,

1421
01:26:02.321 --> 01:26:06.170
one had clues to where others were.
I mean,
I don't know you,
you,

1422
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:09.160
you have to fill that in there,
but you're right.
I mean nine of them,
that's a,

1423
01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:13.690
it's a a big dig.
If it was archaeological.
Well,
one of the more,
more

1424
01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:16.120
<v 4>recent,
the recent sightings,</v>

1425
01:26:16.340 --> 01:26:20.890
these discussions that have been coming out recently from air force pilots and

1426
01:26:20.891 --> 01:26:21.670
Navy pilots,

1427
01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:24.870
they've been talking about things happening in the ocean and that that's

1428
01:26:24.871 --> 01:26:29.740
something go literally goes into the water or something may be below the surface

1429
01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.350
about 2004 tic TAC Nimitz case.

1430
01:26:32.440 --> 01:26:35.380
So that's when George Knapp and I broke on the radio twice before the New York

1431
01:26:35.381 --> 01:26:38.680
Times said no,
this one really well the commander favor those pilots.

1432
01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:44.040
There was a disturbance on the surface of the water come out of favor visually

1433
01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:48.940
saw what looked like similar to a cross some object.

1434
01:26:48.941 --> 01:26:51.880
So it's like as if you have some that coral under the water and you've got,

1435
01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:56.620
it's breaking over.
The tic tac is doing this crazy maneuver that defies,

1436
01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:00.430
it's a gravity propelled says they saw it in the sky before this on the water,

1437
01:27:00.431 --> 01:27:03.550
right?
Yeah.
So there was um,
there were radar that was picking this,

1438
01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:07.960
these things come down from 80,000 feet drop in 50 feet in less than a second.

1439
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:11.530
This is it,
Jamie.
What is it?
This is actually on the news today.
There is a brief.

1440
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:14.680
So a lot of people get this confused about this one that either,

1441
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.140
so that is called the gimbal.

1442
01:27:17.141 --> 01:27:21.490
So there's three videos released by the Pentagon that are all actual and keep

1443
01:27:21.491 --> 01:27:24.010
the volume off.
Okay.
I,
I would,

1444
01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.460
I would really just pay attention to the source video.
So you've got the tic TAC,

1445
01:27:27.461 --> 01:27:31.510
which is this object that commander Fravor saw another pilot filmed it with a

1446
01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.370
fleer pod and it goes to,
but this one you see is really important to Bob Story.

1447
01:27:36.730 --> 01:27:40.810
The gimbal craft.
It's been recently analyzed.
It's flir.

1448
01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:42.370
Not only does it,

1449
01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.680
it's definitive that it's not a conventional anything by the bites movements,

1450
01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:51.670
but there's a pocket of cold air around a propulsion source.

1451
01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:56.950
So this object,
by the way,
sat stationary,
um,
for days,
if not weeks,

1452
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:58.340
it sat stationary.
You'll,

1453
01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:02.770
they founded 11 hours later and they were saying there's no way this thing using

1454
01:28:02.771 --> 01:28:06.460
that kind of energy to go that fast could just hover over the amount of time.

1455
01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:10.030
And by the way,
you're seeing a very small part of what happened that day.

1456
01:28:10.210 --> 01:28:11.920
This object was not alone.

1457
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.240
And so hopefully that information comes out and we can,
I mean,

1458
01:28:16.241 --> 01:28:19.090
I wish we had video of it.
I'm sure we'd all want to see it,

1459
01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:22.990
but that's called the gimbal.
That was east coast,
right?

1460
01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:27.280
2015 west coast 2004 was the tic TAC.

1461
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:31.510
The disturbance on the water commander fravor believes there was something under

1462
01:28:31.511 --> 01:28:34.870
that water that was causing that disturbance when the tic tac was coming around

1463
01:28:34.871 --> 01:28:38.530
to doing it with inside the,
the people that are studying this,

1464
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:42.310
they're thinking maybe the tic TAC system was causing the disturbance,

1465
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:46.510
but the u s o and identified submerged object that,

1466
01:28:46.511 --> 01:28:48.010
that he visually saw.

1467
01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:53.050
The whole interesting thing about that is I want love Bob to describe it as why

1468
01:28:53.051 --> 01:28:58.030
it doesn't matter if these craft or in space air or water.

1469
01:28:58.031 --> 01:29:01.740
Why doesn't it matter?
I love when he talks about this shit.
Well,
first of all,

1470
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:02.190
commander

1471
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:07.110
<v 1>fravor was the f 18 pilot off the Nimitz that was sent out to find out what this</v>

1472
01:29:07.111 --> 01:29:08.280
stuff is.
But,
uh,

1473
01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:13.340
and it wasn't just I got a chance to talk to him recently and it wasn't just a

1474
01:29:13.741 --> 01:29:14.574
radar image.

1475
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:19.610
I mean commander fravor had eyes on it for over five minutes watching this thing

1476
01:29:20.130 --> 01:29:23.820
as for other pilots did.
So it wasn't a radar Blippar anything.

1477
01:29:23.821 --> 01:29:28.170
I mean these guys were watching this thing,
but um,
you know,

1478
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:30.450
one of the things I think in the gimbal video,

1479
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:36.950
the way the craft that we worked on flies is it doesn't fly like a conventional

1480
01:29:40.561 --> 01:29:45.510
aircraft does and it doesn't fly like a flying saucer winter in the 1950s movie.

1481
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:50.490
It flies belly first.
I mean it may set down conventionally,

1482
01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.790
but it always rotates.
It does a role maneuver,

1483
01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.480
puts its belly towards the target and then moves away at high speed

1484
01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:00.300
<v 0>car flying with the wheels forward.
Right,</v>

1485
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:03.740
<v 1>right.
I mean,
it may lift it land on the wheels,</v>

1486
01:30:03.741 --> 01:30:07.010
but at some point when it wants to leave slips up,
flips up,

1487
01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.250
points the wheels were at,
wants to go and takes off and the gimble video,

1488
01:30:10.251 --> 01:30:14.020
you can see the craft do the role maneuver and uh,

1489
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:18.160
it's really interesting.
It behaves exactly like the craft that I work

1490
01:30:18.410 --> 01:30:23.410
<v 0>don't so much like we have different shaped air crafts and fighter jets and</v>

1491
01:30:23.481 --> 01:30:24.111
cars.

1492
01:30:24.111 --> 01:30:29.111
They probably have different shapes of these objects that operate under similar

1493
01:30:29.601 --> 01:30:33.590
principles.
Right?
But they all have the same power source,

1494
01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:36.170
all the same power source.
And we're also dealing with,

1495
01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:41.650
if you think about the laws of technological progression,

1496
01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.980
you know,
you think of Moore's law and you think of how things accelerate.

1497
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:50.870
You've got to think that if this civilization is who knows how many years more

1498
01:30:50.871 --> 01:30:54.140
advanced than we are if not even years.
I mean,

1499
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:57.170
I mean we're thinking about in terms of conventional terms,
right?
The way,

1500
01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.570
the way we look at the world than me,
they meet.

1501
01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.500
They might be just superior in terms of their intellect.

1502
01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.230
They've got to be maybe,
maybe we don't know.

1503
01:31:06.410 --> 01:31:11.410
<v 1>Well the only reason I I say that is because look,</v>

1504
01:31:11.721 --> 01:31:16.250
everyone doesn't necessarily start at a steam engine and go to an internal

1505
01:31:16.251 --> 01:31:19.100
combustion engine and then,
you know,
electric power,

1506
01:31:19.101 --> 01:31:23.900
nuclear power and go up the ladder that we can lean on.
Um,
you know,
the binary,

1507
01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:27.740
if the stuff is true about the origin and the binary star system and they have

1508
01:31:27.741 --> 01:31:32.580
heavier elements that we don't have and this element stable element one 15 is a

1509
01:31:32.581 --> 01:31:34.100
naturally occurring material.

1510
01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.720
Maybe that's the first thing they started experimenting with and the version of

1511
01:31:38.721 --> 01:31:39.531
their steam engine,

1512
01:31:39.531 --> 01:31:44.420
their first product was something that operated like this and actually when they

1513
01:31:44.630 --> 01:31:47.300
came to earth to look around or you know,
whatever,

1514
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:50.870
they were amazed at the stuff we were doing.
These guys burned stuff and squirt,

1515
01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:54.130
squirted out the back to go forward.
So,
um,
right.

1516
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.170
You know who says they follow any kind of normal progression like that?

1517
01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.250
<v 0>My,
my thought was if you went back</v>

1518
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:04.180
<v 6>to the 14 hundreds and then you went from 1400 to 1500,</v>

1519
01:32:04.181 --> 01:32:06.720
you're not going to see that much of a difference technologically.
Right?

1520
01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:10.450
If you go from 2000 to 3000,

1521
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:14.320
I assume there's going to be a radical change,
right?
Well,
the,
yeah,
the Delta,

1522
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:16.390
their rate of change is,

1523
01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.260
is magnificently higher than it used to be.
Right?

1524
01:32:20.261 --> 01:32:25.261
So if you think about what they had in 1988 and you think about what they

1525
01:32:25.781 --> 01:32:30.781
probably have in 2019 just logically,

1526
01:32:31.190 --> 01:32:33.640
it seems like they would advance.
I would think so.

1527
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:38.140
The only question is like are they living,

1528
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:43.770
is that a living thing in terms of like a biological thing or are they some sort

1529
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:48.370
of an artificially created creation like we are working on right now?

1530
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.520
I mean we're in the middle of working on artificial reality,

1531
01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.820
artificial being sent the and beings artificial intelligence.

1532
01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:57.790
There's constant new silicon based life forms that they're essentially trying to

1533
01:32:57.791 --> 01:33:02.340
create Boston dinette or was it Boston Dynamics of the company?
[inaudible]

1534
01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.190
robots.
Yeah.

1535
01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:07.990
You can make machines out of flesh or cybernetic organism.
It's just that,

1536
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:11.050
you know,
that's what a lot of people think.
Those like gray things are.

1537
01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:12.580
You know that people called the grays?
Yeah.

1538
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:16.450
It's like they were like their machines rented from flash.

1539
01:33:16.451 --> 01:33:19.930
So what you're saying is like,
no,
no synthetic,

1540
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:23.290
they don't even need to be,
you know,
machines.

1541
01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.210
Well they seem to have no sex organs.

1542
01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:27.700
So whether described by people that have had interactions with them,

1543
01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:31.090
assuming these people aren't liars or crazy or whatever,
right?

1544
01:33:31.390 --> 01:33:36.390
They have no sex organs and that they don't seem to have any muscle that just

1545
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.380
almost like a frame and they have enormous heads.
I mean if you look at

1546
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.230
Australia pythagoreous or depictions of ancient hominids and then you go to

1547
01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:50.770
human beings,
one of the things you see is bigger heads and weaker bodies.

1548
01:33:51.010 --> 01:33:55.480
Well you see some clear progression of evolution to where or something like
that.

1549
01:33:55.570 --> 01:34:00.130
I would lean towards a synthetic organism because it looks like it was made for

1550
01:34:00.131 --> 01:34:02.940
a specific tasks.
There's no reproductive organs.

1551
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:06.400
So I mean that almost kind of leaves out any kind of,
you know,

1552
01:34:06.490 --> 01:34:09.790
physical evolution.
Right?
But that's also our bottleneck,
right?

1553
01:34:09.791 --> 01:34:12.220
Our bottleneck is our biological imperative.

1554
01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.450
The need to breed emotions,
fear,
anxiety,

1555
01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:21.451
all these different things that exist in order to force us into making sure we

1556
01:34:21.731 --> 01:34:23.980
reproduce.
I mean,
that's essentially what it is.

1557
01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:28.690
A human reward systems that aren't necessary once they can figure out a way to

1558
01:34:28.691 --> 01:34:31.390
make some sort of sentience,
artificial life.

1559
01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:35.290
So I'm sort of thing that doesn't have these biological limitations that we
have.

1560
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.820
By the way,
these craft,

1561
01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:39.070
all these different kinds of been reported because it was confusing.

1562
01:34:39.071 --> 01:34:40.140
I always thought of flying saucers.

1563
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:43.000
What I heard Bob was our talk about flying saucer.
Right?

1564
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:47.080
But if you look back in history,
people have always reported the weirdest shapes.

1565
01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:49.380
Like none of them are alike.
You know there,

1566
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:52.420
there are the saucers but you've got cigar shaped.
You got,
you know,

1567
01:34:52.421 --> 01:34:56.860
the top hat shaped you,
you have orbs.
Why?
Maybe they're serving different,

1568
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.160
they're doing different

1569
01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:01.280
<v 4>things.
Like we'd use different tools and I want to be clear,</v>

1570
01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:02.930
the reason I know that memo is,

1571
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:05.690
is real is because I spend a lot of time with doctor Edgar.

1572
01:35:05.691 --> 01:35:09.500
Mitchell is sixth man to walk on the Moon,
last guy to film him before he died.

1573
01:35:09.501 --> 01:35:11.270
Right?
That's how I know.

1574
01:35:11.271 --> 01:35:13.820
I don't want any journalists thinking I got it from anywhere else.

1575
01:35:13.821 --> 01:35:16.640
I know because of Dr. Mitchell and he said the same thing.

1576
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:21.050
Maybe these things are performing different tasks,
you know,

1577
01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.610
<v 6>seen.
If you,</v>

1578
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:27.610
if you think about what an alien is in terms of our are the sort of iconic image

1579
01:35:27.651 --> 01:35:31.190
of an alien,
like the Steven Spielberg close encounters of the third time,

1580
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:33.140
the third kind alien,

1581
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:38.710
they seem like what we'd assume a human being would eventually become.

1582
01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.390
Right?
And if these things are tiny,

1583
01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:43.280
human beings are smaller than they've ever been before,

1584
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:44.780
they're weaker than they've ever been before.

1585
01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:47.120
And there seems to be a trend in that direction.

1586
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.100
And this trend seems to be amplified by our technological progression.

1587
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:57.350
There are a lack of need for muscle strength and our lack of need for violence.

1588
01:35:57.351 --> 01:36:01.490
And we're moving in a society to try to get away from all the things that we

1589
01:36:01.491 --> 01:36:05.300
think are a bore and about human beings and the terrible behaviors that we have.

1590
01:36:05.630 --> 01:36:10.630
If we one day do give birth to some sort of an artificial being like Marshall

1591
01:36:12.651 --> 01:36:14.840
McLuhan's a quote,

1592
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:17.660
we are the sex organs of the machine world.

1593
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:20.990
You know that one day we buy this.
Yeah,

1594
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:24.830
McLuhan was brilliant and that that quote has always been one of my favorites

1595
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:29.060
because,
okay,
what are we doing when we're constantly technologically innovating?

1596
01:36:29.061 --> 01:36:33.770
We're constantly looking for faster cars,
better computers,
bigger screens,
faster,

1597
01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:38.240
more resolution,
more pixels,
more this,
more that,
higher bandwidth,
five g,
10 G,

1598
01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.090
right?
What are we doing?
We're moving into this in this.

1599
01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:44.120
If you just follow it objectively,
stay,
stand back,

1600
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:46.910
don't attach yourself or your civilization,
your culture to it,

1601
01:36:46.911 --> 01:36:47.810
and look at what it is.

1602
01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:53.000
We're moving it 100% towards technological innovation.

1603
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:56.630
If you looked at this species from afar,
and if you weren't a part of it,

1604
01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:59.450
you'd say,
well,
what does this species do?
Oh,
they make things.

1605
01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.670
They make things better.
Every year.
Beehives,

1606
01:37:01.671 --> 01:37:05.350
the same fucking thing that you see 10 years ago,
you'd go by cob high.

1607
01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.640
It's amazing,
it's cool,
but they're the same fucking thing.

1608
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:10.850
They figured out how to do it.
They make a beehive,
right?
We don't do that.

1609
01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:13.400
We make better things.
What would you constantly,

1610
01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:17.320
and at some point I think that technology is going to fuse with us.
Yes,

1611
01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.770
we're going to become,
it's already happening.

1612
01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:21.740
Eli Musk talked about it on my podcast that we are sideboards.

1613
01:37:21.741 --> 01:37:25.160
You just carry it in your pocket.
It's a phone.
It answers any question you want.

1614
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:28.850
You can talk to it.
It'll give you the answers,
the answers instantaneously.

1615
01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:32.840
It navigates you.
It has all your phone numbers in it.
It has all your contacts.

1616
01:37:32.841 --> 01:37:35.090
You can get ahold of people,
people listening to you through it.

1617
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:39.200
It's connecting us in ways,
even in voluntarily haptics,
that kind of,
yeah.

1618
01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.610
It's also getting on your wrist.

1619
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.000
How many people have iWatches a apple watches the rest.
Right,

1620
01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:46.310
and that's only because we can't integrate them yet.

1621
01:37:46.311 --> 01:37:50.240
But you didn't know that point is 100% yeah.
I didn't joke about it last night,

1622
01:37:50.241 --> 01:37:51.230
but I have a bit about it,

1623
01:37:51.231 --> 01:37:54.500
but I do about the integration between humans and technology.

1624
01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:57.780
That's what would you do if you are hyper intelligence,
right?

1625
01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:01.830
Would you do the work yourself or would you create some cool things called like

1626
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:03.390
humans to do it for you?

1627
01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.170
Would you create things that are cybernetic organisms to come in with machines

1628
01:38:07.171 --> 01:38:07.921
and do it for you?

1629
01:38:07.921 --> 01:38:11.610
If you a hyper intelligence that has kind of changed like you've described,

1630
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:14.040
you'd probably create workers,
right?
Well,

1631
01:38:14.230 --> 01:38:17.340
that's a vast conspiracy theory is that,
I'm not talking about conspiracy,

1632
01:38:17.341 --> 01:38:19.740
but it is a kind of a conspiracy of asking you.
Well,

1633
01:38:19.741 --> 01:38:23.880
I mean I don't think it's necessarily that,
I mean you could look at it that way,

1634
01:38:23.881 --> 01:38:26.280
but that is the way a conspiracy theorist would look at it.

1635
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:29.460
The way I would look at it as like,
there's obviously a progression going on,

1636
01:38:29.461 --> 01:38:33.420
a biological progression.
There's some sort of an integration with technology.

1637
01:38:33.660 --> 01:38:37.590
There's some sort of imperative this need for technological innovation.

1638
01:38:37.591 --> 01:38:38.550
It's in escapable.

1639
01:38:38.551 --> 01:38:42.060
Everyone has it and I think it's attached to materialism and some sort of a

1640
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:47.061
strange way because so many people work so hard to get new things and like God,

1641
01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:49.920
that seems so illogical and preposterous and it makes people unhappy and

1642
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:53.250
depressions on the rise,
but nobody seems to be able to stop it.
Like why is that?

1643
01:38:53.490 --> 01:38:53.671
Well,

1644
01:38:53.671 --> 01:38:58.671
maybe it's because we are the electronic caterpillars that give birth to the

1645
01:38:59.821 --> 01:39:01.710
butterfly.
Maybe that's what we're doing.

1646
01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:07.380
What our job is to do is to make some sort of a cocoon and we don't even know

1647
01:39:07.381 --> 01:39:10.580
we're doing it while we're doing it.
Do you think of Caterpillar as well?
Like,

1648
01:39:10.581 --> 01:39:14.340
Hey Caterpillar,
what are you doing man?
Just I'm doing my things,
my job.

1649
01:39:14.341 --> 01:39:16.950
I have to make it cool and then I'm going to come like a butterscotch natural

1650
01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:20.670
part of evolution.
It could be just supposed to do this.
Exactly.

1651
01:39:20.671 --> 01:39:24.690
Make the jump to some sort of mechanized,
right?
Yeah.

1652
01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:29.310
An orangutan that is a fishing with a spear.

1653
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:34.350
Now they've figured out how to fish with spears.
There's uh,

1654
01:39:34.650 --> 01:39:39.510
there's um,
primatologists without somebody showing them how to fish.

1655
01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:43.020
No.
They've imitated human beings doing it and now they do it.

1656
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:47.340
But they do it independently.
They're not trained orangutans.
They're wild rang.

1657
01:39:47.370 --> 01:39:52.050
Look at that
as a wild ride.
That's impressive.
Very impressive.

1658
01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:56.090
Well,
there's these primatologists I guess you would call them primatologist.

1659
01:39:56.091 --> 01:39:57.990
That's a term that's a great biologists,

1660
01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:01.980
biologists that believe that monkeys and chimps.

1661
01:40:02.340 --> 01:40:06.690
And some of the great apes are moving into the stone age that they've currently

1662
01:40:06.691 --> 01:40:07.770
entered the stone age.

1663
01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:12.980
Like they're not staying what they were a hundred thousand years ago or 500,000

1664
01:40:13.201 --> 01:40:13.740
years ago.

1665
01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:17.310
But they're actively using tools and they're experimenting with different,

1666
01:40:17.400 --> 01:40:21.420
different ways to use those tools.
And then they're making tools out of stone.

1667
01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:24.990
They're making tools out of sticks and they're,
they're using them.
Well,

1668
01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:29.610
this might just be what happens.
This might just be what happens.

1669
01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:34.710
I mean,
why,
why,
why,
why the fuck are we work so hard?
I mean,
I,
I was,

1670
01:40:34.711 --> 01:40:37.800
I was driving to La this morning.
I had a doctor's appointment,

1671
01:40:37.801 --> 01:40:41.490
so I was on the four oh five at eight in the morning.
Jesus Christ.

1672
01:40:41.491 --> 01:40:44.250
Like this is so crazy when you're in the four or five in La,

1673
01:40:44.251 --> 01:40:46.890
at eight o'clock in the morning,
you see literally a million cars.

1674
01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.540
And it's just everywhere you go,
it's people.
But,
and also I'm in a Tesla,

1675
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:55.480
so I have it on autopilot.
So I'm there sitting,
I'm listening to a podcast.

1676
01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:58.240
I barely have my hand on the wheel.
I'm not touching shit.

1677
01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.260
This car's driving me along.
I'm not even doing anything.
I'm just,

1678
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:05.800
I'm just hanging out.
It's so much less stressful by the way,
to do that that way.

1679
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:10.330
So it encourages you to to innovate and encourages you to embrace this new

1680
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:12.550
technology.
I got this giant screen.

1681
01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.120
It's showing me the navigation in front of me.
Oh,
be there five minutes early.

1682
01:41:16.150 --> 01:41:19.720
Excellent.
And I'm listening to a podcast wirelessly.

1683
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:23.530
It's Bluetooth screen streaming from my phone and I pulled that podcast,

1684
01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:27.700
which came out today out of the fucking sky and I'm listening to it and I'm mall

1685
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:31.360
comfortable and my nice little car just driving on my way to the doctor's
office.

1686
01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:35.450
This is irresistible stuff.
Different than your Walkman.
Yeah.

1687
01:41:35.670 --> 01:41:40.480
Irresistible scissor resistance.
Frighteningly irresistible.
It isn't frightening.

1688
01:41:40.481 --> 01:41:42.370
I mean,
if you were a monkey,
right?
If you were,

1689
01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:45.100
I'm an Australia [inaudible] would you go,
man,

1690
01:41:45.101 --> 01:41:48.280
I don't want to fucking be a person.
I live in a house.
That's bullshit.

1691
01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:52.150
I like just swinging around on trees.
I like running from Jaguars.

1692
01:41:52.151 --> 01:41:55.240
This is life guys.
Life is running from crocodiles.

1693
01:41:55.241 --> 01:41:56.910
It's not living in the fucking suburban committed.

1694
01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:00.850
Probably some that are like that.
Yeah,
I don't think so.
I think,
I think what,

1695
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.150
when it comes,
we're going to embrace it.
We're going to embrace it the same way.

1696
01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:06.970
Embrace cell phones the same way.
Embrace television.

1697
01:42:07.090 --> 01:42:09.730
There's going to be a few holdouts.
I don't even know if an email Drew's man,

1698
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:11.950
those,
those,
there's a few and far between.

1699
01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:14.050
The good luck with that fuck face school moved to the woods.

1700
01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.640
Ted Kaczynski go live in a casket.
Ted Kaczynski was right.

1701
01:42:18.670 --> 01:42:23.110
This is something that I think about sometimes when I get really high that Ted

1702
01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:25.690
Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD studies.

1703
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:27.550
This has been proven Ted Kaczynski,

1704
01:42:27.551 --> 01:42:30.310
they cooked his fucking brain when he was at Harvard.

1705
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:32.590
And then when he went over to Berkeley and became a professor,

1706
01:42:32.591 --> 01:42:36.880
his goal was to make enough money so that he could implement this program and

1707
01:42:36.881 --> 01:42:40.540
live in the woods and then write his manifesto and start killing people that

1708
01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:45.220
were involved in propagating technology.
He was expunged from the Harvard,

1709
01:42:45.710 --> 01:42:48.640
uh,
logs.
By the way,
this is something my friend just called me about.

1710
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.530
So there's like this a private library and they used to print people's names

1711
01:42:53.531 --> 01:42:56.860
whenever they were part of a university and he was one of the handful of people

1712
01:42:56.861 --> 01:43:00.700
that were expunged from it.
I want to jump back to the one thing,
Joe,

1713
01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:05.260
I want to be really careful with that word conspiracy theorist.
What I was,

1714
01:43:05.261 --> 01:43:09.720
what I was saying to you is we terraform our earth,
right?
We tear from,

1715
01:43:09.730 --> 01:43:12.100
we change the environment,
we do all this innovation.

1716
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:16.780
What is stopping us from thinking that that's not being done?
I'm not saying is,

1717
01:43:16.781 --> 01:43:20.500
I'm saying what's stopping us from thinking that that's being done on a much

1718
01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:22.510
bigger level.
On a cosmic level.

1719
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:24.970
You mean like aliens coming down doing that to humans?

1720
01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:28.300
So I'm telling you that there is something here that there's a fact.

1721
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:31.780
You know there's something,
there are craft.
They're here,
they're not ours,

1722
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:35.380
they're here.
So the question is what is that about?

1723
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:38.710
And I'm just looking at what we do with what you're describing with technology.

1724
01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.900
I think it's much more likely that the same way we observe chimps and we

1725
01:43:43.901 --> 01:43:46.150
observed that they are now in the stone age,

1726
01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:49.630
that they're observing us and that they're recognizing that there is a pattern,

1727
01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:52.130
that there is a,
there's a steps that happen.

1728
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:56.240
I mean Carl Sagan talked about the different levels of civilization and then you

1729
01:43:56.241 --> 01:44:00.290
know that if we don't get past certain levels,
we're never going to reach this.

1730
01:44:00.291 --> 01:44:04.520
I mean,
we're in,
we're going to stay a type zero while we're in this warring,

1731
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:09.570
polluting,
pillaging were awesome civilization.
It's like,

1732
01:44:09.650 --> 01:44:13.300
well,
me and we're awesome and a lot of ways,
you know,
in that way we're not.
Yeah,

1733
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:16.820
we're,
we're,
we're children that have immense power that we didn't really,

1734
01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.440
the other thing is you're using the immense power that other people have
created,

1735
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:24.410
right?
I mean even when you're driving a car,
you're stomping on the gas.
Like,

1736
01:44:24.890 --> 01:44:28.220
Whoa,
you didn't invent the fucking engine.
You didn't invent tires.

1737
01:44:28.370 --> 01:44:32.090
There's all these things that were in involved in the creation of this thing

1738
01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:37.091
that is really outside of your grasp of understanding,

1739
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.280
but yet you have the ability to use it like a person with a gun.

1740
01:44:40.670 --> 01:44:43.820
I'm just going to bang,
Bang,
Bang people.
You don't,
you didn't invent a gun.

1741
01:44:43.821 --> 01:44:44.540
So like you've,

1742
01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:49.290
you've without the intellect to craft and engineer and,
and,

1743
01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:51.860
and,
and manifest these creations.

1744
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:55.060
You just have access to them because you have paper or you have bitcoin or

1745
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:57.410
whatever the fuck you're using using a credit card.

1746
01:44:57.710 --> 01:45:01.070
Now you have almost no responsibility.
You just,

1747
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:06.050
you could just flippantly use these things,
which is why we,
you know,

1748
01:45:06.051 --> 01:45:10.640
we were very childlike in our actions because we haven't had to earn the

1749
01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:15.140
responsibility.
We haven't had to earn these things that we've been able to have.

1750
01:45:15.141 --> 01:45:19.070
And you've only been able to have them because other people have innovated in,

1751
01:45:19.071 --> 01:45:23.900
spent ungodly amounts of time and effort and focus in the lab to create these

1752
01:45:23.901 --> 01:45:27.290
things.
And then they've all put them together.
And then what is the,

1753
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:30.430
what's the reason to put them together to profit?
Well,
what's the reason of prop?

1754
01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:33.680
Well,
why are you doing this so you can buy more things?
Well,
what are we doing?

1755
01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:36.920
What are we doing?
We're making better things.
That's what we do.

1756
01:45:36.921 --> 01:45:40.640
That's all we do is make better thing.
Why the fuck do we need oil?

1757
01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:43.520
Why do we need oil?
Why can't we just burn wood and stay home?

1758
01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:47.510
Why can't we grow chickens and food in the backyard?
Why can't we do well,

1759
01:45:47.511 --> 01:45:50.180
we fucking can.
We certainly can.
People do do it,

1760
01:45:50.300 --> 01:45:54.290
but we decided to make that almost impossible.
Our preferred way of living,

1761
01:45:54.450 --> 01:45:55.041
it's this stuff.

1762
01:45:55.041 --> 01:45:58.580
Everyone into a very small area where no one grows anything other than weed.

1763
01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.320
This is what La is.

1764
01:46:00.590 --> 01:46:05.590
La is 20 million people with hard surfaces is as many hard surfaces you can boil

1765
01:46:06.090 --> 01:46:09.380
.
If you've got an acre backyard in La,
Holy Shit,
look at all that grain.

1766
01:46:09.530 --> 01:46:10.730
This is amazing.
Well,
no,

1767
01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:15.731
that's the fucking earth coming through this weird sort of creation that we've

1768
01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:16.970
put on top of the earth,

1769
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.600
but the goal is to like New York City that there's none of it,
right?

1770
01:46:20.601 --> 01:46:23.690
You just got,
you've got central park and they just got human shit,

1771
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:27.860
human stacked up,
no one's growing anything.
And then constant work,

1772
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:32.300
everyone's up early,
go,
go,
go,
innovate progress,

1773
01:46:32.301 --> 01:46:36.470
make that money so you can buy more things and every year,
hey apple,

1774
01:46:36.500 --> 01:46:37.820
where's this fucking new phone?

1775
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:42.970
As if your phone isn't good around phones taking pictures and videos and people

1776
01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:46.910
are calling you when you've got applications and tell you which way the wind's

1777
01:46:46.911 --> 01:46:50.010
blowing.
And it's not good enough.
A blink of an eye blink of an eye.

1778
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:51.390
<v 4>It's all gone though that,
you know,</v>

1779
01:46:51.391 --> 01:46:55.140
like 10,000 years and the Hoover Dam goes or whatever,
you know,
Mt.

1780
01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:55.973
Rushmore disintegrate.

1781
01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:59.640
So it's amazing because we have created that and everything's trying to spring

1782
01:46:59.641 --> 01:47:03.240
up through that.
We keep it in maintenance down,
but we're,
we're a blink man.

1783
01:47:03.241 --> 01:47:04.074
Something hits.

1784
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:07.670
<v 6>But we don't think that way.
Well,
you know,
you think in terms of your own life,</v>

1785
01:47:07.730 --> 01:47:11.750
right?
You think in terms of what you want and what you need right now.
You know,

1786
01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:12.590
it's,

1787
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:17.590
we are in many ways this combination of this weird primitive ape like thing with

1788
01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:24.590
the ability to calculate and manipulate our world and our environment that makes

1789
01:47:24.591 --> 01:47:28.850
us wholly unique on top of that with existential angst and fear.

1790
01:47:28.851 --> 01:47:32.060
So what do you do with that with fucking Watertown,
with to antidepressants.

1791
01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:34.400
Give these fucking people some shit that keeps them moving,

1792
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:37.520
whether worried about the future,
the trying to figure out what reality is.

1793
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:41.630
If you're on a Goddamn convertible spaceships spinning a thousand miles an hour

1794
01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:45.950
hurling through infinity,
there's no meaning to this thing.
Just keep making shit,

1795
01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:50.510
keep making stuff and then one day they're going to be able to hit that switch

1796
01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:55.660
and this life will be born out of innovation and thinking and progress and

1797
01:47:56.301 --> 01:47:58.940
technology and more than likely,

1798
01:47:59.150 --> 01:48:02.720
it's probably going to be what we're seeing that these things are that you're,

1799
01:48:02.990 --> 01:48:03.080
you're,

1800
01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.630
<v 4>you're observing.
I'm not observing them,
but yeah,
someone's,</v>

1801
01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:08.720
are you implying that they're us?

1802
01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:11.730
<v 6>I don't think they are us,
but I think they are.</v>

1803
01:48:11.731 --> 01:48:15.780
What happens when things keep going?
[inaudible] that's not us.

1804
01:48:15.781 --> 01:48:19.920
Just like we're not monkeys,
right?
I'm not a chimp.
Oh,
that'd be cool.

1805
01:48:19.921 --> 01:48:23.530
Like they're from here is your idea.
No,
no,
no.
That,

1806
01:48:23.531 --> 01:48:26.640
this is what happens all over the universe,
right?
Yeah,
totally.

1807
01:48:26.641 --> 01:48:28.710
This is what happened.
Look,
here's the thing,
you know,

1808
01:48:28.711 --> 01:48:30.840
I went to see Brian Cox is um,

1809
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:35.940
he has this amazing live show with Robin ins where they,
they,

1810
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:38.520
they have these led screens,

1811
01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:42.960
he's huge screens with this high resolution depictions of the cosmos.

1812
01:48:42.961 --> 01:48:47.961
And one of the most mind blowing things was he has this large scale image of the

1813
01:48:48.781 --> 01:48:52.650
universe and it shows all the individual galaxies,
the universe,

1814
01:48:52.651 --> 01:48:56.880
and it just keeps moving through all these galaxies in three dimensions and it's

1815
01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:01.560
fucking incredible.
But what's stunning is the relative uniformity of it.

1816
01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.360
Even at,
you know,
I mean,

1817
01:49:03.361 --> 01:49:08.361
you're obviously looking at an incredibly small depiction of something that's

1818
01:49:08.581 --> 01:49:11.760
immensely large,
like a galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars.

1819
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:13.440
You're seeing it as this little dot.

1820
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:18.480
But this little dots that's flying through space surrounded by other little

1821
01:49:18.481 --> 01:49:23.481
darts with very similarly spaced distances between both through.

1822
01:49:23.521 --> 01:49:24.210
Yeah.
So Mike,

1823
01:49:24.210 --> 01:49:29.210
if we see uniformity in that form in terms of like the distance between galaxies

1824
01:49:29.210 --> 01:49:31.680
,
like so many galaxies is so it's so similar.

1825
01:49:31.681 --> 01:49:34.860
They might vary slightly and that slightly might be hundreds of millions of

1826
01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:38.310
light years.
Right?
But,
but,
but there's so much uniformity.

1827
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:42.960
Why would we not assume that that uniformity exists pretty much everywhere and

1828
01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:45.420
that all these things that you're seeing that are so similar,

1829
01:49:45.421 --> 01:49:49.750
you do see binary star systems.
You do see single star systems like,
sorry,

1830
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.360
but there's also some,
some speculation that earth and the,

1831
01:49:52.361 --> 01:49:55.750
that our solar system was one time was a binary star system,
right?

1832
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:57.970
I mean that's one of the speculations about that,

1833
01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.820
that object that they find outside the Kuyper belt,

1834
01:50:00.821 --> 01:50:02.500
that the thing is 10 times larger than earth.

1835
01:50:02.501 --> 01:50:05.770
They think it might've been at one point in Thomas Star,
but this,

1836
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:07.810
this uniformity that you see,

1837
01:50:07.811 --> 01:50:12.811
why wouldn't we think that that that has its same implications biologically,

1838
01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.350
that there's some sort of a biological uniformity and that this happens given

1839
01:50:17.351 --> 01:50:19.360
the right sets of circumstances.
You should be,

1840
01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:22.990
you should tell him to some of the stuff that you've read that you don't know is

1841
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:27.970
true.
I mean,
if the stuff was true about the propulsion staff,
I mean anyway,

1842
01:50:28.100 --> 01:50:30.780
he,
well,
what have you read?
What did,
what did what you saw too,

1843
01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:34.970
<v 1>you know,
what are you talking about?
Spill the beans.
Bob.</v>

1844
01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.790
I got to poke the bear here.
That it get some more liquor in you.
The um,

1845
01:50:42.230 --> 01:50:44.570
well I mean the,
again,

1846
01:50:44.690 --> 01:50:49.040
the only thing I could verify was what I had my hands on.

1847
01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:51.440
Um,
they were,
you know,

1848
01:50:51.441 --> 01:50:55.100
there was talk of weapons systems that there were different projects,

1849
01:50:55.590 --> 01:50:59.300
projects like Galileo project sidekick was supposed to be weapon applications of

1850
01:50:59.301 --> 01:51:03.740
the craft.
Um,
project looking glass had to do with time,

1851
01:51:03.741 --> 01:51:06.320
any effects of time in the craft.
Now I don't think,

1852
01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:10.790
we're not talking about making a time machine like in science fiction,

1853
01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:13.550
but we're talking about,
you know,
small distortions,

1854
01:51:13.551 --> 01:51:18.410
intentional distortions of time and how that can be used,
you know,

1855
01:51:18.411 --> 01:51:22.530
as a,
uh,
not as,
uh,
well,
it was part of a weapon program.

1856
01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:23.780
How were you informed in this?

1857
01:51:24.190 --> 01:51:28.460
These again where there's just the small briefings that I read,
but again,

1858
01:51:28.461 --> 01:51:31.790
I don't really like to talk about those because I don't have any information on

1859
01:51:31.791 --> 01:51:34.040
him.
And it was just,
you know,
small briefing

1860
01:51:34.190 --> 01:51:38.700
<v 6>because he told commander flavor that what he saw might've been a time dilation</v>

1861
01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:39.460
and not,

1862
01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:43.360
<v 1>well it could be both.
Just gravity affects time,
you know,
space time.</v>

1863
01:51:43.361 --> 01:51:47.260
I'm sure you've heard of that.
And uh,
you know what,

1864
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:52.900
what commander framers saw as he was in the f 18 approaching it,
he said it,

1865
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:57.460
he described it as a,
a ping pong ball in a cup and shaking it back and forth.

1866
01:51:57.461 --> 01:52:01.270
It was moving that fast.
Now obviously if there's anything inside there,

1867
01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:04.810
it's going to be battered to hell.
But you know,

1868
01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:08.110
my point was was that well one of two things,

1869
01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:13.330
either there's a gravitational envelope in there which negates any inertia

1870
01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:18.850
effects or you are seeing through a gravity distortion field.

1871
01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.340
So you know,
just like you're looking at a hot highway and you see,

1872
01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:27.820
you know,
an optical distortion going through there.
Well,

1873
01:52:27.821 --> 01:52:31.510
the same thing happens in gravity and the craft may not actually be moving like

1874
01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:34.390
that.
It may just look like it because you're seeing,

1875
01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:36.670
you can only see it through the field.

1876
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:41.440
So it may be making much more gentle moves.
I'm not saying that's it,

1877
01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:43.630
but it has to be one of the two

1878
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:46.790
<v 4>and the thing up 60 miles away.</v>

1879
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:51.710
They noticed it on radar 60 seconds after left commander favor,

1880
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:54.230
but it was at his cap point,
which is the next point.

1881
01:52:54.231 --> 01:52:59.231
He was destined to go to 60 miles away and in 60 seconds on radar,

1882
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:04.970
the same object ends up there.
So it's going a mile a second.

1883
01:53:05.210 --> 01:53:09.320
No,
they the,
I think the radar of just picked it up in 60 seconds.

1884
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:13.380
<v 1>Yeah,
I could've been there instantly,
but yeah,
we don't know the cycle.</v>

1885
01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.410
Nobody knows that that's the whole thing is so it cycles like radar cycles

1886
01:53:19.110 --> 01:53:22.700
doesn't sweep determines,
yeah,
like the plainer

1887
01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:28.180
scans around it at random places to spy.
One does the really cool.
Yeah.

1888
01:53:28.260 --> 01:53:30.850
I didn't do the whole loop anymore.
Right.
And the point,

1889
01:53:31.060 --> 01:53:36.060
the point is though that the craft moved to his next location before he knew

1890
01:53:36.970 --> 01:53:41.710
where his next location was going to be.
Jesus.
And that's,

1891
01:53:42.250 --> 01:53:45.670
I mean,
that's well documented.
So that's a,

1892
01:53:45.671 --> 01:53:48.700
that's a pretty shocking piece of information.

1893
01:53:48.850 --> 01:53:52.320
What's fascinating to me too is that you were discussing this,
um,
the,

1894
01:53:52.330 --> 01:53:57.330
the way this react to work and that these things were not really connected.

1895
01:53:58.120 --> 01:54:02.710
No,
nothing is connected.
There's no wiring at all.

1896
01:54:05.010 --> 01:54:09.280
That freaks me the fuck out.
Charge your iPhone,
you know.
Well wireless.
Yeah.

1897
01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:14.500
Yeah.
I mean that's the,
that's a simple electromagnetic.
Yeah,
I know.
Again,

1898
01:54:14.501 --> 01:54:18.520
but that's just simple.
Electro Mandian magnetic induction enemy.
Tesla,

1899
01:54:18.521 --> 01:54:23.010
the scientist had this concept of,
right,
that's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

1900
01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:27.880
The word of saying he wanted to send wireless electricity through the sky and

1901
01:54:27.881 --> 01:54:29.980
Westinghouse was like,
get the fuck Outta here with that.

1902
01:54:30.430 --> 01:54:33.260
Like when anybody could just pull electricity out of this camp meter,

1903
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:37.000
they couldn't talk in the car,
ride over and try to chill him out.
You know,

1904
01:54:37.090 --> 01:54:38.840
we're talking about Tesla now,
you know,

1905
01:54:38.841 --> 01:54:41.860
you couldn't be metered and now it all went down.
So it's funny you bring it up.

1906
01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:43.050
Yeah.
That,

1907
01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.470
that mean who knows what would have happened in terms of innovation?

1908
01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:50.260
Had he been allowed to go forward with that?
Well,

1909
01:54:50.261 --> 01:54:54.850
we probably wouldn't have computers.
You think?
Yeah,
I'm pretty positive.

1910
01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:56.800
I mean forget about microelectronics.

1911
01:54:56.830 --> 01:55:01.510
Well this is dumping huge amounts of electromagnetic energy in the air and yeah,

1912
01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:04.480
we'd be able to wirelessly turn on our lights,

1913
01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:07.930
but there'd be no radio communication.

1914
01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:10.690
The interference would be something we could,
would be overwhelming.

1915
01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.950
It would induce electric currents and anything with a small wire on it.

1916
01:55:14.951 --> 01:55:19.510
So integrated circuits,
transistors would be disintegrated before they were even,

1917
01:55:19.570 --> 01:55:24.310
you know,
tested for operation.
So it would destroy us up.

1918
01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:27.430
Yeah,
it would have stopped this dead.
We'd have,
it'd be great.

1919
01:55:27.431 --> 01:55:30.850
You can turn lighters on and heaters from all over the place with no wires,

1920
01:55:30.851 --> 01:55:34.540
but it would stop modern electronics and they slowly became dependent on it.

1921
01:55:34.570 --> 01:55:37.690
It would almost be like our dependence on fossil fuels,

1922
01:55:37.691 --> 01:55:40.840
although it's destructive,
it's very difficult for us to get off the nipple.

1923
01:55:41.830 --> 01:55:44.010
It would've changed the course of we developed,
which

1924
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.340
<v 4>is so interesting when you talk about if a civilization to the star system</v>

1925
01:55:47.341 --> 01:55:49.110
didn't even start with fossil fuels.

1926
01:55:49.111 --> 01:55:51.960
They had one 15 naturally on their planet and they're like,
cool.

1927
01:55:51.961 --> 01:55:53.370
Antigravity is pretty awesome.

1928
01:55:53.540 --> 01:55:57.410
<v 1>Well,
the fact that they didn't have important that that actually happened.
Yeah.</v>

1929
01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.380
It might've been stopped in its tracks for a reason.

1930
01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.650
<v 6>Whoa.
And
it's just,
it's,</v>

1931
01:56:05.690 --> 01:56:09.740
I think it's incredibly difficult for us to imagine technological progression

1932
01:56:09.741 --> 01:56:12.890
under another timeline other than the one that we've experienced.
Yeah.

1933
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:13.783
That's difficult.

1934
01:56:14.630 --> 01:56:19.030
If we imagine what this alien race must have been like and how,

1935
01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:23.930
I mean,
God,
just,
just to be able to see something like,

1936
01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:26.480
I mean obviously we've seen it in different life forms,
right?

1937
01:56:26.481 --> 01:56:30.080
Like we see the life of certain beetles in comparison to the life of certain

1938
01:56:30.081 --> 01:56:34.550
fish.
Very,
very different existence.
Very different life cycles.

1939
01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:36.650
Octopus.
Yeah.
Octopus.
Yeah.

1940
01:56:36.651 --> 01:56:40.190
I mean we see all these different variables in terms of biological entities on

1941
01:56:40.191 --> 01:56:40.970
earth,

1942
01:56:40.970 --> 01:56:44.930
but we don't see it in terms of technological innovation as we're the only one

1943
01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:48.530
that's intelligent that can innovate when we have intelligent creatures,

1944
01:56:48.531 --> 01:56:49.550
but they're in the ocean.

1945
01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:53.210
The only other thing that are like us or dolphins and orcas and whales and they

1946
01:56:53.211 --> 01:56:57.080
don't have the ability to manipulate their environment and subsequently because

1947
01:56:57.081 --> 01:56:59.450
they don't have the ability to manipulate their environment,

1948
01:56:59.451 --> 01:57:02.780
we put them in fish tanks and we were like,
get in the tank,
do some tricks.

1949
01:57:04.090 --> 01:57:08.170
<v 4>Yup.
The only thing he saw in the craft,
if we are considering Bob's story,</v>

1950
01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:09.340
the only thing that you,

1951
01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:13.450
he saw in the craft that he related to that looked like a human could make was

1952
01:57:13.451 --> 01:57:14.680
this honeycomb hatch.

1953
01:57:14.681 --> 01:57:18.220
And I always loved that because you're like obsessed with this thing that you

1954
01:57:18.221 --> 01:57:19.054
could recommend.

1955
01:57:19.310 --> 01:57:20.060
<v 1>No,
the re yeah.</v>

1956
01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:24.790
I only focus on that because it was the one thing that I understood how it

1957
01:57:24.791 --> 01:57:26.230
worked and it was,

1958
01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:30.700
it was the access to the level below and it was um,

1959
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.250
well,
you know,
if you take a,

1960
01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:37.300
you have a six pack of beer and you take out the cardboard dividers,

1961
01:57:37.810 --> 01:57:41.170
set it on the table,
you can put a lot of pressure on the top.

1962
01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:45.190
But if you push it from the sides,
it collapses flat.

1963
01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:49.870
So it was something like that in a honeycomb shape that was essentially some

1964
01:57:49.871 --> 01:57:54.550
sort of sheet metal.
And you could walk on that in the upper layer.

1965
01:57:54.551 --> 01:57:55.690
But if you took the corner,

1966
01:57:55.691 --> 01:58:00.691
stuck your finger finger in and pushed it collapsed and Meda and entryway.

1967
01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:04.630
So I thought that was a really unique,
I'd never seen that before.

1968
01:58:04.631 --> 01:58:07.960
And it was the only thing in the crap that made absolute sense to me as it,
ah,

1969
01:58:08.170 --> 01:58:10.880
we can make that.
And all that is,
is a hatch.

1970
01:58:11.220 --> 01:58:15.870
<v 6>Was there any discussion about the materials that were used to make the craft?</v>

1971
01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:20.170
<v 1>I'm sure there was,
but that was a metallurgy division has nothing to do with us.</v>

1972
01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:23.500
So you never got a,
not even the slightest briefing.

1973
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:26.780
I don't even know if it was a metal or it was ceramic.
It's a,

1974
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:29.090
I think there's a fine line between the,

1975
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:34.330
<v 6>yeah.
Now one of the things that's happened to you that has allowed people to</v>

1976
01:58:34.331 --> 01:58:39.331
discredit you was there's obviously been some sort of an effort to erase your

1977
01:58:39.641 --> 01:58:42.820
past.
Yeah.
Some sort of an a ref,
uh,

1978
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.850
an effort to erase your education history,

1979
01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:48.880
your employment history at Los Alamos.
In fact,

1980
01:58:48.881 --> 01:58:52.360
the only way your employment history was proven at Los Alamos was someone got a

1981
01:58:52.361 --> 01:58:57.190
list of directory of the employees from the past and read into it and you were

1982
01:58:57.191 --> 01:58:59.110
on that list.
So it prove that you worked there,

1983
01:58:59.111 --> 01:59:01.450
even though people were trying to deny it and they were trying to use that as a

1984
01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:03.790
way to discredit you,
that you never did work at Los Alamos.

1985
01:59:03.791 --> 01:59:08.750
You weren't really the scientists.
What was,
what was that like to experience?

1986
01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:11.110
I mean,
of course we're talking about the 1980s,

1987
01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:14.050
the 1990s when you could get away with something like that.

1988
01:59:15.070 --> 01:59:17.230
<v 1>Yeah.
I obviously there are a lot less,</v>

1989
01:59:18.070 --> 01:59:18.903
<v 5>uh,</v>

1990
01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:20.580
<v 1>allow US records on computers.</v>

1991
01:59:20.581 --> 01:59:24.840
At that time it was still file cabinets and folders,
but uh,
yeah,

1992
01:59:24.841 --> 01:59:27.440
that was frightening.
That was one of the first things answered.

1993
01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.070
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1994
01:59:29.070 --> 01:59:32.880
<v 1>I think it's,
I think George Knapp was the first one that uncovered that.
I mean,</v>

1995
01:59:32.881 --> 01:59:37.740
he saw my birth certificate disappear.
He,
um,
it disappeared.
Yeah.

1996
01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:40.560
It was no record of you being,
yeah,
there was,
there was no record of that.

1997
01:59:40.561 --> 01:59:41.394
There was

1998
01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:43.820
<v 4>no record.
His mom tells me about that.</v>

1999
01:59:43.821 --> 01:59:47.450
Like it was frightening for her for he's got a real family,
you know,

2000
01:59:47.451 --> 01:59:49.340
he's a real person.
That's frightening for her.

2001
01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.880
<v 1>But even the Los Alamos thing really surprised me and that they were so adamant</v>

2002
01:59:54.881 --> 01:59:57.460
that now this guy never worked here,
don't be ridiculous.

2003
01:59:57.461 --> 02:00:02.080
And George went back and forth,
you know,
for months.
I mean,

2004
02:00:02.081 --> 02:00:03.280
it was ridiculous.

2005
02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:07.750
But fortunately somebody came up with a 1982 phone book directory.

2006
02:00:08.050 --> 02:00:11.590
I mean,
and also,
uh,
originally I told you,

2007
02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.140
<v 5>uh,</v>

2008
02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:16.380
<v 1>you know,
when I worked there,
I was on the front page of the paper,</v>

2009
02:00:16.410 --> 02:00:19.020
so they were still able to archive,
you know,
break,

2010
02:00:19.021 --> 02:00:21.410
bring that back from the archives.
And you know,
Bob was our,

2011
02:00:21.411 --> 02:00:25.680
a physicist working here at Los Alamos,
so there was at least something there.

2012
02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:29.250
But,
uh,
somehow George came up with the phone directly

2013
02:00:29.250 --> 02:00:33.690
<v 4>during the,
George didn't,
Bob took George with cameras into Los Alamos.</v>

2014
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:37.360
<v 1>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
So we flew out there and I said,
look,
come on in,</v>

2015
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:40.270
I'll show you where I worked.
We'll go in,
we'll meet people.

2016
02:00:40.271 --> 02:00:44.790
And George went with me and you know,
they'll be inside that place.
Oh yeah.

2017
02:00:44.890 --> 02:00:47.220
And you know,
met people and you know,
and

2018
02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:52.830
<v 6>it was also the place where they had the machine that was able to read the,</v>

2019
02:00:52.970 --> 02:00:54.590
the size of your digits.

2020
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:58.670
<v 1>No,
no,
that was awesome.
That was s four that was asked for and explain that.</v>

2021
02:00:59.510 --> 02:01:03.090
So now this was back in the 80s,
and this is back in the 80s.
Yeah.

2022
02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:06.370
<v 6>Where when you discuss this,
people like this doesn't even exist.</v>

2023
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:10.220
<v 1>Yeah.
Okay.
What was it?
It was a way,
you know,</v>

2024
02:01:10.221 --> 02:01:13.040
this is before fingerprint scanners and you know,

2025
02:01:13.340 --> 02:01:18.230
and anything of anything,
any high resolution scanner that time.

2026
02:01:18.231 --> 02:01:22.940
So what it was was a device that a had a little picture of a hand on a glass

2027
02:01:22.941 --> 02:01:27.590
plate with pins in it so you could jam your hand in there and there was a bright

2028
02:01:27.591 --> 02:01:31.820
light above it and a sensor underneath.
And when you put your hand in there,

2029
02:01:31.821 --> 02:01:36.410
the light would turn on and it would measure the bones in your finger because

2030
02:01:36.411 --> 02:01:41.411
the light shown through your bones and apparently the length of the bones in

2031
02:01:42.951 --> 02:01:47.480
your fingers are extremely unique and easy to measure.
And they use that.

2032
02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:49.040
When you put your hands on there,

2033
02:01:49.041 --> 02:01:53.030
the light would turn on and your badge would pop out.
Oh there it is.
That's,

2034
02:01:53.031 --> 02:01:56.840
that's it.
And I tried to describe this to people and they said,

2035
02:01:56.870 --> 02:02:01.700
that is the most ridiculous thing we've ever heard.
And um,
I said,
hey,

2036
02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:05.810
that my badge came out of that thing.
I put my hand on it,
badge popped out.

2037
02:02:05.811 --> 02:02:10.160
And that's how I could open the doors and get into s four and um,
you know,

2038
02:02:10.161 --> 02:02:13.760
and everybody discredited that.
They said it was bullshit.
It was science fiction.

2039
02:02:13.761 --> 02:02:15.320
And Jeremy,
you found this,

2040
02:02:15.650 --> 02:02:16.010
<v 4>I,</v>

2041
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:19.590
I found it through a good friend of mine named Tyler rogue away and he had some

2042
02:02:19.591 --> 02:02:24.591
good sources inside a very 52 where they also used these for the stealth program

2043
02:02:24.751 --> 02:02:25.980
right around that time.

2044
02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:30.330
So now I've got all these people that worked within who he knows said only if

2045
02:02:30.331 --> 02:02:33.540
you're in certain programs would we use this technology is kind of shit.

2046
02:02:33.541 --> 02:02:35.970
Actually they didn't keep it for very long,
the beginning of biometrics.

2047
02:02:36.150 --> 02:02:38.070
So I was able to reveal it in my film.

2048
02:02:38.071 --> 02:02:41.400
I kept my mouth shut until I showed it to Bob.
You know,

2049
02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:44.760
in the movie is the first time he saw it was how you see it in the documentary.

2050
02:02:44.761 --> 02:02:46.680
That's his genuine reaction.
I'm getting goosebumps.

2051
02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:48.960
That was a great idea that the way you did it.
Thank you man.

2052
02:02:48.961 --> 02:02:49.970
Because you know what?
Guess what I'm,

2053
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:53.220
I'm actually trying to see if he's telling the truth.
That's how I started.

2054
02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:54.300
You know,
that's how we started.

2055
02:02:54.301 --> 02:02:56.580
So it was really cool to see that and that you get to see it.

2056
02:02:56.581 --> 02:03:01.080
His actual reaction has that been verified by other people?
Yeah.

2057
02:03:01.081 --> 02:03:03.590
So yeah.
So to me it has,
uh,

2058
02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:07.740
personally I get emails every day and people are telling me where these are used

2059
02:03:07.741 --> 02:03:09.390
and how they're used in a semi photos.

2060
02:03:09.391 --> 02:03:12.470
I got a lot of photos of identity mats now.
Well,
how they were used right there.

2061
02:03:12.480 --> 02:03:15.060
Not how they were used,
but yeah.
But uh,
I don't,

2062
02:03:15.090 --> 02:03:18.870
the most recent one was way more recent than I thought in another country,

2063
02:03:18.871 --> 02:03:23.070
but yeah,
that technology was used.
So what's so funny is,

2064
02:03:23.970 --> 02:03:26.340
um,
that this technology,

2065
02:03:26.610 --> 02:03:29.450
even in the area of 52 where they'd use them for Tona Paul,

2066
02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:33.270
one of the guys who will go on camera when he will do an interview with me,

2067
02:03:33.540 --> 02:03:37.530
he was a technician for one of these and any hated them because they were really

2068
02:03:37.531 --> 02:03:39.630
bad.
They always broke down and river.

2069
02:03:39.810 --> 02:03:43.870
And he was a technician forum that he won't tell me where if he worked at area

2070
02:03:43.871 --> 02:03:48.360
52.
So there's probably tone apoc.
It's very separated even on base.
But yeah,

2071
02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:50.650
<v 1>so there was that.
Yeah.</v>

2072
02:03:50.830 --> 02:03:53.710
There is your education record.

2073
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:58.050
That was also like what happened with that?
The well,

2074
02:03:58.051 --> 02:04:02.170
that disappeared also,
you know,
that I,
I've,
I've never gone,

2075
02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:06.820
I've never gone anywhere for education.
I've never gone,

2076
02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:10.720
I never attended any classes at cal tech.
I never attended anything at Mit.

2077
02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:15.370
You did attend classes in those places that I did attend classes and those

2078
02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:18.880
places.
Do you know anybody that you went to school with that?
Yes,
I do.

2079
02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:21.730
And have they verified that they went to school with you?
Well,

2080
02:04:21.731 --> 02:04:24.550
I gave Jeremy some names,
but yeah.
I,

2081
02:04:24.551 --> 02:04:29.551
the reason I don't say these names publicly is because every single time I

2082
02:04:29.801 --> 02:04:34.660
mentioned a name,
somebody gets in trouble to be course.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2083
02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:38.280
of course.
Um,
but what,
what is that experience

2084
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:41.040
<v 6>like seeing your birth certificate erased?</v>

2085
02:04:41.070 --> 02:04:45.520
Seeing your employment is frightening.
It's,
it's absolutely fraught.

2086
02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:49.980
It's also the fueled that the debunkers use,
the so called air quotes skeptics.

2087
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.930
I don't like the term skeptics.

2088
02:04:51.931 --> 02:04:54.420
I'm gonna say this publicly because I really only send this privately.

2089
02:04:54.690 --> 02:04:59.310
I think it's a sloppy,
lazy way to look at things,
to just be a skeptic.

2090
02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:04.470
[inaudible] those people can be objective and I think there's a lot of things

2091
02:05:04.471 --> 02:05:07.560
you should be skeptical of.
I think you should,

2092
02:05:07.590 --> 02:05:12.590
you should look at things and look at things from a hard line science

2093
02:05:13.171 --> 02:05:16.590
perspective.
You should be objective,
but the idea of skeptics,

2094
02:05:16.591 --> 02:05:19.600
the problem with that is you're always looking for things to be bullshit.
Yeah,

2095
02:05:19.710 --> 02:05:22.870
and I think that's dangerous because I think some things aren't bullshitting

2096
02:05:23.470 --> 02:05:24.430
<v 4>information bias.
On the other end,</v>

2097
02:05:24.431 --> 02:05:27.460
you're deciding to take a square thing and put it in a round hole no matter
what,

2098
02:05:27.570 --> 02:05:29.850
<v 6>and I find a lot of them to be lazy,</v>

2099
02:05:30.310 --> 02:05:34.170
a lot of them to be lazy thinkers because they're always putting it into that

2100
02:05:34.171 --> 02:05:39.030
box instead of going,
hmm,
instead of just separating their ego,
they're trying,

2101
02:05:39.031 --> 02:05:42.060
they're playing a game and the game is calling bullshit.

2102
02:05:42.090 --> 02:05:45.510
I want to call bullshit and I'm going to align up all these reasons why it's

2103
02:05:45.511 --> 02:05:48.690
bullshit and I'm going to ignore anything that might be contrary to that

2104
02:05:48.691 --> 02:05:49.524
definition.
Yeah,

2105
02:05:49.590 --> 02:05:52.830
<v 4>that does.
Every time I'm thinking I'm going to catch him in something,
you know,</v>

2106
02:05:52.831 --> 02:05:56.490
all along this process,
um,
I found doctor Crangle,
he came forward and said,

2107
02:05:56.491 --> 02:06:00.000
I was in security briefings with Bob Lasar are the physicist at Los Alamos.

2108
02:06:00.001 --> 02:06:02.820
He went on the record with me.
Now the other people I talked with,

2109
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:07.530
why won't they go on the record with me?
Cause he's still working there.
So that,

2110
02:06:07.531 --> 02:06:10.050
that's the difference,
right?
What is the,
what can the public have,

2111
02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:12.060
<v 6>right?
Or even if they're not working,
they're the,
you know,</v>

2112
02:06:12.180 --> 02:06:13.770
they want to live their lives.
I mean,

2113
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:17.110
obviously people have seen what's happened to you,
Mike Pin

2114
02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:22.240
<v 1>After 30 years on them.
If you look at all the information on,</v>

2115
02:06:23.170 --> 02:06:27.250
you know,
concerning my accounts,
that's,
that's verifiable.

2116
02:06:27.610 --> 02:06:30.850
It can't possibly be a bullshit story anymore.

2117
02:06:30.940 --> 02:06:35.830
It's really way past that point.
Yeah.
I mean that was my big pen is,
I mean,

2118
02:06:35.831 --> 02:06:37.540
how could I possibly know?

2119
02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:44.130
<v 4>So Mike Big Pin was the guy that did the security clearances to go to the bay.</v>

2120
02:06:44.650 --> 02:06:48.670
One of the guys that was used,
the guy that you work with,
he said he did.
Right.

2121
02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:51.610
And George Knapp.
George didn't believe him.

2122
02:06:51.611 --> 02:06:55.660
George put him through for polygraph tests.
Right.
He tried to see,
man,

2123
02:06:55.661 --> 02:06:58.240
this is a big risk.
It sounds interesting,

2124
02:06:58.241 --> 02:06:59.590
but let's see if he's telling the truth.

2125
02:06:59.890 --> 02:07:02.860
One of the things was Bob said there's a guy named Mike Figg.

2126
02:07:03.130 --> 02:07:06.400
Penny did security clearances for the base and that's a weird name.

2127
02:07:06.401 --> 02:07:09.190
It's a very specific,
for 30 years,

2128
02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:13.180
George found this guy in this weird department that he didn't even know it was

2129
02:07:13.181 --> 02:07:15.610
my big pin.
The guy wouldn't talk to me,
goes to them,

2130
02:07:15.611 --> 02:07:16.890
totally goes from for 30 years,

2131
02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:20.350
used Facebook and Google image match through his children.

2132
02:07:20.351 --> 02:07:24.250
I was able to find him after 30 years and I talked to him three times on the

2133
02:07:24.251 --> 02:07:27.850
phone.
He lives on the east coast.
He almost went on camera with me,

2134
02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:32.170
confirmed that he did security clearances for the base in 1989 confirmed.

2135
02:07:32.171 --> 02:07:33.880
He remembers Bob Lasar.

2136
02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:38.020
And what you don't know is there's a handwritten note that a friend of yours has

2137
02:07:38.170 --> 02:07:42.160
from Mike that I know I'm gonna give it to you later.
I don't,
but that is real.

2138
02:07:42.161 --> 02:07:45.180
That is actual.
So handwritten note that says what you know,
like this is new.

2139
02:07:45.780 --> 02:07:48.120
So when the eye,
when you're,

2140
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:52.660
when they do security clearances,

2141
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:55.030
they go through all your friends and finagle the offense.
Yeah.

2142
02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:59.730
So this is to Bob and I had people come to me for a friend of mine that's

2143
02:07:59.731 --> 02:08:01.930
serving and they are doing a security plans for him.

2144
02:08:01.931 --> 02:08:04.930
And even though I'm like the Ufo Guy,
uh,
they did,
you know,

2145
02:08:04.931 --> 02:08:09.010
the FBI come and visit my house and make sure that they talk about my friend and

2146
02:08:09.011 --> 02:08:10.540
they lift a little card.

2147
02:08:10.930 --> 02:08:13.390
And when my wife told him to get away because he didn't know who they were,

2148
02:08:13.570 --> 02:08:15.550
they left a little card.
It's super cute now.

2149
02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:19.090
Back then it was a handwritten note and his friend has it for him that you

2150
02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:23.740
haven't seen in,
Oh my God.
Two decades.
So if you're listening,

2151
02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:26.770
I don't know why I'm told is this card,

2152
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:30.940
it's just a little handwritten note with Mike Figg pen signature card,

2153
02:08:30.941 --> 02:08:32.560
like a look,
a look,
a postcard,

2154
02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:36.760
like a piece of paper that he left on the door saying when Bob gets back or

2155
02:08:36.761 --> 02:08:40.690
whatever it says on it.
So it's just another little funny thing I found the guy,

2156
02:08:40.691 --> 02:08:42.790
he does the security clearances.
He admitted to me,

2157
02:08:42.791 --> 02:08:46.060
he did it and he admitted to me he was dodging George Knapp because when George

2158
02:08:46.061 --> 02:08:48.490
said his name on the,
on the,
on the news,

2159
02:08:48.610 --> 02:08:52.780
he dropped his fork into his steak or news potatoes or whatever and he's looking

2160
02:08:52.781 --> 02:08:54.220
at his wife.
He was in trouble.

2161
02:08:54.221 --> 02:08:57.130
His name is never supposed to be out there like it's just a security clearance

2162
02:08:57.131 --> 02:08:57.670
guy,

2163
02:08:57.670 --> 02:09:01.480
but you don't want national attention associated with anything Bob has to say.

2164
02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:02.381
But anyway,

2165
02:09:02.381 --> 02:09:06.640
this unique name Bob said for 30 years and the guy goes to George Knapp,

2166
02:09:06.641 --> 02:09:09.490
George could prove he existed.
He actually talked to me,
man,

2167
02:09:09.491 --> 02:09:13.810
he talked to me three times.
He almost went on camera with me.
It's just crazy.

2168
02:09:13.811 --> 02:09:16.750
What,
what do you,
what happens after 30 years?
You just get more info.

2169
02:09:16.810 --> 02:09:16.961
<v 6>Well,</v>

2170
02:09:16.961 --> 02:09:21.961
that's one of the reasons why when you and me and Jeremy and George Knapp had

2171
02:09:23.321 --> 02:09:25.630
that conversation on the phone.
Yeah.
I said,

2172
02:09:25.690 --> 02:09:30.690
I think what we can do with this podcast is important.

2173
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:32.583
I really do.

2174
02:09:32.770 --> 02:09:37.770
I think it's important for people to hear this from you in a very clear,

2175
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:44.430
just very concise way and if you examine all the information that you've said

2176
02:09:46.931 --> 02:09:50.530
today,
if you look at all the things that the detractors of said,

2177
02:09:50.531 --> 02:09:55.480
if you look at all of the new recent evidence that's coming out in all these

2178
02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.100
really high level people in the military and the government that are discussing

2179
02:10:00.101 --> 02:10:00.934
this,

2180
02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.360
it gives you far more credibility than you would have had in the 19 insurance

2181
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:09.663
when this came out.

2182
02:10:09.770 --> 02:10:13.670
<v 4>Yes.
You can't ignore his story just because you don't like it anymore.</v>

2183
02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:17.170
<v 6>That's why I thought it was important that you come out and refresh the world's</v>

2184
02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:20.620
memory and let people know.
And like I said,
I've been,
man,

2185
02:10:20.660 --> 02:10:21.970
I want to say I'm a fan of yours,

2186
02:10:21.971 --> 02:10:24.850
but I guess I'm a fan of yours as a human being.
I'm a fan of yours,

2187
02:10:25.090 --> 02:10:27.160
but I've been following you for decades.

2188
02:10:27.190 --> 02:10:31.060
I've been following this story for decades.
I mean,
no kidding.
I have VHS

2189
02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:34.400
<v 4>like a lot of the world has.
Yeah,
it's crazy.</v>

2190
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:39.510
<v 6>Well,
anybody that has any sort of a vested interest or just,
uh,</v>

2191
02:10:39.590 --> 02:10:40.423
even a,

2192
02:10:40.670 --> 02:10:45.670
just a fascination with Ufo is as followed your story because there's no one

2193
02:10:46.851 --> 02:10:50.300
else.
There's no one else that comes for this.
Some guy who said,

2194
02:10:50.301 --> 02:10:52.610
I worked underground with the aliens,
they shot my hand off.

2195
02:10:52.611 --> 02:10:56.000
Like this is a bunch of like wacky dudes that let their underground is base as

2196
02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:59.060
they're shooting lasers through the earth's crust and move them,
had lightspeed.

2197
02:10:59.330 --> 02:11:02.690
There's a lot of those guys.
They seem schizophrenia.
They seem crazy.

2198
02:11:02.691 --> 02:11:04.700
They might even be disinformation agents.

2199
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:07.730
They might be people that are designed to muddy the waters,

2200
02:11:07.731 --> 02:11:11.960
which for sure has happened.
He's coming forward then now it's amazing.

2201
02:11:11.961 --> 02:11:13.280
And by doing this,
what you're doing,

2202
02:11:13.281 --> 02:11:16.370
you're providing an opportunities for Bob to tell a story.
You know,

2203
02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:18.620
believe it or not,
he can tell his story.

2204
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:23.770
It's amazing because more people will come forward now that are involved with

2205
02:11:23.841 --> 02:11:27.170
these projects.
They'll come forward to you to meet.
They're coming forward.

2206
02:11:27.171 --> 02:11:30.320
And so what you've done here is provide that opportunity if they need it.

2207
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:33.780
And it's amazing.
I just want to say,
Bob,
don't come forward to,
no,

2208
02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:36.360
don't come forward to Bob.
Why were,

2209
02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:40.070
why were you fricking nauseous at the beginning of this?

2210
02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:43.670
Like so upset.
Why was your,
why did you have a Migraine?

2211
02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:46.130
Because that started off so hard and I got us in here like did this,

2212
02:11:46.210 --> 02:11:49.130
why are you asking them why?
Because obvious anxiety.

2213
02:11:49.131 --> 02:11:51.740
The guy's gone to 30 fucking years of being persecuted.

2214
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:53.990
I just want to kiss his birth certificate.
I just want to hear,

2215
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:58.770
I want to hear him say,
I want them to do is to say that you don't get it.

2216
02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:03.230
I step out.
Settle down.
Yeah.

2217
02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:06.380
Well I get it.
You were,
it was hard for you to get them here,
you know,

2218
02:12:06.381 --> 02:12:08.750
and I appreciate the US.
Yeah.
You know,

2219
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:11.670
<v 1>you didn't want more than that.
It really annoys me or the people that thing,</v>

2220
02:12:11.850 --> 02:12:12.331
you know,

2221
02:12:12.331 --> 02:12:15.870
you guys just came up with the story to make a bunch of money or get a bunch of,

2222
02:12:15.930 --> 02:12:17.670
you know,
attention and that's a good point.

2223
02:12:17.671 --> 02:12:21.840
So let's please explain that you don't get any money out of this at all.

2224
02:12:21.841 --> 02:12:25.800
And I may,
I didn't even let you guys buy plane tickets for me to come out here.

2225
02:12:25.801 --> 02:12:30.560
Anything.
I mean,
anytime like when Jeremy,
uh,

2226
02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:35.220
pre previewed,
I guess the movie up in Michigan,
I mean they,

2227
02:12:35.221 --> 02:12:37.320
it brought in like a couple thousand dollars.

2228
02:12:37.321 --> 02:12:42.090
I made sure that $2,000 went to science programs at the local high schools.

2229
02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.080
There I dirty money,
I don't take touch.
I don't take any money from this stuff.

2230
02:12:46.081 --> 02:12:50.910
And as far as attention,
I hate fucking attention.

2231
02:12:51.090 --> 02:12:52.980
I don't like being on shows.

2232
02:12:52.981 --> 02:12:56.460
I just want to kind of hide in the corner and do my own thing.
So that's,

2233
02:12:56.461 --> 02:13:00.630
I got enough hugs when I was a kid.
Okay.
I don't need any attention.

2234
02:13:00.631 --> 02:13:02.730
So know that if,
if you,

2235
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:05.730
if you think somehow we came up with this thing,

2236
02:13:05.731 --> 02:13:07.950
then you got to tell me why we did it.

2237
02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:12.530
<v 6>Great job of making sure you have your bases covered in that regard,</v>

2238
02:13:12.531 --> 02:13:14.510
that you haven't profited off of this.
And like you said,

2239
02:13:14.511 --> 02:13:18.230
that you have donated whatever money that came your way to science programs.

2240
02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:22.790
It's,
I mean,
it,
it doesn't make any sense any other way.

2241
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:24.223
I mean,
what you're,

2242
02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:27.950
what I've got gotten out of here is what I thought I was going to get out of

2243
02:13:27.951 --> 02:13:31.680
here when I watched the documentary that you,
what you're saying makes sense.

2244
02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:35.850
It doesn't make sense that it's bullshit that happened exactly like I said it,

2245
02:13:35.851 --> 02:13:39.510
that Joe,
I believe you.
Um,
in closing,

2246
02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:40.980
is there anything else you'd like to say?

2247
02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:43.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2248
02:13:43.050 --> 02:13:46.950
<v 6>No,
I can't think of anything other than really don't come and try to visit me.</v>

2249
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:49.943
Well.
Um,

2250
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:55.050
I know that you have paid a huge personal cost to get this information out.

2251
02:13:55.110 --> 02:13:55.771
And I mean,

2252
02:13:55.771 --> 02:13:58.560
maybe you didn't understand what that cost would have been when you first

2253
02:13:58.561 --> 02:14:02.610
initially came forward with the story,
but over the past 30 years,

2254
02:14:02.611 --> 02:14:04.530
it's been immense.
It's been great.

2255
02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.790
And I just wanna thank you for that and thank you for all,

2256
02:14:07.810 --> 02:14:10.890
all these people that would not have gotten this information and would not have

2257
02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:14.820
really had this story any other way.
Oh,
thanks Joe.
Thank you.

2258
02:14:15.630 --> 02:14:17.400
And thank you,
Jeremy.
And one more time.

2259
02:14:17.401 --> 02:14:20.040
The documentary is available on Netflix right now.
Yeah,

2260
02:14:20.041 --> 02:14:24.060
it's called the Bob Lasar area 51 and flying saucers.
All right.

2261
02:14:24.390 --> 02:14:25.650
That's it folks tonight.

2262
02:14:36.170 --> 02:14:37.003
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2263
02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:42.240
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>
