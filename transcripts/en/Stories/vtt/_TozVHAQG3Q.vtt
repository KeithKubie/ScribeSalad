00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.386
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.386 --> 00:00:03.510
LEANNA MULVIHILL: So I'm
going to go do pig chores.

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.820
Hi piggies!

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.580
Four Legs Farm is my business.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.376
I raise sheep, pigs and cows.

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:20.440
It's particularly
important this year

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.080
to build wallows for
the pigs, because we've

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.530
been in somewhat of a drought.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.390
So right now they're
six months old.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.640
So they're getting,
they're getting close.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.322
They're getting
close to being bacon.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.520
NARRATOR: This is
Leanna Mulvihill.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.300
She raises livestock
for meat shares

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.636
on Four Legs Farm in
Hudson Valley, New York,

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:44.140
where she's actually
relatively new to farming.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.600
Up until two years ago,
Leanna was on the path

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.230
to becoming an engineer.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.000
But after college,
she realized that she

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.550
didn't want a desk job.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.200
Instead, she wanted
to become a farmer.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.764
However, that decision
didn't come lightly.

00:00:57.764 --> 00:01:00.180
LEANNA MULVIHILL: I do not
come from a farming background.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.350
It took me a while to have
the courage to be a farmer.

00:01:05.745 --> 00:01:07.370
NARRATOR: It took
courage because there

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.030
are a number of
hurdles preventing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.220
young people like Leanna
from taking the leap

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.170
to become a farmer.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.870
Today only 6% of
farmers in the US

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.720
are under the age of 35, which
for the agricultural industry

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.200
is a problem.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.880
SOPHIE ACKHOFF: We are
in a farming crisis

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.970
now, where our
farming population

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.090
is aging out and retiring.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.690
And we need young people to
take on this role of growing

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.340
our nation's food, but they're
facing incredible challenges

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.890
in doing that, including
access to land, capital

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.940
credit, student loan debt.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.170
Many young farmers
today are discovering

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.150
agriculture in college.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.430
They're not growing
up in farm families.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.100
And this debt that they've
accumulated from college

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.820
is preventing them
from getting started.

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.190
NARRATOR: Leanna
was fortunate enough

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.640
to qualify for a
unique loan forgiveness

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.600
program in New York, which
allowed her to pay off her debt

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.009
and kick start her business.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.300
LEANNA MULVIHILL: Without
the loan forgiveness program,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.030
financing the farm would
have been more challenging.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.340
I'm very thankful
to be a part of it

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.940
and it definitely
cushioned my first couple

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.560
of years of farming.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.310
NARRATOR: But the loan
forgiveness program

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220
hasn't solved all
of her problems.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.190
She still has to work another
job to make ends meet.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.740
LEANNA MULVIHILL: Most of
the time I work 12 hour days.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.610
And I can't really leave the
farm for more than a few hours.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.140
I don't really take days off.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.490
I always have to do chores.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.110
And then I go to my job at
the National Young Farmer's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.660
Coalition, which is also a
key piece of figuring out how

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.844
to make this work financially.

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:51.260
SOPHIE ACKHOFF:
Young farmers have

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.106
to be extremely creative to
make it in agriculture today,

00:02:56.106 --> 00:02:58.380
whether that's
working several jobs

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.420
or finding land through a
land trust or a current land

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.172
owner who is willing to let
them use part of their land.

00:03:08.172 --> 00:03:10.130
NARRATOR: The National
Young Farmer's Coalition

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.139
hopes to help young
farmers in that cause.

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.680
SOPHIE ACKHOFF: In
the next 25 years,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.080
2/3 of farmer-owned
land in the US

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.700
will have transitioned
ownership.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.140
If young farmers aren't
successful in taking

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.570
over this land,
it's possible we'll

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.210
start importing our
food from overseas.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.440
This is a national
security issue.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.100
We need farmers in the
United States growing

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.740
food for our country.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.970
NARRATOR: Essentially
this means that the US

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.770
could become more and more
dependent on other countries

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:40.830
for food.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.600
What the NYFC are
fighting for is

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.320
to give young people like
Leanna the financial support

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.010
to continue and sustain the
farming tradition in the US.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.050
Until legislation to support
young farmers is realized,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.630
folks have to do the
best with what they have.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.150
For Leanna, this means
applying for grants

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.835
and renting, rather than
owning, land for her animals.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.770
LEANNA MULVIHILL: So I move
the sheep every three days

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.850
to a new spot.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.320
And as you can
see, they've eaten

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.580
a lot of the grass over there.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.350
NARRATOR: One day Leanna hopes
to eventually own her own land

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.910
and expand her meat
share business.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.510
LEANNA MULVIHILL: I love
getting to provide my community

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.280
with really healthy proteins.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.140
It feels really
special that it's

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.410
like people I know that
are eating the meat.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.820
Hopefully it makes
them healthier

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.910
and improves their
quality of life.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.170
My life, my world revolves
around, being at the farm

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.540
and taking care of my animals.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.910
I do get to work in
a beautiful place.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.910
I do get to see
spectacular sunsets.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.220
And I get to see-- see
the animals playing.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.000
And it's definitely a privilege
to be able to be here at all.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.220
And I try really hard not
to take it for granted

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.760
and to take pause and make
sure I'm drinking it all in.

00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:08.670
NARRATOR: To hear more
about the farming crisis

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.720
and what NYFC are doing,
check this next episode out

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.735
on Seeker daily.

00:05:12.735 --> 00:05:14.110
NARRATOR 2: Some
states have even

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.940
started offering student loan
forgiveness to new farmers,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.340
adding to the current list
of forgivable occupations,

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.950
such as teaching
and law enforcement.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.550
SOPHIE ACKHOFF: We believe
farmers can produce good

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.840
for their community,
steward the land

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.580
and feed their communities--
and at the same time,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.750
be profitable businesses.
