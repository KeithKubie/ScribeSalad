JULIA: Hello everyone, welcome.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.070
My name's Julia, I'm part
of the food team here.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.340
I'm very excited to
welcome our guest chef

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.380
today, Alice Medrich,
to the teaching kitchen

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.380
here at Google.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.060
Alice is an award-winning
cookbook author.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.500
She is a dessert chef, a
chocolatier, a teacher.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.640
She got her start when she
opened a dessert and chocolate

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.125
shop in Berkeley in the '70s.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.750
One of her claims
to fame-- let's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.830
say-- is introducing the
chocolate truffle that we all

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.010
know and love to America,
so thank you for that.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520
Alice is here today
showing some recipes

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540
from her newest book,
"Flavor Flours," which

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.290
is her 10th cookbook.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.240
And it was the recipient
of the Best New Cookbook

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.650
Award from the James
Beard Foundation

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.880
last year in the Desert
and Baking category.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.530
So thank you so much for
being here today, Alice.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.439
We're very excited to
have you, and welcome.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.480
ALICE MEDRICH: Thank you.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.472
I'm going to start out
with this yogurt tart.

00:01:26.472 --> 00:01:28.390
It's a 9 1/2 inch tart pan.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.560
This dough that we're about
to make is fairly sticky,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.150
and so just in case
I've greased it--

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.880
I've greased it thoroughly,
but not heavily.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.500
So I just want it-- especially
in these little crenelated

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.254
areas, because we really want
it to release and be beautiful.

00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:43.670
So I've taken the
time to do that.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.820
You can do it with
softened butter,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.680
you can do that with
spray if you like spray.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.138
Or you can do it
with oil, whatever

00:01:48.138 --> 00:01:49.470
is going to get it greasy.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.150
Also, when it comes time
to picking equipment,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.860
I personally love a
pan that's not dark.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.460
Because with a pan that's
got this finish on it,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.850
you can get even browning
and it won't brown too fast

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.070
on the outside before
the inside is done.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.700
And one of the key
things about whole grains

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580
is they taste better
when they're fully baked

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.419
and you get a little toastiness.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:16.190
So starting with the crust,
I've got oat flour and sugar

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.680
and a little rice flour.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.480
The rice flour acts as a sort
of neutral ingredient that

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.330
highlights the oats, stretches
them out a little bit.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.790
A teeny, teeny
bit of baking soda

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.290
to give a lightness
to the dough.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.430
A little salt.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.360
I like having a group that isn't
scared of a scale, so 85 grams.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.300
You know, the American bakers
have taken a really long time

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.020
to get used to the scale.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.280
85 grams-- this is almost.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.420
Didn't get-- just 3 tablespoons
of cream cheese, sorry.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.850
So before I drop
in the wet stuff,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.480
let's just mix it all around.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.960
The idea of mixing the dry
before adding the gooey stuff

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.620
is to make sure that the salt
and the soda and anything

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.210
that's strong like
that doesn't end up

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.550
in one place in the
tart pan, right?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.890
So usually we whisk up
the dry ingredients,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.810
and some of these flours
clump a little bit.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.800
OK, just eyeball me the
3 tablespoons of that.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.200
Baking is very precise,
we don't eyeball at all.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.290
Nope, no eyeballing.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.730
So this pastry could be made in
the food processor or by hand,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.820
but we don't want to
watch the food processor

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.528
and we don't want to
have it buzzing away

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:35.760
in this whole demonstration.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.170
So as long as you start with
soft butter and soft cream

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.040
cheese, it's really
easy to mix by hand.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.560
And it's also a good
demonstration of the fact

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.010
that because we don't have
any gluten-- it's not a wheat

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.980
flour-- there's no danger.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.340
If you make pastry,
you know-- thanks.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.110
I think-- is this enough?

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.897
Let me see if I got
the amount right.

00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:55.980
Is it about 3 tablespoons?

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.560
2 tablespoons, good.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.650
OK, so it doesn't matter
how much we handle this.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.500
Because when you handled
a wheat flour pastry,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.270
there's a risk of getting
tough and cardboardy.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.250
Without any gluten, it
just doesn't matter.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.181
So I'm just going to squish
and mash this together.

00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.430
Like I said, if you don't
like to get your hands dirty

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.420
use the food processor, but this
just seems like an easier way

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.892
to go.

00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:24.772
AUDIENCE: Was that
vanilla extract?

00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:26.730
ALICE MEDRICH: Yeah, it
was vanilla, thank you.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.230
Vanilla.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.040
So it's a little cream
cheese, a little butter, salt,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.390
the two flours.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.030
The oat flour is going to
give a lot of flavor here.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.780
In this book-- unlike
other gluten-free books--

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.700
I'm not using this all-purpose
gluten-free flour blend.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.540
It's all about highlighting
and celebrating

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.230
the flavors of the actual
interesting flours.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.820
So in the oat
chapter you're going

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.920
to have a whole lot of things
with oats-- oat flour or oats--

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.930
and sometimes the oat flour
will be a single flour

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.200
and sometimes it'll be
paired with something.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.180
In this case, paired
with rice, and rice

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.400
is like the supporting cast.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.390
So as soon as this is all
mooshed and mashed together--

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.160
who's made pastry before
and lined a tart crust?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.155
This is like nothing
you've ever done before

00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:12.280
if you've done that before.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.710
Does this look
like-- this doesn't

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.300
look like any pastry, doesn't
look like a tart pastry.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.790
That's the beginning of it, OK.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.100
So let's just get
it off my hands.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:34.610
So obviously we can't roll this
out and fit it into the pan.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.950
So usually we call
this a press-in crust,

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.020
but this is really actually
more of a smear-in crust, right?

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.960
You can see that.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.780
It's very good to be
able to demonstrate this

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.070
because sometimes-- for
somebody who's used to baking,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.760
to describe this is harder
than-- once you see it,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.790
you get it completely.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.550
So you do with your
hands whatever it

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.300
takes to get this spread out.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.700
And it looks like not
enough crust, right?

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.880
It looks like not enough, but
it is exactly the right amount.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.290
So you aren't going to
have any extra trimmings

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.310
or anything like that.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.080
Your job is to get
this pressed everywhere

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.000
in here and up the
sides as evenly

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.740
as possible-- and with whatever
it takes to do that job.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.160
I kind of challenge
myself when I

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.050
make this to do this as
perfectly and evenly as

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.700
possible.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.220
Because as I said, when you're
working with whole grains

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.310
you want whatever
pastry or cookie

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.030
or whatever you're making
to be fully-toasted.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.330
And if the crust is
uneven, the thin places

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.340
are going to get
over-baked before I get

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.080
that full toasting on the rest.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.810
So like I said, I make
it sort of a project

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.560
to get this as smooth
and even as possible.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.290
And one trick is to realize
that a lot of the extra dough

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.480
tends to hide in the corners.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.700
So if you think you
don't have enough dough,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.730
push your fingers in
the corner and you're

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.810
going to find a whole lot more.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.625
And when you've got too much
on one side, put it elsewhere.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.770
The real truth is I shorted
the butter on this because we

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.290
didn't have it, so now I've
got that bigger challenge

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.740
of making a teeny bit less
of this go a little further.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.210
But it's still
going to go there.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.920
And the other thing
I want here is

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.000
to make sure that this
upper-top edge is squared off.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.350
I don't want it tapering
up against the pan side,

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.100
because that's going to burn
before everything gets baked.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.600
So if you liked playing with
clay or Play-Doh as a kid,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.430
this is your thing.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.950
I mean, there are
other pressing crusts

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.000
that are thicker
and more forgiving,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.090
and you can just-- This one
is a little bit more finicky

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.960
than that.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.390
So just when you think you can't
possibly make this any better,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.960
there is a great trick.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.820
We're making it
close to perfect,

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.210
and I'll get to
that in a second.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.810
OK, so here's the
rest of the procedure.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.310
So this is not to wrap it up,
this is to kind of line it.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.450
So I'm going to press
it across the bottom

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:28.770
and into those
corners, and then I'm

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.824
going to finish smoothing this
by tearing off a piece of paper

00:08:32.824 --> 00:08:34.490
towel-- and finding
something that's got

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.289
a nice square edge like this.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.100
And I'm just going to use it
to press into the corners,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.450
smooth out the bottom, and
this gets into the corners

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.630
so I'm not going to have a
big, chunky, inelegant corner.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:56.340
And why do I have the
paper towel in here?

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.414
Anybody?

00:08:57.414 --> 00:08:59.152
AUDIENCE: The plastic is sticky.

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:01.610
ALICE MEDRICH: The plastic is
sticky, you can't slide this.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.480
So this can make
even what started out

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:15.160
to be a pretty rough, pretty
smooth and pretty even.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.870
And you can go back
and fix up this edge.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.480
This type of crust,
this type of dough,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.450
and many of these whole
grain doughs benefit

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.320
from at least a couple
hours of rest if possible,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.880
or an overnight rest.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.720
So now you've got not only a
pretty perfectly even crust,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.166
but it's all wrapped
for the fridge, OK?

00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:39.940
AUDIENCE: Are we
supposed to hydrate it?

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.523
ALICE MEDRICH: And
to hydrate it, yes.

00:09:41.523 --> 00:09:43.510
That rest also-- thank
you-- hydrates it.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.280
Which is good, because when
especially the whole grains get

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.584
hydrated, then they bake better.

00:09:49.584 --> 00:09:51.000
They bake more
fully and you don't

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.310
get that sort of gritty,
tongue-biting effect

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.559
that you get from an
undercooked whole grain.

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:58.600
And you may not even know
what I'm talking about,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.683
but if you've experimented
with this kind of stuff

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:05.610
you've probably made a lot of
tongue-biting, gritty things.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.110
This will not be that.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.450
You can bake this right away
or you can refrigerate it.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.995
We happen to have
baked one, so I'm

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:13.620
going to show you
what that looks like.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.020
This can just go away.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.900
But anyway, I've gone for
really into the corners,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.000
straight up the sides,
and squared off.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.950
And whatever it
takes to do that,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.770
I spent the time to do it.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.330
So either give it
a rest or bake it.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.107
So it goes into the oven at 325.

00:10:35.107 --> 00:10:36.690
For those of you who
bake, that sounds

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.840
really low for a tart pastry.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.300
These whole grain and other
grain tart pastries and cookies

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.550
tend to like to bake
longer and slower.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.320
It gives it more time in the
oven to get fully baked, get

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.300
that hydrated dough
fully-baked at a lower

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.340
temperature for longer.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.710
I tried when I did
these recipes-- I tried

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:59.140
350, 375, 325, and I compared.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.760
I'm not a scientist,
but I do know

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.050
that if you do something long
enough-- if a monkey types long

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.540
enough, a sentence might appear.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.940
So anyway this is baked,
it goes in the oven

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.840
for about 15 minutes,
and sometimes

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.630
it poofs up a little bit.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.180
At about the 15-minute mark
you can either press it down

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.650
with the back of a fork, and if
it's lost a little bit of shape

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.880
you can actually
cheat and take the cup

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.220
that you used to shape it
and just kind of press it

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.700
in the corners to
reestablish shape.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.640
And so when it's
fully baked, it should

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.700
have some really nice color.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.650
A pale pastry
doesn't have flavor,

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.900
and especially when we're
talking about a whole grain.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:36.940
You want color.

00:11:39.584 --> 00:11:41.000
This probably
took-- I don't know,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.160
the recipe says 25, 35,
40-- whatever it says.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.710
Then it comes out and
I painted it already

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.560
with a little bit of
egg yolk and salt.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.460
I painted it, put it back
in the oven for 2 minutes,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.710
and the purpose of
that is just to seal it

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.540
because we're going to put
a wet filling in there.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:04.850
And also notice that this
is a pre-baked shell,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.230
but it's not partially-baked.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.063
Even though we're putting
a filling in there

00:12:08.063 --> 00:12:10.630
and it's going to go back in
the oven for 15 or 20 minutes,

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:12.300
it's not going to get
any further baked.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.540
So don't think you're
trying to partially bake.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.330
That's a big, big
fault in baking--

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.247
the idea of partially-baked
shells is usually wrong.

00:12:19.247 --> 00:12:21.580
You need to fully bake even
if it's going to go back in,

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.380
because the filling will
prevent it from further baking.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.046
So filling-- I
love this filling.

00:12:28.046 --> 00:12:29.670
I've done this filling
with sour cream,

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.200
I've done it with yogurt--
which we're doing today.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.150
This is like a yogurt custard.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:39.190
It eats and feels like really
light, smooth cheesecake,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.520
only with a tang and
less fat and really

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:45.840
a beautiful suave
kind of texture.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:13:00.190
And it starts with 3
eggs, and into that

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.046
goes a little sugar,
salt, and vanilla.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.082
OK, a weird and interesting
fact-- and I thought about this

00:13:12.082 --> 00:13:14.540
before I came here because I
thought, one of those Googlers

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.839
is going to ask
me why this is so,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.630
and I'm not sure I can
answer the question.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.310
But in this recipe,
the smoothest filling

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.630
is going to be
gotten by whisking

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.599
the yogurt into the eggs,
not the eggs into the yogurt.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.890
And it has something to do
with the way things emulsify

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.980
and which particular
type of emulsion this is.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.229
And I don't think I can go
further in the conversation

00:13:35.229 --> 00:13:37.010
than that, it's not my area.

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.040
But anyway, I do know
for a fact that it's

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.816
one into the other instead
of the other into one.

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:45.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.200
ALICE MEDRICH: I'm
trying to remember

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.106
what this recipe called for.

00:13:51.106 --> 00:13:57.600
It's over there if you want to
look, the recipe is specific.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.400
But it's plain
unsweetened yogurt,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.230
and I'm sure that
I've done it with--

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:02.602
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:03.810
ALICE MEDRICH: This is Greek?

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.843
Is that what the
recipe calls for?

00:14:05.843 --> 00:14:06.567
Good.

00:14:06.567 --> 00:14:08.900
That's what the recipe calls
for, that's what we've got.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.790
OK, so plain Greek yogurt.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.797
And I do go for
pretty pure yogurt,

00:14:14.797 --> 00:14:16.130
I don't like a lot of additives.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:21.270
I just like the cultured stuff--
just the culturing stuff,

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.530
I don't like any
gelatin in there.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.240
So let's get all of--

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.254
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:28.670
ALICE MEDRICH: I
was about to say,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.790
I think I've done this with all
levels and it's probably fine.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.580
It's not like a little
more-- you know,

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:41.040
the difference between full-fat
yogurt and low-fat yogurt

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.640
is very little.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:43.670
And eggs are rich.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.400
I just don't think
that fat is going

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.776
to make a structural problem,
meaning the recipe won't work.

00:14:49.776 --> 00:14:51.466
It may taste a
little differently.

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:52.965
When you lower the
fat a little, you

00:14:52.965 --> 00:14:55.131
get a little more tanginess--
which I actually don't

00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:58.520
mind in a recipe like this.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.400
So anyway, this is
really nice and smooth.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.090
And normally you'd
mix this together

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:05.750
while the tart's
baking and let it sit.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.580
The tart comes out of
the oven, it's hot,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.687
you brush on the egg
wash, it goes back

00:15:10.687 --> 00:15:12.270
into the oven for 2
minutes, remember?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:17.030
And it's still hot--
pretend it's still hot.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.820
I should use the gloves, right?

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.000
And then this sort of
beautiful ivory-colored yogurt

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.740
custard gets poured on
there, and it goes back.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:35.244
In the meantime, you will have
turned the oven down to 300.

00:15:35.244 --> 00:15:37.160
And you're just going
to let this custard cook

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:43.530
at this really low temperature,
300 degrees, until--

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.820
and I actually am going
to put it in the oven--

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.240
until when you shake it
in the pan like this,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.740
it jiggles like Jello.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:54.290
But not stiff Jello,
kind of lazy Jello,

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:59.560
like it's starting to set
but it's not rigid yet.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.740
And that makes the
difference between something

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:06.560
quite gorgeous and wonderful
to eat and something less so.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.090
I am going to stick
this into the oven.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.740
And if this tart were
hot as it should be,

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.330
the time it takes in the
oven is somewhere between-- I

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.720
don't know-- 10, 15, 20.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.810
It kind of depends on
your oven, and you're

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.101
going to be looking at it
every now and then, giving it

00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:36.230
a little nudge to
see how it quivers.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.200
So I was going to ask if
there's questions about that.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.850
Were there questions about
that or should we save them?

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:43.760
Should I go on?

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.480
I'll go on.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.780
So the next recipe
that I wanted to do

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.740
is this little
gingerbread, which

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.770
is made with the
Cuisinart food processor.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.690
I love gingerbread, I
also like buckwheat flour.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.750
This flour here is going to be
buckwheat flour and brown rice

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.500
flour.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.000
So it's totally whole
grain, except for the fact

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.220
that-- I'm going
to let you do this

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.400
because I'm fumbling with this.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.500
Totally whole grain
except for the fact

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.980
that buckwheat
isn't a true grain,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.692
it's called a pseudo-cereal.

00:17:18.692 --> 00:17:20.650
It acts like a grain and
it looks like a grain,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.220
but it's actually neither
a grain nor a grass.

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.890
But anyway, we're going to
treat it like a grain here.

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:31.350
And we're going to start
out with the brown rice.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.750
And again, we're going to
give that little pre-mix thing

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.664
so everything gets put together.

00:17:36.664 --> 00:17:38.330
Although since it
goes in the processor,

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.690
I wonder why we're doing that.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:50.340
Brown rice, salt, a little
baking soda, powdered ginger,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.155
and all spice and cinnamon.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.470
And a tiny bit of xanthan gum.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.070
Who's worked with xanthan gun?

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.860
OK, a tiny bit.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.990
Because there's no
wheat, there's no gluten,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:09.020
there's no structure-producing
proteins in this cake,

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.480
we're using a little xanthan.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.110
It makes things a little sticky,
it makes them hold together,

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.780
it's going to give
you a cakier texture,

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.710
it keeps things
from falling apart.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:21.160
And it gets used in a lot
of gluten-free baking.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.310
In this book, I
made a big effort

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.470
to find all the ways I could
do a lot of recipes without it.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:29.900
Some people don't
like to use it.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:34.660
I think eating too much of it
is not necessarily a good idea--

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.030
not because it can harm
you, but because it's

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.270
sort of like cement.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.930
It pulls things together, and a
lot of the gluten-free recipes

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.330
out there use so much
of it that you end up

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.590
with this sort of
cement lump in here.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:51.010
So in the experimentation
for this book, any time

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.500
we needed to use
xanthan gum, we kept

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.400
decreasing the amount
to see at what level

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.160
we were getting the
effect we wanted.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.580
And if we lost that effect,
we'd increase a little bit.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.420
So we cut this way, way down to
about a quarter of a teaspoon.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.170
And sometimes then we
just took it all out

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.753
to make sure that
we really needed it.

00:19:09.753 --> 00:19:10.630
In this case, we did.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.510
So there's just a little
bit of it in there.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.070
In addition to the powdered
ginger, I've got fresh ginger.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.290
And if you've not worked
with fresh ginger before,

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.020
it smells wonderful and
pungent and fantastic.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.600
And it's easiest to
peel with a rounded

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.850
spoon, the edge of a spoon.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.790
Or you can use a
vegetable peeler.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.340
We're just going to
use 30 grams of this,

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.811
so I might throw
it on the scale.

00:19:37.811 --> 00:19:40.060
I gave an elaborate way to
measure it without a scale.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.570
This book has measurements
all in volume and grams.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.470
I think it's a
good thing to use.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.370
If you've got grams
or ounces, do that

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:55.412
and use that instead
of the volume--

00:19:55.412 --> 00:19:57.870
especially with dry ingredients
and especially with flours.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.130
Every time you touch flour--
every time you move it

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.310
from one container to
the next, every time

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.110
you pour it, every
time you touch it-- you

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.320
change how much of
it fits in a cup.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.877
So there's no way to know how
much you are putting in a cup

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:11.710
compared to how much
you're putting in a cup

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.600
or you're putting in a cup.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.790
Because first of all, everybody
packs the cup differently

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.706
and everybody's handled
the flour differently.

00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:19.250
So if we're all working with
the same ounces or grams,

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.280
at least that removes one of the
variables that can make things

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.220
go wrong.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.300
So when you're working
with fresh ginger--

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.980
even though I'm
going to puree it--

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.170
I want to reduce the
amount of stringiness.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.980
So the fibers are
running this way,

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.680
so I'm going to cut
it in thin pieces

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.510
to cut across those
stringing grains.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.210
This is for any time
you're going to be chopping

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.030
or pureeing or what have you.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:47.050
So we're doing-- let's see, on.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.840
I had a whole
tutorial-- now it's off.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.220
OK.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.060
It's teared, OK, good enough.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:09.710
OK, so we're going for 30--
it's changing a lot here.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.790
That's it, that's it.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.700
All right.

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:23.780
So the food processor, the
ginger with the brown sugar,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.880
and if we leave that
on for a few seconds

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.130
it's going to turn into puree.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.780
So even if you're doing a
dish that gets chopped ginger,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.202
if you slice across the
grain first before you

00:21:37.202 --> 00:21:39.410
chop you're going to reduce
the amount of stringiness

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.650
that you get in there.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.974
Good little tip.

00:21:42.974 --> 00:21:44.890
When you're doing savory
cooking, some of that

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:45.650
doesn't matter.

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.816
You're just cutting a coin
and putting it in the wok

00:21:47.816 --> 00:21:49.110
or whatever and getting flavor.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:50.930
The same is true
about a peeling.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.540
A lot of savory cooks--
especially Asian chefs--

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.462
won't peel ginger.

00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:57.170
Other people do, some
people don't, but I

00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:58.700
think for something
like dessert I

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.600
don't want the peels in there.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.520
So here's the puree.

00:22:10.472 --> 00:22:20.810
I'm going to melt some butter--
forgot that here, there's

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:23.970
a little bit of melted butter.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.990
Pan preparation is important,
and different recipes

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:32.110
seem to require a different
kind of pan preparation.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.770
Sometimes it's
grease, sometimes it's

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.150
grease and flour-- it all
depends on what kind of surface

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:38.737
you want or how that
particular batter releases

00:22:38.737 --> 00:22:39.820
from the side of the cake.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.140
So I'm not a one-prep-suits-all
recipe person.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.390
Every one of my cakes has a
different pan preparation.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.527
I sometimes have to look
at the recipe myself

00:22:48.527 --> 00:22:50.860
to get reminded what I've
chosen because there's usually

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.250
a good reason for it.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.040
No matter what I
do, however, there's

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.500
always a circle of parchment
paper on the bottom.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.950
That ensures that no
matter what, this cake

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.500
is coming out of the pan
because you can always

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.126
release the sides.

00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:06.632
And if you can release the
sides and flip it out--

00:23:06.632 --> 00:23:08.090
because if the
sides are stick, you

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.139
can always run a spatula
around that no problem,

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.930
but you can't do anything
about the bottom.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.390
But if you've got
paper there, you always

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.970
have a way to get the cake out.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.590
Some chefs and cooking
teachers will grease the pan,

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:24.030
put in the parchment, and
then grease the parchment.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:24.960
Really?

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.470
That, to me, just is overkill.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:30.020
I just put the paper in there,
put the cake batter in there,

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.660
when the cake comes out the
paper's attached to the cake,

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.760
I peel it off the cake.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:39.400
That saves me a whole
lot of fooling around.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.540
OK, we do have hot butter now.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.970
So the pre-mixed flour is
going into the puree here.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:55.320
This was the brown rice flour
with the salt and leavening

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.857
and spices.

00:23:57.857 --> 00:23:59.940
AUDIENCE: So where do you
source your flours from?

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.910
ALICE MEDRICH: I buy
some from Bob's Red Mill.

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.120
I like also Authentic Foods,
which I have to get online.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.970
The reason I like Authentic
Foods is because the flours

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.270
that they make, they're finer.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.890
They make brown rice, white
rice, sorghum, and corn.

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.400
And they're just a
little bit finer,

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.140
so it gives you some
more opportunities

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.530
to get really refined textures
even out of whole grains.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.340
And that's-- I think-- really
part of the fun of doing

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.050
something in a desert with
whole grains where people

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:30.420
don't expect them.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.780
And having them turn out
refined and elegant as opposed

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.250
to hippie rustic-- which
I also like, but OK.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:57.590
So the molasses goes
in here, and the egg,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.850
and the butter-- which I hope
is not too hot to cook the egg,

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.510
so I'll pour it over here.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:07.880
Warm butter was called
for, but this'll be fine.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.517
Now maybe you're wondering
why this rest of this flour

00:25:11.517 --> 00:25:12.350
isn't going in here.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.683
There's a weird tricky thing
going on with this recipe--

00:25:14.683 --> 00:25:16.120
easy to mix.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:17.940
Because of the
xanthan gum, I'm going

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:22.760
to just blend this-- when I
find the top-- about 15 seconds.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.780
If I over-blend
it, at some point

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:26.650
that gum is going
to lose its hold.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.620
And I'm not actually sure
how many seconds out that is.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.270
So when I say mix for 20
seconds or 15 seconds,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.940
I kind of want you
to watch the clock.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.510
Can somebody do that?

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.380
Oh, we've got that
many millisecond, huh?

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.010
That's slow.

00:25:50.776 --> 00:25:52.730
Done?

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.730
So then the other
tricky part of this--

00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:57.280
there's the xanthan which
I don't want to over-mix,

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.380
and then there's the
buckwheat flour which

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.700
has a really weird property.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.870
If you mix it-- even
in a pan or even

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:07.480
if you're cooking it as porridge
and you mix it too much--

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.860
it goes to complete
mush, like cement.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.720
Anybody done that?

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.530
Yeah?

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.530
So I don't want that in there
the whole for 15 seconds,

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.590
I want it in at the very end.

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.280
And it goes in with a little
bit of hot water, which

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:25.200
I'm going to measure in this
wonderful little pre-measured

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:30.460
thing that we marked.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:32.215
So hot water from
the tap is fine.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.966
And it's a half a cup.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.300
We didn't have a
little cup measure,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.160
so we marked off a thing.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.940
So hot water and the
buckwheat, and I'm

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.880
just going to give it
like five seconds just

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:56.110
to blend it in there.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:05.680
Like I said, quirky
little procedures

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:11.170
for some of this, using some
of these different flours.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.900
So it's a very liquid batter,
I've made muffins and cupcakes

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:16.710
out of it.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.300
The pan called for in the
recipe is 8-inch and this is 9.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.400
Normally I'm a stickler
for the right size pan,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.820
but this just means that it's
going to bake in less time,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.320
right?

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.240
It's thinner, it's going
to bake in less time.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.170
So the buckwheat turned out to
be one of the most interesting

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:48.590
of all of the not-grains
that I worked with.

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.775
I worked with a co-author
who lives in Portland,

00:27:51.775 --> 00:27:53.510
and you might
wonder how you could

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:57.000
do a collaboration like this
with somebody so far away.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.140
We had worked together for many
years, she knows my palate,

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.880
I know her palate,
and we suddenly

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.400
discovered-- this
goes in the oven,

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.150
and that's all there
is to it, really.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.080
We suddenly discovered
at a certain point

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.121
when I was in a jam
with a book deadline--

00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:10.620
and I thought since
she'd moved away

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.911
we could never work again--
I called her up and I said,

00:28:12.911 --> 00:28:15.450
I'm in deep doo-doo,
what are you doing?

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.790
She said, not so much right now.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.940
I said, could you try
this and this, and what

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.939
do you think about this?

00:28:19.939 --> 00:28:21.989
And we found out that
we could work together

00:28:21.989 --> 00:28:23.030
after all of those years.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.320
So when this book came
along, I knew that we

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.080
could do this at long distance.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.870
Because we think
alike and differently.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.380
There's a great
overlap and yet we

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.390
have some of the same
problem-solving skills.

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.920
So we're working on buckwheat,
which we both like a lot.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.120
And she's doing a whole
one set of recipes,

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.086
and I'm doing another,
but all with buckwheat.

00:28:44.086 --> 00:28:45.710
We're exploring
buckwheat, we're trying

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.310
to figure out what buckwheat
will do and how it tastes

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.680
and what the texture is.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.770
And I call her up one day-- we
have these long, long check-in

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.600
collaboration
meetings on the phone.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.230
I call her up one day
and I say, oh my God, I'm

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:03.410
getting these beautiful,
floral, fragrant, light flavors

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:04.619
and textures unlike anything.

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:06.493
I mean, if you've eaten
buckwheat before it's

00:29:06.493 --> 00:29:07.380
pretty earthy, right?

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.450
It's kasha, it's soba, it's
not gentle and it's not floral.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.052
So I said I'm so excited about
all these flavors and textures.

00:29:16.052 --> 00:29:18.260
She said well, that's good
because I'm getting cement

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.740
here.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.260
And we're talking about
this, she's getting cement,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.060
nothing is tasting good, and
we talk and talk and talk.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.210
And then we go away,
we get off the phone,

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.030
we haven't solved
anything, and she

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.240
decides that it's the
fineness of the flour that's

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.781
causing a problem and giving
her these mushy, cement-like

00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:37.280
textures.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.130
So she goes off and buys some
buckwheat in the bulk bin,

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.860
and grinds it up
to a course meal,

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.430
and makes her cake
all over again.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:45.986
And it is suddenly fantastic.

00:29:45.986 --> 00:29:47.860
I, in the meantime, am
thinking more and more

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.800
about what's happening
to her and why

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.280
it isn't happening to me.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:56.670
And I re-stumble on information
that when you stir buckwheat

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.170
too much, you get mush.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:00.000
And I realize the
cake she's working on

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.470
takes a lot of beating,
it's just that kind of case.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.300
It's like a butter
cake, lots of beating.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.070
The cakes I'm working on are
sponge cakes-- gentle folding.

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.950
So of course she's
getting mush and I'm

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:14.790
getting-- because she's
activating the mush factor.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.480
But in the meantime, we both
came to different solutions

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.350
to the same problem.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.470
It made that chapter one of the
most interesting in the book

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.430
because there's a lot
of different textures

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.800
and different kinds of
recipes using buckwheat.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.840
Because of that whole problem
solving-- the way in which

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.550
we're both the
same and different.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.310
It was really one of the
best parts of collaborating.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:42.670
I have done what
I came here to do.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.740
At least in terms
of baking, are there

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.339
questions or
comments or anywhere

00:30:46.339 --> 00:30:47.380
you want to go with this?

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.057
Yes?

00:30:48.057 --> 00:30:50.390
AUDIENCE: How long do these
flours last in the cupboard?

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:50.850
ALICE MEDRICH: Oh yeah.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.330
A lot of them are
whole grain, so you

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.413
would treat them like you
would treat whole wheat.

00:30:54.413 --> 00:30:57.400
And if you use
them all the time,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.900
don't buy more than you can use
in a certain amount of time.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.790
I look at the sell-by
dates, because nobody

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:06.300
can sell a flour that's going
to go bad the next-- you know,

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.930
you've got two or three or four
months after the sell-by date

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.350
if it's packaged.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:17.800
Longer if it's in the fridge or
in the freezer-- I do sort of

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.050
address this in the book, too.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.090
People are always asking this,
and it's kind of a best guess.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.590
I mean, you should learn
to sniff the flours

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.250
when you open a bag.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.710
Especially when
it's fresh, it gets

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.230
you used to what fresh flour
smells like-- so that when

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.792
it goes rancid, you'll know.

00:31:32.792 --> 00:31:34.500
But yeah, you have
longer than you think.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.720
And if you're using
something that you're not

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.200
using very often,
maybe the freezer

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.170
is the best place to put that.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.140
One of the things that's
fun about this book

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.660
is you don't have
to go out and buy

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.050
all these flours to begin with.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:46.850
You can start out
with-- like if you're

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.800
interested in the buckwheat,
get the buckwheat flour

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.830
and get some rice flour,
and you can practically

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.840
do everything in that
chapter with either buckwheat

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.050
alone or buckwheat and rice.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.670
There's a couple of
dog legs from there,

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.260
but you can explore
them flour by flour.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.512
Somebody else?

00:32:02.512 --> 00:32:03.720
AUDIENCE: I have a quick one.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.600
ALICE MEDRICH: Yeah?

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.225
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned a lot
that the buckwheat gets really

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:09.162
concrete and terrible,
and honestly I'm

00:32:09.162 --> 00:32:11.690
intrigued why that might be?

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.532
And I know you hate
those why questions--

00:32:13.532 --> 00:32:14.990
ALICE MEDRICH: No,
I love the whys.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.845
I love the whys when they're
something I can answer.

00:32:17.845 --> 00:32:18.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.110
ALICE MEDRICH: I
don't actually know.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.620
We sort of went right
into problem-solving mode

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.240
and didn't stop and say
well, why is that happening?

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:26.806
I don't know.

00:32:26.806 --> 00:32:28.180
But if anybody
ever makes kasha--

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.250
does anybody make kasha?

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.380
Did anybody grow up with kasha?

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.530
A beloved and detested
Jewish-Russian

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.320
dish that some of us grew
up with and some of us liked

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.291
and some of us did not.

00:32:40.291 --> 00:32:42.290
There's a step in there
where you take the grain

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.090
and you toast it in the
pan coated with some egg,

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.848
and then you steam it like rice.

00:32:47.848 --> 00:32:49.223
And I think that
coating with egg

00:32:49.223 --> 00:32:54.240
helps to prevent those little
particles from becoming mushy.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.620
But the last time
I saw that made

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.990
was so long ago-- when
I was probably a kid--

00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:59.660
and I don't remember that.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.390
So I never researched
that mushy thing.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.390
AUDIENCE: And does it do
anything to the flavor?

00:33:05.885 --> 00:33:06.760
ALICE MEDRICH: Which?

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:07.531
What?

00:33:07.531 --> 00:33:09.280
AUDIENCE: The over-stirring
the buckwheat.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.863
ALICE MEDRICH: Well,
you know, if it's

00:33:10.863 --> 00:33:13.211
going to take-- I'm a big
believer that texture affects

00:33:13.211 --> 00:33:13.710
flavor.

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.126
Because if you're
eating something

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:18.940
that feels like cement in your
mouth, you're not likely--

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:24.050
Does it do something to flavor?

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.960
Maybe not necessarily.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.690
Although in the case of what
she made, it certainly did.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.510
Because those lovely
floral fragrant

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.520
flavors didn't come out until
she had something light.

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.714
So perhaps, yes.

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:38.880
AUDIENCE: Could you speak
to some of the nutritional

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.846
differences between these whole
grains and whole wheat flour?

00:33:45.841 --> 00:33:47.340
ALICE MEDRICH: I
can say in general,

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.230
the reason we like
whole grains is

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.790
that there's some nutritional
value in there, right?

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.380
There's the heart-healthy
aspect of it--

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.002
it's good for cholesterol, it's
got fiber, it's got protein.

00:33:58.002 --> 00:34:00.210
And in general when we're
talking about whole grains,

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:02.890
we're comparing them
with refined grains

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:05.850
where they've taken away
the fiber coating, the--

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:06.420
what is it?

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:12.429
The bran and the germ which
has got the protein in it.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.590
So specifically
compared to whole wheat,

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.550
I'd have to look it up.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.860
And you can probably look
those things up flour by flour,

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.540
and they probably all
differ a little bit.

00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:26.745
Yeah, I don't know if that
got close to an answer, but--

00:34:26.745 --> 00:34:28.790
AUDIENCE: More
benefits [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.270
ALICE MEDRICH: More
benefits, yeah.

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.710
And my goal here was not
to make healthy food,

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.520
my goal was to--
because I'm a chef,

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.659
I'm all about the delicious.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.760
And I also like the
unexpected, and I'm

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.880
sort of open to different
flavors and textures.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:50.086
And I love the flavor of whole
grains-- in cereals, in breads,

00:34:50.086 --> 00:34:52.210
and all of those things--
and it's intriguing to me

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:56.094
to bring it into the world of
pastry because it's unexpected.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.760
And it's not that I'm
trying to hide it,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.490
it's not the stealth
thing where I'm

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.760
trying to trick the kids
into eating their peas.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:06.870
It's just because that's
my sort of creative drive,

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:10.020
to make something delicious
in an unexpected way.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.490
AUDIENCE: You mentioned in
the book chestnut flour--

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.530
sourcing it and being able to
find a source that does not

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.280
have a smoky quality to it.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.820
What causes the smoky
quality, is it like rice?

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.810
ALICE MEDRICH: They roast or
dry them over some form of fire

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:24.810
that's got smoke.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.540
And it may even be
something that's

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.920
liked in Italy, because
I think the Italians tend

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.530
to have a bit of that
smoke-- but not all of them.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.840
I just don't find that
delicious for all the desert

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.890
things that I made.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:39.120
And I did find an American
source-- two of them, actually.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.910
One of them-- especially
good-- Allen Creek Farms,

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.670
that you can buy online some
chestnut flour from in season.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.990
And it's only sort of seasonal.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:48.799
Yeah, another?

00:35:48.799 --> 00:35:49.340
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.090
ALICE MEDRICH: Hi.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.500
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you have a favorite flour?

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.460
ALICE MEDRICH: I
love the buckwheat.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.200
And by the way, this
gingerbread is more

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.810
on the sort of robust
and earthy flavor side,

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:04.754
not on the fragrant,
floral side.

00:36:04.754 --> 00:36:07.170
I love the buckwheat for all
the different things it does.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:09.330
I'm crazy about corn flour.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.560
I mean, everybody knows
what cornbread is,

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.380
but as soon as you have flour
that's finer than cornmeal

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.965
you can make a chiffon
cake out of it that

00:36:16.965 --> 00:36:20.460
is golden and beautiful,
and really quite delicious.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.220
So I love the corn.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.060
And the oats, to me,
taste a little bit

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:29.544
like-- have a
caramely note to it.

00:36:29.544 --> 00:36:31.210
AUDIENCE: So I have
a follow-up to that,

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:32.834
which is were there
any flours that you

00:36:32.834 --> 00:36:35.999
tried that were just completely
unsuitable for baking?

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:38.040
ALICE MEDRICH: No, we kind
of honed on these ones

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.581
pretty quickly,
because between us we

00:36:39.581 --> 00:36:41.180
kind of knew what we liked.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.510
I like the flavor
of millet flour--

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:47.144
and I would use that next,
if there's any follow-up.

00:36:47.144 --> 00:36:49.560
I love the flavor of millet,
but every now and then millet

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.330
gets really bitter in my mouth,
and I never did solve that.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.357
And we quickly moved
onto some other flours

00:36:55.357 --> 00:36:56.940
that we agreed we
wanted to work with,

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.400
so poor millet got left behind.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.220
Yes?

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:01.780
AUDIENCE: So is
there any benefit

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.590
in milling your own grains
as opposed to buying flour?

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.410
ALICE MEDRICH:
People say-- and I'm

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:09.890
sure that this is true--
that if you mill your own,

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.490
you get this amazing,
amazing flour.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.230
I know that bread
bakers believe that,

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:16.290
and I'm sure that it's true.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:22.800
And it would be probably true
for what I've done here, too.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.220
Because the agenda in
this book was so big,

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.640
we decided not to just go
over there and do that, too.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.670
But I started to
experiment a little bit

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.530
with that after I
published the book,

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:34.840
to see what the
great fuss was about.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.770
And I found that no
matter what I did,

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:40.230
I couldn't get flours as fine
as the commercially-milled ones.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.810
And it's not that I want
everything to be really fine

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:44.560
and fluffy-- you'll
see that these are not

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.020
particularly fine and fluffy.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.860
But I really value having
some of these grains

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:50.520
in a really fine flour form.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.830
So I didn't follow-up
too, too much.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.520
Has anybody milled their own?

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.610
AUDIENCE: I've been trying some
things inspired by your book

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:58.120
actually--

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.161
ALICE MEDRICH: Thank you.

00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:01.750
AUDIENCE: --on trying
different grains

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.460
and going through a bunch
of them, but some of it's

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:06.247
been to experiment
with mochi making.

00:38:06.247 --> 00:38:07.580
ALICE MEDRICH: With what making?

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.800
AUDIENCE: Mochi making.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.634
ALICE MEDRICH: Yeah.

00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:12.091
AUDIENCE: --and just trying to
find some balance with that.

00:38:12.091 --> 00:38:14.090
But in general, I just
kind of like the idea

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.700
of being able to try textures.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.570
I knew that I probably wouldn't
be able to get it as fine,

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.070
but--

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:19.840
ALICE MEDRICH: I
mean, sometimes you

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.630
want a coarser texture, right?

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.299
I mean, the buckwheat thing that
she did was good proof of that.

00:38:24.299 --> 00:38:25.840
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering if you

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.130
could go through one of
the creative processes

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.240
of your recipes--
maybe a favorite one?

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:32.032
I'm curious of how
these things come about.

00:38:32.032 --> 00:38:33.948
ALICE MEDRICH: So when
I started this project,

00:38:33.948 --> 00:38:35.930
I actually knew very
little about these flours.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.719
I had done a few little
things with these flours

00:38:39.719 --> 00:38:41.260
in conjunction with
wheat, and I knew

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:42.970
I was interested in
the flavor because I

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.780
knew that they were
enhancing to the things

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.000
that I did with wheat.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.963
And I really hadn't done much
without any wheat at all.

00:38:48.963 --> 00:38:51.780
So I was starting with that
blank slate kind of thing,

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.280
with this great
idea and I thought

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.190
there might be a book in this.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:59.110
And I also knew that there was
a great advantage to coming

00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:02.440
at something without having
been fully-steeped in it,

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.440
educated in it, trained
in it-- because then you

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.140
get trained in the way.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:09.320
And I knew I didn't want to do
it the way that it was being

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.400
done, because I hadn't tasted
anything very tasty the way

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.670
it had been done.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.860
So it was a blank slate.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.874
And the first thing
I thought of was how

00:39:16.874 --> 00:39:18.040
am I going to get structure?

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.660
Do we always have
to use xanthan gum?

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:25.169
And I thought, I wonder if a
recipe that's heavy in eggs

00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:26.710
and that gets its
structure from eggs

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.850
anyway might work with these
flours without any gum?

00:39:29.850 --> 00:39:32.350
And so I had the most
amazing beginner's luck.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.260
A few weeks before, a freelance
writer from "The Wall Street

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.350
Journal" called up and
she said, can I come?

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:42.510
I'm writing a story
about creative process.

00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:44.560
Can I come and follow
you around for a day?

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.060
And I thought, oh my God,
what will I do with this one?

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:52.300
I thought OK, I'll do some of
my experiments for this project.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.589
I'll invite her and
if they work, fine.

00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:56.630
If they don't, it's part
of the creative process.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.760
So she comes over,
and my idea is

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.600
to take a really basic,
easy French sponge

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.040
cake-- five ingredients, I could
do it in my sleep really fast--

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.950
and test the idea of
whether a sponge cake that

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.700
gets its structure
from egg could

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.020
work with all of these flours.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.500
And in front of her-- or
maybe I did some in advance--

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:18.477
but I picked about five flours
and I made this sponge cake,

00:40:18.477 --> 00:40:19.310
and they all worked.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.080
They all worked.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.420
Maybe some of them needed a
little tweak here and there,

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:29.620
but clearly the structure
from the eggs-- and that

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.750
led me to thinking--
it also gave me

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.570
a way to taste these grains
as single grains in each cake.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:38.750
I did blend or anything.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:42.670
And it also led me to think
OK, any time a recipe already

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:46.210
has enough eggs in
it to give structure,

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.290
these grains might work.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:48.290
These flours might work.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.000
So it let me the whole
family of sponge cakes, which

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.900
includes chiffon
cakes-- anything that

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.380
is powered by eggs.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.920
And on Maya's side of the
ledger up there in Portland,

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:01.910
she had been realizing that
recipes that had eggs--

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:06.020
if you start out by
beating them a lot,

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.380
you get more
structure from them.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:10.710
So it was like one
thing led to another.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.700
There were some dead
ends-- and I can't even

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.533
remember what some of
those were right now--

00:41:14.533 --> 00:41:16.730
but there were some
really good lucky breaks.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.271
AUDIENCE: Can you say how much
work's involved in something--

00:41:19.271 --> 00:41:20.770
a book like this?

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.552
ALICE MEDRICH: Never made so
many bad pastries in my life.

00:41:23.552 --> 00:41:24.260
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.870
Do you have assistants or
do you do all the cooking?

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.470
ALICE MEDRICH: No, she
and I did it ourselves.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:28.800
AUDIENCE: That's impressive.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.883
ALICE MEDRICH: You sort
of can't afford assistants

00:41:30.883 --> 00:41:33.621
if you're really
just a book writer.

00:41:33.621 --> 00:41:35.995
If you have a whole day job
and a whole business going on

00:41:35.995 --> 00:41:38.030
on the side, it's
a little different.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:39.922
But even for a Cocolat,
I did it myself.

00:41:39.922 --> 00:41:42.380
I did it myself because it was
meant to be for a home cook,

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.760
and you can't apply what
goes on in a bakery to what

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.392
goes on in a home kitchen.

00:41:48.392 --> 00:41:50.350
JULIE: So thanks everyone
for coming out today.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:53.510
And I want to especially
extend a thank you to Alice

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:55.300
for being here,
sharing her expertise,

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.950
sharing these recipes.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.900
So thank you again.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.750
ALICE MEDRICH: Thank you.
