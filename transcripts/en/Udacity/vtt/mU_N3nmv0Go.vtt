00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.865
Okay. So here's the quiz. Michael is going to answer it, but we

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.920
want to give you a chance to answer it first. I've got these

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.039
two equations of two different hydroplanes,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.610
though they're parallel to one another,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.650
'because they have the same parameters. That is to say, I have two

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.380
equations and two unknowns. I want to subtract them from one another

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.390
and what we want you to do is we want you to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.090
solve for the line that is described by their difference. Do you

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.480
understand that, Michael? Or, have I, have I told them enough, or not?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.700
think I'm just going to subtract the second equation

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.510
from the first equation. It seems pretty straightforward.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.700
&gt;&gt; Okay, it seems reasonable to me. But remember, the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.810
output that I want you to figure out here is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.920
exactly what the distances between those two planes, okay?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.320
That is, between what's represented by X1 and X2, okay? Go.
