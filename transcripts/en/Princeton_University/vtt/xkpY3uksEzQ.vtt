DAN DAY: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.580
Princeton University. My name is Dan day

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.109
I'm the assistant vice president for

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.730
communications here at the University

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.170
and we welcome you to today's

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.420
celebration of a Nobel Prize in Physics

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
by Professor Duncan Haldane, and we are

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.270
delighted to have you here with us today

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.070
and also delighted to have those of you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.109
watching our live stream through the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.150
University website and I believe also on

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.300
Facebook. Before we begin our program I'd

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.010
like to give a few instructions on how

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.260
this news conference and celebration will

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.750
work. We'll start with remarks by the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.010
president of Princeton University,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.230
Chris Eisgruber, and the chair of the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.480
physics department, Lyman Page. After

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.160
that, Professor Haldane

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.350
will speak. When he concludes we will

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.820
open the floor to questions from the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.670
news media. I will call upon each member

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.050
of the media and we'll have a mic

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.670
runner bring a microphone to the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.379
reporter so everyone can hear.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.480
We're also receiving questions remotely

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.190
from the media from those who cannot be

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.140
here and I may relay a few of those

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.320
questions to the professor. Beyond the media

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.820
we have a good number of faculty

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.229
students and staff here in the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.479
auditorium, and depending on the number of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.090
questions from the media we hope and

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.560
expect to leave time for your questions

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.650
as well. And now Ii'm pleased to introduce

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.290
the 20th president of Princeton University

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.659
and a former physics major at this

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.000
University, Christopher Eisgruber. Chris?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.200
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: Thank you Dan.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.039
It's my pleasure to be able to welcome all of you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.439
to this press conference this afternoon.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.270
Joining me here on stage is the chair

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.500
of the physics department, Professor

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.049
Lyman Page, and of course the man of the

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.259
hour, 2016 Nobel laureate in physics

00:01:42.259 --> 00:02:03.090
Professor Duncan Haldane.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.750
Professor Haldane's biography is now

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.149
known to the world so I will recite the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.400
details only briefly so that we can

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.340
spend as much time as possible hearing

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.810
from him.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.030
Duncan Haldane is the Eugene Higgins

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.040
Professor of Physics at Princeton

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.110
University, where he has been a member of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.610
our faculty since 1990. In London Duncan

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.349
studied physics at the University of

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.620
Cambridge, where he received his B.A. with

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.459
first class honours in 1973 and his

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.670
doctorate in 1978, but he told me as we

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.829
were waiting just before this conference

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.360
that he spent the last two years of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.519
those doctoral studies here at Princeton

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.530
with his adviser Philip Anderson,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.690
himself a laureate who is with us here

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.819
in the audience today. From 1977 to 1981

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.940
he was a physicist at the Institut Laue-Langevin

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.329
in Grenoble, France. He then became

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.190
an assistant professor at the University

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.519
of Southern California in 1981, where he

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.500
remained on the faculty until

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.980
1987. Duncan also served as a member of

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.319
the technical staff at ATT Bell

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.650
Laboratories in Murray Hill from 1985 to

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.290
1988 and during that time luckily for us

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.139
once again spent some time at Princeton

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.319
as well. Following his stint as professor at the

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.880
University of California-San Diego,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.579
Duncan joined the faculty at Princeton

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.950
where he has been ever since.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.859
Duncan specializes in the field known

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.959
as condensed matter physics.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.630
His research has focused on the use of

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.540
advanced mathematical methods to study

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.639
unusual states of matter such as

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.239
superconductors, superfluids or thin

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.250
magnetic films.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.959
Despite the fact that as Dan accurately

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.700
said I do have an undergraduate degree

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.500
from this distinguished Department of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.250
Physics,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.980
I am utterly unqualified to explain

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.790
Professor Haldane's work.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.209
I'm going to leave that to him, but I

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.909
will remind you all of what was said in

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.909
this morning's press release. Along with

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.250
David J Thouless of the University of

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.219
Washington in Seattle and J. Michael

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.389
Kosterlitz of Brown University

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.150
co-winners of this year's Nobel Prize in

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.060
Physics Duncan has used topological

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.490
concepts to explain the properties of

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.160
chains of small magnets found in some

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.630
materials

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.520
his work has important implications for

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.110
the understanding of new types of

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.270
materials with the potential to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.400
influence future generations of

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.979
electronics superconductors and quantum

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.949
computers Duncan has been widely

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.660
recognized for his path breaking

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.699
discoveries and condensed matter physics

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.759
he held an Alfred P sloan Foundation

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.820
fellowship from 1984 288 and was awarded

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.770
the Oliver e Buckley condensed matter

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.660
physics prize from the American Physical

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.229
Society in 1993 is a fellow of the

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.150
American Academy of Arts and Sciences

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.800
American Association for the Advancement

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.530
of science the royal society of london

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.449
and the institute of physics in the

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:08.650
united kingdom

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.570
he was also named by the institute for

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.870
scientific information in 2004 as one of

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.599
the 230 most highly cited authors and

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.750
physics as i said i will let professor

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.699
whole day and tell us more about the

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:24.460
scientific details of his work but i did

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.020
want to conclude by adding a personal

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.750
reflection as a former student of

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.570
physics myself at Princeton one of my

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.370
strongest memories of my undergraduate

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.610
years here was the day in 1981 Val bitch

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.760
won the nobel prize in physics it was a

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.470
wonderful moment for the Department for

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.110
the University a celebration of the

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.720
truly groundbreaking work that goes on

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.780
here and as an undergraduate I felt

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.849
privileged simply to have a chance to

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.460
watch the excitement from the sidelines

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.639
when I was up late at night struggling

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.889
through difficult problem sets in fine

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.680
library i would occasionally seek

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.930
inspiration by walking through the halls

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.639
of the physics building in gazing at the

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.310
portraits of the many Nobel laureates

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.289
who had studied in the department or

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.169
served on it

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.840
faculty i am delighted today to see this

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.090
marvelous tradition extended as

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.889
Professor Duncan holding becomes the

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.509
newest addition to this extraordinary

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.029
departments all of Fame

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.490
let me now ask professor page to say a

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:39.180
few words after

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.530
let me now as Professor page to say a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.880
few words and then we'll hear from this

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.210
year

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.430
florian I thank you I'll be I'll be

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.979
brief I look this is this is a very

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:53.850
special award for us in a department of

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.419
unusually creative Peter Duncan stands

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.870
out in the in the broader theoretical

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.419
community a physicist is known for his

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.970
extraordinarily deep insights these are

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.710
quotes from letters I've gotten over the

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.889
years and mathematical elegance and

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.349
personality will see Duncan is

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.370
light-hearted and funny she laughs a lot

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.139
he has an ironic sense of humor

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:21.000
sometimes shares at faculty meetings

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.560
tries hard to feign administrative and

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.340
confidence but in the end he always

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.259
comes through to helping support his

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:34.139
colleagues and friends he's absolutely

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:38.009
wonderful colleague Duncan is a reminder

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:40.500
of the importance of environments and

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.020
communities like Princeton where the

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.610
pursuit of knowledge of the forefront

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.479
science can flourish his exotic ideas

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.570
came from is purely intellectual pursuit

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.419
going back some 30 years and they've

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:56.970
been realized in experiments on matter

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.570
your absolute zero temperature are sense

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.970
and apartment that this is just the

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.150
beginning of a new era my colleagues and

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.370
department and around the world in both

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.070
theory and experiment are pursuing new

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.320
knowledge rooted in in Duncan's

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.720
pioneering research in this field

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.780
broadly condensed matter physics but

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.320
also in evolving to encompass atomic

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.530
physics is vibrant and exciting with

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.380
discoveries reported at Princeton with

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.039
remarkable regularity we all we all look

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:35.279
forward to seeing what this work leads

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.680
to there's more great science to come

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:42.149
and we all are just deaded and so

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:43.860
thankful for all you've done

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.150
thank you

00:08:45.150 --> 00:09:04.510
only 16 Nobel laureate not gonna hold

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.320
you're very gratified to have played a

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.230
part with Michael laureates in coming up

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.480
with new ways of thinking and condensed

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.640
matter physics that you really have

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.710
changed since I was a graduate student

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:22.030
there's a completely new focus on on the

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.640
quantum on quantum mechanics in a way

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.970
that we didn't understand before and I

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.550
would actually also like to say that I

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.560
was really guided in all this by the

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:34.990
tremendous training and mentorship i had

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.090
from my advice Phil Anderson it really

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.880
inspired me even with his undergraduate

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.190
lectures at Cambridge my last year that

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.370
got me so excited about condensed matter

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.860
physics that I had two opportunities

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.350
that Cambridge want to work with phil

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.630
and want to go into string theory which

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.640
was about 10 years before its time

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:59.910
luckily i chose the right

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:04.710
what I say that of course technically

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.990
it's kind of difficult to explain what

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.650
this prices is really for but what it

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.530
really is that before we didn't we

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.720
across New the equations of quantum

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.580
mechanics and we could write down

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.800
shredding equations and solve

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.580
model problems and the but we really

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.380
didn't have a proper appreciation of all

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.850
the kind of things that require

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:29.070
mechanics can do just knowing the

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.320
equations doesn't tell you what what

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.900
potential solutions are those equations

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.780
are and that's really i think the new

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.700
way of looking at things that's been

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.430
that i was privileged to to to

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:44.760
contribute to a David palace also and

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.600
Michael slits was more a classical

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.300
physics but actually the costly Dallas

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.490
ideas were also incredibly influential

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:55.770
in the quantum mechanics of lower

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.810
dimensional system so i worked my way up

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.810
from starting with zero dimensional

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.060
systems with my advisor phil anderson

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.140
and my thesis work then I somehow work

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.430
my way around too one dimensional

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.060
systems chains of atoms or spins in

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.360
which i was fortunate to realize that

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.430
but consider the conventional wisdom

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.830
about how these things behave well

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.050
actually put while plausible with in

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.940
fact completely incorrect we looked at

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.220
in detail and no one it really check the

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.340
details out beforehand and this gave

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.650
rise to some some thing which turns out

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.540
to have been the first of this new class

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.140
of topological topological matter which

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:39.660
is a kind of interesting states of

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.880
matter where the boundaries of this

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.750
matter

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.000
this matter is topologically different

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.480
from regular matter which means it can't

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.700
get continuously changed from

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.790
topological the non-trivial too trivial

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.670
and that leads right to give rise to

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.130
kind of new degrees of unexpected

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.620
degrees of freedom on the surface of

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.810
these materials and

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:08.150
this has been a theme this in fact and

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.490
then we worked our way up from the

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.279
one-dimensional case later to the

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:16.279
two-dimensional case layers of material

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:19.850
within a graphene like structure and i

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.770
was fortunate enough to realize again

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.470
that through actually just working on a

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.570
toy model problem for some other reasons

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:28.940
but you could achieve what was called

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.970
the quantum Hall effect without applying

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.220
huge magnetic fields which made it a

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.320
more practical thing just you could

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.940
achieve this just from crystal

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.680
structures with a particular kind of

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.600
broken symmetry and and from that little

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.650
toy model it it went on for a while as a

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:51.920
toy model and later on step up to three

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.020
dimensions happened this happened in

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.240
$YEAR in philadelphia nearby here with

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.450
Charles Canaan and gene millie whoo-hoo

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.760
took two copies of a toy model that I

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.310
found very useful in in in the

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.200
two-dimensional case the graphing like

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.270
model and stuck them together and found

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.670
that when he glued fluid mirror images

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.410
of the thing together it did something

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.110
even more interesting which allowed

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.960
extensions of three dimensions and all

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.610
this kind of theoretical work went on

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.430
but after that after was realized that

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.950
real materials crystals that you could

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.610
find in that you could make here Frank

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.710
so such as the barber is now making all

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.540
the time to actually exhibit these

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.820
topological things and they had these

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.190
unusual surface properties that have

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.960
been sitting in front of people's eyes

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.210
for 30-40 years and no one had noticed

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.850
it suddenly this became a huge

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.750
revolution and it actually fed back

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:50.270
through the creation of new of actual

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.850
materials that behave this way is fed

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.730
back even my toy model my toy model from

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.330
the ladies has now been was now made

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.720
consequences knowing how to how to

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.900
manipulate matter and the surprising

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.670
thing about this is all the implications

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.660
I believe our that

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.050
the future a new way of looking at what

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.270
quantum mechanics can do and now there's

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.910
a huge amount of input from what's now

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.980
called quantum information theory which

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.420
is really different ways of looking at

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.700
all problems and we're really

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.540
topological materials at least have been

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.270
proposed as one of the routes to the the

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.790
the quantum computer which is the dream

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.210
so far the unrealized dream but that a

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.190
lot of people are working on but I can

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.340
see now that this this whole field has

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.910
has has burgeoned and this spread is

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.430
more more kind of this new way of

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.400
thinking has led to new discoveries and

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.510
it's quite whatever the the the future

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.010
will bring I think it's a very which

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:59.190
field of quantum engineering point of

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.280
information technology and that's matter

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.320
all coming together and and we've gone a

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.150
long way from the way physics condensed

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.100
matter physics was when i started

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.950
packing

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:17.410
ok

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:26.740
open questions to the media first but

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.089
i'm going to start with one that came in

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:29.769
from your hometown london from the

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:31.899
evening standard tucking your day

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:33.490
started with a call from Sweden and four

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.990
thirty in the morning but at eleven

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.160
o'clock this morning you were in the

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.839
classroom teaching graduate students

00:15:37.839 --> 00:15:40.689
regularly scheduled class and Matt wats

00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:42.430
from the evening standard reported their

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.379
wants to know why was it so important

00:15:44.379 --> 00:15:46.029
for you to teach class today and if

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.589
you're teaching just as important as

00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:55.980
your research

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:02.370
what's the matter and matter of you know

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.640
Judy your pride to go back in and do one

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.280
job and in fact i think it's i think the

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.530
lesson should be there all the the grad

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.210
these are the classes of of incoming

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:15.810
graduate students and I think all these

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.790
graduate students who come in have some

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.300
they they have hopes and I think any one

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.680
of them could discover something

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.220
tremendous and you and get a Nobel Prize

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.130
for that matter because in fact it's not

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.570
that you you don't get up at the

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.860
beginning of the day and say I'm going

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:34.080
to discover something great today you're

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.240
doing whatever you're doing and you

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.070
happen to chance on something through

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.380
some other route and you have to have of

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.080
course the the insight to see that what

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.450
you found something interesting and and

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.900
worth exploring more but i think most

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.930
most discoveries end up being made for

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.470
reasons completely unrelated to be there

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.210
accidental in some way like you were

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.010
looking at some problem some other

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.810
reason and you found that so in that

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.540
sense it's and so I think we ought to

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.390
inspiring i think it's a good of it is a

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.900
good model role model for the students

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.160
right thank you

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.350
ok questions from the media who are here

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:23.130
slicing they went up felt so is it

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.840
identify yourself i'm phillip current

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.700
from the Princeton back at local paper

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.520
so does this validate you or do you feel

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.230
like you're better at you what you'd now

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.000
that doesn't validate your work and in

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.650
your life's work and you get a raise for

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:46.260
it as well I guess

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:54.300
what we're happy together

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.850
I think of my work my life's work was

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:59.070
validated whether or not whether or not

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.980
i got such a prize and I was this I was

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.710
very happy that I've actually been

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.130
fortunate enough to be able to to make

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.460
such contributions to this it's this

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.790
field and I don't think you'll need the

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.680
prize to validate was working when

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.360
doesn't spend the time worrying about if

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.530
you're going to get a prize

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:25.950
other questions from the media hora I do

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:32.190
have one of the better your question or

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.560
identifiers so I cannot be physics

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.570
yeah i just want to follow up on your

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.700
question now we understand why you want

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.500
to teach it to eleven o'clock i want to

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.450
know what the student did when you

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:48.930
showed up but well they clap for that

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:49.530
matter

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.940
here's a question from Colin Fernandez

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.800
he's a science environment correspondent

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.230
for The Daily Mail in the UK and he

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.820
wonders does the award of the Nobel

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.460
Prize for Physics 23 british-born

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.040
scientists now living in in America show

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.600
that Britain has suffered a brain drain

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.990
and Sciences the USA he also wants to

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.770
know how you're going to spend the

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.620
$MONEY prize my goodness

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:21.159
I'm gonna give a lot of it to be Rs

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:27.309
but yeah the brain drain when i finished

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:29.889
my work I didn't consciously have my

00:19:29.889 --> 00:19:33.849
brain drain here but some sense the

00:19:33.849 --> 00:19:35.769
opportunity and a lot of that time the

00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:39.399
exciting work was going on in the states

00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:42.220
and i think at that time with some kind

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.369
of policy in Britain perhaps i'm not

00:19:45.369 --> 00:19:46.779
sure the mission factor was in power

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:48.700
then but there was some attempt by the

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.379
funding agencies to to stress usefulness

00:19:53.379 --> 00:19:56.259
of work as opposed to I guess the

00:19:56.259 --> 00:19:58.599
National Science Foundation has always

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:03.070
its inspiration based studies or studies

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:06.190
based on the what we call it looking

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.690
looking for something interesting you

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.789
can't get up and running and say I'm

00:20:09.789 --> 00:20:12.549
going to discover something extremely

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:14.679
useful usually something extremely

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:16.509
useful is actually discovered that

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:18.700
completely other reason than it turns

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.669
out to be useful so I think partly with

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:25.389
a kind of some kind of politics written

00:20:25.389 --> 00:20:26.739
about right

00:20:26.739 --> 00:20:29.979
ok if you have any further questions for

00:20:29.979 --> 00:20:31.720
the media are all continue to call on

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.369
you but why don't we open it up to the

00:20:33.369 --> 00:20:36.399
broader audience who has questions for

00:20:36.399 --> 00:20:43.239
Duncan our physics laureate yeah your

00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:47.320
mic runners ready to bring it bring a

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.050
bike too

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.450
go back to the well from the reporters

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:58.530
in in Britain also a common friend is

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.590
from The Daily Mail wanted to know what

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.380
applications could your research bring

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:12.090
ok with you later potentially the one of

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.400
the things of these interesting states

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.200
on the edge especially on these kind of

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.870
flat refereeing like systems is that the

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.620
electrical currents go one way only in

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.840
one direction and in fact one can do

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.630
this with light them analogues of this

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.940
in photonics which is the emotion of

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.250
light and it's a bit like having the

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.410
difference between a crowd of people

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.660
moving through each other in opposite

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:38.610
directions on the street with no rules

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.850
of the road and now this gives you this

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:43.470
system gives you're not just a rule in

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.690
the road of the road where the people

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.940
going forward on the left and the people

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.370
back with on the right or whichever way

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.780
it is in the two countries but in fact

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.240
the the two edges are not just the i did

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.580
buy a barrier in the middle there kind

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.980
of its like 22 size of a freeway that

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.870
are completely split by a long distance

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.750
so this allows a better flow of the

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.820
information without being hindered by

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.920
sharp turns in the road which would

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.380
could cause you to bounce backwards and

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.210
they were under the wrong side and at

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:18.240
least in in this has been one of the

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.700
visions that that might come out of such

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.950
things but really i think that the main

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.380
message is that we're going to find all

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.740
kinds of great things that that applying

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.330
these new quantum mechanical principles

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.060
to matter will allow us to do and we

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.910
don't really know what decide the

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.610
quantum computer is of course the the

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.580
the holy grail of this field but whether

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.710
it happened or not we'll find out but

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.300
there's a lot of money being put into it

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.730
people around the world

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.500
ok any other questions from your

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.580
ancestor

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:54.929
away from the microphone for just a

00:22:54.929 --> 00:22:55.740
moment

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.529
kristali physics Duncan I was wondering

00:22:58.529 --> 00:23:01.980
what experimental work did you find was

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.860
particularly compelling for you in the

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:07.380
area of topological phases of matter

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:15.720
hmm i suppose the only real experimental

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.340
work that motivated me with the

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.710
discovery by Dan tsui &amp; holster mama and

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:32.399
the other 100 * like they discovered the

00:23:32.399 --> 00:23:34.500
something quickly into the quantum Hall

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.909
effect now called the integer quantum

00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:39.299
Hall effect was discovered by vine clip

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:42.450
by vocalist singing in in 1981 and it

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.700
was initially a big mystery it's now our

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.970
has a topological component to it and

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:51.090
quite soon after people had understood

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.299
it and decided okay they understood it

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:56.700
completely this new effect called the

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.679
fractional quantum Hall effect was

00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:02.669
discovered by server gossard and three

00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:05.309
and that was something that no theorists

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:08.789
we understand it was so that I was a

00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:12.750
completely out of the blue experimental

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.360
challenge and it took a year or two for

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.730
I guess Bob laughing who got a Nobel

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:20.789
Prize for his discovery kind of charged

00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:22.710
on the right on the right solution what

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.929
turns out to be in the right explanation

00:24:24.929 --> 00:24:28.380
so the the three experimental is

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.389
completely down founded dumbfounded the

00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:33.840
theorists in 1982-83 with this discovery

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.419
and that got us thinking trying to find

00:24:36.419 --> 00:24:38.370
ways to explain this

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:41.580
I think in the topological filled in

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.919
some senses of theorists roof who

00:24:43.919 --> 00:24:45.419
provided the guidance for the

00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:47.940
experimental thoughtful now so in fact

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.320
they're desperately hoping they will

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.679
find the fractional equivalent of

00:24:52.679 --> 00:24:54.450
topological insulators before the

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.519
experimentalist find it because we were

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:58.919
deeply rooted in our pride that such an

00:24:58.919 --> 00:25:01.700
unexpected .

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.320
really decided we understood everything

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.019
completely further questions

00:25:09.019 --> 00:25:11.960
this man is over here my phones coming

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.639
your way so I'm what projects are you

00:25:16.639 --> 00:25:17.990
currently working on

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:22.519
well our challenge i'm interested in in

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:24.260
back back to this all problem of the

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.909
fractional quantum Hall effect and i'm

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:28.010
at I've turning my attention a little

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.700
bit from apology to quantum topology to

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.760
quantum geometry and their lung in

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.159
mathematics there with a famous gasps

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:39.350
Bonnie theorem where gas made an

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.360
exceptional completely remarkable

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.029
discovery that you could relate apology

00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:48.080
to the geometry and so I'm trying to go

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.350
backwards and lifted look at quantum

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.519
effects in the geometry of assistance

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:58.519
yes back Center microphone coming

00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:09.670
fine you're right

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.190
hey professor how then are there any yet

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:13.990
on conducted experiments you could

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.760
imagine that might be really helpful if

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.340
money weren't an object and resources

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.510
were unlimited kind of experiments that

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.730
condensed matter was actually all these

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.800
kinds of experiments that the dramatic

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.170
amount of money nothing but that they

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:33.100
help help

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:45.040
good idea

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.430
well if I offhand I can't tell you which

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:57.910
one night to do right but in fact the i

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:01.180
don't we need lots of there's lots of

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.190
him amazing stuff going on with cold

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.810
atoms and things were these are kind of

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.130
was small

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:08.020
these are not giant experiment we don't

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.570
need to build huge expert we do need to

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.300
have things like synchrotron light we

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.470
need a lot of facilities for shining

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:19.120
various kinds of radiation of the

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.180
kindest I hate her son does to to

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.910
illuminate these systems with intensity

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:29.110
lightened and see how they behave so we

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:31.750
need user facilities but we don't need

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:39.550
kind of giant LH LH ctypes or in fact or

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.110
in fact this as gravitational radiation

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:46.780
needs all right I i have a more

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:48.970
biographical question damn could you say

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:50.980
something about what attracted you to to

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.810
physics when you were young was it

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.210
something you always felt interested or

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.590
was there a teacher who made a huge

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:02.950
difference to well I guess my last one

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.540
year school there was an extremely good

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.570
chemistry teacher so I could have gone

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.270
into chemistry but the last year was the

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.400
kind of the physics teacher with was

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.800
with quite inspiring and then I didn't

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.330
know what I was actually get cambridge

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.919
one could one wasn't

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:20.509
as some other English universities

00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:23.179
you're tied down to what you said you

00:28:23.179 --> 00:28:24.859
wanted to do when you came in but at

00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:26.629
least it was sciences but they didn't

00:28:26.629 --> 00:28:28.580
have to decide which kind of science and

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.090
i found well actually after a few

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.940
experiences in chemistry or biology lab

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.340
I decided I should not let myself there

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.499
any kind of nasty chemicals or

00:28:39.499 --> 00:28:43.639
radioactive after having a few spills on

00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:48.950
myself I decided I was gonna but

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.269
actually i think all the things that

00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:52.999
probably due to inspirational teachers

00:28:52.999 --> 00:28:55.850
such as Phil Anderson think the quality

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:59.179
of of especially higher-level lectures

00:28:59.179 --> 00:29:00.769
is one of the things that really

00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:03.139
determines what you're going to go into

00:29:03.139 --> 00:29:05.989
you have to show it i think that the

00:29:05.989 --> 00:29:09.200
teacher mentor thing is crucial be one

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:15.559
or two more questions anybody hearing

00:29:15.559 --> 00:29:18.320
and seeing on this will conclude our

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.549
news conference I'd like to thank

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:21.679
everyone for coming today everyone for

00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:23.989
tuning in from afar and thanks to all

00:29:23.989 --> 00:29:25.639
those who made this so this conference

00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:28.609
possible and i think there in about five

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:30.710
minutes or so upstairs in the atrium we

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.679
will have a reception for Duncan and we

00:29:33.679 --> 00:29:35.149
hope to see all of you up there please

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:37.190
move in an efficient quantum fashion and

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:44.859
let's have one last round of apply
