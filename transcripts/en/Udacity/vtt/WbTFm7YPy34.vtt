00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.394
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This absolute value equation was tricky. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The answer is actually, no

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:09.368
solution. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Why is the answer no solution? If you recall, absolute value tells

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:14.124
us the distance from 0. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Since one side of our equation is an absolute value,

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:19.024
we know that absolute values are the distance from 0 and they're always

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:23.720
positive. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Do it make any sense to have a negative distance? ... &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, we can

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.281
not have a negative distance. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is no value of x that will make the

00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:33.231
absolute value of 2x plus 3 equal to negative 5. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's an impossible problem.

00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:38.102
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, the answer is no solution. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Let's try one more absolute value equation.
