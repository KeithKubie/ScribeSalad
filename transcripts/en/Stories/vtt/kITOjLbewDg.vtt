00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:03.140
LAURA LING: Graduation
time is approaching,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.670
and Kelly Acevedo, a
senior at Manual Arts High

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.050
School in South Los Angeles,
will be the first person

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.890
in her family to go to college.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.900
But the pathway hasn't
been without challenges.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.820
Kelly, did you see a lot
of violence growing up?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.590
KELLY ACEVEDO: Outside of my
house, it was a lot of gangs.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.960
And my sister was always
involved with them.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.100
I saw so many graphic things
that she went through.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.114
For example, the
day when she got

00:00:27.114 --> 00:00:28.870
raped, I was like
seven or eight,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.630
so I didn't know how to react.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.700
It kind of made me
lose my childhood.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.731
LAURA LING: Did you ever
think about joining a gang?

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:37.480
KELLY ACEVEDO: No.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.640
It made me more focused.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.280
I was always the
nerd of the family.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.020
LAURA LING: To
protect Kelly's sister

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.000
from the influence of gangs
the family moved to Mexico.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.470
But Kelly always longed
to return to Los Angeles

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.710
where she was born.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.930
KELLY ACEVEDO: I really
wanted to get an education,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.790
and be someone in life.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.740
So I asked my parents if I
could come back to Los Angeles.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.050
And at first they disagreed
with it because I was too young;

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.450
I was 14.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.072
But as time came by my
parents agreed with it.

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:09.280
LAURA LING: Were you nervous?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.370
KELLY ACEVEDO: Yeah,
I remember my dad

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.270
leaving me at the airport.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.950
And my mom stayed home.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.370
And I remember her crying.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.315
It was kind of scary.

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.240
That was like my first
time being on a plane.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.110
And I didn't know who to
ask, like where to go.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.497
LAURA LING: It's a hard
decision to make at only 14.

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:25.330
KELLY ACEVEDO: Yeah.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:30.420
LAURA LING: Kelly
moved back to the US,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.000
and stayed with relatives.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.840
But it was a
difficult transition,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.830
and she faced further
obstacles at her new home.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.855
KELLY ACEVEDO: It's just hard
because at first they didn't

00:01:41.855 --> 00:01:44.700
even provide me anything.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.400
I was sleeping on the floor.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.330
And it was just like a blanket
in the corner of the floor.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.160
It was hard to do
my homework just

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.230
with like a little flashlight.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.739
If I turned on the light,
they would yell at me.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.780
LAURA LING: What kept you
going through that time

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.300
because it could have been
easy to give up, and turn off

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.620
that flashlight, and just not
continue with your studies?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.444
KELLY ACEVEDO: At first I was
just angry and upset that I

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:12.467
had to go through that.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.800
I thought at that moment,
you're going to be in college,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.040
and it's going to
be better for you.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:22.170
LAURA LING: How
hard have you had

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.270
to work to get where you are?

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.340
KELLY ACEVEDO: It was
difficult because I only

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.320
knew fifth grade English,
so I felt really behind.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.820
I had to practice
my writing, and make

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.190
sure my grammar was right.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.409
I would try to read as
many books as I can.

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.200
LAURA LING: And then
finally you caught up.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.782
You're in classes where all the
super smart kids are in, right?

00:02:40.782 --> 00:02:42.240
And now you have
one of the highest

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.040
GPAs in your entire school?

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.550
KELLY ACEVEDO: Yeah,
I'm number two.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.470
So hopefully I'm going to be
the Salutatorian of my class.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.360
LAURA LING: That's awesome.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.160
Kelly is deciding whether to
attend UC Berkeley or Wesleyan

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.290
in the fall.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.420
But before then she has
some celebrating to do.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.900
You do a lot of
extracurricular activities.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.890
You're in ROTC, the Leadership
Council, the prom committee.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.000
Are you looking
forward to the prom?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.580
KELLY ACEVEDO: Yeah, I'm
really looking forward to prom,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.685
especially because
we're organizing it.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.320
LAURA LING: She was also chosen
to be part of a TLC channel

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.090
event called, "Say Yes to
the Prom," which gives prom

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.755
dresses and makeovers to
deserving young women.

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:26.380
KELLY ACEVEDO: I
think that's wonderful

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.300
because a lot of people from
my community can't afford that.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.927
But we also look forward
to it because it's prom.

00:03:32.927 --> 00:03:35.260
It's something special that
happens in your senior year.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.790
LAURA LING: What part of
prom are you looking forward

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.750
to the most?

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.166
KELLY ACEVEDO: I'm
looking forward

00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:43.396
to I guess being a
child again because

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:46.510
throughout my whole life,
I've had to act like an adult,

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.685
and carry so much
responsibilities,

00:03:48.685 --> 00:03:50.380
like look out for myself.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.520
[? If ?] I lookout to eat, or
have clothing, or I don't know,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.080
school supplies, and
stress about money.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.620
So it's amazing that I can be
able to participate in prom,

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.340
and just enjoy the time
I have with my friends.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.680
And not worry about any
responsibilities I have.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.180
LAURA LING: A few weeks later
Kelly reached her biggest goal

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.680
yet.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.270
She was selected to be in
The Gates Millennium Scholar

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.829
Program, one of the most
prestigious scholarships

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.810
in the country, where
she will receive

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.610
full tuition for her
undergraduate, graduate,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.850
and doctorate studies.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.180
I mean you have been
through so much Kelly.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.000
I mean more than I think
a lot of young people

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.760
can ever imagine.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.010
What do you think has kept you
going, and kept you motivated?

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.635
KELLY ACEVEDO: What's
kept me motivated

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:36.922
is to always think
about the future.

00:04:36.922 --> 00:04:42.100
And also what motivates me is
my parents and my grandfather.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.220
He was always there
for me, and always told

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.270
me to be good in school.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.390
And I just want
to make him proud.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.170
And show him that I made
it, once I become someone.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.185
LAURA LING: Please check
out this next video.

00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:08.560
SPEAKER: It's
almost like a dorm.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.860
But the people aren't
young, they're old.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.080
SPEAKER 2: Our project is
called, "A Home That Fits."

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.140
This is one solution
for youth homeless,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.565
a problem in Helsinki.

00:05:19.565 --> 00:05:21.940
LAURA LING: Thanks for watching,

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:22.773
