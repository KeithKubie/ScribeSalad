1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,360
I've talked to a friend of mine who's
from Brazil who has a completely different

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,060
take on the new leader of Brazil,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,240
like he's more positive about it.

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,220
And I've talked to other people that
say he's a monster. Yeah. Um, I mean,

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,340
if people in Brazil are living
through the current chaos,

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,300
I can understand why they might go to a
detailed type finger to say it's going

7
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:23,460
to be messy, but he's going
to clean it up. Right.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:27,720
But he certainly seems like
a monster. Yeah. And they,

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:32,420
they're experiencing some crazy
economic crisis as well, right? Yeah.

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,670
And it was the foster excrement growing
economy in Latin America was booming.

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,360
Yeah. It was just a few years ago. So
it's like this roller coaster ride.

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,530
We did a film that recently,
and uh, I might might get
the numbers slightly wrong,

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:48,300
but the amount of people that
were murdered in Brazil in 2017,

14
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,021
I believe it was,

15
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:52,260
was double more than double the
amount that were murdered in Syria.

16
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,310
Jesus Christ of 72,000.
Yeah.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,360
And after the World Cup and Olympics,
the trafficking gangs and the,

18
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:04,780
the police malicious just retook all of
those areas that were pacified to attain

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,170
to protect the tourists during
the World Cup and Olympics.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,380
So that violence has just come
right back to the fellows.

21
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,030
Say again. There's just so much shit
to pay attention to. Yeah. And Rehab.

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,190
The image of Rio is still, you
know, Sam or on the beach and yeah,

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,890
I've been a few times. Right?
Yeah. I've been over UFC events.

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,740
It's beautiful people.
Very nice, very friendly.

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,220
But then you go two or three miles up
into the hills to another world while we

26
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,380
drove.
When you land at the airport,

27
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:36,030
you drive through the favelas on the way
to Rio and you're like, Whoa, this is a,

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,530
this is a different kind of poverty.
And during the World Cup and Olympics,

29
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,950
they put billboards next to that road
to block the view of the favelas.

30
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,220
Did they rely on those billboards are now
starting to fall apart and you can now

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,980
sell, see it again? Yeah. Wow.
And you can hear it if you,

32
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,470
if you stay close to their,
you'll hear it. I mean,

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,930
we went into the village favelas
many times. We saw one guy,

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,680
he was suspected of being a
police informer. Um, so the,

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,620
the trafficking gangs had captured him,
slashed his leg,

36
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:06,180
so he was laying on the ground, put four
rifle to his head and just unloaded.

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,440
And his chin was still kind of where
it should be. But everything else was,

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,380
this is when you got there while
I, right afterwards, sorry. No,

39
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:16,520
we didn't witness it happening and we got
there right afterwards. But yeah, it's,

40
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:20,520
it's, I mean, hideous violence.
They are on a massive scale.

41
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,890
And also I got into arguments on the
other day about this, um, deeply racist.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,580
Uh, you know, the, the, the rich
people are in Ipanema tend to be white,

43
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,940
European descendants.
The poor kids getting shot in the favelas,

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,680
almost all black. And if you walk into
a bar and if an email with a black girl,

45
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,300
everyone will assume she's a prostitute.

46
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,870
If you walk into a bar and if an
email with a black guy, everyone was,

47
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,350
she meets a drug dealer. Um, and
again, the exact opposite of,

48
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:51,280
of the public image of Brazil. Ipanema is
the more wealthy area because there is,

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,610
yeah, that's the very, the
very wealthy, Nice Beach, um,

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,290
area with all the Nice
hotels and apartment blocks.

51
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,470
But they still must get robbed all the
time down there. Right. It used to be the,

52
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,050
that the violence was separated
from the radio, which areas,

53
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,350
but there are now a lot of wealthy
Brazilians leaving because it's, it's,

54
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,990
it's affecting everywhere now.
I mean,

55
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,270
one of the experts we interviewed
in the last film said, um,

56
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,040
I believe it was one in
three Rio residents will get
caught in crossfire at some

57
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,640
point over the course of a year. I'm, I
might be wrong. I believe it was one year,

58
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:24,940
three year. Yeah. But it was a
massive, massive number. Yeah.

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,780
Fuck yeah. I mean, if, if
you're anywhere near a favela,

60
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:30,341
you'll hear it.

61
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:34,030
Most nights you'll head shots being fired
most nights and not like boom, boom,

62
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:38,110
boom. You know, you'll hear
a fight gung Jesus Christ.

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,250
How much time do you spend over there?
Uh, three weeks, I believe it was. Wow.

64
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,230
And what are you covering? We did a
film about the pacification campaign,

65
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,140
the police and army clearing the
favelas before the World Cup Olympics.

66
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,280
So we went back just to see,

67
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,700
just to sort of illuminated for people
to think that this is what Brazil's

68
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,980
actually lark and see what yeah,
what happened afterwards.

69
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,910
And those areas were abandoned as soon
as the World Cup and Olympics were over.
