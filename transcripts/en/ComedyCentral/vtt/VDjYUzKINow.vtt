00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.635
Oh, sure. Like you've never
threatened a police horse.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:03.836
Actually, I have.

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:05.505
Well, you heard it here first.

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.939
Please like, comment,
and subscribe.

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:08.174
Thanks for watching.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.610
Cut. Excellent.
Love the energy today.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:12.045
Ryan, have you
been working out?

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.746
No.
Consider doing so.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.182
Quick reminder, the all hands
pre-marketing meeting

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.950
for the marketing meeting
is today.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:20.920
So, grab a quick bite,
run up to the conference room.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:23.056
All hands?
Talk to me when it's all feet.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.125
Show's over man. You can stop

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:27.861
Oh, thank god.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:35.735
March 23 post about shitting
at a bus stop

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.671
was more popular
than the March 15th post

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:41.040
about shitting
at a doctor's office.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:44.911
This leads us to believe
that bus stops are funnier,

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:48.681
while office-scapes
are inherently more sexual.

00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:50.249
Given the levels
of engagement ...

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:53.486
That's right big guy.
Give them your meeting face.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:56.689
You're doing great.
They think you're engaged

00:00:56.722 --> 00:01:00.026
and nobody has any idea
you're thinking about butts.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.964
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Reel it in.
Meeting face.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.934
And, you can see
oval number one is small.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.536
Oval number two
is a bit bigger.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.105
Oval number three
is bigger still

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:15.308
and four is the largest oval.
So, these are ...

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.277
Yo, my name is Jordy, and
you know I like pizza.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.480
Loving on the girls.
They say, happy to meet you.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.348
Pizza. Pizza.
Meet you.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.318
What rhymes with pizza?
How bout pizza?

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.719
No, that's the same word.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:28.855
Wait, is Chris thinking
about butts?

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.089
Butts.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:35.695
We launched our new digital
series High Priced Fish Lawyers.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:39.732
It circles around a group of
lawyers who work expensive,

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:44.604
fish-related cases who are also
half human, half fish.

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:48.074
As I was saying before,
my own experience with fish ...

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:52.412
Devin or was it Kevin? Tevin?
Is that even a name?

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.781
Crevin.
Maybe he's Slavic?

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.016
Ugh, even if I figure
out his name,

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.584
what am I going to say?

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:02.489
Hey, so crazy we both come
to this hot dog stand every day.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.289
What are you doing later?

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:07.093
He probably thinks I'm gross
for eating hot dogs every day,

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.295
but like (bleep) him.
He's there too.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.167
God, he's cute.
I think Crevin is my soulmate.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:19.305
Oh my god.
Is Crevin my soulmate?

00:02:19.338 --> 00:02:21.774
Of course we have done
many graphs

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.777
relating to the effectiveness
of company meetings.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.480
My favorite being
the pie graph.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:29.582
Second favorite
is the bar graph.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.818
Yo. My name is Jordy
and you know I like pizza.

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.655
Loving on the girls.
They say, happy to meet you.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:38.258
Pizza. Pizza.
Glad to meet you.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.993
Man, Jordan's
going to be so happy

00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:43.863
when I tell him about this
rap song I've written for him.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.700
I'm such a good friend.
Wait a minute.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.101
Is Chris thinking about butts?

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:50.403
Butts.

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:52.972
I knew that I wanted to see
my pop pop

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.174
once more
before the harvest.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:57.377
I was traditionally
the corn girl.

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:00.446
Okay, okay, okay.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.748
Then, I ended each episode
by saying something wacky,

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:05.484
but still reminding people
to like and subscribe.

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:08.120
It's a job,
but hey, I love it.

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:10.790
Wow. You really are the tallest
and the smartest.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.125
So, what's the name
of your YouTube show again?

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:14.360
Every Damn Day.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:15.595
Wow.
Wow.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:19.031
Well, well, well, very
inspiring, very insightful.

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:22.101
You know, Nate just
keep being you.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:25.504
I'm Barack Obama and I don't
think your palms are too sweaty.

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:27.006
The President.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.742
As you'll see on this slide,

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:32.478
it was the coldest winter
on record

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:35.448
and I knew that I had
to pull that trigger

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:39.218
because my family didn't have
enough oil to heat our stove ...

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.589
I'm Jordan. I'm a fart boy.
LOL. I think Ryan is so cool,

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:47.193
but I'd never tell him because
that'd be bad for my image.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.395
I'm Natasha.
I'm so weird.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.163
I think I'll microwave some fish

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:53.532
and then not eat it
for some reason.

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:56.836
I'm Chris. I can always wear
whatever I want,

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:58.671
but Ryan has to change
his shirt

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.407
because that looks too much
like a swastika.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:05.311
I'm Hannah, duh. I love to
(bleep)

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:09.115
Ryan! You've been talking
out loud this entire time.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:11.050
What the (bleep)
is wrong with you?

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.586
We've been inter-monologuing
dude. Not outer.

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.923
That's when it all came
crashing down.

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:20.192
I could tell I lost
the respect of my coworkers,

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:21.727
even if I secretly
did think they were ...

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.463
Yo, we can still hear you bro.
