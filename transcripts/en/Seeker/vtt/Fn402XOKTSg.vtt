00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.910
I see a 10 meter drop into a pool and think
I’m going to die.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.960
Divers see a 10 meter drop and think, “How
can I bend physics to make this awesome?”

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.190
Greetings mathletes, HOST here for DNews.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.570
The summer games are upon us!

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.040
The best the world has to offer have gathered
to play just about every sport under the sun.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.210
And while each sport has its own unique appeal,
from a physics perspective there may be none

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.630
more interesting than diving.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.100
Divers are spinning, flipping, twisting water
ninjas that have bent the laws of physics

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.879
to their whim with nary a splash.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.690
How do they do it?

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.780
Let’s take it from the top.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.140
Be it from a springboard 3 meters up or a
solid platform a dizzying 10 meters up, the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.800
initial leap is all-important.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.659
First off when the diver jumps they have to
make sure they’re not going to end up where

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.960
they started; on a concrete platform 3 stories
in the air and decidedly dry.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.319
Failing to clear the platform or board is
a big no-no, so the diver has to give themselves

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:03.280
some forward velocity, meaning they will travel
in an arc until they hit the water.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.070
The diver also wants to get as high as possible,
because more time in the air means more tricks

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.909
they can pull off.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.180
The final dimension determined at takeoff
is the diver’s rotation.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.409
If they’re going to spin and flip, they
need to start that from the jump.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.850
But they can increase the speed they’re
spinning as they fall by drawing their body

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.520
into a compact ball.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.369
This tuck position reduces what’s called
their “moment of inertia,” the body's

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.969
tendency to resist angular acceleration.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.659
When the moment of inertia goes down, their
rotational speed goes up to conserve their

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.070
rotational momentum, more commonly known as
angular momentum.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.850
The result is divers can squeeze four and
a half flips into a second and a half of fall

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.850
time.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.729
The other commonly used position for increasing
spin speed is called the pike, but unlike

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.030
the tuck the legs are kept straight, meaning
the diver has less control over rotational

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.280
speed, and the dives have a higher difficulty.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.710
Of course all the flips and spins in Rio won’t
get a diver a good score if they finish with

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.759
a belly flop.

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.850
Diver’s have to spot the water to know when
they’ll splash down, no easy feat when they’re

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.390
twisting and rotating and traveling at 51
kilometers per hour after falling 10 meters.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.150
When it’s time to get wet, the diver’s
goal is to enter the water with as little

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.640
splash as possible.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.200
If they do it right, they’ll part the water
with a sound like ripping paper, known as

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.500
a rip entry.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.760
To achieve this the diver has to punch a hole
in the water and enter it as straight as possible.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.420
Remember though that because angular momentum
is conserved, they’re still spinning when

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.780
they straighten out, just more slowly.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.840
Their body still rotates underwater, but masterful
divers will hit the surface in such a way

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.710
that they look like they’re going straight
in.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.280
If they can pull off the rip entry after flipping
out more than a teenager’s mom, they stand

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.250
a chance of making a splash at the summer
games.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.380
Concepts from physics are hiding everywhere
in sports.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.590
To learn how they’re crucial to throwing
a wicked curveball, check out Julian’s video

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:03.600

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:18.320
