&gt;&gt; Sarah Burnett:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.180
Welcome to the Graphic
Novels Program.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.840
My name is Sarah Burnett,
and I serve as the director

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.430
of operations for
the Small Press Expo.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.900
Our executive director,
Warren Bernard,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.200
was supposed to be here.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.250
He sends his regrets and
requests for painkillers

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.180
because he pulled his back out.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.040
I'm so pleased that I
can stand in for him.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.710
I've got to tell you, it's
tough to reconcile being someone

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.030
who usually spends a
Saturday afternoon curled

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.220
up with a book standing in
front of a large crowd, [laughs]

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.100
but I get the sense that
you guys are my people,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.700
and I'm really glad
we're all here today.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.600
The Small Press Expo,
or SPX, has been proud

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.790
to help organize the lineup
of graphic novel authors here

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.310
at the National Book
Festival for the last 5 years.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.300
This year, we're particularly
excited to support appearances

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.820
by Tillie Walden
and Ed Piskor today.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.870
Both have been mainstays at SPX.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.210
Our show this year
is just 2 weeks away

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.610
and will feature many authors

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.050
and artists you're familiar
with, like Roz Chast,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.210
Jules Feiffer, Derf
Backderf, and Carol Tyler.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.450
We'll also have folks
like Rebecca Sugar

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.970
of Steven Universe
fame and Ngozi Ukazu,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.820
whose web comic Check, Please!

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.430
became the most funded web
comic kickstarter of all time.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.150
With more than 600 creators
on our exhibiter list,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.480
you'll discover a lot
of new talent too.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.070
I hope you'll join us
just outside the city

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130
at the Bethesda North
Marriott Conference Center

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.300
on September 15th and 16th

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.810
so we can continue celebrating
great authors and artists

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.780
like the ones you're
about to get to know.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.620
There are some flyers that can
you grab at the back of the room

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.380
to learn more, and hope
you plan to join us.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740
Now, for why you're really
here, it is my pleasure

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.580
to introduce Michael Cavna.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.620
Michael is the columnist
and cartoonist

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.290
with The Washington Post.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.950
His prose and pictures for
The Post have been honored

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.400
by the Society of
Professional Journalists,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.950
National Headliner Awards, the
Society for Feature Journalists,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.530
the Harvey Awards,
and the Eisner Awards.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.510
This is Michael's fifth year as
the founding emcee and moderator

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.370
of the festival's graphic
novel stage programming.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.060
Please join me and welcome
him, and let's get started.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.110
[ Applause ]

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Thank you, Sarah.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.540
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.070
Are you ready for
2 hours of comics?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.670
This is the recess
of the festival.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.680
This is when you were in school.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.080
You know, we can bring my
Post colleague David Ignatius,

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.380
you know.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.300
He's our social studies
class, and all, and I sat next

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.300
to Jon Meacham last
night and was talking

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.470
about presidential history,
and he was reassuring me

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.940
that 1933 wasn't so
different from this year.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.650
And then, we had a few
drinks or a lot of drinks.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.400
And I mentioned drinks
because this was started based

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.700
on drinks.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.460
It's adult recess.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.910
This festival started, you
know, by Laura Bush was

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.160
who really got it
going, backed it.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.710
But for years, there
was no separate graphic

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.010
novels programming.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.430
They were individual stages.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.240
And then, you had some
enlightened people talk

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.330
to the Library of Congress,
took them out for beers,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.280
got them a little drunk,
and said, you need comics.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.830
This is our fifth
year doing this,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.590
so for the grown-ups,
alcohol can work.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.640
Again, my name's Michael
Cavna of The Washington Post.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.670
The Washington Post is a charter
sponsor of this festival.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.090
I do want to give a big
shout out and thank you

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.240
to the festival co-chairman,
David Rubenstein,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.630
and all the generous sponsors
who make this event possible.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.930
It's huge.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.230
And if you, per chance,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.620
would like to add your
financial support,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.920
you know, please feel free.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.400
There's information in your
program about how to do that.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.790
And at the end of the
2-hour, near the end

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.360
of the 2-hour presentation, we
should have time for questions.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.450
We will have monitors, I
mean, microphones right there.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.830
And just for everyone, the,
this is being videotaped,

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.640
so if you do appear, do come
to a microphone, you may show

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.100
up in a broadcast or
in some other way.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.210
So you're agreeing.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.700
That's your consent if
you dare walk up here.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.420
The, one thing David
Rubenstein didn't talk

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.840
about last night was
literacy, the high degree

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.380
of illiteracy in this country.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.490
Also, just being a
reluctant reader.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.860
We often get teachers
here, and for comics,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.560
it's very much the
power of comics is

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.170
to activate your brain
in different areas.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.590
Some of us are visual learners.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.780
Some of us, it triggers,
you know.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.700
I've talked to students
who it gets things going.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.930
So a big reason we do this
is because graphic novels

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.030
and comics are huge to
get young people to read.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.350
So we have several Eisner
winner awards tonight.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.920
We have a big Reuben
Award winner to my right.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.990
And his name is Mr. Patrick
McDonnell, the creator of Mutts.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.010
Can I get a big hand
for Patrick McDonnell?

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.410
[ Applause ]

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.210
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Thank you.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.260
[ Applause ]

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Mutts, as you
may know, was started in 1994.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.050
It's in more than 700
papers, last I looked.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.030
You may have picked up
some since we sat down.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.910
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Nowadays, it's a little tough

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.210
to pick up newspapers.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.510
[laughter]

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But as you
know, Mutts is the lovable,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.170
sort of New Jersey world of Earl
and Mooch, the dog and the cat.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.940
Just as a baseline, do we have
any fans of cats or dogs here?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.800
Really? Not so good.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.100
All right.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.320
I won't separate and say which
is the better animal to own,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.850
but, you know, and you have
is the, it's a strip that is,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.840
it's special, and it's both, it
makes you feel good to read it,

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.760
but it's also artistically
the epitome of the art form.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.020
Charles Schulz, who
we both would meet

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.060
at National Cartooning Society
conventions, he called Mutts --

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.690
and as you know, he was
the creator of Peanuts --

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.880
he called Mutts one of the
best comic strips of all time.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.560
He said, "Mutts is exactly
what a comic strip should be."

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.880
And Matt Groening, the
creator of The Simpsons, said,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.960
"Mutts cheers me up every day."

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.230
And I don't know about you,
but some days, these days,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.080
I need a little cheering
up in my morning newspaper.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.070
And so I turn to Mutts.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.610
It's just, it's a
tremendous feat,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.560
but he's also a children's
illustrator.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.200
He's also a playwright.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.490
Mutts has spawned 3 books
-- I mean, many books,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.800
dozens of books --
but such books is Year

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.280
of Yesh is what it
is, and #ILoveMutts

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.200
and The Mutts Spring Diaries.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.160
He's really the man who taught
us how to say "yesh" with an H

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.200
and "snax" with an X. And
his play, The, his book,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.000
The Gift of Nothing, was
adapted into a play that played

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.080
at the Kennedy Center that
won Helen Hayes Awards.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.960
He also did the book, Me...

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.990
Jane, with, about Jane Goodall,
and that won a Caldecott Award.

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.380
So basically, you're
just hitting

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.340
on all cylinders these days.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.640
So 1 more hand.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.610
He's doing it all for
everything he does.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.510
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Thank you.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.150
[ Applause ]

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:02.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So am I right?

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.750
Am I forgetting?

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.050
Is Mutts, will Mutts
be a feature film?

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.350
Is that going to happen?

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.650
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Knock on wood, someday.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.250
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Hollywood works a little slower

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.550
than daily comic strips.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.150
Well, let's get to
our images, and --

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.680
oh, good, we do have
the cover there.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.980
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Oh, good.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Good to see it, yeah.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.880
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Well, you
know, I, much as my combination

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.670
of my love for the art of
comics and my love for animals,

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.020
so I brought slides that
show my love for comics

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.320
and my love for animals.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.620
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.920
Now, you are an illustrator.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.220
You were doing things
for the New York Times

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.520
and many other publications
before you launched Mutts.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.820
Were -- I know I've
talked to other creators

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.050
who do [inaudible] animals, and
the animals were often popping

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.980
up in their margins or animal
characters would just keep

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.750
speaking to them
when they would draw.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.310
When did animals sort
of enter your page?

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.610
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
That's funny.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:50.910
I always wanted to be
a comic strip artist,

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.210
but when I graduated
from school,

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.030
I started getting
magazine illustration work,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.090
and that kept me busy
for quite a few years.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.630
But in my magazine
illustrations,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.610
I always drew a little,
white dog with a circle

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.580
around his eye just in
the background somewhere.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.590
And I didn't have a
dog at that point,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.900
but I really wanted a dog.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.200
And he didn't have a name.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.500
He was just this random dog.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.660
But when I finally decided I
wanted to do a comic strip,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.000
I actually went out and
got a Jack Russell Terrier,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.300
and his name was Earl.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.900
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: And
he inspired the comic.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.710
So the illustrated, the cartoon
dog I was drawing became a real

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.890
dog, and then the real
dog became the cartoon.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.380
And did that real dog demand
royalties from the other dog?

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.750
[ Laughter ]

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.160
But, you know, we're going to
concentrate on a couple themes

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:41.000
that consistently come up
in Mutts, and one of those,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.030
we spoke of Charles Schulz.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.770
And, you know, there
is a through line.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.530
I mean, the fact that Sparky
is, as we call him, you know,

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.160
he personally blessed your --

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.070
he, Sparky didn't
like everything,

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.410
and he would let you know
it, but he loved Mutts.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.550
So can you talk about
what you're doing here?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.850
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Well,
I'll read the strip real quick.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:00.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.450
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Charles Schulz said,

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:02.750
"A cartoonist is someone who
has to draw the same thing day

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.740
after day without
repeating himself."

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.360
Yesh, you can say that again.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs]
And then, we have a follow-up.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.880
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Charles Schulz said,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.700
"A cartoonist is someone who
has to draw the same thing day

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.300
after day without
repeating himself."

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.600
He said what?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, man.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.410
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: I
literally did that for a week.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow, yeah.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.520
You literally repeated yourself.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.090
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: And
then, I enjoyed it so much,

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.310
a couple of months
later, I did a few more.

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.370
[laughter] And I think
I might've used it

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.670
as much as I can.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, so this
isn't appearing next week as a--

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.900
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: It might.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.200
[laughter]

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And so--

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.800
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: It's
actually a great quote,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.650
and Charles Schulz is the
reason I became a cartoonist.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.070
I mean, I grew up with Peanuts.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.810
And the fact that I actually got
to become friends with my hero

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.060
and idol was just amazing.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.650
And when he said he
liked Mutts, I said,

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.950
okay, I could retire now.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Right?

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.550
Yeah, exactly.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.850
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Instead, I kept on doing it.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.550
And actually, next year's
going to be 25 years of Mutts.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Wow, congratulations.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.880
That's a huge, [applause] in
this market and everything.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.690
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Well, you
know, when you think about it,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.990
Charles Schulz did
it for 50 years.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Fifty years.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.590
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
I'm only halfway there.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:06.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Really, so
you're going to keep -- okay.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.190
You're going to repeat
yourself for 50 years.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.490
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: I'm
not going to promise that.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, but,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.210
so to continue the
theme of the meta here.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.510
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah, so,

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.200
do you have any ideas
for today's comic?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.500
No, but I'm sure I'm come

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.530
up with something
by the third panel.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:20.270
Boy, that got here fast.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Now, is that
how you feel as an artist?

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.490
You know, some, like,
prefer the 4-panel thing?

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.800
They like a longer arc
to build to the joke.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.640
But some, you know,
you're, you, 3 panels seem

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.940
to be your main thing.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.240
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah,
most of my strips are 3 panels.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.060
It's really, it's the
classic way to tell a story.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.370
It's the setup, and then,
you know, the action,

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.940
and then the punchline.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.540
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
So 3 panels work,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.620
but they do come fast sometimes.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.260
[laughter] Well,
continue, again, the meta.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.560
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Okay.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.460
Cat Comics by Mooch.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.260
I'm thinking of sch-making
this into a graphic novel.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.030
[laughter] I bought this
one because I was surprised

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.280
when I was asked to be on
the graphic novels panel.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.630
I don't, you know, I'm
doing a graphic novel,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.920
but it's taken 24
years to write.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.630
And I feel like Mooch would,
if a cat did a graphic novel,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.910
just different favorite naps
would be a good graphic novel.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And when, you
know, the animal [inaudible] is

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.320
such a distinctive part.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.130
No one does it like that now.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.830
Did that, was that organic
from the beginning, or--

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.130
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Well, you know, I was,

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.180
I'm a big fan of
old comic strips.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.460
And old comic strips,
people used to have little,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.760
silly ways of talking.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.680
I mean, Popeye says,
"I yam what I yam."

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.280
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
And Barney Google.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.220
You know, every, there was more
of like playing with language,

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.520
so I thought one

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.820
of my characters should
talk a little silly.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.710
And when Mooch came up, I
thought he was the character

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.100
that should talk a little silly.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.490
And I had a friend growing up
who, whenever he got in trouble

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.090
and had to admit to
something, he would say, yesh.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.140
And I thought "yesh" would be
a funny thing for Mooch to say.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.030
And then, I had him
say "sch-maybe,"

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.330
and then it just got
out of hand, and--

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There you go.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:11:58.930
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: He's
shushing all over the place.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.120
I literally once had a woman
write me a 2-page letter

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.060
that said she was really upset
that Mooch talked like that.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.360
And at the end of the letter,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.950
her thesis was her cat
would never talk like that.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.090
[laughter] I wrote her
a little note back,

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.390
and I just wrote, "Sch-orry."

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:15.990
[laughter] Nice.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.660
I thought you were going
to call the authority-sch,

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.590
maybe, on that.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.360
Do your characters speak to you?

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.770
Some creators have told me
they know they're in the zone

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.880
when their creators, when their
characters are practically

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.180
speaking to them.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.480
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah,
well, you know, I mean,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.070
it's a corny thing to say,
but the characters come,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.030
sometimes do write themselves.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.340
The way I'm work, I'm visual,
so my notebooks isn't, you know,

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.090
writing as much as drawing.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.470
So I'll just draw
Mooch, and I'll think,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.770
well, what could he do?

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.070
And put him in a
certain situation.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:44.830
And then, he kind of
takes over and tells me--

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There he goes.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.430
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Tells me what to draw.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:48.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: There he goes.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.030
Okay.

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.330
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Like this one.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.930
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Think of a punch line.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.230
Oof.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs]
And in a similar vein.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:57.830
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah,
again, I've said, well,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.130
I've brought all the strips
that talk about it too.

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.430
Art of comics.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.730
So Mooch, in the
first panel, as,

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.030
he's a wizard here,
Prospero [phonetic].

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.040
"I will now cast a sch-pell
for us to travel back in time."

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.340
Poof. "Wow."

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.140
"I will now cast a sch-pell
for us to travel back in time."

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.590
So it's, what's kind of
interesting about this strip,

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.240
you know, we learn
to read comics.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.310
It's a very strange
thing, but, you know,

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.840
each panel's a different moment
in time, and it's something

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.230
that you have to
acquire after a while.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.820
I had a woman that I met
who never read comics,

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.120
so she couldn't,
in the beginning,

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.190
she really couldn't figure
out what was going on, but,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.050
so it's something I think we
just learn, but it was fun

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.890
to play with the concept
of time in a comic strip.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And this
is, I was reading something

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.210
about the comic Norm Macdonald
the other day talking a platonic

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:44.510
joke would be where the setup

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:46.230
and the joke are
almost identical.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.510
Well, if you were an anime,
if you were a manga reader,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.200
you could read this
right to left,

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.110
and it would work just as well.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.810
[laughter] It would literally,
it's that circle, you know.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.170
It's a platonic strip.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.980
Sparky really knew what the heck
he was talking about, basically.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.280
And so more fun.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.580
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: So
here's Prospero again.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.480
"As the great cat wizard,
I can see into the future.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.780
How does it look?

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.080
Empty for now."

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.380
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And then,

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.680
what other art form
could you do this?

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.070
Play with the art form within
the art form in this way.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.370
Oh, I love this.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:17.670
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Oh, here's one.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:18.970
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.270
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: And
this one isn't going to appear

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.570
until next Sunday,
so you're getting a--

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:22.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: A tease.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.170
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
A tease here.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.470
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All right.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.770
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: "Va-voom."

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Are they
allowed to take pictures

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:29.370
and post on social media?

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:30.670
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: No, don't.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.970
[laughs] "Va-voom."

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.270
"What was that?"

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.570
"Onomatopoeia."

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:35.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Love that.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.170
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: I've
been doing much for 24 years,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.470
and it's the first time
onomatopoeia was a punch line.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:39.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:41.070
And you're going to
teach a few people too.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.370
They will, the Google,
there will be a Google spike

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.670
for that on Sunday morning.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.990
So another key theme
and huge part

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.630
of Mutts is not only the
laughter, but the heart,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.920
the soul, and you, you know,
you have this uncanny ability

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.320
in 5 panels or 3
to also just yank

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.700
on our heartstrings so hard.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.000
It's a gift.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.300
It's, you know, you
really do it.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.870
And can you talk a little bit
about just the origin of this

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.390
and the response you get
from doing Shelter Stories?

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.690
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
I'll read this one first.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:10.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.290
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: So this
is Shelter Stories, Bowser.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.590
"I was the first
picked from my litter.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.790
My family thought I was
the cutest little thing.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.090
In a year, I was gone.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.920
It was a matter of size.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.210
I got big, and their
hearts got small."

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.810
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, man.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:26.410
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: You
know, I was doing mutts

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.370
for about 4 years and, or maybe
3 and a half, and I was thinking

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.400
that Earl and Mooch have loving
guardians and a loving home,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.890
but I was thinking about all
the dogs and cats in shelters

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.620
that are waiting for
that opportunity.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.390
And I was trying to, I was in my
sketchbook trying to figure out,

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:43.220
how can I get shelter
animals into the Mutts world?

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.160
And then, a woman from
the Humane Society

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.740
of the United States
wrote to me and said

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.450
that November's National Animal
Shelter Appreciation Week,

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.750
Month.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.060
And could I do something?

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.080
I said, well, that's
the perfect opportunity.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.390
So I started Shelter Stories,
which I do twice a year --

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.370
one, the first week in May and
the first week in November.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.310
They just remind the readers
that if they're thinking

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.200
about getting a new best friend,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.890
that the shelter
was the place to go.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
So you're funny,

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.540
but you're saving
lives, to be honest.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.840
[laughs] You're literally,

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.500
you're a great spokesman,
by the way.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:13.800
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
You know -- thank you --

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:18.540
you know, in doing Mutts,
I really, even though Earl

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.330
and Mooch talk, I really
wanted it to, people to connect

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.590
with their own cat and dog
because if you have a cat

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.280
and dog, you all know
how funny they are.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.060
They -- I'm sure everyone's
cat and dog can be a cartoon.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.550
And they're based on my memories
of different cats I've had

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.130
and the dog and cat I have now.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.780
And, you know, I just
thought that I was trying

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.570
to see the world
through their eyes,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.140
and trying to see the
world through their eyes,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.650
I realized how tough a lot of
animals have it on this planet,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.030
so I just wanted that
to become part of Mutts.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Let's tell
some more of their stories.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.600
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Yeah, so this is Sky.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.570
"Sure, I know I'm deaf, but I'd
still make a great companion.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.830
Just do like I do:
Listen to your heart."

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The faces.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.270
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: I put
that one in particularly

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:07.830
because I got a letter
from a policewoman,

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:11.250
and she said she just did a
drug raid, and in the drug raid,

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:15.590
there was a deaf pit bull that
she had to take to the shelter,

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:18.810
but she was just really attached
to this dog that she had

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.590
to bring to the shelter, and
she didn't know what to do,

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.350
but she came home, relaxed,
took out the newspaper,

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.830
and that strip was in the
paper the day she did that.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.130
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Oh, my.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.430
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: And
she literally went back

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.330
to the shelter, and adopted
that dog, and named him Sky.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.510
So you never know how
you might touch somebody.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Saving lives.

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.110
I'm not kidding.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.410
I'm not kidding.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.710
Okay.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.010
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: And this
is another one, Sweetness.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.310
"Tom and Karina drove 3
hours to come and adopt me.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:47.070
They saw me in my
shelter, in my sweater

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.370
on the shelter's website.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:49.680
It was love at first sight.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.020
Likewise."

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.250
And this was another opportunity
that I got to go to spend a,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.910
2 days at the New York City
shelter and did stories

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.780
about real things, and
that was a real story.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.180
Someone drove 3 hours from
Vermont or Maine, I think,

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.530
to adopt this dog in New York.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:07.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.180
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Chickpea
and Chickpea's brother.

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.480
"Well, the shelter's
closing up for another day.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.780
We didn't get picked."

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:13.080
"I know. Tomorrow, guaranteed."

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.840
I did this story about
Chickpea and Chickpea's brother

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.140
in the shelter, and at
the end of the week,

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.480
they didn't get adopted, and
I got a lot of nasty letters.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:24.490
So a couple of months later,
I had them both adopted.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.790
And Guard Dog.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.090
I always get letters
about Guard Dog.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.390
They want me to free him.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:29.920
And someday, I definitely
will, but for now,

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.910
I feel like he has
a message to say

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.040
for people who chain their dogs.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.970
And hopefully, more and more
states are outlawing that.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.270
So, "Beware of dog.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.340
I might break your heart."

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.990
This is a strip I did a few
years ago, Sweet Dreams.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.610
And in the first panel, Millie's
petting Mooch in her home.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.370
But in the second
panel, we have pigs

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.520
in crates wishing they
were running free,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.750
an elephant in the circus
wishing he was running free,

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.020
chickens in battery cages
wishes they were running free,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.130
chimps in the laboratory
wishing they were running free,

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.680
and then ends with
Guard Dog wishing

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.480
that he was getting
sweet dreams.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.840
What's amazing about this
strip, I did it quite a,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.490
like 10 years ago or maybe even
longer, and, you know, progress.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.260
You know, Barnum &amp; Bailey
don't have elephants

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.560
in the circus anymore.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.360
Like, things are
definitely getting better,

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.240
and there's optimism that
the world will start having

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.540
more empathy.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.140
And then, here.

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.730
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: "I'm going
to get you, I'm going to let you

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.030
in on a little secret.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.360
Millions of chickens are
kept in cages so small,

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.670
they can't even spread
their wings.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.970
Now you know."

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.620
And that was done, California
was passing a proposition

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.410
to let chickens in cages
actually have more space,

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:41.520
and so I wanted to be
part of that message,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.350
and they actually
voted that through.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.360
So the power of the comic strip.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.160
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
I'm going veggie.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.760
You've gone veggie
yourself, right?

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.060
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah,
that, I tell you, the,

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.360
more and more, I feel
like that's what's going

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.660
to change this planet.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.560
I mean, even if you just
did Meatless Monday,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.370
you could help millions
of animals.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.090
It's amazing how many
animals are killed for that,

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.590
so I thought we could
do that message.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.930
I started out with only eating
-- my wife and I, 40 years ago

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:11.950
or 30 years ago, said,

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.940
let's just have meat
1 day, once a day.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.720
And then, it became once a week.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.020
And then, we just got off it.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.250
And now, we've been vegan
for quite a few years.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:20.820
And it just gets
easier and easier.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.560
We went to a great vegan
restaurant right here

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.500
in Washington, D.C. for
breakfast, so it gets easier,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.000
and I think that's what's
going to change the world.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.700
There's more and
more vegan products

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.490
that everybody could enjoy.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:31.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.090
We had to shut a few
concession stands right out here

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:35.100
when you came up [laughs]
just to make sure.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:36.400
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: I'm sure.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.700
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.140
And then, similar, you
know, talking about planet

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.800
and just the larger
picture there.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.100
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Well, like I said,

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.940
when you start seeing the
world through animals' eyes,

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:47.240
you see how tough it is.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.850
I mean, there's so, we have so
much plastic in our oceans now.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.520
See animals are dying from
being choked with plastic.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.820
So I did this strip.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.990
And I, actually, there's
a guy in I think Arizona

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.770
who just wrote to me that
he's spending his life trying

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.490
to solve that problem.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.190
And he said it because he
was reading Mutts as a kid

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:08.110
since he was 5 years old.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.800
So you never know who you're
going to, who you might touch.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did
you mail back thank-sch?

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.520
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: No, I'm
going to send him the original.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.850
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: So this is
a comic I did a few years back

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.240
where Noodles says
to, Shtinky says

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.540
to Noodles, "Yes, Mr. Noodles.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.260
Sometimes I do get
compassion fatigue."

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.110
"Gee, Jules, how do you get
over something like that?"

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.030
"Well, my autographed photo
of Dr. Jane Goodall helps."

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.380
[laughter] And that
appeared in the paper,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.380
and the Jane Goodall
Institute called me and said,

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.880
can we put that on
our newsletter?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.000
And I said, you can do
anything you want with it.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.910
I'd love to send you the
original to give to Jane.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.210
And they said, well,
Jane's going to be

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.510
in New York next week.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.810
Why don't you just give
it to Jane herself?

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.140
I said, oh, okay.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.550
So I got to meet Jane,
which inspired me

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.980
to do a children's book on
Jane Goodall called Me...

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.280
Jane.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The Caldecott
Medal winning children's book.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.510
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: Yeah.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:59.910
Yeah, thank you.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.310
[applause] And, you know,
it's a love letter to Jane,

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.820
but since we're here
at the book festival,

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.130
it's a love letter to books.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.230
I mean, the power of books,
you know, part of that,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.870
that's an auto, a biography
about Jane as a young girl,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.270
and she just talks about
reading Tarzan and Dr. Dolittle,

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.820
and it was those books in her
childhood that made her dream

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.810
of going to Africa and
working with animals.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:23.860
So, boy, just the
power of books.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.440
I'm sure everyone here has a
book that changed their lives,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.020
and I think that's why
we come here and read.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.580
Did you have a book or books
that changed your life early on?

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.160
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: You know,
probably Come Home, Snoopy.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.460
[laughs] You know,
that was my religion.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.940
Before I went to bed, I read
those Peanuts paperbacks.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.540
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: So, yeah,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.450
that was what changed my
-- you know, like Jane.

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:49.990
I mean, Jane at 4 years old
knew she was going to do that,

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.290
and I think at 4 years old,

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.330
I knew I wanted to
draw comic strips.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
then, it all came together.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.040
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Dreams can come true.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:57.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Her, Jane.

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.640
You, Patrick.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:22:59.940
And that's made for books.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.870
Well, it is now time to
welcome 2 more nature lovers

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:06.810
and animal lovers to our
stage, and they'll get a chance

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.530
to talk with Patrick too.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:14.130
The first is Tillie Walden, who,
2 years ago, 2016, you know,

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.100
right up the road, we
heard Sarah talking

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.460
about Small Press Expo.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:18.760
If you live in the area,

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.170
if you're around the
area -- there she is.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.470
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Hi, hi.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:23.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Thank you, Tillie.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.070
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell:
Nice to meet you.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.670
let's give Tillie Walden
and Penelope Bagieu.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.210
[applause] Thank you guys.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:33.450
So while they get mic-ed up,
so Tillie, if you get a chance

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.590
to go to Small Press
Expo, she won not 1,

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:40.580
but 2 Ignatz Awards 2 years ago,
and it's a great place to see

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.490
who the, where the
rising stars are.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:48.060
At the time, she was 20 and
just continued to do great work.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.350
Then, last year, she
came out with Spinning,

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.920
which just weeks ago won an
Eisner Award, which is the Oscar

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.800
of comics, so that's huge.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:00.750
She has lived in a number of
places, but Texas is her home

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.120
and where she was from.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.660
You went to the Center for
Cartoon Studies to study

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.060
with the great James Sturm,
and it's a great place.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.360
If you have a child or someone
close to you and they want

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.150
to become a cartoonist
and get serious,

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.150
the Center for Cartoon
Studies up in Vermont is one

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:19.080
of the great places to land.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:25.200
And so we have Spinning, and
we also have her new book comes

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.280
out in October, On a Sunbeam,
and I got to read a preview

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.690
of it, and I can't
recommend it more highly.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:35.300
So you've done 4 graphic novels.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.950
You had your web comic come out.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:39.510
The great Brian K.
Vaughan, cartoonist, said,

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:42.600
"Tillie Walden is the
future of comics."

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.620
And we have 2 people here
are the future of comics.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:49.630
With Penelope Bagieu, who this
is the third time I've had the

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:50.970
pleasure of moderating you

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.460
because she is a true
rock star in comic.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.030
She's a rock star in France.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.320
She also is in a
rock band, so that,

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.930
she has, she's, that is she.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.870
She, her blog, My
Quite Fascinating Life,

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.950
started drawing great
attention in France.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.830
Then, she, you know, I'm
not even going to try

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.130
to pronounce this French.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.610
I had French, and I don't want
to mangle one of your titles.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.480
But in English, it is
Brazen: Rebel Ladies

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.220
Who Rocked the World,
which came out this year.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.530
One critic called it
"beguilingly brilliant."

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:21.830
Wait, that was me.

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.670
I reviewed it and wrote
"beguilingly brilliant."

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.000
[laughter] You know, to quote
yourself is always good.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.320
But she did, she came out with
the graphic novel Exquisite

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.200
Corpse, which is wonderful.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.990
Last year, she was here for,

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:40.910
in the area for California
Dreamin', which is the story

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.530
of Mama Cass Elliot
because even in France,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.760
her parents would play
American rock music on cassettes

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.160
or 8-track, and she was
hearing the Mamas &amp; Papas.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.850
So Mama Cass Elliot,
if you don't know,

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.690
grew up in this area,
was in Northern Virginia,

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.840
then in Baltimore, and
she beautifully tells,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.290
you know, that story.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.590
And we'll talk about
her new one.

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:01.820
But 1, while we're
up here, so Patrick,

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.880
we've heard how much he loves
animals and how much it,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:06.820
through his art, you show that.

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.800
Tillie's bio literally
says, "I love cats."

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.100
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: It does.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.420
I felt like I should
just be clear about it.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.720
[laughter]

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.020
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Be upfront.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.500
So, and you have said, Penelope,
that you love nature shows,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.010
so can you talk, you guys,
just a little bit about,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.850
with animals, is there an
animal that you turn to,

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.890
either personally, or animals,

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.560
a breed that kind of
inspires your art?

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.570
I mean, I haven't asked you cat
versus dog because that's, like,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:35.870
you know, the worst --

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:37.660
we're already divided
enough in this country.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.960
I don't want to go there.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.120
But can you guys talk
about the animals and art?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.070
Do they inspire you?

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:46.250
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah, I, I'm
obviously very inspired by cats.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.420
I think they're wonderful
and fascinating creatures.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.930
And I think when
you're drawing a story,

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.890
especially a graphic
novel, and you want

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.500
to tell the audience
something about your character,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.070
have that character
interact with a cat.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.370
Like, I'm serious.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.670
It says a lot about
who they are.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.190
You know, do they
immediate go for the snuggle?

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.920
Do they talk to them
like they're a senator?

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.440
Do they, you know,
like, how do we do this?

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.220
And I love using animals as a
way to express who people are

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:13.040
and how they show love.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.640
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
There's a theory saying

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.590
that if you want a character
to look immediately mean

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.180
and for people to hate
him, he has to kill a cat.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.730
And if someone kills a cat--

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.030
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I
would never draw that.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:25.330
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: No matter
what you write afterwards,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.190
your readers will hate
him no matter what, and,

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.890
or if he saves a cat,
then he's a good guy

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.190
for the rest of the book.

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So
that's a signifier

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.180
with how you treat a cat.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:36.460
Wow. Well, I know Patrick
talked about, you know,

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.350
the work you've done
in terms of, like,

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.210
drawing about marine
conservation and the planet.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.090
And you actually got,
what, thousands of people

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:46.580
to sign about, it was, had to do

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.330
with the saving marine
life, right.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.080
Can you talk a little,
just a moment about that?

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.610
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah,
there's a fishing technique,

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.660
and industrial fishing
technique all

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.890
over the world called
deep-sea fish trolling,

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.840
which is very destructive
to the Earth.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.160
And there was supposed to
be a law that would be voted

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.150
against this, and
a lot of countries

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.790
for not super clear reasons were
against the banning of this,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.680
and so I met this woman from
an NGO who's been fighting

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.040
against this all her life,

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.190
but she couldn't really
make people care about this

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:23.020
because it is not a very
sexy subject, honestly.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:29.190
So, and so I made a comic online
about this because there was,

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:31.710
we were just about
to have a vote

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.820
at the European Parliament
about this.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.160
And so she made this petition
online, and she had a hard time,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.130
yeah, raising attention
from people.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:42.940
And so she had maybe,
I don't know,

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.180
I think it was 14,000
signatures to her petition.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.130
So we made this comic
online, and within the month,

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.030
we had a million signatures.

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.950
So that was very,
yeah, that was nice,

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:57.750
except that still
they voted against it.

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.540
Yeah, so, but that taught me a
lot about how democracy works.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:03.840
[laughs]

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.700
&gt;&gt; Patrick McDonnell: It's
also the power of comics that,

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.890
you know, we talk to
people at their level.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.360
It's like more of a
family conversation,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.700
and you can really say a
lot of important things

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.340
that people will take
easily than, you know,

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:17.720
so that's the power of comics.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.020
You did a great thing.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's it.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.170
Well, on that note, we have to
say goodbye to Mr. McDonnell,

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.990
but for Patrick McDonnell,
can we get a big hand

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.480
but also say a huge yesh?

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:39.660
[ Applause ]

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:42.180
You can sit where you
can, however you want to--

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.770
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
Because that's weird.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.070
Just kidding.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.370
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I'm
not going to do that.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:47.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: We, no.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.970
[laughs] That's a
later show, and,

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:50.340
but cats, we need cats up here.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.660
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
Let's get cozy.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.680
Oh no. We've ruined
their whole setup for us.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.980
Sorry, guys.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I know.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.580
I know. But--

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.880
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Rebels.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.150
So, you know, I don't know if
you were anticipating, you know,

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:07.180
even though the hash, the "me
too" hashtag was a decade old,

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:13.350
but where we are now, but the
culture is just so, you know,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:17.560
so ready and hungry as
ever to hear these stories.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.100
When you thought about
and obviously came

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:23.130
out in France first, but with
Brazen, when you started this,

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.180
were you sensing
shifts in the culture,

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.660
or was your timing
just impeccable?

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:33.300
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: [laughter]
No, there was a long pre process

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:36.250
to it, so I would've loved
to do this book 10 years ago,

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:40.300
but it just had to, you
know, mature a bit more.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:45.100
But then, yes, obviously,
my editor wouldn't deny it.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.590
The timing was perfect.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.300
[laughs] But it's just
that it took me a long time

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.960
to gather all these
stories, so that was--

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Twenty-nine, no, they're great,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.830
and it's a great
array of stories.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.130
But let me ask.

00:30:57.130 --> 00:30:58.430
You mention your editor.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.610
You guys both are at First
Second Books, which, you know,

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.050
is just a marvelous imprint.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:07.170
What is in the water there that
not only do they draw such,

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.440
having such a great eye for
talent, like such with both

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.710
of you, but the editors seem to
draw out that talent so well?

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.120
What's First Second
doing right in this time

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.700
when so much great work is being
done beyond the big 2 or big 3

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.160
when some people
think of comics?

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.680
But it's just great stories.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.620
I mean, you know, not
to put you on the spot,

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.800
but what are they drinking
up there that's going right?

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.890
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I think
First Second really understands

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.730
comics, and that's
not actually a given

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.720
with a comics publisher,
necessarily.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.760
There are a lot of book
publishers that now want to get

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.360
into graphic novels, but
they just don't understand

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.730
that it is an extremely
unique medium.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.220
Very different from prose.

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.320
And I feel like at First
Second, they have worked

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.620
with so many cartoonists.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.510
They have published so many
successful graphic novels

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.590
that they understand what works

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:00.100
and they understand
how cartoonists work.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:04.610
And so it's a very artistic
and kind of loving environment,

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:08.390
and they just, they have a great
team, and they all really care

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.780
about comics, and they
have good aesthetic,

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.230
good aesthetics, good design.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.320
I don't know what it is, really.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well,
we know that France is one

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.210
of the nations that truly
appreciates comics, and--

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.510
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
That's what I heard.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:21.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: By the way,

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.210
Mark Siegel at First Second
Books, with his strong ties

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.000
to France, has a great
tie, so he appreciates --

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.900
sometimes, I feel like the
United States is still trying

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.010
to catch up with much of the
rest of the world about--

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:32.310
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: We are.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Appreciating, yeah, we're--

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.910
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: No, we are.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It's
going to take us a while.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.830
Well, let's get to these stories

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.420
and have you tell
specifically about some of them.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.970
So here are there are 29
stories total, and, you know,

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.710
you have to tell these
biographies quickly,

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.550
and so your pacing
is just magnificent,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.160
but, you know, and that.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.620
That's just beautiful.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.760
That's just gorgeous.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.980
So can you tell me, this
is Mae Jemison, right,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.590
the first black astronaut

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.300
or the first black
woman to go into space?

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.600
Can you tell her--

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.900
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: And to be

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.590
in a Star Trek episode
at the same time.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Really?

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.190
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:16.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So
can you tell, what--

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:17.790
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: She was
a Star Trek fan, and she--

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What
drew you to her story?

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.390
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: What
drew me to her story,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.980
the fact that she was
afraid of both heights

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.660
and darkness when she was a kid.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.960
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Wow.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.560
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
That's amazing.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.860
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: And--

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.460
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
And she ended up,

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.760
you know, kind of nailing it.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.060
[inaudible]

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
then, can you tell us,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.920
is this the rapper
from Afghanistan?

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.970
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah,
this is Sonita Alizadeh.

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:42.420
She's a young girl who
was supposed to be married

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.670
when she was 10 by her
parents in Afghanistan.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.660
She grew up under the Taliban,
and so she, and one day,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.720
she heard an Eminem
song on the radio,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.070
and she didn't understand
the lyrics,

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:59.550
but she really got struck by the
rage in the way he was singing.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.140
And she said that
that's what I want to do,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:04.940
so she recorded her own rap
song about forced marriage.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.650
And she was, back
then, living in Iran,

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:11.620
where it's illegal
for women to sing.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.300
And so she put it online.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.580
She shot a little video,
music video on her own,

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.880
and she put it online.

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:24.820
And she was awarded a grant
to go and study music in Utah.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:29.110
And so she had to escape her
family to come to Utah to work

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:32.360
on her rap, and she was
17 when she did that,

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.930
which is such a lesson because
I remember what I was doing

00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.280
when I was 17, and--

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.580
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
What were you doing?

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.880
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Nothing.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.280
[laughter] I was
doing nothing, mostly.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.580
So--

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
You were saving cats.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.180
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
Yeah, not even.

00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.480
I was watching TV,
so I thought, yeah,

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.290
and she's now -- what's she?

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:48.590
She's your age.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:53.360
She's still very young, and
she's still going on stage now.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.740
And to me, what's amazing
is the fact she physically,

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:00.420
her body was going to
be commerce by age 10.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.820
You literally, that was
her fate unless, instead,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.110
she turned her mind
into commerce and art.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:08.470
I mean, that's just
a beautiful twist,

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.180
and you tell it well
and quickly.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.560
And is this Nzinga or--

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.000
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yes, it is.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And what
drew you to her story?

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.040
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: She was
queen of what is now Angola,

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.830
and she was really
smart, really witty,

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:26.280
and she had a very dumb brother.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.700
But he became king because
he was the only son.

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.840
And when she was born,
the woman who put her

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.500
to the world told her father,
she will became a queen.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.360
And so she had her
brother killed,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.350
and so she became a queen.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Now, that's gangsta.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.220
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.620
[laughs] And she was a
very good peace negotiator,

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.490
and she was very fair and just.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.780
And she was amazing.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.320
And she said that she
would never have a husband,

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.620
but she would have many lovers.

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.830
And she was really cool.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.640
And she was a queen until the
age of I think probably --

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.530
well, it's not very well
documented about this --

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.870
but probably around
her late 70s.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:07.910
And she was still
on the battlefield,

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.030
on the front row to fight.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.330
So she's super cool.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:12.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: A
true woman warrior.

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.100
Yeah. And this is the
bearded lady, right,

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.400
as she was [inaudible].

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.200
Can you tell us what, her story?

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:19.500
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.800
So her name is Clementine
Delait.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.530
She was the first
bearded supermodel

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.000
because she was a bearded
lady, but she refused to be

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.920
in a circus, like in a show,
nor to shave, of course.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.990
And she said, I don't want
to be part of a freak show.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.110
I want to be like a freelancer.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:43.080
And so she was selling
her autographed pictures

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.990
to her fans.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.010
And then, she started her own
cabaret in the east of France,

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:52.110
and she adopted kids, and
she was really amazing.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:56.210
But she started her life
by, of course, being shamed

00:36:56.210 --> 00:37:01.330
for her beard, and then she was
offered as the only opportunity

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.810
for a woman like her to
be, yeah, to be a freak.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:08.650
And that was early 20th century,

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.960
so there were not
many other options.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So so far,
every woman we're talking

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:16.150
about basically was, had been
assigned a role by her birth,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.190
essentially, and having to
steer hard against that.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.490
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:21.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:24.590
And then, yeah, there we go.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:25.990
Try this again.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.290
Look at her there.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:28.590
I love -- look at
that top panel.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:29.980
That's just beautiful.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.560
That's her story.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.840
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: And even in
France, she's not that famous,

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.760
which I thought was very unfair.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.030
And that is the thing in common

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.930
for all these women I think
is just that the reaction

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:48.010
that I had mostly with this
book was people telling me, oh,

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.750
how come I never heard of
that woman, even if she was

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:52.140
like a Nobel Prize for Peace?

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.820
Because some of them are.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:59.290
And as usual, they are
invisible, so I thought,

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:04.720
in a very proud way, I was
very proud when people say,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.010
I have never heard about
them, and that's my, yeah.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:10.610
And it's a great
mix because some

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.320
of the people you may have even
heard of like Josephine Baker,

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.530
known as a club and cabaret,
or Hedy Lamarr, the actress,

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.870
but we didn't know sort of,
when it came to World War II,

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.410
what they were doing, whether in
terms of sleuth work, spy work,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.880
or technology, this
whole other side

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.400
that just never came to light.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.840
Yeah, that's beautiful.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.140
Look at her there.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.280
And then, so this is
Las Mariposas, right?

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.020
Can you tell us about, was
this, and they're Dominican?

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.100
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah,
so they were 4 sisters,

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:49.230
but 3 of them became
resistant to the local tyrant

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.390
in Dominican Republic.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.040
And what they had in common
was that they were very smart,

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.780
but they were also
very beautiful,

00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:02.130
and that men had the horrible
habit of kind of going fishing

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:07.040
for young, beautiful
girls to hang around with.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.290
And so he invited them over
to his sort of palazzo,

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:15.390
and he was hitting on them,
like, very, very intensely.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.690
And that's what threw them
into politics because they were

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.800
so sick of being seen as a
piece of meat that they decided

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.470
to fight back the power.

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:26.470
And they were put in jail.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.770
They were tortured.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:34.320
But they still fought him
with all their energy.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.830
And eventually, they
were murdered.

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:42.660
And today, the International Day
Against Women Violence, Violent,

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.680
yeah, Violence Against Women is
the day they were killed still,

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.980
so.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So they
were, so they became martyrs--

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.360
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Essentially.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.260
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: What?

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.560
&gt;&gt; What about the fourth one?

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What
happened to the fourth sister?

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.200
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
She was mild.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.830
She was not that much
into politics, I think.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:02.130
&gt;&gt; She was what?

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:03.760
She was wild?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.060
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Mild?

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.360
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah,
she was more, you know.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.710
She had more mild
political stances,

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.290
I think, than her sisters.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.590
So these are the other 2.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So she
got to live, basically.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.580
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
No, she died too.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No?

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.180
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
No, that's very unfair.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So either way.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.780
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: So, yeah.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.380
I love the art of that,
and there they are.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:27.270
Let's see if there's, get to,
trying to get to the next one.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.240
Can we get to the next one?

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:30.990
Oh, Margaret Hamilton.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:37.280
Now, I mean, I've, I
have relatives who talk

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.150
about being scared as little
kids when we watch Wizard of Oz,

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.700
and Margaret Hamilton in that
green makeup, and the poof,

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:45.820
and the fact that
you get behind,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.120
you know, behind her story.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.770
What drew you to her story?

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.070
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Same thing.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.370
I was terrified by her as a kid.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.810
I had to leave the room every
time, with all the scenes

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.540
where the witch was
on, I had to leave.

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.800
And then, my parents
would come, would call me

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.260
to come back whenever
she was gone.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.560
So--

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I'm just --
anyone else here at all scared

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.520
by the Wicked Witch
in Wizard of Oz?

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.820
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:12.530
She was ranked the fourth worst
villain in the history of movies

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:15.320
after Darth Vader and I
think Hannibal Lector.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.940
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah, I was
going to ask, who's number 1?

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.240
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
It's Darth Vader.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.540
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Oh.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And they
both got to wear masks.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.140
She was just--

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.440
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah,
and she's the only woman.

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.040
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: So, yeah,
so, and for a long time,

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.300
I was really, even just to see
her face was too much for me.

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:33.420
And then, one day, I heard that
she was actually a schoolteacher

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:36.060
to begin with and that she
loved children, and I thought,

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.840
what a curse it must've been
for her because for the rest

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.980
of her life, she was, I think
probably kids were running away

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:43.510
screaming whenever they saw her.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.840
And then, I heard that she had
been a single mom struggling

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.120
to get parts, and she wanted
to play romantic roles,

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:54.530
but all the casting directors
told her she was too ugly

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.900
to play that.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.710
And so she thought, okay,
then plan B, I'm going to be,

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:01.200
if I can't be the pretty one,
I'm going to be the scary one

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.160
because I'm really
good at being scary.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.660
And so she heard that they were
auditioning the part of a witch

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.350
in a movie, and so
she went there,

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:16.540
and she became the most
famous witch in the world, so.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.140
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Wow.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.440
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
And so I just want

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.040
to let people know we have
just a couple minutes here

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.340
with this [inaudible] so
-- and who is this again?

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.640
This--

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.940
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
It's Nzinga that we--

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
This is Nzinga, yeah.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.540
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
Mentioned before, yeah.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.840
And that's me.

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:32.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
And that is you.

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.440
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: With
a beautiful other picture.

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.740
[laughter]

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You were
voted the least terrifying woman

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.340
in the world in the
most recent--

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.640
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Well,
there's actually my story

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.310
at the end of the book,
which was not my idea

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.530
because I thought that
was really pretentious.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.300
But since we had to remove
1 story from the original

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.560
because it was originally
30 women, and 1 was removed

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.680
for the American edition
because it was too hard,

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.980
[laughs] so it was removed.

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.320
And so instead, my editor,
our editor suggested

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.430
that I put my own story in it
being told from the outside,

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.660
which is a super
weird experience.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:09.070
So I wrote a 2-page comic
to explain how I was brazen

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.820
and cool, so [laughs]
it's horrible,

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.120
but it's still in the book.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Does that exist?

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.720
Is that in there?

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.020
Is that--

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.320
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah, it is.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.620
Yeah, it's the last 2 pages, and
it's, and then, Penelope went

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:20.920
on to become, blah, blah, blah.

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.220
And I wrote this, so
this is really weird.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Okay, no, I read that.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.120
It just, okay, it felt humble.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.610
It didn't feel pretentious.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.920
Okay, that's why -- I was,
I thought there was a comic

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.840
out there where it
was like you were--

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.140
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: No.

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.920
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes, okay.

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.120
[laughs] So with
Tillie, Spinning.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.110
You know, this, it's

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.770
such a beautiful work,
a heartfelt work.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.780
Deeply personal.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.400
I could sort of mangle
it and try to say,

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.210
explain in 30 words all
-- no, but the drama.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:55.050
I mean, what I will say is
what you get, the sheer, raw,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.830
tender emotion is apparent.

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:59.130
I've experienced it.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:02.510
When you see a teenage
girl, when something that,

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.110
when you're a little
older, is just a mild thing,

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.220
but everything new is,
just feels so immediate

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:11.710
and can feel incredibly
dramatic,

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.030
and your life is upside down.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.610
So when you're working, I mean,

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:21.280
you're a competitor junior
skater, and you are, you know,

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.120
looking, having, you're
having skating with different,

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:28.750
in the morning, see a different
girl, one who's 5 years older,

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.280
and you're sensing a
stirring, an attraction.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.580
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Oh, yeah.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.180
See, right there.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.840
That "oh, yeah" said more
than my previous 40 words.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.880
Please, you can do
it better than I.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.480
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: You
mean describe Spinning.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Want
me to describe Spinning

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.570
and then what sort of,
what it's like to be

00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:50.880
that personal on
that level in art.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.690
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
It's kind of awful.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.430
It's very hard to make a memoir,

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:58.360
and I think no matter what age
you are, it's very hard to look

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:04.790
at yourself with
honesty and bravery.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:08.560
And Spinning is, it's
about my childhood.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.350
I grew up as a competitive
figure skater.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.140
I did synchronized
skating as well.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:14.450
Not a lot of people
know what synchro is.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:16.700
And I grew up in New
Jersey and Texas.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.000
And I'm also a lesbian.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.350
And I felt like I was breaking
into this thing where it was

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.680
like not only are almost all
skating narratives just awful,

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.600
and really boring, and
stupid, and they end

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.160
with them getting a gold medal.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.570
And, like, oh, look, a cute
guy on the side of the rink.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.870
And I was like, oh, gross.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.910
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs]
That's not your rom-com.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.210
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: No.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.810
I was like, I have been, I
grew up being so frustrated

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:41.370
with skating media and very
frustrated with sports media

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.940
that I wanted to tell a story
about what it means to grow

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.270
up in a sport, what it means
to grow up being pushed

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.930
to do something that you are
good at and that you also hate,

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:54.560
and then also to be a
lesbian while doing that.

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:55.860
And that--

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:57.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
And discovering.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.460
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: And
discovering that, and figuring

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.520
that out in the locker room,
and trying to decide whether

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.990
or not these girls would let me
come back in this locker room

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.290
if they knew I was a lesbian.

00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:07.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:11.100
Well, at 1 point, I
think you actually say,

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.990
you feared acknowledging
you were gay

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.920
or you feared that awakening.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.620
Or you even talk about fearing,

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.840
not writing gay characters
because of that.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.140
Like, you had to--

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.440
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Oh, yeah.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.800
Yeah, I spent, when I first
started drawing comics,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.340
all my characters
were little boys.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.940
[laughs]

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.240
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: And I
guess they were straight.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.540
I have no idea, but it
was all this just kind

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.840
of internalized stuff.

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:33.740
I spent my whole life seeing
media that told these kinds

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.990
of stories, so when I sat down
to tell stories, naturally,

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.090
I told, I reflected them
back, the things I had seen.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.100
And you, I think there
has to be a moment

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.040
where you say to
yourself, hold on.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.440
What is important to me?

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.430
What do I actually want to say?

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.730
And you have to push yourself
to put that in your comics.

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:52.570
And I should point
out, it wasn't just

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:53.870
that you were skating.

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:55.170
This was a 12-year saga.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.470
I mean, this is hard core.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.770
This is--

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.070
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I
was skating far longer

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.370
than I've been drawing.

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:01.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:02.970
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I'm a much
more accomplished skater

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.270
than I am an accomplished
artist.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No, no, no.

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:06.870
But I love the way, you know,
different chapter titles,

00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:10.130
the way you have axel,
or lutz, or counter.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:12.410
And so what that
hammers home is it's not,

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.290
you describe the technical move,

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.530
but then you realize that's
also an emotional state.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:21.380
And it just works beautifully
on that level because you sense,

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.740
you know, it feels like
as you're discovering it,

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.870
we're so in the moment with you.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.570
We're feeling with
you moment to moment.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:32.030
Oh, there's Lindsay,
and here comes Caitlin,

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:35.120
and there's Molly, and there's,
you know, and there's Ray,

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.890
and then, is Grace sort of
your nemesis, would you say?

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.190
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:41.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.790
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I mean, some
of the book is about bullying

00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:44.490
and things I experienced.

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So here,
the massiveness of a rank,

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.830
and there you are back again.

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:49.130
You talk about--

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:50.430
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Well,
and what's strange is

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:54.520
that I didn't use any photo
reference for this book.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.010
I, because I just, I
wanted the drawings

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.820
to reflect how I
remembered things.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.210
Like, if you all think back
to your childhood home,

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.560
in your mind, it's a lot
bigger than it actually was

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.230
because when you're a kid,
everything seems huge to you,

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.270
and I wanted the scenes to
feel like those memories.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:11.410
But that rink, I drew
it in this huge way,

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.760
and when I finished the
book, I actually looked

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.060
up what it looked like.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.360
It is that big.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.960
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
I wasn't wrong.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.260
It's huge, and there's
an American flag in it.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.560
I was right.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So
draw it when you're 20,

00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:24.160
not when you're 40,
is what you're saying.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.460
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Or
draw whenever you want.

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.760
Who cares.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs]
But your sense of it.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:30.220
And it's just, and, you know, by
the way, on a technical level,

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:33.110
your grid work, you know,
the way you'll do 6 panel,

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:37.560
and then you have these 24-panel
pages, it's, on the ice,

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:40.440
it's just heart -- I mean,
you feel the immediate.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:44.720
It also reminded me because I
was just a, on a much less so,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.280
I was a competitive junior, as
a kid, junior tennis player.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.370
And, but I wasn't thinking
about my makeup, and I wasn't,

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:54.030
use your wording,
I wasn't thinking

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.340
about whether my crotch was
showing as I'm doing a move.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.750
And I wasn't worrying about,
you know, just concerns

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.130
that I've covered both men's
and women's sports early

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.030
in my career, and the
difference, you make us aware

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.250
of everything in those panels.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:13.940
And it just, everything feels
just painfully, and it feels

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.370
like almost anything is
a potential embarrassment

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.670
when you're that age.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:19.970
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Well, yeah.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.670
And it's a sport all about
your body, and I was in it

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.280
through my entire childhood,
so my body was changing

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.910
and growing, and I was having
to experience that while

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:29.320
in like a skintight
dress with no underwear

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.760
on because skaters aren't
allowed to wear underwear

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.150
because the judges might
see it, like a line of it.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:34.450
And they were like, no, no.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:37.900
And, like, having to understand
your body while having an

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.560
audience looking
at it was like --

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.870
but thing is it's
not just skating.

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.230
If you've been in dance, if
you've been in gymnastics,

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:47.730
I would probably say even
tennis or even a lot of sports,

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.410
there's a lot of that.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:52.330
It's, this isn't an
isolated experience.

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:53.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Not at all.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:54.930
Not at all.

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:56.280
But to do it when you're young,
to be, to have, you know,

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.460
you're not even 18, and, yeah.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.680
And so you go from there.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.640
So you go from memoir
to fiction, and then--

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.060
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I wanted
to perk up a little bit.

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:08.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did you?

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.660
Okay.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.960
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
[laughs] And so could,

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.560
so this was a web comic.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.750
This was an Eisner Award
winning web comic was this?

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:18.620
This is Ignatz Award winning.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:19.920
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I don't know.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.220
I don't remember.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:22.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: They pile
up, like your skating medals.

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.820
At 1 point, you say that
you have an unhealthy amount

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.120
of skating medals, right?

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.420
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I threw
them all out, except for 1.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Really?

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.020
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I had so
many, it was disgusting.

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:30.320
My door actually broke because
my mom used to hang them

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:31.620
on my door, and then
my door broke.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:33.650
And I was like, this is
like, this is stupid.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:34.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and
it came across in the book as,

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:37.770
like, not like, oh,
look at me, but, like,

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.410
literally weighing
you down with the--

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.710
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:42.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What
you've been through.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:45.240
So can you talk about, this
book comes out in October.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.970
I can't recommend
it more highly.

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:51.840
Can you talk about transitioning
to a work of space fiction?

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.140
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah.

00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.440
I mean, it was easy.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:55.740
It was just like, let me
shut down that part of myself

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.740
that wants to, like, examine
who I am and just tell a story

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:00.480
about all the fun stuff
that I want to do.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.730
And I would really like to go
to boarding school in space,

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:07.670
so [laughter] I started
with that.

00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:10.560
I would also really like to
live on a spaceship with a bunch

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:12.690
of other queer women
and just, like,

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:15.210
be a little family
together, so I did that too.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:17.190
And that's what the
story is about.

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.930
It's about this girl, Mia, and
these 2 stages in her life --

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:23.030
1 when she is at boarding school
in space, and falls in love,

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:26.150
and deals with some
things, including bullying,

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:29.370
and then her, in her older
life, trying to understand

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:33.250
who she is not as a student, not
as a girl at boarding school,

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.510
but as a girl who
is now a woman.

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:39.870
And it's long and fun, and
it's still a web comic.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:41.170
It's still for free.

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:42.470
You can read the
whole thing online

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:44.280
if you just Google On a Sunbeam.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.580
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: On a Sunbeam.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.880
And in October--

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.180
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
Where did you get that?

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.850
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Oh, I have my ways.

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:53.370
[laughter] I just, you
know, it's the patriarchy.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:54.670
It's [inaudible].

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.010
Did I just say that out loud?

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.310
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: You did.

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:00.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:04.610
No, what it is, it's partly that
it's the power of First Second,

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.110
but also the power
of Small Press Expo,

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:10.550
which will be in 2 weeks again.

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.020
They have helped
make it possible

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:18.010
to bring Tillie Walden
here as well as the person

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.630
who will follow us
next, Ed Piskor.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:21.930
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: You mean Ed?

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I mean Ed.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:24.530
[laughs]

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.980
But, you know, another thing
is 1 thing you guys both are

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:32.330
drawing about and writing about
is fear versus fearlessness,

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:37.370
the fear paralyzing you versus
people who seem like they just,

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:39.320
they seem able to conquer fear.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.730
And there's so much
that goes into that.

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:42.740
I mean, you talk about quitting,

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.540
and you thought quitting
would be a big deal.

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:47.090
You quit skating, and was it
your mom that's like, oh, okay.

00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:48.390
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: It
was not a big deal.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:49.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Not a big deal.

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:51.440
Everything you thought --
can you talk, you know,

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.910
in getting across that emotional
state, just very quickly,

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:58.610
can you talk about
sort of tapping fear

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.300
versus fearlessness
for, in your work?

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:02.820
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I don't know.

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:06.240
I don't know if there's
a way to conquer fear.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:09.000
I feel like all I can do is
just try and work through it

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.090
and try and understand it.

00:53:12.090 --> 00:53:13.390
That's all I really
know how to do.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:14.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:15.990
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah,

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:17.630
and the fear will
always be there anyway,

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.110
probably until the end.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:22.200
So I don't think
there's a moment

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:26.500
when you start not being scared
anymore, so you just have

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:28.890
to live with it and be
able to work with it.

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.990
And the good thing
is that it's not us.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:32.290
It's our books.

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:38.140
So we're not directly going
towards, you know, people.

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.650
And we something in between.

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.940
We have the books,
so we're safe.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.800
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: And it's
our way to process it.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.100
Art lets us deal with it.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.240
I just fear, deadlines I think
is what I end up fearing most

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.230
when I'm trying to,
and I really mean that.

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:54.190
Well, what that leads us to,
speaking of Small Press Expo

00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:57.510
and someone along with Tillie
who will be here in 2 weeks,

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:03.720
someone who I first met at
Small Press Expo 6, 8 years ago.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:06.110
Straight out of Pittsburgh.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:11.070
He is a huge fan of Marvel
Comics and that '70's aesthetic.

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:12.920
He's a huge fan of hip-hop.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.270
He's a huge fan of
so many things.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:17.600
But he's able to put it all
in his art with this sort

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.550
of aesthetic that
only he is doing.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:24.370
He's one of the very few, if not
only cartoonists working for one

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.840
of the big 2 who does
the writing, the drawing,

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:30.140
both the penciling and inking,

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.230
the color separation
from end to end.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.840
He's a 1-man machine.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.000
Growing up in Pittsburgh,
he went to the Kubert School

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.220
of Art, you know, started
by the great Joe Kubert,

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.520
if you know your stuff.

00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.220
He got to know, if you know
Harvey Pekar, American Splendor.

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.960
Ed, at a young age, was
doing that, working with him

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:54.330
on Macedonia, and The Beats, and
American Splendor [inaudible].

00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.600
And so then, he went
to Wizzywig,

00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.570
which was an Eisner nominee.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.250
Then, he did Hip Hop
Family Tree, and this is,

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:04.860
we'll get into how this
is a work that, you know,

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:06.920
you either have credibility,
you have cred

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.570
with the hip-hop
heads or you don't.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:10.740
And he got mad cred for that.

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:15.000
And so what's coming up now
is he's been working on X-Men:

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.470
Grand Design, and Marvel just
threw him the sandbox and said,

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:19.880
do what you want to do.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.900
And so we're going to
have 2 Eisner winners

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.200
up here at 1 time.

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.830
Please welcome Eddie
P. [applause]

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.210
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
Should we move over?

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:36.650
I think he needs this --
Ed, you need his microphone.

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:37.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:40.470
And while he's doing that, some
of the praise for X-Men so far,

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:44.870
it's been called a love
letter to that era in comics,

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:48.110
and it's been called the
intricate labor of love.

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:51.780
And it's just, it's beautifully,
it's done with such depth,

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:56.420
and you're able to get, capture
that old Marvel aesthetic,

00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.810
and it's a masterpiece, really.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:00.110
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I agree.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:02.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, yeah.

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:06.220
[laughter] So 1 thing I want to
ask you guys about is, you know,

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.760
it's, to different degrees,
you're working with editors,

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.310
but when you're telling
personal stories,

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.240
you need certain
amount of freedom.

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.340
Do you feel like once
you have a vision,

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:19.110
do you feel like you're
able to sort of push back

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:22.410
against editors, or convince
them, or be persuasive and say,

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.120
here's the vision I have?

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.840
And are there ways to do

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.060
that where they respect
you creatively?

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.400
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: There are ways

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.150
that they respect
you creatively,

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:36.790
and by way of Hip Hop Family
Tree being a New York Times best

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.900
seller, [laughter]
they seem to trust

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:43.420
that I'll be able
to sell them books.

00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:47.300
You know, like when it comes to
that realm of corporate comics,

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.770
which I'm not really
familiar with --

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:52.720
I'm just kind of visiting
-- it's all about the money.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.400
So, like, the things that I'm
doing are not so controversial

00:56:56.400 --> 00:57:01.290
that they really, I really need
much of their input or whatever.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:05.740
And to some extent, in that
universe, I am a little bit

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.110
of a prima donna where--

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:08.410
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Are you?

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:09.710
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I would
like to just work

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.630
on my own stuff in
a lot of ways.

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:15.110
So, you know, if they
push back too much,

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:16.830
then I'll just go back
and do my own thing.

00:57:16.830 --> 00:57:18.130
You know what I mean?

00:57:18.130 --> 00:57:19.920
Do Hip Hop Family Tree,
Volume 5 or something.

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:21.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.320
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.180
I feel like my editors know
a lot more than me at times.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Really?

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.780
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah.

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.080
I'm very much like, after I do
the first draft, and they, like,

00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.620
look at a scene, and they're
like, uh-uh, I'm like, okay,

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:32.920
you're probably right.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.220
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So you're
saying you're not a prima donna?

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:35.520
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I guess not.

00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:39.700
I guess I just, I know that
I'm so biased, I can't look

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.140
at my work critically at all.

00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So,
yeah, you rely on someone

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:44.490
with critical distance to say--

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:45.790
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: I do.

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.090
I do, yeah.

00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:48.390
I have to.

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:49.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:50.990
And Penelope?

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:52.290
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Oh, yeah.

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:53.590
Totally relying on my editor.

00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:54.890
I give him half of my brain
when I begin the book.

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:56.190
He knows where I'm going, and
at some point, he knows better

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:57.490
than I do because he
remembers my original idea

00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.790
where I'm totally lost

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:00.950
and confused along the
way, and he's like, focus.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:02.390
Remember. I'm like,
okay, thanks.

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:03.910
So, yeah. Totally need him too.

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:05.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:08.700
You know, to me, often, there's,
there has to be 1 point where,

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.970
you know, you just feel

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:13.740
like when you're writing,
you trust your voice.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.300
You know your voice.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.500
Have all 3 of you
gotten to places

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.820
where you know your voice?

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:21.870
You know, because we all
have, we're influenced

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:23.790
by different writers
and artists early on,

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:25.600
but then you learn to trust.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.860
Something inside
gradually emerges.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.890
You feel like you all have
reached a place where you just,

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.560
your voice is your voice
and you are very comfortable

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.860
in that place?

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.160
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah?

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.760
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu: Yeah.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.060
&gt;&gt; Tillie Walden: Yeah, I do.

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:40.360
&gt;&gt; Penelope Bagieu:
At least, yeah.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.660
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Took me
a really long time.

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:42.960
I think I was like 27, already
in the game for like 6 years

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.280
when I finally accepted
who I was.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.970
You know, I was always trying
to make comics like this or like

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:50.330
that because there was no
empirical data that the things

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:54.000
that I like, my taste levels
would resonate on the shelves

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.330
because I had nothing
to point to.

00:58:55.330 --> 00:59:00.030
So it took a lot of trust in
myself to get to that level.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:02.540
It took a while.

00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
But you're there.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:05.140
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I guess.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.740
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Never satisfied.

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.340
Well, since you're
not satisfied,

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.640
you have to stay with us.

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.940
You have to stay after
class, begin recess.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.740
But you guys, thank you so much.

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:18.510
Tillie, Penelope, please
give them a big hand.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:29.550
[ Applause ]

00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:31.540
Okay. All right.

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:33.640
There he is.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:35.760
There he is.

00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.710
Man, this book is beautiful.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.800
This is just a -- you know,
I'm going to take a minute.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:43.240
I'm going to find this book
because -- and you've got a,

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.840
you had a new one
just drop, right?

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.140
A new X-Men?

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:48.440
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: New issue
just dropped, and the,

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.200
like the second big book will
come out at the end of October.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.040
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: That was
the cool thing too, like,

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:57.710
dealing with Marvel, like,

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:00.790
they accepted the format
changes I wanted to make.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.730
Generally speaking, all the
Marvel books are of a piece.

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.030
They look the same.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:08.370
They fit next to each
other on the bookshelf.

01:00:08.370 --> 01:00:10.300
But my ego doesn't
work that way,

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.850
so I wanted the book
to be big and giant.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:16.380
And if they were going to
use my full superpowers,

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.690
they have to let me design it,

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.210
so they were accepting
of that too.

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:22.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Tell me,
you know, we talked a bit

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.270
about this, but how
does this happen?

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:27.480
I mean, this is Marvel, and
for them, it's one thing

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.400
to hire a writer to,
or an artist and say,

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.770
hey, we like your stuff.

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:36.540
You want a shot at writing a
limited run on x, so to speak?

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.290
But to say, we're going
to let you really play

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:43.510
in a huge sandbox and trust
you to go to town, I mean,

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:45.380
it's, that's a rare thing.

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.820
How does that happen?

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.620
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: When I got
the Eisner Award for,

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.780
I think it was the second
volume of Hip Hop Family Tree,

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:59.810
and you're there at the
event, they call your name,

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:04.370
and as I was walking up, I
didn't quite feel the feeling

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:07.250
of satisfaction I've been
searching for my entire life

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:08.670
in this game, and I didn't want

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:10.840
to do Hip Hop Family
Tree anymore, actually.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.430
I had about 10 pages to
go on the fourth volume,

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:16.240
and I got up there and accept
my award, and I'm like,

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.550
this didn't give me what
I, this trophy's hollow.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:20.650
You know what I'm saying?

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:21.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: The
ultimate metaphor.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:23.250
You hoist it at the event.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:24.930
You haven't even left the
San Diego Comic-Con Hall,

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:26.230
and you feel hollow.

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:27.530
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Totally.

01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:28.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.130
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: So I
put a tweet out there.

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:33.110
I drew just for pleasure for,
like, the first time in years,

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:35.940
and I decided to draw
this elaborate picture

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:38.660
of the X-Men because, like,
as a kid, I liked the comic

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.160
or whatever, and I've been
so far away from those kinds

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:48.410
of comics, I decided just
draw this thing for fun

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:49.840
since I developed some skills.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.580
I have never drawn any
of that superhero stuff.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:52.910
And it was a lot of fun.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.030
Put a tweet out into
the universe and said,

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:56.790
Marvel should just let
me make whatever kind

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:59.810
of X-Men comic I feel like
making, just like that.

01:01:59.810 --> 01:02:01.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So you
weren't even tweeting at Marvel.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.000
You were just tweeting
to the universe,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.440
so to speak, the
Marvel universe.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.560
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, because I
never thought about doing work

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.880
for Marvel in any way.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:10.800
Like, as a cartoonist,
you make comic books.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:12.100
Like, you don't need
to be paired

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:14.240
up with a writer or artist.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.540
You know, like--

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You do it all.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.140
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Just, yeah.

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.440
So I make comic books.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So how long
did it take to hear from Marvel?

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.040
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Like an hour.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.340
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.640
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, yeah.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.940
It was pretty cool.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
The game has changed.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.540
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah,
it was pretty cool,

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:29.840
and I let them know that, you
know, this is what I would do.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.260
The X-Men, for those who don't
know, it's a very sprawling,

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.250
kind of convoluted narrative.

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.830
It goes all over the place,
and there's a lot of confusion

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.030
in those comics,
which is actually kind

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.800
of like what I liked
about it when I was a kid,

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.060
but it takes a lot of work
to parse through all of that.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:49.680
So my idea was to take, you
know, the first 30 years

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.040
of those comics --
that's the stuff

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.450
that I liked when I was a boy--

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.050
This is Chris Claremont
stuff, right?

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:56.350
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, the
Chris Claremont era.

01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.650
And when he left the--

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:58.950
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
X-Men fans here?

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:00.250
Any fans of -- yes.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:01.550
Nice.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:02.850
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Whoa, way
more than I thought.

01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:04.150
That's awesome.

01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:05.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:06.750
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: When he left
the series, I left the series

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.050
and graduated to, you know,

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.780
Fantagraphics and
stuff like that.

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.850
So they liked the idea,
and I'm quite sure

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:15.660
that they would've liked me
to have done it, you know,

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.450
inside of a year or
something, but 240 pages,

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:21.770
doing the whole kit and
caboodle, it takes a while, man.

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.230
So it's 3 years.

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:26.260
I'm good for like 80
to 90 pages a year.

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
You know your rate.

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.860
You know how to pace.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:30.160
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
You know how to pace.

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:32.760
Well, let's talk about
Hip Hop Family Tree.

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.770
I mean, this is just
from Fantagraphics.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:38.330
It's, you know, it's just
gorgeous, but also, like,

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:42.600
I have a Post colleague,
Washington Post colleague

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.140
who is working on a big
hip-hop book now that came

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:49.480
out of an article, and whenever,
you know, hip-hop is still,

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.800
people are so passionate about
it, and even though it's been

01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.690
around for so many decades, so
many aspects of it feel so fresh

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:59.230
to people that they, you
really can't get it wrong.

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:00.950
If you get anything
a little bit wrong,

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:02.280
you're going to hear from it.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.450
So credibility is
everything, just starting out.

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:08.320
And so you had to
really do your homework.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.260
I mean, you can't
just wiki that.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.560
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: No.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.150
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You really
-- can you talk about, this is,

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:17.630
just from a research standpoint,
was a mammoth undertaking.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:19.270
Can you talk about doing that?

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:20.570
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, for sure.

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:22.070
I mean, with both
of these projects,

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:24.040
there's just all
this back-end work

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.480
that doesn't get
seen on the page.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.780
And with--

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: All
behind the curtains.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.650
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yep, and with Hip
Hop Family Tree, you're right.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.460
You have to have
some credibility,

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:34.950
and it has to feel organic.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:36.420
It has to feel authentic, man.

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:40.280
Like, that phony
stuff will not fly.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.750
So my kind of solution to that
with Hip Hop Family Tree was

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.820
to kind of dull the
strips out online first

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.810
to just have even a
fresh set of eyes.

01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:57.000
Like, you know as well as I do
that the anonymous commenter

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.320
on the internet is
very quick and happy

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:03.170
to let you know if/when
you got something wrong.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:06.010
I'm very happy to say that
that just has never come up in,

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:08.200
like, in the comments on--

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
That's amazing,

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.800
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Online
because I really did try

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.190
to make my research as
bulletproof as possible.

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:18.580
And when we first met, you
brought up the word, like,

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.510
"journalism" and using
a journalist process.

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:22.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You're
doing comics journalism.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.110
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: And I never
thought of it as that.

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:28.350
I just didn't, I just wanted
to have artillery in the pocket

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:31.730
in case somebody said something
weird, and then I could just,

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:35.370
like, present the materials that
I used to put my comic together.

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:36.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Well, here's the thing.

01:05:36.670 --> 01:05:38.490
I mean, and we know
beefs are still happening

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:40.890
about who gets credit
for what, right.

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:44.470
I mean, we can't seem to resolve
[inaudible] Marvel Comics what

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:49.730
Stan Lee gets credit for versus
Jack Kirby versus Steve Ditko,

01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:53.200
or Gene Cullen [phonetic], or
Marie Severin, who just died.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.500
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah,
rest in peace.

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:55.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: May
she rest in peace.

01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.100
She was legend, and
she was there.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.290
She worked her way up
from colorist all the way

01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:01.120
up to co-creating Spider-Woman.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:04.080
Or, you know, we just
lost Marvel editor

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.550
and creator Gary Friedrich,
who co-created Ghost Rider.

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:10.220
So if you can't parse
that out in a,

01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.940
in the Marvel method system,
hip-hop trying to parse

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:16.990
out who gets credit for
what beat and doing what

01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:19.020
when they're all in
that creative caldron

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.620
at the beginning, and you

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.000
in some ways are
having to officiate.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.630
You're kind of, drawing
that is kind

01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:25.390
of refereeing that a little bit.

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.270
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, but I
hedge my bets in ways too.

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:29.250
So like in that first
hip-hop book,

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:32.180
I believe there are no
less than 3 or 4 guys

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:35.860
who I allow the space to
claim the creator of--

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.460
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Hip-hop.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
then, did you ever hear

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.060
from one or the other?

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:42.360
Like, hey, that's not my take.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.660
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Sure, yeah.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.090
Like, after the first volume,
which was largely constructed

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:52.640
from found materials, that's
when I started to get the calls

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.570
about just like, okay, when
you start to cover me, like,

01:06:56.570 --> 01:07:00.450
let's talk, and then, you know,
I'll give you the full story.

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:04.460
But the way that hip-hop works,
so you have your, you know,

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:07.710
Malcolm Gladwell, 10,000
hours in interviewing.

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:12.720
I don't. So these guys were
trying to run all over me,

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.000
and the way hip-hop works, you
have to puff your chest out,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.320
and you have to take command,

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.700
and you have to be
the alpha dog.

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.420
And I just know that I
was being told fictions.

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.800
And I would just say, like,
man, that's a wild story.

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.340
I love it.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.430
Is there anybody
else on this planet

01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:30.430
who could corroborate
what you just told me?

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:31.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Yeah, second stories.

01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:33.030
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Anybody else, man.

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:34.980
And it would always
come back sort of, no.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.280
Oh, you don't believe me.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.730
And it's just like, it
was pretty wild, man.

01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:39.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:40.330
So you're getting fake news.

01:07:40.330 --> 01:07:41.630
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Fake news.

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:42.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.230
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah,
before it was trendy.

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:45.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs]
Well, can you talk about it?

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:47.460
I mean, you ended up, you're
either going to hear back,

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.130
you're going to hear back one
way or the other, and not just

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:51.650
from anonymous commenters.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.450
You're going to hear back
maybe from an Ice Cube,

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:55.410
maybe from a Grandmaster Flash.

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:56.710
Can you talk about what it was

01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:00.280
like to have certain
people really who were there

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.820
in the closer [inaudible]
at the beginning

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:04.470
or who were really big
and say, you got it?

01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:07.470
Or just even offhandedly,
go look at this.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:08.770
What was that like?

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.660
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Oh,
it was incredible.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:12.990
You know, I operate in a vacuum.

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:16.050
I don't work closely with any
editors or anything like that.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.110
My entire process has
always been just sit down,

01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:21.670
make the comic, see which
publisher likes it the best,

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:24.350
and then move forward
from there.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.620
So putting the strips
out online,

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:30.070
it became a really fun game
almost week in, week out,

01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:33.170
where I would just kind of
look online and see, oh,

01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:36.810
so this famous rapper
tweeted the comic or that.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.900
I mean, the success of
the series is really in,

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:43.530
thanks in great part
to the kind of word

01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:46.260
of mouth that, you
know, Ice Cube--

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What's,
yeah, I was going to --

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.490
what's one of the coolest
things you saw that was like,

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:51.490
whoa, okay, so-and-so--

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:53.500
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, well,
this photo right here, man,

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.700
this is Fab 5 Freddy,
the host of Yo!

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:59.040
MTV Raps from when,
you know, I was a kid.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.780
Like, you know, when, I
didn't take this photo.

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.080
You know what I mean?

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:05.270
This was just something that
was online that, you know,

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.110
I was tagged in on Twitter
or something like that.

01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:08.870
So when I see things like
this, it blows my mind.

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:12.600
The most popular strip was
definitely this one that I did

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:18.170
about how Ice Cube met Dr.
Dre at like a backyard cookout

01:09:18.170 --> 01:09:21.500
in the super early '80's.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:26.040
And when Ice Cube
spread the strip out like

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.480
on his social media
platforms, you know, his people

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.640
or whatever, he took
ownership of it.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.610
So he said, hey, read this
comic about when I met Dre.

01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:37.930
So it wasn't like,
look at this bullshit.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:39.390
You know, pardon my French.

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:41.400
It was like, yeah, this is,

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.880
check out this comic
about when I met Dre.

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.790
And it just, it spread
like wildfire.

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:46.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and
that's the kind of thing,

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:48.640
the kind of recommendation
like when you say to a friend,

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.710
you know, that isn't, you
don't need a hype man.

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:53.310
That's just a friend saying to
a friend, check this out, which,

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:56.500
in a way, has a lot more, you
know, a lot more influence.

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:57.800
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Never took
it for granted, man.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.100
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.400
That's the way to do it.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.700
So look at that.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.000
And look at, now, am I wrong?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.300
You know, so you're
nodding to Marvel.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.250
Is that a little bit of
like a Kirby crackle there,

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.890
a little nod to Jack Kirby?

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:09.190
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Oh, for sure.

01:10:09.190 --> 01:10:11.580
At any moment, like, I
wanted this comic to look

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.450
like it was ripped from that
time period that I was covered,

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:18.910
so it's like late '70's, early
'80's, and try to capture

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.880
that aesthetic as
much as possible.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:23.480
And you even captured, like,
you didn't want to do it

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.780
on a slick white paper.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.210
You wanted that sort
of tan, weathered,

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.050
6-month old comic
book aesthetic, right?

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:31.350
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:35.670
I just like that look and feel
of a well-read, old comic book.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:38.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
yeah, which, in a way too,

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:41.670
is great because old
album covers, you know,

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.890
they get a little
weathered, and so part of it,

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:45.940
you feel like you're, like,
holding a weathered comic book,

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.230
but also, some of these are
so evocative of the time,

01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:51.170
you feel like you're
holding an old album cover.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:55.010
People remember vinyl or new
people use, buy vinyl now.

01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:56.550
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Down to
the paper that the,

01:10:56.550 --> 01:11:01.020
those books were printed on was
a design choice that I made.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:05.590
Like, I called and got in touch
with several Chinese publishers

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:08.620
to try to get the
exact perfect paper.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:11.190
And the biggest compliment
whenever I'm at a signing

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.790
or anything like that,
when I see people kind

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:15.100
of like rubbing my books.

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.200
Like, even subconsciously,
it's a big compliment.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.390
And if we're going to, you know,
chop down trees to make books,

01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:24.740
like, might as well make
very tactile experiences,

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:27.330
like the most beautiful
books possible.

01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:29.840
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Yeah, and I should,

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:32.660
reminds me all these
authors will be signing,

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:34.300
so if you haven't
gone to the, you know,

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.190
you should go to their signing.

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:37.790
When is your signing,
by the way?

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:39.390
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I think it's
like five thirty to six thirty.

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:40.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.290
So if you go to his signing,
make sure to rub your book,

01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:44.340
and he'll check it out.

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:45.640
[laughter] So--

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.080
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Well, now, that
would just be pandering now.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.380
You don't have to.

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: It would.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.360
So, but you can see that
weathered aesthetic, but,

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.540
I mean, so can you talk about,
you know, you're evocative

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:59.910
of Claremont's X-Men and getting
to play with the superheroes?

01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:02.550
And, I mean, you
really, I think,

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:05.650
it seems like you're
referencing, you might,

01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:09.680
like hundreds of comics
and dozens, and dozens,

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.170
and dozens of characters.

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:14.690
I mean, you're going deep with
little nods here and there.

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:17.670
You talk about, it seems
like Hip Hop Family Tree,

01:12:17.670 --> 01:12:20.380
you're really, you're going
deep with the knowledge.

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:25.180
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, it took
about 8000 pages of material.

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.380
You know, it's 30
years of comics,

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.160
not just from the main series,
but there are tangential series

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.500
and all sorts of
things like that.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.250
About 8000 pages of material.

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:39.340
Cull all of that down
into a 240-page story

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.730
with a satisfying beginning,
middle, and ending, you know,

01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:44.690
like not that bait and switch
of cliffhanger at the end.

01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:45.990
Come back next month.

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:48.190
See how they get
out of that scrape.

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:50.320
Leave on another cliffhanger.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:53.390
So I, when I started
this project, I got,

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:56.210
I bought the biggest kind

01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:58.980
of bulletin board
that money can buy.

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:04.660
It's like as big as a school, as
a elementary school chalkboard.

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.970
And I just sort of
put it on its side

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:08.610
and got all these note cards

01:13:08.610 --> 01:13:10.890
as I was making notes
along the way.

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.900
And, you know, red
yarn string from this

01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:15.560
and pushpin to that one.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.860
And this very--

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Almost like
the way you track a mob family.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.660
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Exactly.

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.200
It, like, it was like, you
know, the Barksdale family tree

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.070
or something like
that in The Wire.

01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:28.560
And, but it would
be these phrases

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:33.110
that would just sound totally
insane read all by themselves.

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:35.950
So, like, I was praying that,
you know, I just wouldn't die

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:37.870
in a car crash or
something like that.

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:40.400
My parents have to
clean out my house,

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.270
and then they see this bulletin
board full of these notes

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:45.890
that say something like,

01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:49.090
the shadow king was sexually
transmitted to his son, or,

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:51.800
and then, like, you know,
my parents might think

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.330
that they dodged a bullet.

01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:55.150
You know, it's like,
oh, it's good.

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.140
It's good he's off the streets.

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But then, they
would say, he was a cartoonist,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.320
and that explains it all.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:02.600
You get away with so much when
you're a cartoonist, right.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.520
Your research material.

01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:06.790
But, I mean, and this
is just gorgeous.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:10.100
Do you have a favorite
X-Men artist?

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.400
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I don't.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.810
Like, they definitely,
they being Marvel,

01:14:13.810 --> 01:14:16.890
definitely hired the
top talent of the day

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.530
to draw their comics
or whatever.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:22.100
And, yeah, I, you know,
there's a million of those guys

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.900
that I like, and it's all
for different reasons.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.570
So you were nodding -- so was
there, when it comes to X-Men,

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:32.900
if you had to bookend certain
years that really influenced you

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:35.670
and you really were
nodding to more than others,

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:36.970
what would you say sort of a--

01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:38.990
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: You know, I don't
know what years these things

01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:43.000
came out, but it would be
Issue like say 108 to 137.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.730
Late, mid '70's.

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:47.860
The John Byrne, Chris
Claremont era.

01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:50.360
And that's the, those
are the comics that all

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:52.560
of these movies kind
of derive from.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.500
And I kind of think of that the
stuff that Chris Claremont did

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.630
in his early career
on the X-Men,

01:14:59.630 --> 01:15:01.780
he created a pretty
astounding piece

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.720
of kind of modern mythology.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.940
And part of my take on this
project is the way mythology

01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:11.350
works, it has to be
kind of reinterpreted,

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.520
almost like a sort of
a game of telephone.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:19.400
So in a world now where I,
like, just walking here, like,

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:24.150
I see people with, like,
Avengers shirts on, and, like,

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.580
when I grew up, like, Avengers
was as corny as can be.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:29.880
Like, the X-Men were
like the pirates,

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.020
and the Avengers
were like the Navy.

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:34.030
So I have to--

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:36.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Whoa, hold on.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.920
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Well,
I'm just saying, like,

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.250
they were just more
punk rock, more outlaw.

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:41.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yes.

01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:42.850
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: So I just have
to remind everybody, like,

01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:44.150
kind of how cool the X-Men are.

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:45.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:47.290
No, Avengers Assemble
sounded cornier before.

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:50.550
And are you a fan of the --
I mean, the Avengers, yeah --

01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:53.010
are you a fan of the
X-Men films at all?

01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:54.650
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I've seen them
all, but I kind of, like,

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:56.460
as soon as I leave the
theater, I forget about it.

01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.990
You know, just go there with
friends and kind of hang out.

01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:02.330
I like it at the time, but
I'm not one of those people

01:16:02.330 --> 01:16:05.020
who sees a movie that's
based off of a book,

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.330
and I complain that, like,
oh, they got it wrong.

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.000
Like, it's a different medium.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, your
childhood wasn't ruined.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.000
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: That's, and
that's what I say to people,

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.110
like the old, kind of
like basement-dwelling,

01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:17.580
neckbeard guys who mess around.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.240
Like, I'm like, listen, I'm
not coming to your house

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.540
and burning your old comics.

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.290
Like, if you don't like
it, just don't read it.

01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:25.670
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, so we
apologize if you are in the Navy

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:27.450
and are a neckbeard guy.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.810
The twofer.

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:30.140
We're really--

01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:32.100
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Nah,
the Navy's cool.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:37.000
I'm just saying it's, I'm
just saying that it's--

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Not the neckbeard.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.740
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: You know, square.

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.040
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.340
[laughter] The, we
talked about you getting,

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.640
I know you don't
need affirmation,

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.330
but getting confirmation
from the hip-hop community,

01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:52.690
from old X-Men guys who
worked on the X-Men books and,

01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:54.820
or anyone else from
the Marvel world.

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.320
Have you gotten sort of
that kind of, I don't know,

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.530
not affirmation, but just
sort of positive reaction?

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:07.910
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: The answer would
kind of be not no, but just,

01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:09.880
it's just like a baseline.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.270
Like, I got to spend a lot
of time with Chris Claremont,

01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:16.550
and my approach when
dealing with him --

01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:19.290
now, Chris Claremont
wrote this comic for,

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:20.950
like, almost 17 years.

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:23.180
It's his baby.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:26.340
So my approach when dealing
with Claremont was almost like,

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:29.030
I felt like I was kind
of dating his daughter.

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.870
So I just, as a student of this
form, you know, I don't pretend

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:36.710
to know everything, and I
consider myself to be a student.

01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:38.010
I shut my mouth.

01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:39.310
I opened my ears.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:40.640
And I just receive
information, you know.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.940
So it was, you know,
senpai, kohai kind of thing.

01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.240
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:50.070
And in terms of the artistic,
I mean, how did you approach,

01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:54.040
are there certain ways --
you know, you're so specific.

01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.880
You remind me of, like, when I
talk to someone like Chris Ware,

01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:00.790
and if it comes back, if it
ships back from, say, China,

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:02.660
and just he can see, you know,

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:06.860
colors just on page
93, building stories.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:10.080
Just something, they
didn't quite nail it.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.930
But now, instead of, like,
working with Fantagraphics,

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:16.930
working with Marvel, when it
comes to the art, the printing,

01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:20.060
lettering, is there anything
that, does it all feel the same,

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:22.030
or is there something
you've had to adjust to?

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:23.870
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: It feels pretty
much the same, but the thing is,

01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:26.750
you know, working with
a Fantagraphics, you're,

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:29.830
I get to work with the
people who have kind

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.240
of skin the game, so to speak.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:33.800
Like, the people who are there,
like, investing their money

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:38.540
into the product, and they
want this book to be true

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.220
to the vision that
it's supposed to be.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:44.130
With Marvel, it's been a
long time since, you know,

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:45.430
Martin Goodman was there.

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:48.430
And then, the closest relation
to the originator was Stan Lee,

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:51.280
and he hasn't been in the mix
for a really long time either.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.590
So it's all, you know,

01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:56.160
just people who are
going to their job.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.460
They have a certain
passion for it,

01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.760
but you can absolutely tell the
difference that, like, you know,

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.480
Disney money is being spent
on this rather than, like,

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:09.090
the money from my own
pocket kind of thing.

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.770
That said, the people
that I work

01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:15.360
with there are totally behind me
making the most beautiful books

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:17.040
that we can.

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:21.060
So we're able to get, you know,
proof copies way ahead of time

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:24.000
so that I could adjust
things and, you know,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.660
have a lot of say
in the paper stock.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:28.730
Like, all of these kind of
back-end elements to just try

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.580
to make, like, a
really solid unit.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
Yeah, absolutely.

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:37.110
And these covers, and
so to have such control

01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:40.000
over the covers because, you
know, you have top writers

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.440
and artists working
for the big 2.

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.250
They don't, they might not
have any say over the cover.

01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:47.830
So the fact that you get
sort of not only, you know,

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:51.630
beginning to end process and
cover to cover, it's all you.

01:19:51.630 --> 01:19:54.770
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Part of the
idea is to make these,

01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:58.480
this Grand Design thing kind
of the definitive X-Men comic,

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.400
a comic that you can
point to and give somebody

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.480
if they were curious
about the X-Men.

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:06.000
And now, the comic books
have different covers

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.650
than what we're seeing appear.

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:10.390
And that, those comics
have a different kind

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:11.690
of distribution mechanism.

01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:13.190
They go to comic shops.

01:20:13.190 --> 01:20:16.610
So the guys at the comic shops,
they want to see cool costumes,

01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:20.140
and, you know, muscles,
and whatever.

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:26.030
These books are in regular
bookstores, you know,

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:27.640
at Barnes &amp; Noble or whatever.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.360
So what I want to communicate
with the covers of the big books

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.400
that have, like, a
wider distribution,

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.410
I need to get the
concept across, like,

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:39.170
as fast as possible, and that's
the spirit with these things.

01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:43.530
And so it's less about just, you
know, putting, stacking bodies

01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:45.430
and fight scenes or whatever.

01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:49.270
Just communicate the idea in
as quick a fashion as possible.

01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:50.570
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:54.530
And, you know, Rob Liefeld,
the Deadpool creator, I mean,

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:57.680
what he called the way you did
is he calls the perfect primer,

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.390
or some people say
"primer," for young and old

01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:01.830
if you want to learn X-Men.

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.950
Do we have anyone here
considers themself young?

01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:07.460
Anyone? Anyone?

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.760
Oh--

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.060
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I see a youngster.

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: How about old?

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.660
Anyone consider?

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.960
Old, but you--

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.260
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: We got a lot
of middle agers, it seems.

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:16.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, wow.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.860
That's, so this, no,
this book is so for you.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:19.160
It's just beautifully done.

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.310
So, you know, is it, knowing
how you work, you know,

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:28.420
you're not the type to
sign an Aaron Rodgers deal

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:30.900
and commit yourself to,
or [inaudible], you know,

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.660
to Marvel for 5 years.

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:35.570
You're not going to do a James
Bond thing and be locked in.

01:21:35.570 --> 01:21:39.330
What, how far out do you
see going with Grand Design?

01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:41.150
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I'm working
on the last 2 issues.

01:21:41.150 --> 01:21:44.720
It'll take me until next
summer, but, you know, that's,

01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.110
this is what I have
to offer them.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:47.800
You know, like I try --

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.750
thankfully, the Hip Hop
Family Tree thing really blew

01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:53.210
up in a way that I
could really pick

01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:56.220
and choose what I'm
going to end up doing.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.700
And this is what I
could offer them.

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.210
This is all that I have
to kind of give them.

01:22:00.210 --> 01:22:02.600
And I have to go back
and just get these ideas

01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.300
that I've been having
in my head,

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:06.020
get them out there on paper.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.130
This is the example of one
of the comic book covers

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.180
that would be in
the comic shops.

01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna:
That's just beautiful.

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:15.380
And so that, was that your idea
to kind of have these covers?

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:16.680
You know, the--

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:17.980
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: It
actually wasn't.

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.310
Like, that was like a
really great contribution

01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:20.610
of the editor.

01:22:20.610 --> 01:22:24.680
I came up with some ideas that
ended up being variant covers

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.540
or whatever, but when he said,

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:29.340
what if we do 6 interconnecting
covers that just kind

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.440
of show the whole
tapestry of the--

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.740
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Is this
[inaudible] or somebody else?

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:35.590
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: It was my direct
editor named Chris Robinson.

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:36.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:38.190
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Good guy.

01:22:38.190 --> 01:22:39.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Shout
out to Chris Robinson.

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:40.790
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, and
when he came up with

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:42.250
that idea, it was a bet.

01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.730
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: These
are just beautiful.

01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:45.210
Just gorgeous.

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.510
And look at that.

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:49.410
I mean, that, you know, the
depth of field, by the way,

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:53.300
you're able to achieve, that,
you know, that's a long time.

01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:54.600
That's--

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.900
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, thanks, man.

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's
decades of skills right there.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.500
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah,
I guess, man.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.800
We've known each other
a long time, Mike.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:01.100
Goddamn.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs]
You know, like you said,

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:05.610
been in this game a minute,
and, but look at the texture,

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:10.180
the feel of the Ben-Day dots,
you know, on there, and--

01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:12.930
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, once again,
doing everything I can to try

01:23:12.930 --> 01:23:14.540
to make it look like
it was a comic ripped

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:15.880
from that time period.

01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.820
Now, this panel would've been
maybe 1 of like 10 panels

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:21.370
on a page, so that's a
very, very small panel,

01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:23.300
so that's why she looks
like she has measles.

01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.900
[laughter]

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.200
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Because
it was very, very tiny.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You're
approximating the tech

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:29.800
of the time, you
know, what you had,

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.100
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: It's very
Lichtenstein blown up that way.

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, and
the classic Snikt Wolverine,

01:23:33.260 --> 01:23:35.140
just even nodding to that.

01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.440
I love that.

01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.870
When Wolverine was still,
you know, closer to 5 feet

01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:41.580
than 6 feet and low
to the ground.

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:42.880
Yeah, and look at that.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.180
Oh, that's just gorgeous.

01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:46.470
A little more Kirby
crackle popping there.

01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:48.200
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, I'm learning
a lot just in terms of, like,

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.500
drawing this, like, action stuff

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.480
that I never even
thought to draw.

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:56.510
It, everything I do is kind
of just like an education.

01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:59.080
And playing around with
this superhero stuff,

01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:03.390
it's like now I can't really,
like, fake my anatomy as much.

01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:06.510
You know, like I would
be raked over the coals

01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:08.120
by the superhero fans.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.560
So it's like I'm kind of
learning on the job to try

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.710
to get more dynamic
and whatever,

01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:14.180
for this project, you know.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.010
Of course, it's required
for this, but--

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:17.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: If
you're going to, like,

01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:18.900
foreshorten an arm and
do something like that,

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:21.500
you're going to have to
nail it, and, you know,

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:26.010
Kirby could go bold, but
still had to be true.

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:27.360
This is just, look at that.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.310
That's just, that's gorgeous.

01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:31.610
So what is, what's next for you?

01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:36.040
Because I know every project
for you is a project of passion.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.340
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: It's true.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:38.640
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.940
Do you know what's
coming up on, for you?

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.240
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I definitely
do, and there's,

01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:44.550
it's a subject matter that's
really not been covered much

01:24:44.550 --> 01:24:47.490
in -- it's very, there's some
new stuff that's happening

01:24:47.490 --> 01:24:49.700
in our culture, and I
just don't want to say

01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:52.790
because I can't let some
other schmuck beat me to it.

01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:54.090
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: [laughs] Yes.

01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:55.390
Yeah.

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.690
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: But
I do have ideas.

01:24:56.690 --> 01:24:57.990
I have a ton of them.

01:24:57.990 --> 01:24:59.290
I've been taking notes, putting
things together ahead of time,

01:24:59.290 --> 01:25:01.720
so it's like I have
62 more pages to draw.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.020
I could do 2 pages a week.

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.140
You know, once I
get done with this,

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:09.030
I'm going to just probably
go to Japan for a month,

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:10.560
and check out the scene there,

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.560
and then come back,
and get busy.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice.

01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.510
Well, do you, early on,
you were collaborating --

01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:19.080
Pekar, Harvey Pekar
and other people could.

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:22.190
But now, you, you know, you
have the creative control

01:25:22.190 --> 01:25:24.410
to do your own thing,
could you see a situation

01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:26.090
where you were collaborating
again, where you're turning

01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:27.390
over part of it to someone else?

01:25:27.390 --> 01:25:28.700
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: There are 3
people who I would work with,

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:30.390
like off the top of the bat.

01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:33.020
Like, and they're the top
dogs as far as I'm concerned.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.320
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
you can tweet this.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.730
And within an hour, maybe
they'll respond to you.

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:37.030
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Yeah, maybe.

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:38.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:41.110
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Alan Moore,
Frank Miller, Neil Gaiman.

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:43.510
Like, I would collaborate
with those guys.

01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:46.050
And then, whatever
they had in mind.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:48.080
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Alan Moore,
Neil Gaiman, Frank Miller.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.380
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Frank
Miller, yeah.

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:50.680
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I've
talked to 2 of those 3.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:53.620
They're great interviewers,
great fun.

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.600
Alan Moore, maybe
1 day, you know.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.900
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Oh, sure.

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:58.930
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: We know Harvey
Pekar's widow, Joyce Brabner,

01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:02.970
knows Alan Moore, so there
may be a way for you.

01:26:02.970 --> 01:26:04.270
Yeah.

01:26:04.270 --> 01:26:05.570
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Oh, yeah.

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:06.870
I'm not worried.

01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:08.170
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, yeah.

01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:09.540
But, you know, so, and by the
way, I always, I've asked this

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.830
of a lot of creators
because if you're any,

01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:14.490
a fan of any particular
kind of mind, often,

01:26:14.490 --> 01:26:17.990
you listen to that music to
fire you up, get you inspired.

01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:19.960
Did you listen to hip-hop while,

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.330
did you have it banging while
you were creating Hip Hop

01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:23.630
Family Tree?

01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:26.290
And what do you listen
to when creating X-Men,

01:26:26.290 --> 01:26:27.590
your version of X-Men?

01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:28.890
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I did
listen to a lot

01:26:28.890 --> 01:26:31.310
of rap music while putting
Hip Hop Family Tree together.

01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:36.010
With X-Men, I consider it to
be kind of like a true epic,

01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:37.790
so this is how I
discovered, you know,

01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:40.960
the Game of Thrones
audiobooks and stuff like that.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.230
But just a lot of podcasts.

01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:44.900
Just a lot of fiction.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:48.370
A lot of, you know, of going
through Stephen King's body

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:52.050
of work while I'm working, the,
you know, audiobooks because I,

01:26:52.050 --> 01:26:55.270
if I'm awake, I'm putting
that pencil to paper.

01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:58.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
and that gets you going.

01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:04.550
You know, I think the -- 1
last question for you is,

01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:06.490
do you remember -- many

01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:10.520
of us remember the first time
we saw something on a page

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.770
that awakened us to the
miracle of what could be created

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:16.060
on a page, whether
written, drawn.

01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:18.840
Do you remember what sort of,
what was that thing for you?

01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:21.020
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: I do, and it
wasn't a particular drawing,

01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:22.320
or words, or anything.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.530
It was the credits box
on an old X-Men comic

01:27:25.530 --> 01:27:28.490
with the name Chris
Claremont, writer.

01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:30.620
Dave Cochran, penciler.

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.970
You know, Joseph
Rubenstein, inker.

01:27:32.970 --> 01:27:36.640
And this is before I even
knew how to read words,

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.550
and I asked my mom,
what is this?

01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:40.370
And she says, okay,
this is a credit box.

01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:41.730
These are the people
who made the comic.

01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:43.300
And I thought, oh,
people make this.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:45.630
A human hand makes this comic.

01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:47.120
That's what I'm going
to do when I grow up.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.420
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
that raised the curtain

01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.720
on what you were doing.

01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:51.490
With that, we will close
the curtain here on--

01:27:51.490 --> 01:27:52.790
&gt;&gt; Ed Piskor: Thank you, guys.

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:54.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: With Eddie
P., the great Eddie P.,

01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:58.690
the Eisner-winning
Eddie P. Thank you.
