00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.590
With Captain America: Civil War about to kick
off Phase 3 of Marvel’s Cinematic Universe,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.650
many fans have been revisiting the films that
have led up to this epic battle of the titans.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.619
Disney and Marvel studio head Kevin Feige
have done an excellent job overall, but you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.279
don’t build a billion dollar franchise without
making a few mistakes along the way.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.340
Here are the 10 Biggest Movie Mistakes The
MCU Has Made So Far

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340
Ant-Man vs Falcon&nbsp;
Marvel takes every opportunity to remind us

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.340
that all of these films take place in the
same Universe, even if that means unnecessary

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.340
cameos.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.340
Ant-Man had potential to be the only true
standalone film in MCU’s Phase 2, but just

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.340
in case people weren’t sure what universe
they were in, they squeezed in an awkward

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.340
confrontation between Ant Man and secondary
Avenger Falcon.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.340
The whole scene reeks of studio notes and
reshoots.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.340
At Marvel the studio always trumps the director,
which has cost them the talents of Edgar Wright,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.340
and who knows who else.&nbsp;

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.340
2.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.340
Ed Norton as Hulk&nbsp;
The Incredible Hulk is probably the most disconnected

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.340
of all the films in the MCU, and a big part
of that is because of its lead.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.340
Edward Norton is the only Avenger who needed
to be recast after a standalone film, although

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.440
replacing him had very little to do with his
performance.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.280
Like his character in Birdman, Norton can
be as intense offscreen as he is onscreen

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.310
and had very specific ideas about the Hulk
that didn’t always line up with Marvel’s.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.329
He refused to do publicity for the film, and
wasn’t the team player the studio needed

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.430
for their Avengers initiative.&nbsp;

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.430
3.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.430
Black Widow&nbsp;
As much as we love Black Widow and Scarlett

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.430
Johansson’s portrayal of her, the movies
seem to have a difficult time knowing what

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.430
to do with her.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.430
Black Widow is primarily a utility player
used to fill in plot holes and tick boxes.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
Her relationship with the other Avengers seems
to depend on whose movie she’s in.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.430
Always the bridesmaid, never a bride, we all
know Black Widow could hold her own in a standalone

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.430
movie if they just gave her a chance.&nbsp;

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.430
4.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.430
No stakes&nbsp;
With so many mini franchises feeding into

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.430
this mega franchise, it’s become like a
towering Jenga game that Marvel is afraid

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.430
will topple if they remove one block.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.430
We’re a dozen films in and even though the
fate of many has been at stake every time,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.430
they’ve still only killed off minor characters
like Agent Coulson and Quicksilver, only one

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.430
of whom stayed dead.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.430
They wouldn’t even follow through on deaths
like Nick Fury in Winter Soldier or Pepper

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.430
Potts in Iron Man 3, even though these wouldn’t
have had a very large ripple effect.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.430
While Marvel doesn’t need to be as dark
or serious as DC, we still need to feel these

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.430
characters are at risk if we’re expected
to remain invested.&nbsp;

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:14.430
5.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.430
Steve Rogers' CGI Body&nbsp;
To show Steve Roger’s pre-serum body in

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.430
Captain America: The First Avenger the filmmakers
used CGI to put Chris Evans’ face onto another

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.430
actor’s body.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.430
It’s an advanced technique that sometimes
comes off as crude and unfinished.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.430
In some scenes you can barely notice it, but
there are times when it becomes strange, distracting,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.430
and almost humorous.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.430
Even if you’re not supposed to take Rogers
seriously for the first third of the movie,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.430
The First Avenger would have benefitted from
a little more time in the post production

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:23.430
lab.&nbsp;
6.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.090
Terrence Howard
It’s still a little unclear what happened

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:39.610
with Terrence Howard that caused him to be
replaced by Don Cheadle as Colonel Rhodes

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.400
for the second Iron Man and subsequent Avenger
films, but there’s clearly some bad blood

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400
there.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:57.880
Howard is known for being a little eccentric
so many of suspected his on set behaviour

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.299
could have had something to do with it.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.060
On several occasions Howard has blamed Robert
Downey Jr. and his big pay raise between films

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.690
for muscling him out.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.480
Regardless of the reason, the superb Cheadle
is almost five films into his Marvel run and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.200
nobody seems to miss Howard.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200
7.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.090
“I’m always Angry”&nbsp;
Avengers was the first film that really made

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.340
the Hulk work.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.870
Like Ruffalo’s Banner, director Joss Whedon
learned how to control the Hulk and use him

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430
for good as opposed to just having an out
of control rage monster.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.200
When Banner shows up for the final battle,
he reveals his secret to taming the Hulk:

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.840
He’s always angry.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.840
It sounds cool and has become a highly quotable
line, but it actually poses more questions

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840
than it answers.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.129
How did he turn the one thing that triggers
the Hulk into something that subdues him?

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:46.970
Why is he so mad all the time?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.690
Fortunately he punches out a giant space whale
before we can think too much about it.&nbsp;

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.690
8.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.210
Whiplash
It’s been said a superhero movie is only

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.060
as good as its villain, perhaps this is why
Iron Man 2 catches so much flack.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.420
Ivan Vanko aka Whiplash was a strange choice
for Iron Man’s second outing.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.569
Vanko is supposed to be as brilliant as Stark,
so it seems odd that after figuring out the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.960
tech that powers the Iron Man suit that he
would apply it to something as basic as whips.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.610
Everything about the character, from his his
motivation, to his look, to Mickey Rourke’s

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.340
weird Russian accent just didn’t mesh for
audiences.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.640
In the end it was Sam Rockwell’s more comedic
villain Justin Hammer who was the more amusing

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640
foil.&nbsp;

00:03:22.640 --> 00:04:25.490
9.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.009
Tacked on Love Stories&nbsp;
It seems like to matter how many worlds are

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.949
colliding, origin stories being told, or crossovers
being justified, there’s always time for

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:34.949
a little love.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.300
These subplots usually feel unnecessary and
shoehorned in.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.409
The most blatant example of this would probably
be the relationship between Thor and Jane

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.249
Foster, which isn’t developed at all but
we’re just supposed to accept.

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:49.460
Marvel has no shortage of strong female characters,
they just came seem to find strong stories

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.569
for them.&nbsp;

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:51.569
10.

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.009
Spoiling Spidey in Civil War Trailer&nbsp;
As exciting as the trailers for Captain American:

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.839
Civil War make it look, there’s an overshadowing
sense that we’ve seen it all already.

00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:02.900
The main event is the Avengers fighting one
another, but even that we’ve seen.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.479
Perhaps this is why they felt the need to
show the addition of fan favourite Spider-Man

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:07.899
in the second trailer.

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:11.449
This is the kind of reveal that should be
saved for the first time you see the film.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.849
It would be a moment that would make audiences
cheer in the theatre, but now it’s just

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.039
something they’ll wait for.

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.060
It’s hard to imagine Civil War containing
any surprises that would be as big or fun

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.060
as that one.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.350
I guess the execs got a little too excited
about finally coming to an agreement with

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.240
Sony to use the wall crawler and slung their
web too soon.&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.399
While we love what Marvel has done with their
cinematic universe, nobody is perfect, but

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:36.059
at least they seem to be learning from their
mistakes as they perfect the formula they

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:37.159
helped invent.

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.110
What MCU missteps bothered you?
