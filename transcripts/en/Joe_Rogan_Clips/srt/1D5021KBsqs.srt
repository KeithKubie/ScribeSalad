1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,890
It is not what they'll
cover that was on the show.

2
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:05,820
They're not going to cover this, the
meat. Okay. Cause this is not my opinion.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,850
This is the real research that I have
heard that up that I have talked to army

4
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:15,810
generals, commanding generals,
major generals, general generals,

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,020
CIA, everybody. And they're all 100%. Uh,

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,540
and I thought it was a sigh out
before and that I've researched it.

7
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:25,350
I've talked to hundreds of people now,
not on there,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,220
but I'm gonna make a film on this
who've taken Iowasca and DMT.

9
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,240
I've not taken it.
And B for obvious reasons.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,860
And uh,

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,790
and it's unbelievable because I mean,

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,820
they 100% in San Francisco is the main
project site literally have an alien base

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,890
and they are literally communicating and
they've got like astronaut level people

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,240
taking super hardcore levels of drugs
and going into meetings with these things

15
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:57,450
and making intergalactic
deals. And that, and again,

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,300
that's what the government believes and
says they're doing who this isn't that

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,360
when you say the government, that's
a broad stroke. You're painting,

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,670
you're using a broad brush. Like,
what do you mean by the breakaway?

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,110
Rogue intelligence agencies.

20
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:12,570
So we you're saying is essentially
that the using psychedelic drugs to

21
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:16,710
communicate with interdimensional beings.
Alright, that's spirit guides. Okay.

22
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,000
Everyone,

23
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,740
everyone who's done a high dose of
psychedelic drugs has had this experience.

24
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,160
So everyone is listening to you right
now who's done DMT or done five grams of

25
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:30,960
siliciden.
They know that this is a,

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,790
you have some kind of communication
with something else. The question is,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,390
is that something else inside your
psyche or is that something else?

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,010
A chemical Herto crochet.

29
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,930
Is there a chemical doorway inside the
mind that opens up in the belief is that

30
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:49,620
when you die, and this is what the
afterlife is, that when you die,

31
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,040
your brain redeemed,
produces these chemicals,

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,850
these chemicals open up this doorway
and this is the portal to the next

33
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:58,830
dimension.
So you're saying,

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,610
you're saying that the government is
aware of this and they must be aware of

35
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,080
this.
They've heard enough people talk about it.

36
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:08,550
They must have done experiments on it.
[inaudible] to the universe for sure.

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,300
And people that have the courage
to experiment with these things.

38
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:16,350
And try them themselves realize that this
is such a profound experience that it

39
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:16,920
is.

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,920
It's so alien that if an alien landed
right now in our parking lot and a little

41
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,910
gray man with big black guys got out,

42
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,900
it would be nothing compared to what
I've seen on psychedelic trips. Well,

43
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:29,070
let me just tell you that

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,590
me getting under this Joe is just because
she'll, people need to understand that.

45
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:37,830
I don't know about this for a long time
and I just don't think people are ready

46
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:41,850
for it,
but a lot of folks who

47
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,150
have low oxygen and how
who and I hope brains well,

48
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:50,900
well who have sleep apnea,

49
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:53,490
have the big next big hedge
tongues go back like you and me.

50
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,470
You go down to 62% oxygen.

51
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,680
That's another time that
the brain releases DMT show.

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,680
My whole life since I was about my first
memories were every night was a DMT

53
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,890
trip show.
I basically,

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,350
I don't want this to sound arrogant.
It's not. I've seen everything. Well,

55
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:18,910
I believe that when you are dreaming
it's most likely the same chemicals that

56
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,910
are being released as well. The key
point when you go into the room sleep,

57
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:26,290
it opens the gate. Which
side is it proven? Your brain
is working in the fourth,

58
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,900
fifth, sixth dimension. And if
you can work into those images,

59
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,670
you can see beyond it. So just what
I'm trying to tell you is this,

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,990
I know you already know all this show for
your audience. Here's what's happening.

61
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,120
I'm not saying you're bad.
I never said you were in the CIA.

62
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,990
I say the CIA is on record with
Timothy leary and everybody promoting

63
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,700
hallucinogens in the 60s. They admitted
that it was a plan to try to, uh,

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,950
she would do in the public to
make them more suggestible,

65
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,080
but there's a larger program and then
they kind of backed off because he kind of

66
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,820
got out of control and
actually created some,

67
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,650
some people that were
actually fighting him. So,

68
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,970
so he didn't have the effect they want it.

69
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:05,110
So then they moved on the Iowasca
and the DMT that they promoted,

70
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,460
which good strong people that have
got compass go and have problems with,

71
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,230
but weak minded, stupid people and others.
Here's an example. This guy is smart. Uh,

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,210
Eric, uh, cal Mueller, syndicated radio
host. I've known him like 15 years.

73
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,450
You just lost me. Well, I'm going to
tell you the story you said. He's smart.

74
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,150
He's a nice guy. I'm just kidding.
He's a smart guy. Don't be man.

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,860
I've been on his show before. I'm
like, like she likes it. I like him to,

76
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm just asking around. He will
everybody say everybody is on this quest.

77
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,800
And I told you, I've talked to like a
hundred people. I've talked to more.

78
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,080
There's a lot of people
are going and doing these,

79
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,900
the DMT and Iowaska trips outside Austin,
they're doing them all over the place.

80
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,763
Yes.

81
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,180
And I'm on a show and he's told me the
same story everybody tells you about

82
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:48,340
being in Peru or being,
you know, Costa Rica.

83
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,620
You went to two trips down
there and he shed. Yeah. Um,

84
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,910
we're sitting there and we
take the Iowasca and then
all these basically elves,

85
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:01,090
aliens come out of the woods and
we're all seeing the same aliens.

86
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,770
We're all hearing the same thing and
it's like 43 of us or whatever, seeing.

87
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,820
And he goes, but it was the drugs effect
on our brains. No, no, no. A drug.

88
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,080
Everyone sees something different.

89
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:16,350
When you open a gate and
now interdimensionally your
brain's already filtering

90
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,450
out most stuff because you can't handle
it. Your eyes are already seeing,

91
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:22,300
I'm like a cat when it's like
seeing something in or a dog will,

92
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:22,870
you know when they.
