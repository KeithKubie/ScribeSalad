00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.420
RACHEL SMITH: Please
welcome J.L. Collins.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.631
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:18.630
J.L. COLLINS: Thank you.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.838
RACHEL SMITH: You're welcome.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.100
So my first question for
you, the title of your book

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.170
is "The Simple Path to Wealth."

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.010
J.L. COLLINS: It is.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.100
RACHEL SMITH: And it's a roadmap
to financial independence

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.580
and a rich, free life.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.630
So what does wealth
mean to you, and how

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.495
is it tied to a free life?

00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:40.620
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I
suppose we could look at that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.520
in two different directions.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.230
So if we think about the
psychological part of it,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.660
to me, personally,
what wealth represents

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.730
is security and freedom.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.590
So security to protect you
from what the world can

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.890
throw at you, and freedom to
chart your own path in a way

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.920
that you couldn't do
without the resource.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.420
On the financial
point of view, I

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.130
suppose when I think about
what the benchmarks are

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.860
for are you wealthy or
not, have you achieved

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.830
financial independence
or not, what

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.270
has come to be called the
4% rule is a good guideline.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.980
That comes out of a thing
called the Trinity study.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.840
And without
belaboring that point,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.810
it simply suggests
that if you have

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.380
enough assets that
4% of that amount

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.960
can cover your
annual expenses, you

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.774
can consider yourself
financially independent.

00:01:35.774 --> 00:01:37.940
So you can work at it from
two different directions.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.480
You could say, well, I have a
million dollars, so 4% of that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.340
is $40,000.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.816
Can I live on $40,000
a year or not?

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:47.690
And therein lies the
answer to your question.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.210
Or you can look at it
from the other direction.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.990
You can say, you know, I
need $40,000 to live on.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.470
So how much do I need to
be financially independent?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.920
You multiply $40,000
by, as it happens, 25,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.200
you get a million dollars,
and there's your answer.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.845
So it really depends
on what your needs are.

00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:09.720
RACHEL SMITH: And why
is it important to keep

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.949
the path simple?

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.990
I think there are a
lot of folks tuning in

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.030
or folks in the
audience who have read

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.720
financial independence
books, and maybe their eyes

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.470
roll back in their
head, because they just

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.594
can't make sense of it all.

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:22.860
So why is it important
to keep it simple?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.651
J.L. COLLINS: Well,
that's one good reason.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.160
But the reason that I
prefer keeping it simple

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.590
is simple is simply
more powerful.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.642
Simple is what gets
you the best results.

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:36.600
And in this case, when
I talk about simplicity,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.310
I'm talking about index funds
and specifically broad-based

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.310
stock and then bond index funds
when you bring them into it.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.100
There are a lot of reasons that
simplicity is an advantage.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.770
It keeps your costs low.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.510
It keeps your life simpler.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.900
It makes things, when the time
comes, easier on your heirs.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.250
But the most important thing
is it is the most powerful way

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.680
to reach financial independence.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.870
People who come to
my blog are always--

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.330
I get two kinds of
readers of my blog.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.730
People who are really
into this stuff and they

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.040
always want to
tinker, and that's not

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.170
who I'm really writing for.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.940
I'm writing for people
like my daughter

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.370
who knows that it's
important, but she

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.770
has other things that she'd
rather do with her life

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.440
than fixate on
finances and investing.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.350
And so when you
have a simple path,

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.810
you can just get a
couple of things right.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.630
You'll have a very
powerful performance.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.850
You will outperform the vast
majority of professionals

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:33.620
out there.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.320
And I am fond of saying to
those people who want to tinker,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.770
if I thought there was a way
to successfully tinker and do

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.690
better, then that's what I would
have written the book about.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.910
And in fact, I wasted a couple
of decades trying to find that.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.590
RACHEL SMITH: So you have
a blog, jlcollinsnh.com.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.434
If folks are interested
in your content,

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:58.350
should they begin with
your blog or your book?

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.760
J.L. COLLINS: I would suggest
that if you don't know anything

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.080
about me or this concept, I
would go first to the blog.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.080
And I would go to-- there's a
button at the top called Stock

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.240
Series, and the
blog is best known

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.910
for my stock series of posts.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.910
And when you click
on that button,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.790
that will take you
to an introduction.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.860
And in that
introduction is a link

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.670
to what I think is the best
review of my stock series

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.790
that's been done--

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.790
and not best because
it's most favorable,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.040
but in my view most accurate.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.740
So you can click over to that
and read that brief review.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.041
And after reading it,
you'll know very clearly

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:38.790
whether this is going
to resonate with you

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.456
or not and whether
it's worth your time.

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:42.450
So I'd start there,
and then I would

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.255
read a couple of the posts.

00:04:44.255 --> 00:04:46.350
And then if you
like what you read,

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.570
you can consider
going on to the book.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.860
There is nothing in the
book that's not in the blog,

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.420
so you can get all
the information

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.610
just by staying on the blog.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.560
The book is more concise.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.680
It's better organized,
because the post and the blog

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.540
came organically as
they occurred to me

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.795
or were suggested.

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:07.170
And the book has the advantage
of being better organized.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.880
It's more concise.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.040
I spent more time
polishing the writing so,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.880
I hope that the writing
is more polished.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.200
But you'll make
the judge of that.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.290
RACHEL SMITH: Got it.

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.430
And thinking back to the early
days of your own investment

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.190
history, how did you
learn all this stuff?

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.929
How did you learn to invest?

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:28.720
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I
did it the hard way--

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.120
trial and error.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:39.480
I spent, as I alluded to
earlier, decades trying

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.075
to do things that were not--

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:47.420
what's seductive about
this is that they were

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.690
subpar but not bad performance.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.910
I tell people that long
before I discovered

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.090
or embraced indexed
investing, I'd

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.450
reach financial independence.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.020
So I reached financial
independence by picking stocks

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.890
and picking mutual fund
managers-- active managers--

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.800
who could pick stocks or
thought they could pick stocks.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.820
So it can be done.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.020
The problem with it is
it's more expensive.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.250
It's more time consuming.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.490
It's not as effective
as indexing.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.160
So I would have been
much better off if I'd

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.710
discovered indexing earlier.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.390
The great irony is
that Jack Bogle,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.050
who is the founder of
Vanguard and the inventor

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.260
of the first index fund
available to the public,

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.380
launched that fund in 1975.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.700
1975 was the first year
I started investing.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.550
I never heard of Jack Bogle
or Vanguard or index funds

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.960
when I started.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.480
It was 10 years before
I heard of them,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.810
and then it took me a
disturbingly long time

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.720
to embrace it.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.016
So people say, how do
you know all this stuff?

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:53.390
I it's, well,
because I made just

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.098
about-- if you can
think of a mistake you

00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:58.290
can make in investing,
I've probably made it.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.527
So to the extent that I know
anything is from my mistakes.

00:07:01.527 --> 00:07:03.110
RACHEL SMITH: So
speaking of mistakes,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.080
what do you think was working
in your favor versus working

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.232
against you as you were trying
to figure this out on your own?

00:07:09.232 --> 00:07:11.690
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I think
the main thing that was working

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.740
against me at the time and that
is working against everybody

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.390
listening to this is there
is a large industry--

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.940
Wall Street-- whose drumbeat is
counter to our best interests.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.990
And it is based on making
this as complex as possible,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.690
putting out a siren
song that you, too,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.340
can be Warren Buffett.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.970
You, too, can pick stocks.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.000
You, too, can
outperform the indexes--

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.330
only if you're willing to
pay us for the privilege.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.280
And that's a very
seductive message,

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.280
because everybody wants to think
that they can be above average

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.981
and outperform.

00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:54.480
RACHEL SMITH: You're in a room
full of above average people.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.490
J.L. COLLINS: Well, right.

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.450
But maybe not in investing.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.990
Now, the irony is if you
invest in index funds--

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.510
and, of course, the slam
that active managers

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.390
put against index investing
is that you will only

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.320
get average returns.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.590
That's a little bit misleading,
because yes, the index

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.930
gives you the return
of the market overall.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.620
But that return is
far above average.

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.330
Index investing, based on the
research that has been done,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.900
outperforms-- depending on
what numbers you look at--

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:36.260
80% to 85% of active managers
over a 15 year period of time.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.440
If you research out
30 years, the number

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.950
of active managers who
can outperform the index

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.770
is less than 1%.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.790
That's statistically zero.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.280
So when you invest in
the index and you're

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.610
getting the average
performance of the market,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.430
you're actually getting
the best performance

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.470
that you can expect
by a long shot.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:06.146
RACHEL SMITH: And so what
was working in your favor?

00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:08.020
J.L. COLLINS: I think
was working in my favor

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.070
is I continued
being curious, and I

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.720
continued trying
different things,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.760
and I continued researching.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.130
And indexing, which was
first put in front of me

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.200
in 1985 by a good
friend of mine--

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.920
there's something about it
that is very counter-intuitive,

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.680
and I think particularly
for smart people

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.500
like the people in this room
and the people listening.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.690
Because you look
at it, and you say,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:36.740
well, indexing says I buy
every stock in the index.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:41.210
And yet, if I can only just
not buy the obvious dogs,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.810
I'll outperform.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.980
I mean, outperforming seems
like it should be so simple.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.520
But the problem with that--

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.570
or even if I just buy the
top performers and not

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.240
even buy the mediocre or
the low performing ones.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.100
Obviously, I'm
going to outperform.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.750
And yet, you look
at that research

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.309
that says that doesn't happen.

00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:01.100
And of course, the
reason it doesn't happen

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.580
is today's dogs are sometimes
tomorrow's great turnaround

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.200
success stories.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.350
And those that are flying
high are the stories

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.270
of how they crash and burn.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.420
So there is no way
to know what is going

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.770
to happen with specific stocks,
and it is just way too easy

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.292
to guess wrong.

00:10:21.292 --> 00:10:23.000
RACHEL SMITH: So one
thing that struck me

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.410
about your blog and your book
is how specific the advice is.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.820
So in other books or websites
I've tried reading in the past,

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.320
the advice was
always really vague,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.990
like invest in mutual funds.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.620
And it would leave me thinking,
well, which one, and how much?

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.400
So why do you think other
authors' advice is not

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.385
very specific?

00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:47.510
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I'm
not sure I can answer that,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:51.990
because I can't put myself
in the heads of other people.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.240
Maybe I can answer
it by telling you

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.050
why my advice is what
it is, and that's

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.690
because I didn't write
this blog to have

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.130
the international audience
that I have today.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.400
It never occurred to me
that that would happen.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.480
I had started actually
writing a series of letters

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.977
to my daughter about financial
things I wanted her to know.

00:11:11.977 --> 00:11:14.060
And I shared it with a
business colleague of mine,

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.067
and he said, you know, Jim,
this kind of interesting stuff.

00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:19.400
You might want to share it
with your friends and family,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.870
and a blog would be a
good way to do that.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.690
And this is in 2011.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.080
I like the idea of a blog,
because it occurred to me

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.790
that it would be a great way
to archive the information.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.530
But I didn't have a plan to
create a blog as a business

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:38.400
or as a successful way to
reach a broader audience.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.840
It was just to archive
the information

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.610
I wanted my daughter to know.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.190
And that was basically
what mistakes

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.800
I've made, what's worked,
what's kicked me in the ass,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.740
and what I think
specifically she should do.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.800
And so I think that's why
my advice is so specific.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.400
These are the things
that I'm doing now.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.980
These are things
I wish I had done

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.210
in 1975, or at least in
1985, when I became aware

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:06.320
of indexing.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.020
These are the things
that I want her to do

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.060
and that I've got
her started doing.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:16.730
So that's maybe why my advice
is more specific than others.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.870
RACHEL SMITH: OK.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.760
I can't tell you
how many times I've

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.110
talked with a friend about
how I'm on this new track

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.610
where I'm investing, and they
say, well, what are you doing?

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.560
And I just send
them one sentence

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.210
of exactly what I'm
doing, and that's

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:30.830
what I read in your book.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.020
And they're like, that's it?

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.020
And I'm like, that's it.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.920
That's all I'm doing.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.550
So aside from telling them to
open their computer, start it

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.220
up, and what clicks to make
to log into their account,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.050
it's such simple advice.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.080
J.L. COLLINS: You know,
a year and a half,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.870
two years ago, I was
interviewed by Farnoosh Torabi

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:51.927
on her podcast.

00:12:51.927 --> 00:12:54.260
And I don't know if anybody
has listened to her podcast,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.780
but at the end of
her interview, she

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.030
likes to ask a
question that says,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:02.990
if you were suddenly given $100
million, what would you do?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.330
And the typical kind
of answers she gets

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.549
is, well, I'd buy this, that.

00:13:06.549 --> 00:13:07.590
I'd give this money away.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:08.930
I'd do that.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.730
And of course, she's
interviewing me.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.180
We're talking about index fund
investing, and specifically

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.930
VTSAX, which is Vanguard's
total stock market index

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.740
fund and the one I recommend
the most and love the best.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.120
So when she got
to that question,

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.940
she said, Jim, you've got $100
million, what would you do?

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.130
I'd put it in VTSAX.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.240
And she goes, really?

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.270
That's what you'd do?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.030
RACHEL SMITH: So one of my
favorite posts on your blog

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.740
is called "Why your house
is a terrible investment."

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.070
And I know you got a lot of
feedback from your readers

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:43.630
about this.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.710
J.L. COLLINS: Yeah,
feedback's one way to say it.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.180
RACHEL SMITH: So
why do you think

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.400
this post is so controversial?

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.560
Why do your readers get so
excited about this post?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.950
J.L. COLLINS: You know,
not me, but somebody said,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.310
home ownership is the
American religion.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:07.060
And you could go to Dealey
Plaza in downtown Chicago,

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.460
and you could set up
your little soap box.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:15.340
And you could climb up on it and
pick any major religious leader

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.370
and begin to vilify
that individual--

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:23.360
Jesus Christ, Muhammad, Buddha,
who ever-- just vilify them

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.480
in the most horrific
terms possible.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.590
And people would just
turn around and walk away.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.030
They'd ignore you.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.340
You get up on that
same box and suggest

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.860
that home ownership isn't the
perfect thing for everybody

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.330
to do, and they started
gathering rocks.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.640
So I think it's polarizing.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.610
And the people who
love their homes and

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.800
love the idea of owning a home--

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.020
that gets that response.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.370
And then there's another
segment of people

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.540
who don't like owning homes
and see value in renting,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.640
and they muster to the cause.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.210
And that's what makes that
post, to my surprise--

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:04.430
because I kind of did
it tongue in cheek.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.670
And by the way, I'm not
anti-home ownership.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.580
I've owned homes
most of my life.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.070
I am anti-believing
the propaganda

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.200
that it is always
or even commonly

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.330
a good financial decision.

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.010
It can be a great
lifestyle decision,

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.760
and that's why I bought the
houses I bought over the years.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.590
But I never once
bought them thinking

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.830
I was doing something that
was financially astute.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.480
Because unless you happen to
get lucky with a rising market--

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.050
and that does happen--

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.910
it's generally
not the best thing

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.790
you can do with your money
if financial independence is

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.152
your goal.

00:15:39.152 --> 00:15:40.610
RACHEL SMITH: And
so for the person

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.800
who is at the point
where they're considering

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.730
buying their first home or
condo, what considerations

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.192
would you advise them to
make before they do that?

00:15:49.192 --> 00:15:51.650
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I think
the first thing along the lines

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.670
with what I just said was to
understand that you are not

00:15:55.670 --> 00:16:00.530
making an investment, you're
making a lifestyle decision.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.780
In my manifesto on my
blog, one of the things

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:07.310
that I say is something to the
effect of all of our decisions

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.300
don't have to be driven by
financial considerations.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:16.490
But you should always
understand the financial dynamic

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.380
of what you're choosing to do.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.600
And I have a post
about buy versus rent

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.900
and run the numbers, which talks
you through how to do that.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.380
So I would suggest,
if you're renting now

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.070
and you're thinking of going
into a house or a condo,

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.910
that you first run the numbers
and find out exactly what it's

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.610
going to mean financially.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.716
And it might be that it's going
to be less expensive than what

00:16:39.716 --> 00:16:40.340
you're renting.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.006
That's possible.

00:16:41.006 --> 00:16:42.470
That does happen.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.090
More commonly,
you're going to find

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.580
that it's going to be more
expensive, but then you know.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.730
And just because
it's more expensive

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.670
doesn't mean that you don't
have to buy the house.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.800
It just means that
you understand

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.380
what you're paying for
the lifestyle decision

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.856
that you're making.

00:16:58.856 --> 00:17:01.230
RACHEL SMITH: And that was
one of the first conversations

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.690
we had at the Chautauqua.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.690
I wanted to tell you a
story about how I frequently

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.240
get asked, Rach, are you going
to buy a place in Chicago?

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.700
And I say, well, I read
J.L. Collins' book,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.377
and I'm cool renting for now.

00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:16.710
I told you a story about how
my refrigerator broke right

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.920
before I came to Ecuador,
and just called my landlord

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.849
and said, I need a new fridge.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:22.540
See you later.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.390
I'm going to go out of town.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.869
So other than this
post called "W

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.731
your house is a
terrible investment,"

00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:31.230
is there any other
post on your blog

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.990
that's generated a lot of
feedback or controversy

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.400
from your readers?

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.108
J.L. COLLINS: Well,
that's the one that's

00:17:37.108 --> 00:17:40.620
generated the most controversy,
because it's such a hot button

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.530
topic.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.820
Less controversial
but very popular--

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.500
probably the two
that are most popular

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.530
is "How I failed my daughter"
and "The simple path

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.040
to wealth," and that was
one of my earliest posts.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.380
And in that one post,
I kind of sum up

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:04.410
the whole content of the blog
in the book, so that's popular.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:10.410
"Why you need F-you money" is
probably at least as popular.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.980
From the reaction
of the audience,

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.731
I gather we have people
who agree with that.

00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:16.230
RACHEL SMITH: There's
a famous video

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.264
on YouTube called "The
importance of F-you money."

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:24.150
So those of you who haven't
seen it, write it down.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.780
Put your headphones
on at your desk.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.820
J.L. COLLINS: Yeah, it's
not suitable for work.

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:35.139
So just a quick aside
on that, if I may.

00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:36.930
There's a movie called
"The Gambler," which

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.670
is not a particularly
good movie,

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.500
so I'm not
recommending the movie.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.130
But there is a
wonderful segment.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.780
It stars John Goodman,
who's a wonderful actor.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.460
And there's a wonderful segment
little piece in that movie--

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.990
and you can Google that
and find this clip--

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.250
where John Goodman is
talking to Mark Wahlberg

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.950
about the importance
of having F-you money.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.410
And when I saw that
clip, I thought,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.570
I want to do a version of that.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.730
I want to keep it as
close to the original

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:13.050
as I can, but tweak it
so it reflects my values.

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:15.000
He talks about buying
a house, for instance,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.580
and we've talked about that.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.620
But my problem is, I
didn't know anybody

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.600
who could make the film.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.820
But one of the wonderful
things about Chautauqua,

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.430
which is where you
and I met, is that you

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.410
meet really cool,
interesting people who

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.650
come to Chautauqua, including
a couple of years ago a pair

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.350
of filmmakers who
were less than an hour

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:35.830
from where we
living at the time.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.060
And they came up-- and I
give you all this background,

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:42.360
because if you
choose to watch this,

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.250
it's filled with salty language
that I don't use every day.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.960
I'm acting.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.690
I'm trying to
channel John Goodman,

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.970
and he uses the same language.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.790
And if you like it, you
think I do a good job in it,

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:59.060
the credit goes to my
filmmakers, Joan and--

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.770
terrible, I'm drawing
a blank on his name.

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:07.530
But if you go to my blog and
you do the search function,

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:14.420
you'll find it, and you'll
see the credit is given.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.300
RACHEL SMITH: So we're
in the beginning of 2018,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.764
and this is a good
time for folks

00:20:18.764 --> 00:20:20.930
who are trying to get their
financial house in order

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.550
to maybe come up
with a 2018 plan--

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.320
2018 and beyond.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.840
And the amount of
investment options

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.220
is confusing and overwhelming.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:34.640
So I know a lot of folks who
are maxing out their 401(k),

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.680
because that's
very sound advice.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.390
We get the full match.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.790
They might also have an
emergency savings fund.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:42.380
But beyond those
two things, they

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.030
don't know what to do
with what's left over.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.770
And they're just keeping their
money in savings or checking,

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:51.304
or maybe they're outsourcing
the management of their money

00:20:51.304 --> 00:20:51.970
to someone else.

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:54.560
So for the folks who
don't feel confident

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.450
investing beyond just the
401(k) match and they're

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.060
just keeping their money
maybe in savings or checking,

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.920
how should they
begin to make sense

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.600
of all these different options?

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.684
How would you advise
them to get started?

00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.100
J.L. COLLINS: Well,
in a way, this

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.450
circles back to the advantage
of things being simple.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:20.030
So if you have a visual image,
let's say, of a long banquet

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.830
table that is just groaning
under the weight of every kind

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.750
of food and preparation and
dish you can possibly imagine.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:33.340
Think of that image as what
the financial community

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.100
has laid out for us and that
they want us to partake in.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.360
The problem is these are all
very expensive things that

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.610
are, for the most part,
designed for the people

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.690
who have created them and
who sell them to enrich them,

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:50.480
not necessarily
what's best for us.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.420
That's the bad news.

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.720
The good news is you
can put your arm down

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.740
on that table at one end
except for a tiny little corner

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.780
and sweep it all
under the floor,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.950
because none of that matters.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.090
Only a very small sliver
of what's out there really

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.030
matters for us in
building our wealth.

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:13.690
That's index funds, and
that's very specifically

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:19.090
broad-based stock index funds
and broad-based bond index

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.930
funds.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:24.090
I mentioned the one
that I like the best is

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:28.630
VTSAX, which is Vanguard's
total stock market index fund.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.660
More common-- and the original
fund Jack Bogle created--

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.050
is the S&amp;P 500 index fund.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.180
That's perfectly acceptable, and
the two are surprisingly close.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.360
So sometimes people get hung
up on deciding between them.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.950
If you have access to
one and not the other,

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.800
go for whichever one you have.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.340
And then there are
total bond market funds.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.750
With those two tools,
that's all you really need.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.310
It gets a little complex with
401(k) plans and 403(b) plans

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.760
for people who are not
in the private sector,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.480
because they don't always
offer those particular Vanguard

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.820
funds that I prefer.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.200
Most plans offer some
kind of broad-based stock

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.740
index, usually an
equivalent of an S&amp;P 500.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.900
It might not come from Vanguard,
which is my preferred company,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.130
but an S&amp;P 500 index fund
is pretty much the same

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.100
no matter who's providing it.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.520
Fidelity or T. Rowe Price--
those are all fine options.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.760
RACHEL SMITH: OK.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.720
And so if someone wanted
to get started this year

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.950
and they wanted to take a
look at some index funds,

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.620
but they also know
that there are HSAs,

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:50.080
529 plans, how would you
recommend they get started?

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.130
Maybe if 2018 was just
going to be a simple year,

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.144
what would your
advice be if they're

00:23:55.144 --> 00:23:57.310
feeling overwhelmed by all
the different places they

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.450
could put their money?

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.930
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I
think if you're really

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.810
starting from ground
zero and you really

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.616
do not have any base
of knowledge on this--

00:24:07.616 --> 00:24:08.740
and that's not a bad thing.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:11.440
That can be an advantage,
because at least it means

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.390
you don't have bad knowledge.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.040
And there's a lot of bad
information out there.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.020
So if you're at that ground zero
level, don't feel bad about it.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:21.760
That's an advantage.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.360
There's nothing you
have to unlearn.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.970
At the risk of touting my
own book and my own blog,

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.580
I would go there and do
a little bit of reading

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.140
and do a little bit of learning.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.990
So one thing in
the way you phrased

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.730
the question that people
need to be clear about--

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.890
and this is something
that I come across a lot.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.310
They'll say, well, I want
to invest in my 401(k),

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:47.680
or I want to invest in my IRA,
or I want to invest in VTSAX.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.860
Well, you're
conflating investments

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.380
with what I come
to call buckets.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.840
So a 401(k) is
not an investment.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.460
An IRA is not an investment.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.780
A TSP plan is not an investment.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.660
Those are buckets.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:06.880
In those buckets, you
hold your investments.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.300
Investments are things like
mutual funds and stocks

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.219
and bonds.

00:25:11.219 --> 00:25:12.760
So those are the
investments that you

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.780
choose to put in your bucket.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:17.940
So if you have a 401(k),
as you do at Google--

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.440
and I have no idea what
your 401(k) looks like,

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:23.920
but you will have a list of
selections of investments you

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.250
can put in that 401(k) bucket.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.840
If my approach
resonates with you,

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.210
and you believe in broad-based
index funds are something

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.810
you want to go with, you
can go down that list

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:42.180
and maybe find the specific
funds I'm talking about.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.750
But you will certainly
probably find

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.110
something that is a
broad-based index fund.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.300
The easiest way to
do that, by the way,

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.549
is to find the column that
shows the expense ratio.

00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:53.590
And you should have that.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.080
You run your finger
down that, and when

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.570
you find the very
lowest expense ratios,

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.460
you will have found
the index funds.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.092
And focus on those, and
take a look at them.

00:26:04.092 --> 00:26:06.300
RACHEL SMITH: And why do
you think some people choose

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.120
to manage their own investments,
whereas others outsource it

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.379
to someone else?

00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:13.670
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I think
the people who outsource it

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.530
to someone else
have been convinced

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:20.160
that this is just too complex
for their pretty little head.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.210
And the vast majority of
things on that banquet table

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:28.320
we talked about are too complex
for anybody's pretty little

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.930
head.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:34.960
In 2007, 2008, 2009 when
the economy cratered,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:38.700
Wall Street was selling
products they didn't understand.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.380
So if this stuff
looks complex to you,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.430
it's because this stuff is
complex, and in some cases,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:45.854
intentionally complex.

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:47.520
But we don't care
about that, because we

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.170
don't need any of that.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.010
And once you understand that you
don't need that complex stuff,

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:57.150
then doing it yourself
becomes much more attainable,

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.610
even if you don't have any
interest in financial stuff

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.450
like, frankly, my daughter.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.940
She has better things to
do with her life than fool

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.880
around with this financial
stuff that intrigues her dad,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.290
and that's great.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:16.710
People have bridges to build
and ways to make the world work.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:19.710
The beauty of this is that
if you get a couple of things

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.500
right financially,
you can profoundly

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.890
change your financial life
without having to dwell on it.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.420
And you can get on
with doing things

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.086
that are more important
to you and maybe

00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:32.184
more important to the world.

00:27:32.184 --> 00:27:34.350
RACHEL SMITH: And what do
you think are two to three

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.530
of the biggest mistakes
people can make when investing

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.670
or managing their money?

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:45.710
J.L. COLLINS: Well, I think
two come to mind immediately.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.630
One is thinking that you
can pick individual stocks,

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.920
and by extension, that
you can pick people

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.630
who can pick individual
stocks-- that is,

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:01.890
people who run actively
managed mutual funds.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.620
One of the comments that
makes my skin crawl is when

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.120
I hear people say
something like,

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.030
well, Warren Buffett
became a billionaire

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.420
picking individual stocks.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.850
I'll just do what Warren did.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.886
As if.

00:28:16.886 --> 00:28:17.790
As if.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.960
There is a reason that
Warren Buffett is famous,

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.730
because Warren
Buffett has managed

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:26.580
to do something that
is extraordinarily

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.170
difficult to do.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:31.550
The ability to do it is
extraordinarily rare.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.940
And the hubris to think, oh,
I'll just go and do what Warren

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.130
has done is, to me, stunning.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:40.380
It's just absolutely stunning.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.500
And the research indicates
that while Warren has done it,

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.850
as we talked about, you go
out 30 years, and less than 1%

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.190
of people trying to do
it who have survived

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.200
that long have accomplished it.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.330
And I bring this one
up first, because this

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.710
was my own stumbling block.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.890
I just kept believing
that I could

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.350
pick people who
could pick stocks,

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.980
and I believed that
I could pick stocks.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.740
And because every now and
again I'd get it right,

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.350
and maybe I got it right more
often than I got it wrong,

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.930
that feeds into that belief.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.400
And that's the
thing that made me

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.710
reluctant to pick up indexing.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.220
But the truth is that the
few times I got it wrong

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.700
dragged down my performance--

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.010
and this is what happens to
the vast majority of people

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.320
trying to do it--

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.420
to where I would have been far
better off with the index--

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.620
far better off.

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.590
So trying to pick individual
stocks and managers is

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.090
number one, maybe--

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.740
not necessarily in order.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.380
The second thing is
trying to time the market.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.320
And you can't turn
on the financial news

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.290
or open up a
financial periodical

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.470
without finding somebody
who's telling you definitively

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.990
where the stock
market is going next.

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.310
Nobody knows.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.940
If you could accurately do
that with any consistency,

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.360
you'd be far richer than Warren
Buffett and far more lionized.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.850
It would be magic dust.

00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:08.730
Nobody can tell you where
the market is going.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.520
You just can't predict
the market, and trying to

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.300
is a fool's game.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.855
So Fidelity Investments did
a little piece of research

00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:21.620
I think about a year ago,
a year and a half ago,

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:24.960
and they were curious as
to what group of investors

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.900
in their funds did best.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.970
Because the research
indicates that the people

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:36.000
who invest in a mutual
fund under-perform

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.280
the performance of that fund.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.780
He said, well, how
is that possible?

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.610
If they're investing
in the fund,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.220
their performance
should match the fund.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.230
The reason they under-perform
is they try to dance in and out.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.110
They tried to time the market.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.260
So when Fidelity
did this research,

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.660
they determined that
one group of investors

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.390
did significantly better
than any other group who

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.570
own their funds--

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.990
and that was dead people.

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:05.540
The dead people outperformed.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.470
Now, can you guess why?

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.500
Because they didn't tinker
with their investment.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.099
The second best
performing group were

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:13.890
people who forgot that
they owned the fund.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.950
So you can't time the
market, and especially

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.889
when the market has been on
as long a bull run as it has.

00:31:23.889 --> 00:31:25.680
The media is filled
with people telling you

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.730
that they know what
it's going to do next.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.220
At some point, the
market will dive,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.530
because the market is volatile.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.000
That's what markets do.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.360
So if you invest in the market,
you have to expect that.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.610
You have to expect
the volatility.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.520
You have to be willing
to ride with it.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.600
But I don't know when
it's going to do that.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.260
It could be happening as we're
sitting in this room together

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:49.040
today.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.040
I haven't looked at the market.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.350
It might be 10 years from now.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.700
I have no idea, and
nobody else knows.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.490
The difference is I'm
willing to say I don't know.

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.120
RACHEL SMITH: So
for someone who may

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.820
be interested in investing--
maybe when they go home today.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.180
They have some cash they
want to start investing.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.890
And they say, well, the market's
the highest it's ever been.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.910
I'm going to wait for it to dip.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.580
What advice would you
give to those folks who

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:17.080
are waiting for the next step?

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.990
J.L. COLLINS: If we went
back to March of 2009,

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.095
which was when the market
bottomed and its collapse.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.709
Almost every month
since then, you

00:32:36.709 --> 00:32:38.000
could have said the same thing.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.190
I wrote a post
in, I want to say,

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:46.120
2014 responding to a
reader who was asking

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.980
that exact same question.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.240
The S&amp;P 500 was
1,600 and change,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.810
and this reader was saying,
how can I possibly reinvest?

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.700
How can I possibly invest?

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.580
Nothing would go up for
the last five years.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.740
And here it is at 1,600,
and it bottomed out

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.310
at I want to say
600 and something.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.580
And where are we today?

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.820
Now, I didn't know
that at the time,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.580
because I didn't know where
the market was going to go.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.630
But you just don't know.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.410
You can't predict the market.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.930
And by the way, it's become
fashionable to suggest

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.960
the P/E ratios or
Shiller P/E ratios give

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.940
some insight into this.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:30.210
In that post-- it's called
"Investing in a raging bull,"

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.360
it's in the stock series--

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:40.990
I just put a link to
a post I came across--

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.750
very well done--
where the guy analyzes

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:49.430
where the various P/E ratios
were at the beginning of drops.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:55.450
And there's no predictive
correlation there to be had,

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:59.440
so you just can't know.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.850
I also have a post called
"Why I don't like dollar cost

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.330
averaging."

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:10.310
And in summary,
dollar cost averaging

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.590
is the idea of putting
in a little bit of money

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.230
at a time over a period of time.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:19.610
The problem with that is that
unless the market conveniently

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.702
goes down while
you're doing it, you

00:34:21.702 --> 00:34:25.520
will have been giving up gains
rather than avoiding losses.

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.020
And the thing that
really bothers me

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:29.989
about it is that at the end
of your investment period

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:33.110
where you have finally deployed
all of your money, who's

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.630
to say the next
day isn't the day

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.179
the market takes its big plunge?

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:41.870
So you have $120,000,
you want to deploy.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.530
and you say, I'm going to do
it over the next 12 months.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.440
And I'm going to put
$10,000 a month in,

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:50.120
and I'm going to
avoid that risk.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.620
You're not avoiding
the risk, you're

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:55.949
just delaying the risk until
you put that final $10,000 in.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.040
Now, if you get lucky
and the market plunges,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.390
you'll pat yourself on the back.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.360
But understand that's only
luck, because nobody knows

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.950
where the market is going.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.160
There's a saying that the
best time to have invested

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.603
was yesterday, and the
second best time is today.

00:35:11.603 --> 00:35:13.730
RACHEL SMITH:
That's great advice

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.800
J.L. COLLINS: Time in the
market is more powerful

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.822
than to time the market.

00:35:17.822 --> 00:35:19.280
RACHEL SMITH: Time
in the market is

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:22.291
more powerful than trying
to time the market.

00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:23.290
J.L. COLLINS: Well said.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.280
RACHEL SMITH: I like that.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.450
So we have one more
question for Jim,

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.960
but for folks who
have live questions,

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.760
feel free to line up at the mic.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.690
We also have a Dory at
go slash Jim dash Dory.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.980
So my last question before we
turn it over to live questions

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.930
is, there may be
folks in this room who

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:43.700
have a New Year's
resolution to get

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.040
their financial house in order.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.200
And they may be one
of the folks who

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.100
have a lot of cash in
checking or savings,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.212
or they just are so
overwhelmed by this stuff

00:35:54.212 --> 00:35:55.920
that they don't even
know where to begin.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.580
So what would you say are
just the key takeaways

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.450
they should focus on when
they leave this room?

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:05.930
J.L. COLLINS: Well, again,
I would encourage anybody

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.480
in that position-- if you're
sitting on that much cash,

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.030
and assuming that
that amount of cash

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.490
represents a large
part of your net worth,

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.900
because money is relative.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.560
But if you're sitting on
$100,000 as an example,

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.320
and that is a large
part of your net worth,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.580
that indicates that you're
not comfortable investing.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.260
And that's fine.

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.320
So the first thing you should
do is educate yourself,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.890
and you can start with
my blog or my book.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:33.590
And see if that resonates,
and go from there.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.540
If you find it doesn't
resonate, then there

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.950
are a lot of other
sources out there,

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.380
but educate yourself first.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.090
And some of the posts
that I referenced

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.010
are in the stock series.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.440
You can read about
investing in a raging bull.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.030
You can read about
dollar cost averaging.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:55.040
But once you decide
to invest in stocks,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.020
you have to accept the fact
that the market is volatile.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:02.300
At some point, the
market will go down.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:04.370
Now, whether it goes
down 10% and continues

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.600
going up 20%, who knows.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.700
Nobody knows.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.300
But the market-- you can
count on it being volatile.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.080
And at some point,
it will go down,

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.450
and you have to come
to terms with that.

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:18.950
And you have to be absolutely
sure that when that happens--

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.630
not if, but when--

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.370
you don't panic.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:25.130
Because the only way
you lose is if you

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.160
panic and sell at the bottom.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.890
Now, trust me when I
tell you, because I've

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.510
lived through a few of them.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:35.870
When the market is taking
one of its dives, it's ugly.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.680
It's painful.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.730
It's scary.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.890
It's easy to sit here
now and say, well, I'll

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.330
stay the course.

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.880
But it's not so easy to
do it when it's happening.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.560
So the first thing
you need to resolve

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.200
it seems to me in your own
mind, in your own heart,

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.430
in your own gut, is
that when that happens,

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.520
that selling is not an option.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:01.670
It's just simply not an option.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.330
Now, in my world,
I divide the times

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:08.870
in our life between wealth
accumulation and wealth

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.360
preservation stages.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.190
In a more traditional
point in time,

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.800
that might have been when
you're young and you're working,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.460
that's your wealth
building stage.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.310
And then you get to
60 or 65, and you

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.170
retire, wealth preservation.

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:26.150
These days, people
step in and out

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.700
of careers on a
routine basis, so you

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.220
will go from wealth
preservation to wealth building

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.810
and back several times.

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.970
I know I did in my career.

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:37.460
When you're doing that,
there are two ways

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.310
you can mitigate the
volatility of the market

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:43.270
and actually use it
to your advantage.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.900
When you are in the
wealth building stage,

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.580
you have earned income.

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.250
And if you're aiming to be
financially independent,

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.520
a large portion of
that income is being

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.560
diverted into investments.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.480
So that means on
a regular basis,

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.150
you are putting substantial
amounts of your income

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.950
into the market.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.800
That, by extension, means
when the market drops,

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.650
you're getting to
buy things on sale.

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:09.400
Now, you're not going
to try to time this,

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.050
because we know
we can't do that.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.110
But what it does mean is
that when the market drops,

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:15.520
you should celebrate.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.480
Because, oh, I'm getting to buy,
when I put that extra $1,000

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.540
or $10,000 or whatever
it is in each month,

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.200
I'm getting more
shares in my VTSAX

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.940
than I would have
gotten otherwise.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.550
The volatility works to your
advantage in that fashion.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:34.090
So you sleep easily at
night, because you don't care

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.880
what Mr. Market's going to do.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.610
Now, when you move to the
wealth preservation stage,

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.360
you no longer have that income
stream to smooth the ride.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.060
And that, in my world,
is when you add bonds,

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.660
and bonds become like
ballast in your sailing ship.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.230
Where your flow of
income was before,

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.590
now you're going to replace
that with the ballast of bonds.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:00.620
And that means that
when the market plunges,

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:03.920
the stocks plunge,
and you reallocate

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.590
to stay at whatever
allocation you've chosen,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:09.140
you'll be selling bonds,
which have gone up

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.000
as a percentage
of your portfolio.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.900
Let's say, as I do at
the moment, you have 30%

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.530
bonds, 70% stocks.

00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:20.780
When stocks plummet,
that percentage of bonds

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.980
is going to go up.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.250
You sell some of those bonds,
and you're buying those stocks

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.880
at lower prices, just
like your cash flow was

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.710
allowing you to do it before.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.490
When stocks go back up again
and suddenly that percentage

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.850
of stocks start to outweigh
where you want it to be--

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:39.260
it gets above 70%--

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.530
you start selling some of those
off to replenish your bonds.

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.720
With those two
strategies, you no longer

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.470
have to care whether the
market is going up or down,

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:52.130
because you know that over time
the market is going to go up.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.320
And you've eliminated the
concerns with volatility.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.420
So I would embrace
those two concepts--

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.270
understand that you don't
ever sell in a panic

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:03.830
just because it went down.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.280
That is simply not an option
that you will ever consider.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.950
And then depending on
which stage you're in,

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.440
either use bonds or use cash
flow to smooth the ride.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440
RACHEL SMITH: All right.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.790
We're ready to go to
some live questions.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.660
So I just had two
questions about the future.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.610
So number one--

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.857
J.L. COLLINS: You are
addressing the wrong guest.

00:41:29.857 --> 00:41:30.940
AUDIENCE: I'll try anyway.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.850
So earlier in the talk,
you mentioned a very simple

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:34.847
sentence--

00:41:34.847 --> 00:41:36.430
what do you do with
your money, put it

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:39.744
in VTSAX or a similar fund.

00:41:39.744 --> 00:41:41.410
So that one sentence--
it seems like you

00:41:41.410 --> 00:41:45.610
can do that in a matter of a
few clicks as an individual.

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:52.220
So my question is about the
financial advisor system--

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.390
the kind of larger system,
where you're calling someone

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.100
on the phone and
having them essentially

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.050
do the exact same thing.

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:02.530
My question is, how do you
see that changing as the world

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:05.110
becomes more
financially educated?

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:09.430
And then as a corollary to
that, the broader system--

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:15.190
if everyone kind of buys
into this indexing idea,

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:18.400
are there any systemic
risks to the entire world

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.062
investing in an index?

00:42:21.062 --> 00:42:21.770
J.L. COLLINS: OK.

00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:27.620
So with financial advisors--

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.590
I think in fairness
to financial advisors,

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:36.110
they can be useful
in a wide range

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.780
of subjects other than
making your investment

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.580
choices for you.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.770
But one of the
chapters in my book

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.880
and one of the posts
in the stock series

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.800
is "Why I don't like
investment advisors."

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:54.680
Because if you embrace the
simplicity that I suggest,

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.430
then--

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.520
from at least an
investment point of view,

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.680
as you well point out--

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.810
why would you need an
advisor to do what you

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.300
can do in a handful of clicks?

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:08.510
And when I gave my
talk at Chautauqua

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:11.254
when I was preparing
that talk for last year,

00:43:11.254 --> 00:43:12.670
I took a little
different approach

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.060
than I had taken before.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.940
And I was thinking about
the content of my book

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:19.530
and the content of
my blog, and I'm

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.980
trying to boil it down into
one line or one phrase.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.930
And really, what
I came up with is

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:30.900
my advice is, buy VTSAX,
buy as much as you can,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:33.880
buy it whenever you can,
and hold it forever.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.680
And it's really that simple.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.630
And as you say, it's a matter
of a handful of clicks.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.640
The second question--
and this is

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.750
one that's in the financial
community a fair amount-- is,

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.510
well, what if everybody
embraces indexing?

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.670
What's that going
to do to markets?

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:53.670
And the problem
that's suggested is

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.630
that indexing simply buys every
stock, where stock pickers--

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:01.290
whether they're individuals
or fund managers--

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:04.560
they're the ones who are
trying to evaluate companies

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.970
and thereby creating a
trading mechanism that

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.900
looks at some sort of
objective parameters

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.360
and comes up with the values.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.780
And is there a danger to
that going away as everybody

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.590
embraces indexing?

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.730
I'm not concerned about it.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:25.440
I don't know if there's
a danger or not,

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.030
because it's hypothetical.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.590
I'm not concerned
about it, though,

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:31.470
because indexing at
the moment accounts

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:35.610
for 20%, 25% percent
of the market.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.660
It is growing.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.240
More people are
embracing the idea.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:46.380
But I think if it continues to
grow, what I think will happen

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.500
is as that sliver
of active management

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.700
becomes narrower and more
and more people are indexing,

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.490
the opportunity to actually
outperform the index

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.830
will start to increase.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.640
And as that happens, you'll have
some of those active managers

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.460
posting success stories,
and that will begin

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:07.900
to tilt it the other direction.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.470
And I think the other reason
I'm not concerned about indexing

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:14.040
taking over the world is
because-- as I mentioned

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.110
earlier in answering
one of your questions--

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:23.350
it is counter-intuitive
that it is so powerful.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:26.030
It's part of human
nature to want to think

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.310
that you can outperform.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:32.570
It's part of human nature to
want to best the benchmark.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:33.890
I still have the disease.

00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:38.670
Every now and again, I'm
still trying to pick stocks.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:42.230
So I think that
aspect of human nature

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:45.710
is also going to keep
indexing from ever

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.150
taking over the world.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:48.510
Does that help at all?

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:49.670
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:50.753
J.L. COLLINS: My pleasure.

00:45:50.753 --> 00:45:51.546
Thank you.

00:45:51.546 --> 00:45:53.420
AUDIENCE: Hey, J.L.,
thanks for coming today.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.003
J.L. COLLINS: Thank
you for having me.

00:45:55.003 --> 00:45:57.840
AUDIENCE: My dad and I go back
and forth on this all the time.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.170
But do you see any
advantage to trying

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.530
to diversify away
from the S&amp;P 500

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.100
and think about either
global markets, or bonds,

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.240
or commodities?

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.110
J.L. COLLINS: Well,
bonds, as I mentioned,

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:15.830
I think you add bonds depending
on what point in your life

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.800
you are as ballast for
your investment ship.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.940
And other than that, I
don't see a role for bonds.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.070
What's interesting to
me about that question

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.790
is the S&amp;P 500, as
the name suggests,

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:34.220
owns basically the 500
largest American companies.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.110
VTSAX, which is a total stock
market index fund, owns--

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.930
and it varies-- about
3,600 companies.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:45.470
When I first started
investing and it

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:48.050
was before such things
existed or they were just

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:51.950
coming on stream, the idea
of being diversified was--

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.470
because the vast
majority of people

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:56.760
were picking individual stocks.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.490
They had to, because
that was available.

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:01.170
There were some mutual
funds out there.

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.240
But the advice given
to individual investors

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.530
then was, you know, you want
to pick seven, eight, nine,

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.790
maybe 10 industries.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:12.030
And inside those
industries, you want

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.820
to pick two or three companies.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.730
And then you have a
diversified portfolio,

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.780
because you really can't
physically and mentally

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:26.580
follow more than 20, 25, maybe
the outside 30 companies.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.755
And that was considered to be
a well diversified portfolio.

00:47:30.755 --> 00:47:32.130
So when somebody
says to me, do I

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:37.680
need to diversify
beyond 500 companies,

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.060
I think you're there.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.470
I think you're there.

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.502
Now, the international
aspect of it--

00:47:42.502 --> 00:47:44.460
I'm a little at odds with
the rest of the world

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.470
or most of the
rest of the world.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.510
The advice that
most people give is

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:53.430
that in addition to buying
the S&amp;P 500 or VTSAX, which

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:57.750
are US companies, you need
to buy funds that can put you

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.840
into the rest of the
world internationally

00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.610
from other countries.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.305
Vanguard itself
gives that advice.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.790
I don't buy it,
at least not yet.

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:12.600
The US is still very dominant
in the world economy.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.390
It will continue to be dominant
for the foreseeable future.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:18.750
But more importantly,
those companies

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.470
in the index in the S&amp;P 500--

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:26.010
especially in the top
100 of those companies,

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.200
Google as an example--

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.030
are international
companies by definition.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.750
So if you're investing
in the S&amp;P 500--

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:39.420
and, of course, the S&amp;P
500 is 80% of VTSAX--

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.140
you, by definition, are
invested in the world.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:47.254
AUDIENCE: All right, well, you
just proved my dad right, so.

00:48:47.254 --> 00:48:49.420
RACHEL SMITH: Before we
take our next live question,

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.360
I want to go to the top
voted question on the Dory.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.690
So the question is from
Stephanie here in Chicago.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.540
She said, a lot of Googlers
receive a significant portion

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.760
of compensation in Google stock.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.830
Oftentimes, there
are strong camps

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:06.340
who never sell a share
or those who sell it all

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.014
and diversify immediately.

00:49:08.014 --> 00:49:10.180
What are your thoughts on
holding the Google shares,

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.980
since we're all
extremely invested

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:13.025
in the success of Google?

00:49:13.025 --> 00:49:15.400
J.L. COLLINS: Well, that's a
politically loaded question.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.300
Somehow, I think I
should say, hold Google.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.380
But that's actually
not my opinion,

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.250
and that has nothing to do
with, by the way, Google stock

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:34.060
or what I see is the
future of Google.

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:40.450
The problem I have is in
looking at the question--

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.460
when she says we're
all extremely invested

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.810
in the success of Google,
that's a great thing,

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:49.100
but that's also an
emotional thing.

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.400
And I think you need to
separate your emotions

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.410
from your investing.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:56.650
So you all want to
see Google go forward

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:58.070
and succeed and prosper.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:49:59.980
It is your career.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.350
It writes your paychecks.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:05.620
And therein lies the problem,
because when you are also

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:09.430
invested in Google, you have
more and more eggs in that one

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.650
basket.

00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.540
I don't know what the
future of Google is,

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.550
and nobody really does.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:19.240
Everybody in this room
presumably in the organization

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:25.480
is striving to make that future
wonderful and profitable going

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.470
on indefinitely-- and have
done a wonderful job so far.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.420
But the world is
filled with people who

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:34.490
are trying to eat your lunch.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.070
I think back to General Motors.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:40.640
So when I was a kid in the
1960s, General Motors--

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.360
who has kind of had
a rough go of it

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.430
in most of your lifetimes--

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:48.560
in the 1960s, the
federal government

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.760
was on the verge of
breaking up General Motors,

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.790
because nobody else
could compete with them.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:59.450
General Motors was so dominant
that the government was

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.930
concerned that no
other car company would

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:05.720
be able to compete and
they would have to step in.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.580
And they were
specifically talking

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.130
about splitting off the
Chevrolet division, which

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.380
was just huge and dominant.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.280
Well, of course, history
tells us two things.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.450
It tells us, one, the
government chose not to do that.

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:21.030
And two, that they
didn't need to worry,

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:26.430
because the world was filled
with other companies waiting

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:30.840
to eat General Motors' lunch
the moment they slipped up--

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.240
or simply the moment the
competitor figured out

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.140
a better way to do it.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.010
So you have to be very careful
in putting all of your eggs

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:41.890
into the same basket
where you work.

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.230
Going back to the question
the gentleman asked earlier

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:49.840
about the S&amp;P 500, I would
rather own the S&amp;P 500--

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.980
or at least have the bulk of
my net worth in the S&amp;P 500--

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:58.020
because now I don't have to
guess who's going to win.

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:03.080
Because the losers fall off, and
the winners go on to prosper.

00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:04.940
One of the beautiful
things about the index

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:08.630
is what I call self-cleansing.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:12.860
And by that, what I
mean is that if you

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.840
look at any specific
company in that index,

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.290
you can only lose
100% of that company.

00:52:22.290 --> 00:52:24.020
But any other company
in that index--

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.550
and Google is a
wonderful example

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.710
of this over the
last few decades--

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.430
can grow exponentially.

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:32.630
There is almost no limit
to how far it can grow.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.880
So that's kind of a
winning combination.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.880
The losers fall off, and they
don't actually go to 100%

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.650
before they get delisted.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.830
But the losers drift away,
and you are continually

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.430
getting new blood added to
it as new companies come up.

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.070
And you get the benefit
from those who succeed,

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.630
and all those
companies are filled

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.480
with people who are
working hard to make sure

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:55.190
that their company succeeds.

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:57.800
And as an investor, I
don't have to figure out

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.920
who the winner is going to
be, because I own them all.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.040
RACHEL SMITH: We have time
for one more question.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:10.700
AUDIENCE: So I was going to ask
two, but I think they're quick.

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:15.040
The retirement-date
funds-- thoughts on those

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.750
target retirement-date funds?

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:18.930
So automatically adjusting
allocations as you're

00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:20.602
closer to retirement--

00:53:20.602 --> 00:53:21.310
thoughts on that?

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.620
Or do you think you should
just do allocation yourself

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:29.620
through the various bonds and
Vanguard funds on your own?

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:32.155
And then the second one was
just really about in what

00:53:32.155 --> 00:53:34.140
scenarios would you
find it helpful to use

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.087
a financial advisor.

00:53:35.087 --> 00:53:37.420
I find doing it on your own
is great, but at some point,

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:38.800
you want some kind
of reassurance

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:40.030
you're doing it well--

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.910
not for investment banking,
but you have to go to someone

00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:46.240
to get insurance, et cetera.

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.480
J.L. COLLINS: OK, so a
target retirement fund,

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.670
just to kind of quickly
explain what that is.

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.680
There are mutual
funds out there--

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.340
Vanguard has them-- which are
called target-date retirement

00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:59.020
funds or target
retirement funds.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:05.440
And the idea is that it's what's
called a fund of funds, which

00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:07.840
means it is a mutual
fund that holds

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.490
a bunch of other
funds inside it,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:13.750
usually five or six
different funds.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:15.460
And with a target
retirement fund,

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:19.090
you pick a retirement
date, and you buy the fund.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:21.220
And as the gentleman
just indicated,

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.860
you can hold it forever.

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:26.530
And automatically, the closer
you get to that retirement

00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:31.240
date, the more conservative the
fund allocation will become--

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:35.200
that is to say, typically
the more bonds they will add.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.040
So the idea is you never have
to adjust your allocation as you

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.710
get to it.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.570
Now, so some people
say, well, gee, I

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.540
might want to be more
aggressive or less aggressive

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.130
than the retirement fund.

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:50.440
Well, you can adjust that.

00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:52.060
If you want to be
more aggressive,

00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:54.170
just pick one with
a retirement date

00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:57.220
that's actually further out
than your own anticipated

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.270
retirement.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:00.470
If you want to be
more conservative,

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:02.770
you can just bring
that retirement date in

00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:07.350
closer than you were
actually planning to retire.

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.360
And the idea is that you never
have to do anything again.

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:15.430
It is not a bad approach.

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.970
If you really want to invest in
a way that is completely hands

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:22.090
off where you really never
have to think about it,

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:23.650
this is not a bad way to go.

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.950
And in fact, I have a post
on this in the stock series,

00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:28.730
and I think it's a
chapter in the book.

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:30.570
I'm not sure if I put
it in the book or not.

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:32.140
But there is a post
in the stock series

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.520
where I talk about these things.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.130
It's not a bad way to go.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.140
What I suggest to
people is that if you

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.690
can read through my
stock series and you're

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.480
comfortable with what you
read, or you read my blog--

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.720
or my book, rather-- and you're
comfortable with what you read,

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:52.330
it is less expensive to simply
do the allocation yourself.

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:53.690
And it's not very hard.

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:55.060
It doesn't take much time.

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.530
And that's the way I
would encourage you to go.

00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:59.977
On the other hand, if you
read through the stock series

00:55:59.977 --> 00:56:01.810
or you start reading
through it and you say,

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:05.740
you know what, I just
really don't want to.

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.230
This is just not my thing--

00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:10.240
and there are topics,
by the way, in my life

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.190
that I would have
that reaction to--

00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:16.060
then just skip down to the post
about target retirement funds

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.520
and you can be done.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.576
It won't be a bad thing to do.

00:56:21.576 --> 00:56:23.950
And the second thing, real
quickly, in terms of financial

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:25.210
advisors--

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.680
again, I don't
think you need them.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.390
If you follow an
approach like mine,

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.390
which is simple investing,
you don't need them for that.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:36.520
But there are other aspects
where they can be useful.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.260
The problem with
financial advisors

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:41.830
is while there are good ones,
there are a lot who are not.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.240
And they're not for
a couple of reasons.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.740
One is simply they're
not that competent.

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.600
But the other-- and a
little more insidious--

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.230
is that their interests
are not necessarily aligned

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.000
with what's best for you.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.920
So if you read my post on why I
don't like investment advisors,

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.140
one of the conclusions
I come to is

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:06.610
by the time you know enough
to choose an investment

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:11.050
advisor wisely, had you invested
that time learning it yourself,

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:13.960
you would know enough
to do it on your own.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:15.640
J.L. COLLINS: Thank you.

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.400
RACHEL SMITH: We're out of time.

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.967
Thanks for coming
to Google Chicago.

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.300
It's been a pleasure having you.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.680
J.L. COLLINS: It's been
a pleasure being here.

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.180
Thank you.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.330
