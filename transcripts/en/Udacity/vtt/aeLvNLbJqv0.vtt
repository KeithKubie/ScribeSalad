00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I'd like to do next is describe a different algorithm

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that I learned under the name "Russian Peasant's Algorithm."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If you'd like to learn more about it, you can go to the Wikipedia page

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
called "Ancient Egyptian Multiplication."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is an algorithm that people actually implemented by hand before there were computers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here's the Russian Peasants Algorithm in Python.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You can see it follows pretty closely along with the naive algorithm that I described before.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It starts off assigning a and b to x and y.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It starts off z as an accumulator set to 0.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's going to repeat while x is bigger than 0 a bunch of steps

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that involve accumulating values in z and making x smaller.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What makes this algorithm work really well is when doubling

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and halving numbers is really easy to do.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you're not familiar with this syntax, this is saying take whatever the binary representation

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of y is and shift it over 1 to the left.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is saying take whatever the binary representation of x is and shift it over to the right.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's do a little quiz to see if you know what that would do.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
A straightforward question--what is 17&gt;&gt;1 in Python?

00:01:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
171, 9, 8, 8.5, or 34?
