1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,730
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,450
I've been listening to radio
lab on the way over here and um,

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,310
they have a new episode out about the
asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,980
Yeah. Holy Shit Man. Right.

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,910
Would you apparently they tell me if
I'm right about this before you tell me

6
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:21,300
more because I want to see if I
have a little knowledge. Go ahead.

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,180
There is an under,

8
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,360
like there's a very hard layer of rock
that covers a large part of the earth.

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,350
Right.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,350
And that is proof that somehow there was
an asteroid that hit and it got really,

11
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,950
really hot and the Rock God,

12
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,660
the morons version of a size that they
clearly lay out by the way is the worst

13
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,980
thing. I'm also like, there's
a rock that got melted day.

14
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,630
This was under the ground,

15
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,690
undeniable evidence of a rock of from
this space as every layer of the earth.

16
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,590
The crust of the earth is
super hard because it got
really hot after an asteroid

17
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:09,460
hitting. Everybody died and they found
dinosaur bones in it. Yeah Bro. They can.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,120
They can don't believe
in dinosaurs cause I'm,

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,580
you know I have something
called the Bible at home,

20
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,560
but some people don't
believe in dinosaurs.

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,820
Do you know that this flat earth folks,
while those dinosaurs are fake,

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,620
why is it that most flat earthers from
my experience are generally super good at

23
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:30,150
like a discipline that has nothing to
do with astrophysics, like Jujitsu,

24
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,740
like they spent a lot of time on a mat,

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,920
but then they have really strong political
opinions about that. Central banks,

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,660
it think it's just a lack of
real education and then yeah,

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,720
you get caught up in these youtube things
that show you a secret and it's very

28
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:50,250
attractive. It's very attractive to look,
find out about some hidden stuff like,

29
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:53,520
oh my God, I can't believe they
did this. They hid from us.

30
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,450
The fact that the earth is flat.
Jesus Christ spaces fake too.

31
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:02,340
Pro Space is fake. Satellites aren't
real. They're low flying planes,

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,410
their planes there.

33
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,110
That's the constantly beaming down
these information from the sky.

34
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,200
Satellites are not real nuclear
bombs and not real. Yeah.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,670
Not really just big bombs,

36
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,760
but then the problem is when you break
your leg and you have to set your bone or

37
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,450
you get staff and, and you have
to trust big Pharma to cure it.

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,680
Or you use your iPhone and it works
and you're talking to somebody in debt,

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,210
big one. You know what
I'm saying? So, but why?

40
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,180
Why is that technology
something you trust?

41
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,810
Your fucking iPhone has a global
positioning satellite chip and it stopped

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,260
porous.

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,250
It links up with the fucking one that's
in the sky and it tells you where you

44
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:42,390
are on the map. That's why your Google
maps works. Jesus fucking Christ.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,900
These are probably only five or six
flat earthers. No, there's a lot. Yeah,

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,490
there's thousands of them. Well, okay,

47
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,050
but that really means only
five or six in the ground.

48
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,760
I think the problem with all of them is
that they just got married to the idea

49
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:54,630
and then they're fighting it.

50
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:57,300
And if you fight it with someone who
doesn't know what they're talking about,

51
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,650
not that I do know what I'm talking about,

52
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:02,980
but if you fight it with like a Sean
Carroll or like a real assets is a real

53
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,330
scientific study,
they,

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,600
there's so much evidence that the earth
is round and no evidence that the earth

55
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,900
is flat. It's one of those things where
it's just like, what are you guys doing?

56
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,720
You're chasing your tail.
Yeah. This is crazy. Too busy.

57
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,910
Way Too busy or youtube.

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:19,910
Okay.
