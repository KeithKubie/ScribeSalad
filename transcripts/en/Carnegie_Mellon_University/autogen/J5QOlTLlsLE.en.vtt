00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.170
all we had ceded control but we also
 

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.620
all we had ceded control but we also
realized that situations had been

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:34.630
realized that situations had been
 

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:36.240
realized that situations had been
created which actually were not

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:36.250
created which actually were not
 

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.400
created which actually were not
beneficial to our clients because we had

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:38.410
beneficial to our clients because we had
 

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.860
beneficial to our clients because we had
individual entities who were basically

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:40.870
individual entities who were basically
 

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:44.010
individual entities who were basically
exerting architectural control and so we

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:44.020
exerting architectural control and so we
 

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:46.440
exerting architectural control and so we
adopted a different strategy which is we

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:46.450
adopted a different strategy which is we
 

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.440
adopted a different strategy which is we
said we will fundamentally support open

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:49.450
said we will fundamentally support open
 

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.170
said we will fundamentally support open
interfaces in the stack of information

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:52.180
interfaces in the stack of information
 

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.140
interfaces in the stack of information
technology meaning that by all means any

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:55.150
technology meaning that by all means any
 

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.900
technology meaning that by all means any
one company can provide a piece of

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:57.910
one company can provide a piece of
 

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.610
one company can provide a piece of
technology but the interfaces should

00:45:59.610 --> 00:45:59.620
technology but the interfaces should
 

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.930
technology but the interfaces should
always be open and therefore these

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:00.940
always be open and therefore these
 

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:03.000
always be open and therefore these
various technologies should be pluggable

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:03.010
various technologies should be pluggable
 

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.770
various technologies should be pluggable
so you should have a choice of micro

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:04.780
so you should have a choice of micro
 

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.420
so you should have a choice of micro
processes you should have a choice of

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:06.430
processes you should have a choice of
 

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.210
processes you should have a choice of
operating systems and we began to

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:09.220
operating systems and we began to
 

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.970
operating systems and we began to
actually disassemble some of the

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:10.980
actually disassemble some of the
 

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:13.680
actually disassemble some of the
vertical integration that we had on just

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:13.690
vertical integration that we had on just
 

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:15.840
vertical integration that we had on just
take you for exactly for example disk

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:15.850
take you for exactly for example disk
 

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.490
take you for exactly for example disk
drive we also invented the disk drive

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:17.500
drive we also invented the disk drive
 

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.920
drive we also invented the disk drive
and subsequently we also divested the

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:19.930
and subsequently we also divested the
 

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:21.030
and subsequently we also divested the
disk drive but there was a very

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040
disk drive but there was a very
 

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.820
disk drive but there was a very
interesting era in that time when our

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:23.830
interesting era in that time when our
 

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.310
interesting era in that time when our
our advantage in the district came from

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:26.320
our advantage in the district came from
 

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.250
our advantage in the district came from
the disk drive head however we decided

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:29.260
the disk drive head however we decided
 

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.810
the disk drive head however we decided
we would sell the disk drive head to

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:30.820
we would sell the disk drive head to
 

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.580
we would sell the disk drive head to

remember the first value that when when

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920
remember the first value that when when
 

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:41.010
remember the first value that when when
when talked about the three values the

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.020
when talked about the three values the
 

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:44.610
when talked about the three values the
first one is basically the client the

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:44.620
first one is basically the client the
 

00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.460
first one is basically the client the
value of the client preserve the value

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:47.470
value of the client preserve the value
 

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:48.780
value of the client preserve the value
of the client and do everything in the

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:48.790
of the client and do everything in the
 

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:50.100
of the client and do everything in the
interest of the value of clients so

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:50.110
interest of the value of clients so
 

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.500
interest of the value of clients so
trying to exert a control or a monopoly

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:52.510
trying to exert a control or a monopoly
 

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.330
trying to exert a control or a monopoly
it's not in the interest of our clients

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:54.340
it's not in the interest of our clients
 

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.220
it's not in the interest of our clients
is not in the interest of our industry

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:56.230
is not in the interest of our industry
 

00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:57.720
is not in the interest of our industry
not in the interest area so that was a

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:57.730
not in the interest area so that was a
 

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.490
not in the interest area so that was a
huge change and it only happened 20

00:47:59.490 --> 00:47:59.500
huge change and it only happened 20
 

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.350
huge change and it only happened 20
years ago but we've grown and we've

years ago but we've grown and we've

years ago but we've grown and we've
behaved in that way since then and it's

behaved in that way since then and it's
 

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.799
behaved in that way since then and it's
actually been to our great benefit

importantly why and if a university

00:49:20.179 --> 00:49:20.189
importantly why and if a university

importantly why and if a university
finds that its constituents are global

in their integration matter greatly to

the university's fundamental mission of
 

00:49:31.499 --> 00:49:33.919
the university's fundamental mission of
