TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.113
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:06.550
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.790
The Play Billing Library
simplifies the development

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.430
process for Google Play
billing, allowing you to focus

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.260
your efforts on your app.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.290
And the official 1.0
release is now available.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.450
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.900
below for a video
introduction and code.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.290
Cloud GPUs can accelerate
your workloads, including

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.470
machine learning, training and
inference, geophysical data

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.439
processing, simulation,
molecular modeling, and more.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.190
And now, faster
GPUs are available.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.620
And Nvidia P100
GPUs are now in beta

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
and Nvidia K80 GPUs are now
generally available on Google

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.690
Compute Engine.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.670
And sustained-use
discounts are now

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.230
available on both the
P100 and the K80 GPUs.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.170
Google Cloud Dataprep is an
intelligent, fully-managed

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.680
Cloud service that visually
explores, cleans, and prepares

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.070
structured and unstructured
data for analysis or training

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.330
machine learning models.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.480
And now, it's available to
everyone as a public beta.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.069
Check out the post
for more details

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.050
and a video introduction.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.060
Cloud Natural
Language enables you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.810
to extract critical
information from written data.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870
And we recently launched
two new features

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.190
that can help you further
organize your content

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.980
and better understand
how your users feel.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.200
For more details on the
launch and a tutorial

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.890
on classifying text,
check out the links below.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.290
Committed Use Discounts are
now generally available.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.160
They are ideal for predictable,
steady-state use of Google

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.800
Compute Engine instances.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.030
They require no
up-front pay payments,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.510
and allow you to purchase
a specific number of vCPUs

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.690
and a total amount of memory
for up to 57% off normal prices.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.140
More details are on the post.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.980
Stackdriver Debugger
lets you inspect

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.860
the state of an application
at any code location

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.950
without using log in statements
and without stopping or slowing

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.382
down your applications.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.340
And we just announced
that Stackdriver Debugger

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.880
for Node.js is now
officially in beta.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.910
The agent is open source
and available on EVM.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.880
Get started with the post.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.960
Our latest research
with Ipsos suggests

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.810
that people are three times
more likely to pay attention

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.900
to online video ads
versus television ads.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.120
And within the
online video, people

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.010
pay nearly twice
as much attention

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.850
to video ads on YouTube than
they do on other social media.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.520
Head on over to the post
to review four new tools

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.900
to help you capture
the attention

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.480
of your audience on YouTube.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.430
Please remember to like,
subscribe, and share.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.725
I'm Timothy Jordan, And
I'll see you next week.

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:38.550
Thanks for watching another
episode of "The Developer

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.150
Show".

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.590
If you'd like to catch
some of our prior episodes,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.460
