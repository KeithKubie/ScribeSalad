new way of thinking but then when they

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 align:start position:0%
did now it's basically instant so
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.729 align:start position:0%
did now it's basically instant so
they're<00:00:39.930><c> they're</c><00:00:40.170><c> looking</c><00:00:40.469><c> over</c><00:00:40.710><c> our</c>

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 align:start position:0%
shoulders all the time and now to see
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.389 align:start position:0%
shoulders all the time and now to see
what's<00:00:43.290><c> going</c><00:00:43.500><c> on</c><00:00:43.710><c> and</c><00:00:43.890><c> see</c><00:00:44.070><c> how</c><00:00:44.190><c> they</c><00:00:44.340><c> can</c>

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
what's going on and see how they can
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 align:start position:0%
what's going on and see how they can
incorporate<00:00:44.789><c> it</c><00:00:45.149><c> into</c><00:00:45.300><c> their</c><00:00:45.450><c> their</c><00:00:46.350><c> product</c>

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
incorporate it into their their product

incorporate it into their their product
so<00:00:46.950><c> finance</c><00:00:47.280><c> is</c><00:00:47.460><c> really</c><00:00:47.820><c> very</c><00:00:48.469><c> applied</c><00:00:49.469><c> as</c><00:00:49.800><c> a</c>

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 align:start position:0%
so finance is really very applied as a
