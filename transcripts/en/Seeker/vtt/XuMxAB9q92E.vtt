00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.490
How do my 
teeth look?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.490
Pretty good?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.830
Okay great.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:22.470
Fluoride in the water might be helping that,
but it might also be doing other things.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.100
Fluorine is the 13th most abundant element
on the planet.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.010
It's in seawater, foods like fish, tea and
gelatin contain it, and it's a naturally occurring

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.160
substance in minerals -- that is to say, IT'S
IN ALL THE ROCKS, because it's everywhere,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.290
fluorine is washed into the water supply during
erosion.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.170
Fluoride is just fluorine with an extra electron,
and when we see it in toothpaste, food or

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.800
drinking water, it's actually sodium fluoride,
or in our bodies it's calcium fluoride.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.490
In the 1940s, scientists found that people
living near natural water sources with 1 part

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.710
per million of fluoride had fewer cavities.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.180
So, they decided to add fluoride up to that
concentration to reduce cavities for everyone.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.610
Unsurprisingly, controversy ensued.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.689
Today, two-thirds of Americans have fluoridated
public water, but studies have thrown into

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.680
question the benefit of water-borne fluoride
compared to topical fluoride… or toothpaste

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.680
with fluoride.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.959
A study of 23,000 skeletons from medieval
archaeological sites found people who live

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:21.280
near the coast and consumed fluoride-rich
fish had fewer cavities.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.249
Another CDC study compared kids in the late-60s
to kids from the early 90s, and found a 68

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:27.420
percent drop in cavities.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.289
Though this could be due to fluoride toothpaste,
not fluoridation as communities without fluoridation

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.350
also saw a decrease.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.399
In the right concentrations -- that is, point-8
to 1.2 parts per million -- fluoride reduces

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.740
tooth enamel solubility during its formation,
helping it solidify and form teeth that are

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.880
more resistant to bacterial attack.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.630
After the enamel is formed, fluoride helps
prevent bacteria from producing acid that

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.719
causes tooth decay.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.360
Of course, higher concentrations of fluoride
can cause pitting in teeth, decay, and major

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.520
health problems.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.369
Anything over 1.5 ppm can cause tooth decay,
and 3 to 6 ppm can cause skeletal problems.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.229
And though there are some Chinese studies
correlating high fluoride with IQ problems,

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.780
no US city is even close to the 4 ppm EPA
limit.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.829
Whether it’s cool to add fluoride to the
water is still a political and social point

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.829
of contention.

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:20.430
From a healthcare perspective, if we want
our teeth to last, we've gotta keep the enamel

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.500
free of harmful bacterial deposits - which
fluoride does.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.989
Enamel, the outermost layer of the tooth,
is the toughest stuff the body can make, but

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.650
it can't repair itself.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.650
It needs help.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.890
Whether it belongs in the drinking water is
a complicated question, because for those

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.000
of us who didn't grow up with municipal drinking
water, like me, we HAD it in our well water

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.030
because the EARTH put it there.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.640
Municipal sources get it as an odourless and
tasteless byproduct of phosphate fertilizers

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.650
that makes no perceptible change to the water,
according to the World Health Organization.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.540
The WHO also recommends community water fluoridation
as the "most effective public health measure

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.519
for the prevention of dental decay."

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.370
Countries and states seem to be on board with
fluoridation until someone finds damning evidence

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.019
they shouldn’t be, which, in 70 years, no
one has yet found.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.409
So, for the moment, water fluoridation is
still a thing, but what do you think about

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.670
it?

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.459
Do you care?
