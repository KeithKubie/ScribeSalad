00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:07.274
HE'S UPWARDLY COMING,

HE WAS A GERMAN DURING THE TIME

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.315 line:0%
 
SCHMELING HAD WON
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.052 line:0%
 
IN 1930, 'CAUSE JACK SHARKEY
HIT HIM IN THE NUTS

00:00:19.052 --> 00:00:21.255 line:0%
 
AND GOT DISQUALIFIED.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.824
SO HE BASICALLY WON
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:25.726
OF THE WORLD
BY GETTING HIT IN THE NUTS.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:28.161
JOE LOUIS' MANAGER WAS LIKE,

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.299
LOUIS WILL PUMMEL HIM.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.667
JOE LOUIS WAS LIKE,

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.836
I DON'T NEED TO TRAIN
FOR THIS SCHMUCK, YOU KNOW?

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:37.838
INSTEAD OF TRAINING,
HE WAS PLAYING GOLF,

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:40.174
AND HE HAD ALL THESE WOMEN
COMING AROUND AND STUFF.

00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:42.042
SO HE'S [bleep]
AND PLAYING GOLF AND STUFF

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.911
INSTEAD OF TRAINING
FOR HIS FIGHT.

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:47.481
MMM.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:50.317
SO THE FIRST FIGHT
WAS AT YANKEE STADIUM.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.786 line:0%
 
THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE THERE,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.121 line:0%
 
AND EVERYONE JUST ASSUMES

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.124 line:0%
 
JOE LOUIS IS GONNA KICK
MAX SCHMELING'S BUTT.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:00:59.793 line:0%
 
LIKE, HITLER DIDN'T EVEN WANT IT
ADVERTISED IN GERMANY.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.862 line:0%
 
HITLER WAS LIKE,
THIS GUY'S GONNA LOSE.

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.298 line:0%
 
WE DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO KNOW ABOUT THE FIGHT.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.734 line:0%
 
IT WAS LIKE, JOE WAS, LIKE,
DOING ALL RIGHT,

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:11.939 line:0%
 
AND THEN MAX SCHMELING
JUST STARTS COMING AT HIM.

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.108
HE WAS LIKE,
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.477
AND THEN [bleep] SCHMELING
KNOCKS HIM DOWN

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:20.314
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN HIS WHOLE CAREER.

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:22.282
JOE LOUIS WAS LIKE,
OH, [bleep].

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.752
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN [bleep]
AND GOLFING.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:29.456
AND HE LOSES.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.693
SO LOUIS FEELS LIKE,
I'M NOT THE REAL CHAMP

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:36.096
UNTIL I BEAT MAX SCHMELING,
YOU KNOW,

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.565
'CAUSE HE BEAT ME BEFORE,
SO I'M GONNA--

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.834
I'M--NOW, I WANT TO BEAT HIM,

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.670
AND SO THEY
BASICALLY ENDED UP DECIDING

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.272
THEY WERE GONNA FIGHT AGAIN.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.708
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
HE WAS AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.810
AND ROOSEVELT SAID,
YOU KNOW,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.446
WE NEED THESE ARMS
TO BEAT THE NAZIS.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.147
ARE YOU GONNA WIN?
OR WHATEVER.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:56.750
AND HE'S LIKE,
YEAH, I GOT TO--

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.587
I GOT TO--I--
I CAN'T DO WHAT I DID BEFORE.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:04.124
I CAN'T [bleep] UP AND LOSE.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.193
I GOT TO GET MY [bleep]
IN SHAPE.

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:08.061
NO WOMEN, NO GOLF.
