Speaker 2:          00:08          Welcome to native link.com course on using the IPA to help you with pronunciation in a foreign language or any language you're learning. When we talk about vowels in the context of IPA or phonetics, we don't tend to say things like the letter a or the letter u or the vowel you even instead we break down valves by their features and features are kind of like the component parts of vows. Each val has multiple features. The first of these features is val height. If you want to think about it anatomically, you can distinguish different val heights by considering the position of your job when you make a certain vowels. So for instance, when I make the open sound or my jaw is in a different position than it is when I say the clothes val e, so my jaw opens up between e and. O. You can also relate height two how close your tongue is to the roof of your mouth. It's closer when you say the sound e than it is when you say, aw, we can distinguish open mid and close vowels.

Speaker 2:          01:26          Backness is the other feature we should distinguish at this point. Backness involves instead, what we can think of as how far forward and how far back our tongue is in our mouth. That's the anatomical way of thinking about it. So if you again, say the vowel e, your tongue is fairly far forward in your mouth, but if you say all, you pull it back. So that's the feature. Backness we can distinguish three levels of backness. The first one is going to be back. The second one is central, and the third is front. Using those two features, backness and height, we can lay vowels out on the table with the x axis being backness and the y axis being height. This will allow you to lay out all of your basic values on a chart and to be able to pronounce them in relation to each other. Let's take a look at one of those charts, and I'll pronounce the sounds for you.
