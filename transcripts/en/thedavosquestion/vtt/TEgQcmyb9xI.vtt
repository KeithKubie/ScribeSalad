Josette: Hi I'm Joseete Sheeran, the head
of the world food program in Davos.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.330
Many of you may know that we're the world’s
largest humanitarian organization,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.920
and many of you may know that we feed people
all over the world including

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.220
three million people in Davos -- in Darfur
every day.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.359
What you may not know is with the cash we
have which is half our budget, we procure

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.189
 -- spend
eighty percent of it procuring from farmers

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.819
in more than 70 developing nations.
And so today, when we fill this cup for school

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:35.900
children in Mozambique, eighty percent
of that food comes from local farmers.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.250
That food would never be seen on global markets
because they don’t have the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.170
transportation and the ability to move it.
So the World Food program goes to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.710
the farms, gets the food and fills the cup.
This is a win-win solution, and we are very

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.920
proud of the fact that we spend
almost seven hundred million dollars a year

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.289
procuring food from small farmers throughout
the developing

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.190
world to help feed people in Darfur, to help
feed schoolchildren all over

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.009
the world.
So, help give us support for these local farmers,

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.600
and break the cycle of hunger right at its
root.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.009
Thank you.
