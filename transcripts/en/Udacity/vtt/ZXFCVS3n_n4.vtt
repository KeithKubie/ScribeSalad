00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.920
You might me wondering what the difference is

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.990
between statistics and machine learning. In short, the answer

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.794
is not much. More and more, the 2

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:10.914
fields are converging and they share many of the

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.440
same methods. However there are couple of significant

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.820
philosophical differences between the 2 subjects. Generally, statistics is

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.770
focused on analysing existing data, in drawing valid

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.720
conclusions, whereas machine learning is focused on making predictions.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.310
What this translates to is the following: In statistics, we

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.270
care a lot about how our data was collected, and

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.360
drawing conclusions about that existing data using probability models. For

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540
example, we might try to answer the question are left

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.060
handed hitters statistically better than right handed ones? In the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.130
case of machine learning, we're a little bit more focused

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.010
on making accurate predictions and less committed to using a

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.910
probability model if there's a more accurate method that doesn't

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.850
use them at all. As long as our

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.770
machine learning method consistently makes accurate predictions for example,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.880
how many home runs will a player hit, we

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.520
aren't too worried about what assumptions the model makes.
