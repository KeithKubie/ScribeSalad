00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.600
I WANNA GO FAST, DAD.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.790
I WANNA GO FAST!

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.490
But what's the evolutionary basis of wanting
to burn rubber?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.740
speed demons
Speed is a thing y'all.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.259
The fastest freefall, the fastest sprinter,
the fastest jet, the fastest swimmer, cars

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.580
that go zero to sixty in 2.5 seconds, and
on and on!

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.130
Humans seem to be obsessed with speed.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.869
People just cannot keep off the throttle,
but why do some of us seem to be addicted

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.869
to it?

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.270
Well, a 2009 study in Organizational Behavior
and Human Decision Processes, that took FOREVER

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.670
to find, looked at the testosterone levels
of men driving a sports car or a family sedan.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.780
They then had them drive down streets crowded
with women, and streets that were empty; testing

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.580
their testosterone after the experiment, and
regardless of their audience, the men in a

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:56.040
sports car had elevated testosterone levels,
while the sedan guys remained low.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.800
When driving fast, squirts of adrenaline cause
our blood pressure to spike, heart to race,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.300
and body to tingle as we prepare to spring
into action.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.560
After the moment of fear and mortality fades,
we're left with euphoric withdrawal.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.150
Some people respond to this feeling more than
others, but men tend to be more susceptible

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.580
than women, indicating it's related to testosterone.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.580
Which is why men tend to drive likeâ€¦ well.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.640
you know.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.150
When we get into a car, something happens
to our psyche and the car becomes an extension

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.360
of our ego!

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.090
And the lead researcher believes human males
use the sports car as a status symbol, and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.070
a method of "sexual signalling," akin to the
feather displays, dances, constructions, songs

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.670
or displays of other animals.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.150
We are literally peacocking, though, according
to the study, we're not doing it for an audience,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.150
we're doing it for ourselves.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.540
Of course, then we have to get out there and
USE that giant thing underneath us and go

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.540
fast!

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.540
Right?

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.280
Yes, it depends on your levels of testosterone,
sure, but also the levels of the enzyme monoamine

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.380
oxidase (MAO).

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.680
MAO is a regulator in the brain which is linked
with a dopamine receptor called dopamine-4.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.210
Dopamine is one of the reward chemicals floating
around in your gourd, it makes you feel good

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.700
and is connected to mood so strongly that
antidepressants keep more of it floating in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.050
there.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.620
People with low levels of MAO are correlated
with high-levels of sensation-seeking, the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.430
name psychologists give to those who take
risks for the thrill of it.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.159
When humans feel excitement and fear, our
brains are awash in a myriad of chemicals

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.639
and hormones, stimulating here, tweaking there,
rewarding and dampening our feelings and emotions;

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.510
and those chemicals can be habit-forming,
sometimes resulting in sensation-seekers driving

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.720
faster and faster and more and more dangerously.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.269
So, there's some level of genetic and hormonal
influence involved in speed demoning, further

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.859
supported by evidence that the children of
sensation-seekers tend to themselves fall

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.670
into the euphoric trap!

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.970
We've talked about sensation-seeking before,
and when applied speed demons, it makes all

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.970
the sense.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.090
In the book "The Speed Handbook," UC Santa
Barbara professor Enda Duffy explores how

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.419
the automobile changed human experience.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.240
We became psychologically averse to slowness,
the media, movies, and television have all

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.220
seduced us into speed.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.359
It's exciting, and also (often) illegal.

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.310
According to the National Highway Transportation
and Safety Administration "speeding is one

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.650
of the most prevalent factors contributing
to traffic crashes."

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.739
In 2010, 31 percent of ALL fatalities on the
road were due to speeding, and 77 percent

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.669
of all car-related deaths involve men.

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.900
Sensation-seeking is fun and exciting and
gives some of the best natural-highs in the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.400
world, but it can ALSO be dangerous.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.159
Slow down, don't speed.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.159
Grab a spot on a racetrack if you want to
test your limits.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.249
But also keep in mind, we get flashes of these
feelings when dating, exploring new places,

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.749
and even having sex.

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:50.969
Without sensation-seeking, we'd never have
left the trees, the plains, or the shores

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:51.969
of Africa.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.480
And definitely never have gone to space, or
broken speed records.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.819
It's a part of us, a risky part, but important
nonetheless!

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.239
But if you enjoy thrill of a new vehicle,
check out the Toyota TRD.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.359
Toyota has been doing some tinkering of their
own with the TRD line of Toyota Trucks.

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.860
Enhanced to rule the off-road!

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.659
What was your first car?

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.760
Mine was a 1988 Volkswagon Vanagon, it was
sweeeeet top speed 70 mph.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.449
No thrill-seeking for me.
