00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.980
emerged out of the second world war with
the you know the greatest manufacturing

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
the you know the greatest manufacturing
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.530
the you know the greatest manufacturing
infrastructure in the world and kind of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540
infrastructure in the world and kind of
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.560
infrastructure in the world and kind of
Road on that wave for maybe 30 40 years

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570
Road on that wave for maybe 30 40 years
 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.049
Road on that wave for maybe 30 40 years
today we no longer have the best

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
today we no longer have the best
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.690
today we no longer have the best
manufacturing infrastructure in the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
manufacturing infrastructure in the
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.350
manufacturing infrastructure in the
world and we have to compete with the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
world and we have to compete with the
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639
world and we have to compete with the
best and the brightest around the world

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
best and the brightest around the world
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369
best and the brightest around the world
a big issue for us i think is there are

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
a big issue for us i think is there are
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.990
a big issue for us i think is there are
people out there that are just as smart

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
people out there that are just as smart
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.330
people out there that are just as smart
as us that are much hungrier than us and

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340
as us that are much hungrier than us and
 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.340
as us that are much hungrier than us and
much more determined to you know get

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
much more determined to you know get
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.020
much more determined to you know get
their piece of the American dream which

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
their piece of the American dream which
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.310
their piece of the American dream which
is no longer in America and I I think

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
is no longer in America and I I think
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710
is no longer in America and I I think
there's the next 10 or 15 years is a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
there's the next 10 or 15 years is a
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.170
there's the next 10 or 15 years is a
huge wake-up call for Americans to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
huge wake-up call for Americans to
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050
huge wake-up call for Americans to
realize that that they are competing in

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060
realize that that they are competing in
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.149
realize that that they are competing in
a global world with with people who are

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
a global world with with people who are
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.300
a global world with with people who are
every bit as smart and probably a lot

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
every bit as smart and probably a lot
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.429
every bit as smart and probably a lot
hungrier and more dedicated to getting

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
hungrier and more dedicated to getting
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.870
hungrier and more dedicated to getting
up in the morning with her so the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
up in the morning with her so the
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.510
up in the morning with her so the
greatest thing about America is that in

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
greatest thing about America is that in
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.170
greatest thing about America is that in
my experience when it when it it it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180
my experience when it when it it it
 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.679
my experience when it when it it it
faces a huge sort of seemingly

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689
faces a huge sort of seemingly
 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.819
faces a huge sort of seemingly
unchallenged huge obstacle it figures

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
unchallenged huge obstacle it figures
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.450
unchallenged huge obstacle it figures
out how to solve that so I remember it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
out how to solve that so I remember it
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.859
out how to solve that so I remember it
wasn't that long ago we don't talk about

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
wasn't that long ago we don't talk about
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.960
wasn't that long ago we don't talk about
it anymore but when people were saying

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
it anymore but when people were saying
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630
it anymore but when people were saying
you know America had lost its edge to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
you know America had lost its edge to
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.510
you know America had lost its edge to
Japan and Japan and turned to Korea and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
Japan and Japan and turned to Korea and
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670
Japan and Japan and turned to Korea and
some of the other sort of asian giants

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
some of the other sort of asian giants
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.730
some of the other sort of asian giants
and I think what turned that around is

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
and I think what turned that around is
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.480
and I think what turned that around is
good old sort of American okay if it's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
good old sort of American okay if it's
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.240
good old sort of American okay if it's
broken we can fix it and just the kind

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
broken we can fix it and just the kind
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.440
broken we can fix it and just the kind
of willingness to take a challenge take

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
of willingness to take a challenge take
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.630
of willingness to take a challenge take
on a challenge head-on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
on a challenge head-on
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.180
on a challenge head-on
and the kind of flexibility in terms of

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
and the kind of flexibility in terms of
 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.400
and the kind of flexibility in terms of
our institutions for doing that as well

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
our institutions for doing that as well
 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.010
our institutions for doing that as well
so I wouldn't count America out at all

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020
so I wouldn't count America out at all
 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.080
so I wouldn't count America out at all
but I do think that the world we're

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090
but I do think that the world we're
 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.610
but I do think that the world we're
competing in now and will compete in is

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620
competing in now and will compete in is
 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.199
competing in now and will compete in is
very different the one that we have in

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209
very different the one that we have in
 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:38.199
very different the one that we have in
Manhattan well I think those are two

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209
Manhattan well I think those are two
 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.510
Manhattan well I think those are two
countries that we are going to be

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520
countries that we are going to be
 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.559
countries that we are going to be
competing with in a very direct way last

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569
competing with in a very direct way last
 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.410
competing with in a very direct way last
