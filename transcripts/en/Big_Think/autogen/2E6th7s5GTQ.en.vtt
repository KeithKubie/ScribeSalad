worth 80 million dollars we could buy it

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930
worth 80 million dollars we could buy it
 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.139
worth 80 million dollars we could buy it
for 50 if we went in and started buying

gotten certainly close up to the 80
 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.440
gotten certainly close up to the 80
million but we wouldn't buy because we

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450
million but we wouldn't buy because we
 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.880

worth 80 million dollars we weren't
 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.690
worth 80 million dollars we weren't
going to buy it even for 50 min because

so fair value accounting created a
