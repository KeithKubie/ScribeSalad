00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.010
If you wanna make it in Hollywood, it’s
all about who you know.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.110
There are always new contacts to be made and
networking to be done.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.039
Occasionally, the planets align and someone
has the good fortune to be born into showbiz.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.369
But the majority of people you see onscreen
had to hustle pretty hard to get where they

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.240
are, and make ends meet along the way.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.570
But hey, everyone’s gotta start somewhere,
even the famous people.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.710
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Actors Whose Careers
Started In Shocking Ways.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.410
Chris Evans
Everybody loves Chris Evans.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.780
Wether it’s an occasional appearance in
a rom-com, or reprising his role as Captain

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.640
America, it seems like audiences are willing
to follow the actor to the ends of the earth.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.710
But despite his popularity, many fans are
surprised to discover one key element in his

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.930
origin story: modelling.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.950
His work can be found in an unlikely place,
too.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.470
On the cover of the 1999 re-issue of the board
game Mystery Date.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.050
Originally released by Milton Bradley in 1965,
the focus of the game is to have the perfect

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.380
date with the perfect guy.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.950
Fans will recognize one of the game’s eligible
bachelors, ‘Tyler’, as portrayed by the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.620
Star-Spangled Avenger.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.280
Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan has been in the movie business

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.390
for a long time.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.909
The actor and stuntman was quite accomplished
in Hong Kong long before American audiences

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.159
learned who he was.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.179
But success didn’t always come easy for
Chan, who struggled to make ends meet at the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.179
beginning of his career.

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.520
And because of this, he had to get creative
when it came to making money.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.439
Fans who associate him with family-friendly
movies like Rush Hour, Shanghai Knights and

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.760
Kung Fu Panda will be caught off guard by
the revelation that he was also in porn. Chan

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.590
acknowledged his involvement with a 1975 erotic
film All In The Family but the star has stated

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.170
that he feels no shame about it.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.939
Which is understandable, given how tame it
is compared to literally everything on HBO.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.340
Paul Rudd
Between guest appearances on Parks &amp; Recreation,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.479
starring in Netflix’s revival of Wet Hot
American Summer, and his recent turn as Marvel’s

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.960
Ant Man, it seems like Paul Rudd is everywhere.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.979
He can make audiences bust a gut with laughter
and cringe with awkwardness, all while making

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.229
us fall in love with him.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.869
As it turns out, the actor has always been
pretty versatile, both on and off the big

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.869
screen.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.091
Before he made his Hollywood debut, Rudd had
a handful of odd jobs, including one as a

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:05.439
Bar-Mitzvah DJ.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.940
The actor would spin tunes for parties that
were sometimes as elaborate as weddings, so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.929
it’s no surprise that he can work a crowd.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:20.390
And given how naturally lovable he is, we’re
betting he was pretty good at it, too.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.830
Channing Tatum
The revelation that Channing Tatum used to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.300
be an exotic dancer is will not surprise anyone
who’s seen the Magic Mike movies.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.380
His skills on the stage sparked a lot of discussion
about the actors’ beginnings in the entertainment

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.380
business.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.420
But what a lot of people don’t know is that
he also danced for Ricky Martin.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.330
The 2000 music video for Martin’s “She
Bangs” features a lot of dancers, but only

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.420
one of them would grow up to be Magic Mike.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.190
Past all the rump-shaking, and oddly-placed
mer-people, is a young Tatum dancing his heart

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.190
out.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.150
And while Ricky Martin has since faded into
obscurity, this video proved to be a valuable

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.280
stepping stone for the actor.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.260
And also as a cautionary tale about following
strange women into the ocean.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.500
Helen Mirren
Not only has Helen Mirren achieved Dame status,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.720
she’s also an actress who surprises audiences
with the roles she picks.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.430
Wether it’s transforming herself to play
the titular role in films like The Queen,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.730
or being a straight-up badass secret agent
in RED, Mirren is a versatile artist.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.700
Having a song interest in acting all her life,
she’s been working since the sixties.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.400
And one of her early films had her showing
a lot of skin.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.780
Cast as Caesonia in 1979’s Caligula, Mirren
worked alongside Malcolm McDowell and Peter

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.370
O’Toole in telling the story of the Roman
Caesar.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.390
And given that Caligula was a notoriously
“passionate” ruler, we’ll let your imaginations

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.531
do the rest.

00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.250
The actress has joked about her time on set,
saying that given how naked everyone else

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.970
was, it would be weird if she wasn’t.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.980
And that the whole thing was a great experience.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.372
Chris Pratt
Chris Pratt is a man wearing many hats, who

00:03:37.372 --> 00:03:40.640
has successfully conquered both television
and film.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.180
But before the actor made a name for himself
as Peter Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.440
he was a stripper for bachelorette parties.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.370
Known for his goofiness and impeccable comedic
timing, it’s safe to say that Pratt found

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.780
his calling with acting.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.230
When asked about his dancing days, he jests
that they were awkward and disappointing for

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.230
everyone involved.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.600
It’s a good thing the actor switched jobs,
because he’s already on track to becoming

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.980
Hollywood’s next superstar.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.740
Wether it’s action, comedy, or voice acting-
Chris Pratt has shown that he can do it all.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.390
Cameron Diaz
Like many starlets in Hollywood, Cameron Diaz

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.820
began her career as a model.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.510
And after being paired up with an agent, landed
her first big role in 1994’s The Mask.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.310
But contrary to popular belief, that wasn’t
technically her first movie.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.449
The actress can be also be found in a soft-core
bondage film from the early nineties, currently

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.400
housed somewhere in the internet’s seedy
underbelly.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.650
Given the ridiculousness of everything from
the early nineties, we’re willing to bet

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.419
that the content is pretty subdued, if not
downright laughable.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.990
She’s also gone on to star in over forty
movies.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.969
And given the insane amount of success Diaz
has enjoyed since, there’s no reason for

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:40.969
her to look back.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.970
Aaron Paul
If you’ve ever watched The Price Is Right,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.289
you’ve probably mused about how it would
feel to hear the announcer say your name,

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.009
and be plucked from the audience.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.770
Some of the fun of watching the show is playing
along at home, shouting prices at the screen.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.680
But the most enjoyment comes from watching
how excited the studio contestants get.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.330
Some jump up and run straight for the podium,
while others take time to high-five the entire

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.539
audience on their way.

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.310
Very few people know what this actually feels
like, and Aaron Paul is one of them.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.900
He did pretty well, too, making it all the
way to the Showcase Showdown.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.191
But it wasn’t his first (or last) time on
T.V. He also did cereal commercials, and even

00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:14.191
a music video.

00:05:14.191 --> 00:05:18.090
Jason Momoa
Jason Momoa has been acting for a while now.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.520
But gained notoriety when he rode his horse
into our lives in HBO’s Game of Thrones.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.770
Momoa plays Khal Drogo, the leader of the
Dothraki- a vicious tribe of warriors.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.570
After seeing what his character is capable
of, it would be easy for audiences to assume

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.779
the six-foot-four actor would be just as intimidating
in real life.

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.009
But it wasn’t his daunting figure that got
him the job.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.020
Raised by a photographer mother and painter
father, Momoa was destined for a career in

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.020
the arts.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.720
During his audition for Game of Thrones, the
actor proved he was born to be a warrior,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.949
and enacted a Haka- the traditional war dance
of the Māori people.

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.020
Not only did this dance land him the role
of Drogo, but it also contributed to his casting

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.259
in the 2011 version of Conan the Barbarian.

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.289
Robert Downey Jr.
Iron Man has gone from a niche-favorite to

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:08.039
a household name thanks, in part, to the talents
of Robert Downey Jr.

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.169
His fast-talkin’ take on billionaire Tony
Stark not only did wonders for the character,

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.169
but also for the actor.

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.219
Who has reprised his role seven times already.

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.629
And with the rapidly expanding Marvel universe,
there’s no end in sight.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.499
Raised by creative parents in New York, the
actor has been honing his craft since childhood.

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:25.559
But a move to L.A. with his dad reinforced
his passion.

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.610
Growing up with a drug-addicted father exposed
the actor to the culture of narcotics.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.669
And had an influence on his own struggles
with substance abuse.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.740
Struggles which, thankfully, Downey Jr. has
since overcome.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.210
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.669
