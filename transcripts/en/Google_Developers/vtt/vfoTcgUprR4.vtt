TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.134
And this is the Developer Show.

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:07.550
I'm standing here
with Susan Koger

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.770
who is the co-founder and chief
creative officer of ModCloth.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.682
Susan, welcome.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:12.640
SUSAN KOGER: Thank you.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How are you?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.260
SUSAN KOGER: I am wonderful.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Me, too.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.665
So we're going to talk about
entrepreneurship and maybe

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:19.790
some advice that you have
for startup founders that

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.140
happen to be watching.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.200
But first, and I know you've
told this story like a billion

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.890
times, I'd like to talk to you
about the origins of ModCloth.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.400
Is that OK?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.470
SUSAN KOGER: Yeah, of course.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.350
So here's my very
specific question.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.770
You're sitting there in 2002
with Eric, your then boyfriend,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.480
now husband and co-founder.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.680
And you're thinking
to yourselves, wow,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.350
Susan's really
good at antiquing.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.110
Maybe we should spend
all of our free time

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.880
making this into a business.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.380
Like how do you cross
from one idea to another.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.342
How did that happen?

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:49.550
SUSAN KOGER: Yeah, I love it.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.160
I built ModCloth while
I was an undergraduate

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.400
at Carnegie Mellon.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.900
Just for me and my
style of leadership,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.230
and what I know about myself,
I lead very instinctually.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.840
And I think we did a lot of
things, just me and my husband

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.050
being in the business.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.050
Almost like having a beginner
brain kind of approach

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.550
to things.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.180
So you do have
to-- so I think it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.430
was very instinctual at first.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.137
You do have to
codify those things

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:19.970
and actually step back
and think about them,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.210
and think about what's working.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.560
These are the things that
we've kind of just done.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.550
What's working from this list?

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.354
What can actually
scale and what doesn't?

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.270
What needs to go away?

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.710
What new things
need to be added in?

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950
For me it was--
starting ModCloth,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.410
like deciding to work on it
full time once I graduated

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.230
from CMU, because I did it part
time while I was at school.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.590
I was at the stage where I
was like, man, if I can just

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.910
do this and I can
support myself and maybe

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.590
hire a few people to do the
stuff that I don't enjoy

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.067
doing so much, like packing
boxes is really fun,

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.400
but you don't necessarily
want to spend four hours a day

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.360
doing it, which is kind
of what I was doing

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.310
when I hired my first employee.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.860
Yeah, I was like,
man, if I can just

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.750
support myself, and
create this job,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.300
and let's see where it goes.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.020
And it's just continued
to go and grow.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.669
And yeah, I feel really
fortunate to be able to do it.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:08.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.259
So here's a question
based on what

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.850
you were saying about having
this job for 14 years.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.510
I can't imagine
it's the same job.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.140
And I have some data
to back that up.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.450
In 2012, 50% growth to
$100 million in sales.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.679
And in 2015, $150
million in sales.

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.470
There's no way that
you can get that growth

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.190
and still be doing the
same thing every day.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.660
But I'm curious what the
rate of innovation is?

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.280
How often does your job change?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.430
And how often do you have
to find new strategies

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.630
to grow even bigger, or
to deal with that growth?

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.380
SUSAN KOGER: Yeah.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.838
It's a really
interesting question.

00:02:38.838 --> 00:02:43.470
And I think-- I mean,
there's been so many phases.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.610
And I used to feel like
my job was changing

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.774
almost every quarter,
because honestly, it

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:50.440
is just like we were
growing so quickly.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.600
I want to say in
2010 we hired-- we

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.433
had 100 people at the
beginning of the year,

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.800
and we hired 150 that year.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.810
So we went from like
100 to like, I think,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.270
225-ish by the time
the year was out.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.181
But it's so different.

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:05.430
And there's no way that you
can hit the level of scale

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.130
that we've gotten to, or hit
any scale at all, without being

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.690
able to let other people
in and empower them

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.130
to do the things that
they do really well.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.060
So part of the process
for me has been

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.650
learning how to be a leader.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.210
As much as we've gone from
nothing to where we're

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.170
at today, with 350 full time
people across three locations,

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.280
the sales numbers
that you referenced,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.770
we're still a small fish
in the big fashion sea.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.480
Like it's a huge industry.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.160
And one that is
ripe for innovation.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.670
And we're doing
things differently

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.159
and in a very cool way, I think.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.330
So clearly you've been
at this a long time.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.680
And you've used a
number of different ways

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.660
to really help keep the
spirit of the company alive.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.550
Let me just kind of tag a few
of them that I think I heard.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.151
One is that you had to
be really innovative

00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:55.150
and you approached it
with this beginner's mind.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.419
That's such a cool idea.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.460
It's like, what's the
company we want to work at?

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.000
And you put that into
ModCloth from the beginning.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.730
I think other big
thing that I heard

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.330
is that you built
that into the culture

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.400
so that throughout, it wasn't
just like a list of rules,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.430
but something people carried
with them as part of ModCloth.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.400
Does that sound right?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.820
SUSAN KOGER: Yeah, definitely.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.330
OK.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.820
I have one more
question for you.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.550
And this is an advice question.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.550
There's somebody out there who
was where you were in 2002.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.880
They have a passion
for something

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
that they think they can make
into a successful startup.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.670
Where do they start?

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.330
SUSAN KOGER: I think the
first thing that I would say

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.790
would be to ask for help.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.310
And do it all the time.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.950
And be very concise
and know what you're

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.430
looking for at all times.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.240
Right?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.820
You know, if you're doing
something for the first time,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.987
if you get better your taste
is going to get better.

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:48.569
And you're going to look back
on that stuff that you did early

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.002
and you're going
to cringe at it.

00:04:50.002 --> 00:04:52.460
I look back at the first logo
that I designed for ModCloth,

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.970
at our first website, at
our first photo shoots.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.480
And I'm just like, oh, my god.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.440
It looks so bad to me now.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.720
And I didn't think that
when we launched it.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.140
Obviously, like I
cared deeply about it.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.420
It was the best I could do.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.250
So I think that sometimes we
get scared to just put something

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.974
out there, because it's scary.

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:09.640
It's vulnerable.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.460
You're putting
something out there.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.360
People might like it.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.985
They might not.

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:13.280
It's like, oh my god.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.840
But here's the thing.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.640
If you're going to succeed,
you're going to get better.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.439
So you've got to
start somewhere.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.640
So don't be afraid
to ask for help.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.813
And you've just got
to get out there.

00:05:25.813 --> 00:05:26.670
SUSAN KOGER: Yep.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:27.880
You've got to get out
there and put something out

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.450
into the world.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.408
And you know what, it's
probably going to suck.

00:05:30.408 --> 00:05:31.464
And that's OK.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.880
Or it'll be great,
and then you'll

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.112
look back at it
five years from now

00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:35.820
and you'll say, wow,
that kind of sucked.

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:40.390
And then you'll look back
at it and you'll be like,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.792
oh, this is actually
kind of cute and retro.

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Susan, thanks
so much for joining me today.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.740
SUSAN KOGER: Yeah,
thanks for having me.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.948
TIMOTHY JORDAN: For more
information about ModCloth--

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:51.940
and maybe we can put some
of your favorite blogs

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.580
and blog posts in
the notes as well.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.200
SUSAN KOGER: Amazing.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Check
out the show notes below.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.270
See you next time.
