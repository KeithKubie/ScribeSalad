00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.800
The intent in this lesson is to give you a feel for how some enduring

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.150
concepts stand the test of time. The ideas in Quicksilver, namely,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.770
using transactions as a fundamental operating

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.330
system mechanism to bundle and stage recovery

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.550
of operating system services. Found resurgence in the nineties, in the LRVM work

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.650
that we discussed earlier for providing persistence. Again, in 2010, it found

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800
resurgence in the form of providing

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.990
safeguard against system vulnerability and malicious

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.000
attacks on the system. And another research operating systems called Texas. We

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.270
will mention Texas when we cover a later lesson module on system security.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.280
What about the computer industry and the commercial

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.030
operating systems? Well, they always focused on performance.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.460
Reliability always takes the back seat. You will

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.700
be amazed, what goes on under the covers

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.020
of an operating system to gain performance. Just

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.100
as an example, you write to a file,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.150
and you think it is on the hard disk. Well, think again. It is a while before

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.160
your file write actually gets persisted on the disk. What if the system

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.510
crashes in the meanwhile? Well, too bad. Well things may change in the future.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.670
There are new kinds of memories called Storage class memories, that have

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.150
latency properties that are similar to a DRAM and are yet non-volatile.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.800
Will this new technology result in a resurgence of

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.200
exploring transactions once more in operating systems? Only time will tell.
