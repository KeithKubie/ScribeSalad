00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.200
Where we left off
in the last video,

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.810
we were just kind
of staring, amazed,

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.550
at this Earth's view of
the Milky Way galaxy,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.540
just making sure we
understood how enormous

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.530
and how many stars
we were looking at.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.100
And even if each of
these dots were a star,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.470
this is a huge amount of stars.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.360
But a lot of these dots
are thousands of stars.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.170
So our mind was already blown.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.140
But what we're going
to see in this video

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.089
is that in some ways, this is
kind of just the beginning.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:29.630
And to some degree,
I'm going to stop

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.180
doing these particles of sand
and a football field analogy

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.870
because at some point,
the particles of sand

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.500
become so vast
that are our minds

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.060
can't even grasp
it to begin with.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.130
But let's just start
with our Milky Way.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.280
And we saw in the last video,
the Milky Way right here,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.950
we're sitting here about 25,000
light years from the center.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.330
It's roughly 100,000
light years in diameter.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.810
And then, let's put
it in perspective

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.670
of its local neighborhood.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.222
So let's look at
the Local Group.

00:01:00.222 --> 00:01:01.680
And when we talk
about Local Group,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.679
we're talking about the
local group of galaxies.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.350
So this right here is the
Milky Way's Local Group.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.880
That's us right
there, sitting right

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.620
over here, about
25,000 light years

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.310
from the center
of the Milky Way.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.090
You have some of these
"small"-- and I use "small"

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.550
in quotation marks-- because
these are also vast entities,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.420
also unimaginable entities.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.580
But we have these
satellite galaxies around,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.580
under the gravitational
influence, some of them,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.880
of the Milky Way.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.950
But the nearest
large galaxy to us

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740
is Andromeda right over here.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.157
And this distance
right over here.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:39.698
And now, we're going
to start talking

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.560
in the millions of light years.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:50.760
So this distance right here
is 2.5 million light years.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.150
And just as a bit of reference,
if that's any reference at all,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.250
one light year is roughly
the radius of the Oort Cloud.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.260
Or another way to think about
it, one radius of the Oort

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.560
Cloud is about 50,000 or
60,000 astronomical units.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.950
And that's the distance
from the Sun to the Earth.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.250
So you could view this
as 2.5 million times

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.240
60,000 or so times the distance
from the Sun to the Earth.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.729
So this is an unbelievably
large distance

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:25.770
we're talking about here.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.770
And that's to get to the
next big galaxy over here.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.940
But even these things are huge
things with many-- I mean,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.290
just unfathomably many-- stars.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.230
But Andromeda, in
particular, we said

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.020
that the Milky Way has
200 to 400 billion stars.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.650
Andromeda, people
believe, has on the order

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.450
of 1 trillion stars.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.500
So these just start
to become numbers.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.405
It's hard to grasp.

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:52.780
But we're not
going to stop here.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.780
So in this, over here, this
whole diagram right here,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.420
it's about four
light years across,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.669
if you go from point to point.

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:01.560
If you go from one
side to the other side,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.200
this is about-- not
four light years.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.700
Sorry.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.305
This is 4 million light years.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.690
Four light years is just
the distance from us

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.310
to the Alpha Centauri.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.450
So that was nothing.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.820
That would only take that a
Voyager 1 80,000 years to get.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.650
This is 4 million light years.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.650
So 4 million times the
distance to the nearest star.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.590
But even this is-- I mean I'm
starting to stumble on my words

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.290
because there's really no words
to describe it-- even this is

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.850
small on an intergalactic scale.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.310
Because when you zoom out more,
you can see our Local Group.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.000
Our local group is
right over here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.270
And this right over here
is the Virgo Super Cluster.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.660
And each dot here is
at least one galaxy.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.435
But it might be more
than one galaxy.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:12.350
And the diameter here is
150 million light years.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.390
So what we saw in the Local
Group, in the last diagram,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.250
the distance from the
Milky Way to Andromeda,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.680
which was 2 and 1/2
million light years, which

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.647
would be just a little
dot just like that,

00:04:22.647 --> 00:04:24.480
that would be the
distance between the Milky

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.690
Way and Andromeda.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.900
And now, we're looking at
the Virgo Super Cluster

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.340
that is 150 million light years.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.470
But we're not done yet.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.030
We can zoom out even more.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.000
We can zoom out even
more, and over here.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.650
So you had your
Virgo Super Cluster,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.000
150 million light years
was that last diagram,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.280
this diagram right over here.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.404
I want to keep both of them
on the screen if I can.

00:04:46.404 --> 00:04:50.200
This diagram right here, 150
million light years across.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.340
That would fit right about
here on this diagram.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.340
So this is all of the super
clusters that are near us.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.200
And once again, "near" has to be
used very, very, very loosely.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.620
Here, this distance is about
150 million light years.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.990
A billion light years
is-- two, three,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.690
four, five-- a billion light
years is about from here

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:16.310
to there.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.700
So we're starting to talk
on a fairly massive--

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.908
I guess we've always been
talking on a massive scale.

00:05:20.908 --> 00:05:22.770
But now, it's an even
more massive scale.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.370
But we're still not done.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.522
Because this whole
diagram-- now these dots

00:05:26.522 --> 00:05:28.730
that you're seeing now, I
want to make it very clear.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.730
These aren't stars.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.230
These aren't even
clusters of stars.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.150
These aren't even
clusters of millions

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.710
or even billions of stars.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.670
Each of these dots are
clusters of galaxies,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.520
each of those galaxies
having hundreds of billions

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.490
to trillions of stars.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.925
So we're just on an unbelievably
massive scale at this point.

00:05:46.925 --> 00:05:48.590
But we're still not done.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.120
We're still not done.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.630
This is roughly about a
billion light years across.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.590
But right here is
actually the best estimate

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.980
of the visible universe.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.355
And in future
videos, we're going

00:05:59.355 --> 00:06:01.834
to talk a lot more about what
the visible universe means.

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:03.250
So if you were to
zoom out enough,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:11.250
this entire diagram right here,
about a billion light years,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.680
would fit just like that.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.500
So we're talking about a super
small amount of this part

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.000
right here.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.330
And this is just the
visible universe.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.330
I want to make it clear.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.664
This is not the entire universe.

00:06:25.664 --> 00:06:27.163
And we say it's the
visible universe

00:06:27.163 --> 00:06:28.920
because think about
what's happening.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.490
When we think about
the a point out here,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.290
and we're observing
it, and that's let's

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.400
say 13 billion light years away.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.770
Let's say that point 13 billion.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.228
We're going to talk
more about this

00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:44.220
in future videos, 13
billion light years.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.387
And I feel it's
almost a sacrilege

00:06:49.387 --> 00:06:51.720
to be writing on this because
this complexity that we're

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.550
seeing here is
just mind boggling.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.800
But this 13 billion light
year away object, the light

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.060
is just getting to us.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.530
This light left some point
13 billion light years ago.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.610
So what we're actually doing
is observing that object close

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.907
to the beginning of
the actual universe.

00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:13.740
And the reason why it's
the visible universe

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.698
is there might have been
something a little bit

00:07:15.698 --> 00:07:16.530
further out.

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.540
Maybe it's light hasn't reached
us yet or maybe the universe

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.380
itself, and we'll
talk more about this,

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.800
it's expanding so fast that the
light will never, ever reach

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.300
us.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.430
So it's actually a
huge question mark

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.024
on how big the
actual universe is.

00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:34.440
And then some people might
say, well, does it even matter?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.542
Because this by itself
is a huge distance.

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:39.500
And I want to make it
clear, you might say, OK,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.730
if this light over here, if
this is coming from 13 billion

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.860
light years away, or if this
is 13 billion light years away,

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.920
then you could say, hey, so
everything that we can observe

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.990
or that we can even
observe the past of,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.089
the radius is about 26
billion light years.

00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.630
But even there, we
have to be careful

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.820
because remember the
universe is expanding.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.046
When this light was
emitted-- and I'll

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:02.170
do a whole video on this
because the geometry of it

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.570
is kind of hard to visualize--
when this light was emitted,

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.830
where we are in the
Virgo Super Cluster,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.430
inside of the Milky Way
Galaxy, where we are

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.772
was much closer to that point.

00:08:15.772 --> 00:08:17.230
It was on the order
of-- and I want

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.520
to make sure I get this
right-- 36 million light years.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.060
So we were super close by, I
guess, astronomical scales.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.870
We were super close, only
36 million light years,

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.470
to this object, when
that light was released.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.095
But that light was coming to us
and the whole time the universe

00:08:34.095 --> 00:08:34.740
is expanding.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.834
So we were also moving away from
it, if you just think about all

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:40.590
of the space, that everything is
expanding away from each other,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.980
And only 13 billion
years later did

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.359
it finally catch up with us.

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:46.150
But the whole time that
that was happening,

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.240
this object has
also been moving.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.140
This object has also
been moving away from us.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.430
And so our best estimate of
where this object is now,

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.710
based on how space is
expanding, is on the order

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.600
a 40 or 45 billion
light years away.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.440
We're just observing
where that light

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.274
was emitted 13
billion years ago.

00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:04.440
And I want to be very clear.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.990
What we are
observing, this light

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:09.850
is coming from something
very, very, very primitive.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.600
That object or that area of
space where that light was

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.570
emitted from has now
condensed into way more,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.630
I guess, mature
astronomical structures.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.520
If you take it from the
other point of view,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.830
people sitting where
in this point of space

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.580
now, and they've now moved
46 billion light years out,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.534
when they observe
our region of space,

00:09:29.534 --> 00:09:30.700
they're not going to see us.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.533
They're not going to
see Earth as it is now.

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:35.470
They're going to see
the region of space

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.260
where Earth is at a
super primitive stage,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:40.441
shortly after the Big Bang.

00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:41.940
And when I use words
like "shortly,"

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.962
I use that also loosely.

00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:44.920
We're still talking about
hundreds of thousands

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.541
or even millions of years.

00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:48.540
So we'll talk more about
that in a future video.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.914
But the whole
point of this video

00:09:49.914 --> 00:09:54.189
is it's beyond mind numbing.

00:09:54.189 --> 00:09:55.980
I would say the last
video, about the Milky

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.450
Way, that alone
was mind numbing.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.824
But now, we're
going in a reality

00:09:58.824 --> 00:10:02.750
where just the Milky Way
becomes something that's

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.650
almost unbelievably
insignificant when you think

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.076
about this picture right here.

00:10:07.076 --> 00:10:08.450
And the really
mind numbing thing

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.970
is, if someone told me that
this is the entire universe,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.980
this by itself would certainly
put things in perspective.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.784
But it's unknown
what's beyond it.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.700
There's some estimates
that this might be only

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.520
be 1 times 10 to the 23rd
of the entire universe.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.760
And it might even be the
reality that the entire universe

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.680
is smaller than this.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.340
And that's an interesting
thing to think about.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.650
But I'll leave you there
because I think no matter

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.921
how you think about it,
it's just-- I don't know.

00:10:35.921 --> 00:10:37.420
I actually, before
doing this video,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.960
I stared at some of these
photos for half an hour.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.850
This is my least productive day
just because it's just so awe

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.560
inspiring to think about what
these dots and dots of the dots

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.007
really are.
