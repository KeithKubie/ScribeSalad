00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.920
After checking our genetic code, we see that this is most

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.430
likely a missense mutation. Because we change from a isoleucine codon

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.250
to a leucine codon. Because the overall change is just one

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.620
amino acid to a different one. This is categorized as a missense.
