Sleeping naked is supposed to have all kinds
of benefits, so being naked all the time can

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:14.549
only be more awesome, right? ...that’s not
how it works? ...awkward...

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.271
Hey guys, a fully clothed Amy with you on
DNews today.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.660
To get to the meat of why sleeping naked might
be good for you, we have to look at the one

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
undeniable fact about nudity: When you have
no clothes on, you stay cooler, and that is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.030
really what sleeping naked is all about.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.009
There's a fair bit of research out there that
says being cooler not only helps you fall

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.100
asleep but also helps you sleep deeper without
waking up during the night.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.140
And it’s not just a comfort thing. Being
cooler has to do with neural activity. In

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.609
both humans and animals, warmer skin has been
linked to increased activity in areas of the

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:49.300
brain that regulate sleep cycles; the warmer
the subject the more disturbed their sleep.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.870
One study from the journal “Brain” found
that a moderate cooling of the skin, just

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.329
1.08ºF, helped subjects sleep more deeply
and stopped them waking up at night, particularly

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.679
the elderly.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.800
Another study from the University of South
Australia looked deeper into the body, literally,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.780
and found that lowering people’s core temperatures
was vital in getting patients to fall asleep

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940
faster.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.540
And once you’re asleep in the nude, there
are health benefits! Sleeping naked allows

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.180
your skin to breathe, and also your private
area. This can be especially important for

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.630
women, particularly those prone to yeast infections.
Because bacteria, including yeast, thrive

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.790
in warm, moist areas, freeing your lady bits
from constricting fabric and allowing it to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.160
breathe all night can decrease bad bacterial
growth and help prevent infections.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.860
And while there’s not really a male equivalent,
some men prefer to sleep naked to keep their

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.680
testicles cooler and improve their sperm count,
particularly if they're trying for kids.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.420
And speaking of kids, another benefit to sleeping
naked? Adult time! Skin to skin contact, particularly

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.920
with someone you're into, is a powerful form
of mind-body medicine. Touching, like hugging,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.530
releases oxytocin, a hormone that makes us
feel secure. It also lowers cortisol levels,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.460
which boosts the immune system, and can lower
blood pressure and heart rate. And as we know,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.700
and science confirms, sex involves at least
some parts of you being naked.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.920
And of course, good sleep is crucial for your
whole body, not just for feeling rested in

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.340
the morning! Sleep is a time when a lot of
important hormones are released into the bloodstream,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.500
managing our appetites, helping maintain a
healthy immune system, and repairing skin

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.010
tissues. So really, cool sleep is beauty sleep.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.840
But ultimately, if you're not comfortable
sleeping naked, you might not sleep well.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.310
So if you're a clothed sleeper, try setting
the thermostat a little lower for the same

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.310
benefits.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.840
So, what about my whole “being naked all
the time” experiment? I’m not wrong! Trace

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:45.690
gets into the benefits of more naked time
in this video right here.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:58.510
So, be honest guys, who out there sleeps naked?
