00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.080
Let's say we have
a cup of water.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.330
Let me draw the cup.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.530
This is one side of the cup,
this is the bottom of the cup,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.130
and this is the other
side of the cup.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.325
Let me say that it's
some liquid.

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:19.920
It doesn't have to be water,
but some arbitrary liquid.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.260
It could be water.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.850
That's the surface of it.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.570
We've already learned that the
pressure at any point within

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.970
this liquid is dependent
on how deep

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.580
we go into the liquid.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.450
One point I want to make before
we move on, and I

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.730
touched on this a little bit
before, is that the pressure

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.460
at some point isn't just acting
downwards, or it isn't

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.480
just acting in one direction.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.975
It's acting in all directions
on that point.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.620
So although how far we go down
determines how much pressure

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.000
there is, the pressure is
actually acting in all

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.850
directions, including up.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.330
The reason why that makes sense
is because I'm assuming

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.950
that this is a static system,
or that the fluids in this

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.500
liquid are stationary, or you
even could imagine an object

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.360
down here, and it's
stationary.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.800
The fact that it's stationary
tells us that the pressure in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.000
every direction must be equal.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.970
Let's think about a
molecule of water.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.870
A molecule of water, let's say
it's roughly a sphere.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.440
If the pressure were different
in one direction or if the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.070
pressure down were greater than
the pressure up, then the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.310
object would start accelerating
downwards,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.950
because its surface area
pointing upwards is the same

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.240
as the surface area pointing
downwards, so the force

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.410
upwards would be more.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.550
It would start accelerating
downwards.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.520
Even though the pressure is a
function of how far down we

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.900
go, at that point,
the pressure is

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.150
acting in every direction.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.790
Let's remember that, and now
let's keep that in mind to

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.530
learn a little bit about
Archimedes' principle.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.840
Let's say I submerge a cube into
this liquid, and let's

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:13.370
say this cube has dimensions
d, so every side is d.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.560
What I want to do is I want to
figure out if there's any

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.870
force or what is the net
force acting on this

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.070
cube due to the water?

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.770
Let's think about what the
pressure on this cube is at

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.980
different points.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.760
At the depths along the side of
the cube, we know that the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.310
pressures are equal, because
we know at this depth right

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.350
here, the pressure is going to
be the same as at that depth,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.110
and they're going to offset each
other, and so these are

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.900
going to be the same.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.080
But one thing we do know, just
based on the fact that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.480
pressure is a function of depth,
is that at this point

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.510
the pressure is going to be
higher-- I don't know how much

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.010
higher-- than at this point,
because this point is deeper

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.330
into the water.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.275
Let's call this P1.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:03.210
Let's call that pressure on top,
PT, and let's call this

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.260
point down here PD.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.910
No, pressure on the
bottom, PB.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.220
What's going to be the net
force on this cube?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.330
The net force-- let's call that
F sub N-- is going to be

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.420
equal to the force acting
upwards on this object.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.280
What's the force acting
upwards on the object?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.830
It's going to be this pressure
at the bottom of the object

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.730
times the surface area at the
bottom of the object.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.530
What's the surface area at
the bottom of the object?

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:42.930
That's just d squared.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.770
Any surface of a cube is d
squared, so the bottom is

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.440
going to be d squared minus--
I'm doing this because I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.850
actually know that the pressure
down here is higher

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.630
than the pressure here, so this
is going to be a larger

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.090
quantity, and that the net force
is actually going to be

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.430
upwards, so that's why I can
do the minus confidently up

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.570
here-- the pressure
at the top.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.590
What's the force at the top?

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.620
The force at the top is going to
be the pressure on the top

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.750
times the surface area of
the top of the cube,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.700
right, times d squared.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.540
We can even separate out the d
squared already at that point,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.980
so the net force is equal to
the pressure of the bottom

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.920
minus the pressure of the top,
or the difference in pressure

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.150
times the surface area of either
the top or the bottom

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.840
or really any of the
sides of the cube.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.460
Let's see if we can figure
what these are.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.770
Let's say the cube is submerged
h units or h meters

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.560
into the water.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.780
So what's the pressure
at the top?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.600
The pressure at the top is
going to be equal to the

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.240
density of the liquid-- I keep
saying water, but it could be

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.610
any liquid-- times how
far down we are.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.080
So we're h units down, or maybe
h meters, times gravity.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.700
And what's the pressure
the bottom?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.060
The pressure at the bottom
similarly would be the density

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.600
of the liquid times the depth,
so what's the depth?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.270
It would be this h and then
we're another d down.

00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:29.480
It's h plus d-- that's our total
depth-- times gravity.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.946
Let's just substitute both of
those back into our net force.

00:05:31.946 --> 00:05:35.750
Let me switch colors to keep
from getting monotonous.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.360
I get the net force is equal to
the pressure at the bottom,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.120
which is this.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:52.730
Let's just multiply it out, so
we get p times h times g plus

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:54.480
d times p times g.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.910
I just distributed this out,
multiplied this out.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.230
That's the pressure at the
bottom, then minus the

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:13.950
pressure at the top, minus phg,
and then we learned it's

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.860
all of that times d squared.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.350
Immediately, we see something
cancels out.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.905
phg, phg subtract.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:25.950
It cancels out, so we're
just left with--

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.100
what's the net force?

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:36.000
The net force is equal to dpg
times d squared, or that

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.490
equals d cubed times
the density of the

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.740
liquid times gravity.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.000
Let me ask you a question:
What is d cubed?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.830
d cubed is the volume
of this cube.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.780
And what else is it?

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.800
It's also the volume of
the water displaced.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.680
If I stick this cube into the
water, and the cube isn't

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.050
shrinking or anything-- you
can even imagine it being

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.860
empty, but it doesn't have to be
empty-- but that amount of

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.640
water has to be moved out
of the way in order for

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.040
that cube to go in.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.360
This is the volume of
the water displaced.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.680
It's also the volume
of the cube.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.010
This is the density-- I keep
saying water, but it could be

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.770
any liquid-- of the liquid.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.560
This is the gravity.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.190
So what is this?

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.800
Volume times density is the mass
of the liquid displaced,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.240
so the net force is
also equal to the

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.120
mass of liquid displaced.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.260
Let's just say mass times
gravity, or we could say that

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.660
the net force acting on this
object is-- what's the mass of

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.120
the liquid displaced
times gravity?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:05.750
That's just the weight
of liquid displaced.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.030
That's a pretty interesting
thing.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.990
If I submerge anything, the net
force acting upwards on

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.630
it, or the amount that I'm
lighter by, is equal to the

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.370
weight of the water
being displaced.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.960
That's actually called
Archimedes' principle.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.260
That net upward force due to
the fact that there's more

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.090
pressure on the bottom than
there is on the top, that's

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.280
called the buoyant force.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.950
That's what makes
things float.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.280
I'll leave you there to just to
ponder that, and we'll use

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.919
this concept in the next couple
of videos to actually

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:40.789
solve some problems.
I'll see you soon.
