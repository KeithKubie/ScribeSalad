00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.160
GUS CLASS: Hello world, and
welcome to this week's episode

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.820
of Google+ Developers Live.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.480
Today we're going to talking
about the Sign-In user

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480
experience and ways that you
can make the most of the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.100
available features
from Google+.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.660
So I'm Gus Class.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.200
I'm a Developer Programs
Engineer on Google+.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.830
And I'm here today to kind of
again, elaborate on that topic

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.850
that Joanna Smith and I were
talking about this year at

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.200
I/O. [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.580
sign-in on your site is to get
that user signed in and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.235
connected on your site.

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.979
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sorry, we're
going to have start this

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:13.229
again, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.760
We're going to persevere.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.732
GUS CLASS: We're going
to persevere.

00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:38.520
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.190
GUS CLASS: Hello world.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.950
And welcome to this
week's episode of

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.220
Google+ Developers Live.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.730
I'm Gus Class, a Developer
Programs Engineer on the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.000
Google+ team.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.590
And earlier this year Joanna
Smith and I gave a talk at I/O

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190
on best practices for
Google+ Sign-In.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.990
We're going to cover one of
those concepts today, and this

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.230
is reflecting the user back and
welcoming them when they

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.650
sign in to your site.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.840
So as a foundational thing about
Google+ Sign-In, the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.800
goal when you integrate is to
get that user to sign in to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.290
your site and then become
connected to your site in a

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.180
way that they build an
emotional connection.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.050
So what I'm going to do today
is, I'm going to start with a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.690
very basic site.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.340
And then I'm going to make
marginal improvements on that

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.870
Sign-In experience to show you
ways that you can be creative

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.860
and create a more engaging
experience.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.700
So if you look at my screen,
here is the basic site.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.980
On the top right hand corner of
the site, which is one of

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.830
the hot spots for where users
look when they see your site

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.390
the first time, is the Google+
Sign-In button.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.670
And on the top left, I invite
the user to sign in.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.900
So let's take a look at just
the basic scaffolding that

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.960
we're building from here and
look at that code behind the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.080
site that's relevant.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.690
So here is that index.html
markup.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.750
And if you look inside of here,
this is a very basic

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.320
sign in button.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.590
I'm connecting that sign in
button to the global call

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.010
back, which is called out as
onSignincallback, and then

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.520
from within that global call
back, I'm connecting the user

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.080
to a helper module which
contains the functionality for

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.350
doing things like rendering
the user experience.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.740
So if you just look here
inside of that

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.580
onSignincallback, what I'm doing
is I'm just hiding the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.460
Sign In button, rendering a
Disconnect button, and then

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.180
kind of connecting that
user with that

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.290
helper.connect method.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.270
And actually, sorry, what I
meant to say was inside of

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.840
helper.connect is where we're
going to render the various

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.880
user experience or
for that sign in.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.700
So let's go back to the site.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.240
And let's see what happens when
I sign in the first time.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.330
So here you have this
site again.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.860
There's lots of cute pictures
of puppies on here, and that

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.550
user is invited to sign in so
that they can do all of the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.290
great things that they
can do once they're

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.720
signed in to the site.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.440
So I'll click Sign In, and the
Google Sign-In authorization

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.650
dialogue should render.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.290
We'll see what happens
before that happens.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.680
So it looks like we're having
some connectivity issues here,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.050
no big deal.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.330
Go back and there it goes.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.390
So here's that authorization
dialogue that you've become

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.230
very familiar with because
you're Google+ Developers.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.430
And so inside of this
authorization dialogue you can

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.260
see the various things that
Google is requesting for on

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.610
the top and the various things
that will become publicly

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.780
available from the
user's friends.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.340
So I'll just sign in here.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.400
And once I sign in, something
is going to

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.910
happen on the site.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.030
And that something that happens
is really what we're

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.320
going to focus on today.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.460
So in this really basic example,
what we are doing is,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.380
we hide the Sign In button.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.360
We render a Disconnect button.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.830
And then we reflect the user's
display name back to them--

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.700
indicating to them, oh,
you're signed in now.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.360
So this is a real basic
implementation.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.290
And so we're not doing
anything special yet.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.670
But this is a good start.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.750
So let's take a look at
how I'm doing this.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.450
So I'll go back in here.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.880
Let's look at some code.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.100
And so here's that
basic example.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.620
You'll notice that I'm using
jQuery, jQuery UI.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.590
You can do this anyway
you like.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.950
A lot of people are talking
about various ways of just

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.530
kind of using raw JavaScript
and CSS referencing.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.640
It doesn't really matter.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.880
But the point here is the things
that are happening.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.390
So on the top here you can see
where I hide the various

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.470
things that are going
to be updated.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.240
And then you can see where I
render that signed in as the

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.690
current user.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.030
And then you can see where I
show the Disconnect button and

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.870
then show the Authorization
button.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.535
So what happens here is, after
that user signs in, that Sign

00:06:51.535 --> 00:06:56.430
In button disappears and then
a Disconnect button appears.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.520
And that user profile
appears again.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.690
So let's go back and look at
that Disconnect button.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.390
So what I've done is I've just
kind of tried to do something

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.940
cute here, sort of match
the theme of my site.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.240
And I've added this little
Disconnect button.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.700
When you click Disconnect, the
user is prompted with a

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.060
disconnect dialogue.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.160
And then the user, after they
click Disconnect, they break

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.930
up with the site.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.150
And then they're disconnected.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.180
So there's that basic
experience.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:25.770
Let's think about ways that we
can make it even better.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.610
So if you're following here,
you'll notice also that this

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.680
is actually a live site.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.600
So if you want to check this
out on your own, you're

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.620
welcome to look at
my code directly.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.880
But moving along, here is
a better experience.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.380
So I'll just reload this
page to make sure

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.020
that it's all good.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.490
And so here's that same
experience that

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.880
the developers sees.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.150
The Sign In button in that
hot spot, in the

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.140
top right hand corner.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:54.010
And then the user signs in.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.380
And after you sign
in, something

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.320
different is going to happen.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.710
That user's profile information,
their picture

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.540
which is extracted from their
Google+ profile, is then

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.870
displayed alongside
their name.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.290
And then that same experience
from before happens.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.010
So let's again revisit that code
and see what we're doing

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.120
differently.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.870
So the key point that I want you
to take away from the code

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.810
that I'm showing you here is
that the differences between

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.500
an awesome experience and a
real basic experience is

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.580
almost trivial.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.659
You don't have to do very much
more to create a more engaging

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:34.799
experience.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:38.490
So looking at the code here,
the big change that happens

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.610
now is that HTML, as opposed to
being rendered just based

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.200
on the user's display name, is
being created using this

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.050
getProfileHTML function.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.400
So you'll notice that the first
thing that we do is, we

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.970
get that user's image URL.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.260
And that image URL will then be
put inside of that profile

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.460
box along with alt text
displaying their display name.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.650
And then that user's display
name again is going to be

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.300
reflected back to the user.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.700
So something special happens
when the user sees themselves

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.700
looking back on the site.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.140
They think to themselves, I
am part of this site now.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.430
My experience is
tailored to me.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.400
And now, like that social
connection is made there.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.370
So that if other people exist
on that site, or if you're

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.840
building these connections with
other people on the site,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.980
then you know that it's
a face-to-face sort of

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.220
conversation and experience.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.360
So I'm going to show
you one more way

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.880
you can make it better.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.120
I'll just disconnect
here again.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.093
Reload the page, and I'm just
using these anchor tags to

00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:46.930
kind of distinguish between
the various experiences.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.850
So I'll sign in.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.500
And after that sign
in, something

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.750
different is going to happen.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.700
You might have missed it, but on
the top left hand corner of

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.320
the site, my profile
was rendered.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.410
And then it bounces.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.220
So let's take one more
look at that.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.860
Awesome.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.560
So you see that profile bounce,
and then all of a

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.170
sudden your attention is
drawn right to it.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.810
Now I'm not going to say that
this is what you should do

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.380
specifically for your site.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.150
But this is one unique way that
you can kind of enhance

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:28.000
that experience, draw the
user in more, and

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.760
let them know that--

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.070
yeah.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.610
I'm signed in to this site.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.720
I'm there and here's
my information.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.410
Here is the information that
Google is presenting to me.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.960
And now I'm kind part of
this site's experience.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.140
So this is going to be the
final code snippet

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.460
that I'll show you.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:49.280
And again, this is just a very
small change to that code that

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.560
we had seen as our
basic example.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.200
So what we're doing differently
here is, we're

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.470
using a jQuery UI effect
for bounce.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.670
And we're setting a time out
for that animation to show.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.240
So that's pretty much it.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.840
The real key takeaway here is,
try to be creative in the way

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.220
that you're integrating
Google+ Sign-In.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.980
And think about the things
that you can do that are

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.630
unique to your site to
distinguish it from just sort

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.830
of that boring old or
conventional sign in

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.040
experience where just the user
signs, they're authorized on

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.210
your site, and that's it.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.120
So think about ways
that you can make

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.120
your experience better.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:34.840
And keep an eye out for future
Google+ GDLs, because we're

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.240
going to be showing additional
things you can do to improve

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.370
your site experience.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.620
Thanks for watching.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:12:41.847
