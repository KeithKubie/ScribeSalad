00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.120
&gt;&gt; Sarah DeBacher: Hi,
everyone, my name is Sarah,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.630
and I am the lead of the
Division of Education

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.660
at the Louisiana
Endowment for Humanities.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.590
We are a state counsel
of the National Endowment

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.820
for the Humanities, and
I'm here to talk with you

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.200
about PRIME TIME Family Reading.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
And our suite of programs
that support literacy

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.380
that begins in the lap of homes.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.700
Because I'm in the room of
people who I know love books

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.580
and reading, I thought I
would begin with a story.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.160
It is the story of reading with
my son who is six years old.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.470
And somehow the real
Brothers Grimm version wound

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.320
up on our bookshelf.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.740
It is not at all like
the Disney version,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.730
and when we finished reading
this book, my son turned to me

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.890
and said, "Mom, why
does the queen care

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.460
so much about being pretty?"

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.880
He's six. We had a
discussion about feminism.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.760
This is the kind of thing
that happens regularly

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.930
when the approach to learning
literacy is not the teacher

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.350
delivering content, who,
what, when, where, why,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.990
those route approaches.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.760
But, when the approach
is humanistic discussion,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.820
humanistic conversation.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.120
And we believe at PRIME Time

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.980
that it can happen
in all families.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.360
The strategies that enhance
learning are here featured

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.500
in the PRIME TIME methodology,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.490
we call them the
PRIME TIME Pillars,

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.980
they're essentially
learner centered, right?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.210
They're about privileging the
people who are in the room

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.590
and the knowledge
that they possess.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.460
They're about learning
through joy.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.660
They're about talking about
books in ways that inspire,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.040
love, and that connect the book
to the experience of the reader

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.970
who is reading and
talking about those books.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.580
We believe that it's
important that programs

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.580
like PRIME TIME exist in part
because, of what's happening

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.180
in the schools that serve
families that are least likely

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.360
to have access to humanities
and humanistic pedagogies.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.630
In other words, humanistic
pedagogies are most --

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.550
most often found in
elite settings, right?

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.890
Institutions of higher
learning, Parochial schools,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.750
they're not found
commonly in public schools.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.480
My son attends a public school,
and I work with teachers there,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.780
I work with them to
help find more ways

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.570
of introducing conversation
into the classroom,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.090
so that what Kelly
Gallagher refers to as

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.100
"Readocide" is not
happening in our classrooms.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.920
This is the context of
the state of Louisiana,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.530
which is where PRIME
TIME was built.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.020
In 1991, in fact, librarians
around the state came together

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.390
to discuss the problem of
intergenerational illiteracy.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.330
And how it was that we could
find a way to address that issue

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.910
when public schools were
not doing the best job

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.210
of addressing it there.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.540
We now have a suite of
programs, at the heart

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.650
of it is PRIME TIME
Family Reading.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.710
It occurs over 90 minutes, one
night a week for six weeks.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.500
Families gather together to
eat a meal together, to read,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.910
and discuss a book though
open-ended Socratic discussion.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.390
And they all take a copy of
that humanities-based children

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.120
literature home in order to
build their home library.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.180
PRIME TIME Preschool builds
on the family reading model,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.380
but integrates families with
children who are three to five,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.090
through center based
play that links

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.740
with the humanities
themes in the book.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.280
And we also are now offering
teacher professional development

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.630
to support teachers, again,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.050
in leading discussions
in the classroom.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.580
We've been at it for a long
time, 26 years to be exact.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.060
I know you can't
read this slide,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.490
I'm not going to read it to you.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.790
Please talk to me later

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.260
if you're interested
in our history.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.830
I'd love for you to
be part of our future.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.210
We remain relentlessly focused
on under-served audiences.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.460
Gain, bringing elite
strategies to learning.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.930
I don't know, the
shouldn't be elite.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.190
Bringing just the
strategies that work

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.180
to learning to everyone.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.690
Because, again, we believe
that everyone deserves

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.480
that kind of education.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.000
Oh -- yes, I'm like, and
there's numbers here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.380
I realize that I -- I've been
seeing all these numbers,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.350
and I'm like, I must
get the numbers in!

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.010
We -- over those 26 years,
we have, through the support

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.100
of our partners, such as
the National Endowment

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.240
for the Humanities,
worked in 40 states,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.290
and with over 100,000
family members.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.100
And we're just getting started!

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.180
Thirty seconds, whoo!

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.110
Oh, these are our families.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.980
And I really just want to thank
all of you for inspiring --

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.590
like today, I think a lot
of this has been affirming,

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.210
you know, to hear of
the beat practices,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.610
the work that you're all doing.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.250
To be reminded that when we
come together through inquiry

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.960
and discussion, we come together
and talk, and enjoy literature,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.950
and value and privilege the
people who are in the room,

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.970
and the -- everything
that they bring.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.830
We don't make deficit
assumptions about them,

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.960
but we believe that they
have just as much to bring

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.980
to the conversation as
we literacy experts do.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.200
That's how literacy
begins in the lap

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.620
of American families
through PRIME TIME.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.390
Thank you so much
Library of Congress.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.270
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
