your brain is making an assumption right

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850
your brain is making an assumption right
 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:16.310
your brain is making an assumption right
now hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
now hello and welcome to another episode
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.290
now hello and welcome to another episode
of the lab where we take your questions

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
of the lab where we take your questions
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.330
of the lab where we take your questions
and turn them into experiments my name

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
and turn them into experiments my name
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.890
and turn them into experiments my name
is Greg and I'm Mitch and today we're

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900
is Greg and I'm Mitch and today we're
 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509
is Greg and I'm Mitch and today we're
gonna be talking about cool illusions

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
gonna be talking about cool illusions
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.910
gonna be talking about cool illusions
and why we love them so much so we're

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
and why we love them so much so we're
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.230
and why we love them so much so we're
gonna be doing a bunch of weird stuff to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
gonna be doing a bunch of weird stuff to
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.870
gonna be doing a bunch of weird stuff to
our brains and yours let's start off

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
our brains and yours let's start off
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.820
our brains and yours let's start off
with the thing that humans do really

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
with the thing that humans do really
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860
with the thing that humans do really
well our brains have evolved to pick up

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
well our brains have evolved to pick up
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930
well our brains have evolved to pick up
pattern so for example there's a tiger

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
pattern so for example there's a tiger
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.610
pattern so for example there's a tiger
hiding in amongst grass and it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
hiding in amongst grass and it's
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400
hiding in amongst grass and it's
camouflaged like my coat then what will

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
camouflaged like my coat then what will
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.660
camouflaged like my coat then what will
happen is that our brains will be able

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
happen is that our brains will be able
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.920
happen is that our brains will be able
to actually focus on the important

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
to actually focus on the important
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660
to actually focus on the important
aspects and see the tiger and obviously

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
aspects and see the tiger and obviously
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.979
aspects and see the tiger and obviously
this makes sense our brains have evolved

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
this makes sense our brains have evolved
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.060
this makes sense our brains have evolved
to do this because it helps us

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
to do this because it helps us
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.250
to do this because it helps us
evolutionarily but interestingly your

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
evolutionarily but interestingly your
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290
evolutionarily but interestingly your
brain actually wants to ignore all the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
brain actually wants to ignore all the
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.029
brain actually wants to ignore all the
other information it's receiving so much

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
other information it's receiving so much
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.170
other information it's receiving so much
and it's trying to pick out what's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
and it's trying to pick out what's
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.700
and it's trying to pick out what's
important and what's not and so the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
important and what's not and so the
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.270
important and what's not and so the
stuff that's not it tries to get rid of

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280
stuff that's not it tries to get rid of
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.770
stuff that's not it tries to get rid of
so the solution is gonna be called spot

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
so the solution is gonna be called spot
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.270
so the solution is gonna be called spot
the difference we haven't actually seen

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
the difference we haven't actually seen
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950
the difference we haven't actually seen
these images yet but basically it's

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
these images yet but basically it's
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.359
these images yet but basically it's
gonna be a flashing image and each time

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
gonna be a flashing image and each time
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.520
gonna be a flashing image and each time
it flashes one thing changes back and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530
it flashes one thing changes back and
 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140
it flashes one thing changes back and
forth we've got a spot what that things

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
forth we've got a spot what that things
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.480
forth we've got a spot what that things
about the difference okay

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490
 
 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.679
 
wait oh oh I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
wait oh oh I
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.380
wait oh oh I
what is it someone well it's funny cuz

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
what is it someone well it's funny cuz
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030
what is it someone well it's funny cuz
once you see it it's like all you can

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
once you see it it's like all you can
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.399
once you see it it's like all you can
see it's like I'm just like I do not see

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
see it's like I'm just like I do not see
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.450
see it's like I'm just like I do not see
it but oh the shadow oh yeah oh my god

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
it but oh the shadow oh yeah oh my god
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.539
it but oh the shadow oh yeah oh my god
okay so that time curious let us know

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
okay so that time curious let us know
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.280
okay so that time curious let us know
how long these take you in the comments

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
how long these take you in the comments
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399
how long these take you in the comments
ooh tourism but you spotted already okay

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
ooh tourism but you spotted already okay
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260
ooh tourism but you spotted already okay
so we got there in France

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
so we got there in France
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.469
so we got there in France
no fair pain out there in New York see

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
no fair pain out there in New York see
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.030
no fair pain out there in New York see
this is the I shouldn't be ya know like

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
this is the I shouldn't be ya know like
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.859
this is the I shouldn't be ya know like
finding things yeah I'm like oh cool

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
finding things yeah I'm like oh cool
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.649
finding things yeah I'm like oh cool
image I cannot see anything it's like a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
image I cannot see anything it's like a
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.969
image I cannot see anything it's like a
pattern in the fence

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
pattern in the fence
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:03.889
pattern in the fence
no what I'm not good at this what does

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
no what I'm not good at this what does
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.780
no what I'm not good at this what does
that mean I'm like I would have died no

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
that mean I'm like I would have died no
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.990
that mean I'm like I would have died no
no I was like a primitive human never

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
no I was like a primitive human never
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.380
no I was like a primitive human never
just been like oh that's a cute

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390
just been like oh that's a cute
 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.520
just been like oh that's a cute
this was interesting because there are

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
this was interesting because there are
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.289
this was interesting because there are
so many faces and things that you would

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299
so many faces and things that you would
 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.180
so many faces and things that you would
expect to change like people walking

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190
expect to change like people walking
 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.130
expect to change like people walking
your brain is like are they moving the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140
your brain is like are they moving the
 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.710
your brain is like are they moving the
light is something that could change the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720
light is something that could change the
 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.990
light is something that could change the
cars could be moving but it's something

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
cars could be moving but it's something
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
cars could be moving but it's something
that you don't necessarily always

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
that you don't necessarily always
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.289
that you don't necessarily always
anticipate and your brain is actually

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
anticipate and your brain is actually
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.149
anticipate and your brain is actually
making these assumptions that these are

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159
making these assumptions that these are
 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.920
making these assumptions that these are
the things that make sense to move on my

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930
the things that make sense to move on my
 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.569
the things that make sense to move on my
I automatically goes to the words and

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579
I automatically goes to the words and
 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.390
I automatically goes to the words and
the people okay I give up okay it's on

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
the people okay I give up okay it's on
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.720
the people okay I give up okay it's on
the car the window like the reflection

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
the car the window like the reflection
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.640
the car the window like the reflection
on that is the changing back and forth

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
on that is the changing back and forth
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.960
on that is the changing back and forth
oh my god yeah but that was like

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970
oh my god yeah but that was like
 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.190
oh my god yeah but that was like
discrete cuz it wasn't an R I'm

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
discrete cuz it wasn't an R I'm
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.509
discrete cuz it wasn't an R I'm
surprised you even saw next Jeff yeah

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519
 
 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.229
 
from the night Otto so my brain is no

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239
from the night Otto so my brain is no
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.990
from the night Otto so my brain is no
working no having right my brain is

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
working no having right my brain is
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.970
working no having right my brain is
right now going to probably look at the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
right now going to probably look at the
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.410
right now going to probably look at the
human or look at the words look at the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420
human or look at the words look at the
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.420
human or look at the words look at the
things that's a violation airily wanting

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
things that's a violation airily wanting
 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.339
things that's a violation airily wanting
to do but I know this is an illusion so

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349
to do but I know this is an illusion so
 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.420
to do but I know this is an illusion so
I need to try and find the things I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
I need to try and find the things I
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.490
I need to try and find the things I
probably won't move because I've learned

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
probably won't move because I've learned
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.710
probably won't move because I've learned
oh the blue box yeah on the screen

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
oh the blue box yeah on the screen
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.180
oh the blue box yeah on the screen
disappears in and they do really go down

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
disappears in and they do really go down
 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.860
disappears in and they do really go down
because the water is behind it so it's a

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870
because the water is behind it so it's a
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.569
because the water is behind it so it's a
natural piece that goes I guess that's

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579
natural piece that goes I guess that's
 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:24.860
natural piece that goes I guess that's
part of the solution in that it's

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
part of the solution in that it's
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.440
part of the solution in that it's
replaced by something that seems normal

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
replaced by something that seems normal
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.800
replaced by something that seems normal
ya know those illusions work because our

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
ya know those illusions work because our
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.270
ya know those illusions work because our
brains have evolved to focus on things

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280
brains have evolved to focus on things
 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.830
brains have evolved to focus on things
that they think are important and in

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
that they think are important and in
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.420
that they think are important and in
fact leaving and making assumptions

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
fact leaving and making assumptions
 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.830
fact leaving and making assumptions
about all the things that Dean's as not

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840
about all the things that Dean's as not
 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.860
about all the things that Dean's as not
important so now it's time to take a

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870
important so now it's time to take a
 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.420
important so now it's time to take a
look at how our brain makes some wrong

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430
look at how our brain makes some wrong
 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.949
look at how our brain makes some wrong
assumption we have a variation of

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
assumption we have a variation of
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.960
assumption we have a variation of
something called the Moirai illusion and

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970
something called the Moirai illusion and
 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.849
something called the Moirai illusion and
so if we stick these together you'll

assumptions with this little rig we've
 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.890
assumptions with this little rig we've
got going so yeah this is obviously a

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900
got going so yeah this is obviously a
 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.050

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.090
assumptions and essentially start to
 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:05.540
