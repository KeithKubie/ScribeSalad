00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.220
In this video we're going
to get introduced to the

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:14.190
Pythagorean theorem,
which is fun on its own.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.930
But you'll see as you learn
more and more mathematics it's

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.570
one of those cornerstone
theorems of really all of math.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.920
It's useful in geometry,
it's kind of the backbone

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.750
of trigonometry.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.200
You're also going to use
it to calculate distances

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.510
between points.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.810
So it's a good thing to really
make sure we know well.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.570
So enough talk on my end.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.320
Let me tell you what the
Pythagorean theorem is.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.290
So if we have a triangle, and
the triangle has to be a right

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.110
triangle, which means that one
of the three angles in the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.520
triangle have to be 90 degrees.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.580
And you specify that it's
90 degrees by drawing that

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.930
little box right there.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.830
So that right there is-- let
me do this in a different

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.550
color-- a 90 degree angle.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.930
Or, we could call
it a right angle.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.390
And a triangle that has
a right angle in it is

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.850
called a right triangle.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.700
So this is called
a right triangle.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.440
Now, with the Pythagorean
theorem, if we know two sides

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.980
of a right triangle we can
always figure out

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.920
the third side.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.310
And before I show you how to
do that, let me give you one

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.560
more piece of terminology.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.230
The longest side of a right
triangle is the side opposite

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.690
the 90 degree angle-- or
opposite the right angle.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.650
So in this case it is
this side right here.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.285
This is the longest side.

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:55.020
And the way to figure out where
that right triangle is, and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.060
kind of it opens into
that longest side.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.150
That longest side is
called the hypotenuse.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.330
And it's good to know, because
we'll keep referring to it.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.000
And just so we always are good
at identifying the hypotenuse,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.560
let me draw a couple of
more right triangles.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.090
So let's say I have a triangle
that looks like that.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.390
Let me draw it a
little bit nicer.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.130
So let's say I have a triangle
that looks like that.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.010
And I were to tell you
that this angle right

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.390
here is 90 degrees.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.860
In this situation this is the
hypotenuse, because it is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.410
opposite the 90 degree angle.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.880
It is the longest side.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.670
Let me do one more, just
so that we're good at

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.420
recognizing the hypotenuse.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.050
So let's say that that is my
triangle, and this is the 90

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.790
degree angle right there.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.710
And I think you know how
to do this already.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.620
You go right what
it opens into.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.530
That is the hypotenuse.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.200
That is the longest side.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.400
So once you have identified the
hypotenuse-- and let's say

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.050
that that has length C.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.980
And now we're going to
learn what the Pythagorean

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.210
theorem tells us.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.680
So let's say that C is equal to
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.630
So let's call this
C-- that side is C.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.910
Let's call this side
right over here A.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.890
And let's call this
side over here B.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.620
So the Pythagorean theorem
tells us that A squared-- so

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.880
the length of one of the
shorter sides squared-- plus

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.890
the length of the other shorter
side squared is going to

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.370
be equal to the length of
the hypotenuse squared.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.740
Now let's do that with an
actual problem, and you'll see

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.820
that it's actually not so bad.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.820
So let's say that I have a
triangle that looks like this.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.050
Let me draw it.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.210
Let's say this is my triangle.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.160
It looks something like this.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.560
And let's say that they tell us
that this is the right angle.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.940
That this length right here--
let me do this in different

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.830
colors-- this length right
here is 3, and that this

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.170
length right here is 4.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.490
And they want us to figure
out that length right there.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.130
Now the first thing you want to
do, before you even apply the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.660
Pythagorean theorem, is to
make sure you have your

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.710
hypotenuse straight.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.350
You make sure you know
what you're solving for.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.120
And in this circumstance we're
solving for the hypotenuse.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.440
And we know that because this
side over here, it is the side

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.310
opposite the right angle.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.540
If we look at the Pythagorean
theorem, this is C.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.160
This is the longest side.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.920
So now we're ready to apply
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.070
It tells us that 4 squared--
one of the shorter sides-- plus

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.260
3 squared-- the square of
another of the shorter sides--

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.080
is going to be equal to this
longer side squared-- the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.590
hypotenuse squared-- is going
to be equal to C squared.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.310
And then you just solve for C.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.380
So 4 squared is the same
thing as 4 times 4.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.460
That is 16.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.910
And 3 squared is the same
thing as 3 times 3.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.810
So that is 9.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.580
And that is going to be
equal to C squared.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.610
Now what is 16 plus 9?

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.480
It's 25.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.195
So 25 is equal to C squared.

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:29.020
And we could take the positive
square root of both sides.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.960
I guess, just if you look at
it mathematically, it could

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.160
be negative 5 as well.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.870
But we're dealing with
distances, so we only care

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.050
about the positive roots.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.170
So you take the principal
root of both sides and

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.280
you get 5 is equal to C.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.260
Or, the length of the
longest side is equal to 5.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.640
Now, you can use the
Pythagorean theorem, if we give

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.620
you two of the sides, to figure
out the third side no matter

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.690
what the third side is.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.300
So let's do another
one right over here.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:10.670
Let's say that our
triangle looks like this.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.610
And that is our right angle.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.820
Let's say this side over here
has length 12, and let's say

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.080
that this side over
here has length 6.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.210
And we want to figure out this
length right over there.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.870
Now, like I said, the first
thing you want to do is

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.350
identify the hypotenuse.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.130
And that's going to be the side
opposite the right angle.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.550
We have the right angle here.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.650
You go opposite
the right angle.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:41.460
The longest side, the
hypotenuse, is right there.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.100
So if we think about the
Pythagorean theorem-- that A

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.820
squared plus B squared is
equal to C squared-- 12

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.220
you could view as C.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.740
This is the hypotenuse.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.670
The C squared is the
hypotenuse squared.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.030
So you could say
12 is equal to C.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.880
And then we could say that
these sides, it doesn't matter

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.580
whether you call one of
them A or one of them B.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.970
So let's just call
this side right here.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.990
Let's say A is equal to 6.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.780
And then we say B-- this
colored B-- is equal

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.640
to question mark.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.070
And now we can apply the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:25.940
A squared, which is 6 squared,
plus the unknown B squared is

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.330
equal to the hypotenuse
squared-- is equal

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.760
to C squared.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.250
Is equal to 12 squared.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.260
And now we can solve for B.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.370
And notice the difference here.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.110
Now we're not solving
for the hypotenuse.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:40.210
We're solving for one
of the shorter sides.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.790
In the last example we
solved for the hypotenuse.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.790
We solved for C.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.570
So that's why it's always
important to recognize that A

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.190
squared plus B squared plus C
squared, C is the length

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.670
of the hypotenuse.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.850
So let's just solve for B here.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:59.280
So we get 6 squared is 36,
plus B squared, is equal

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.700
to 12 squared-- this
12 times 12-- is 144.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.550
Now we can subtract 36 from
both sides of this equation.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.270
Those cancel out.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:17.510
On the left-hand side we're
left with just a B squared

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:23.410
is equal to-- now 144
minus 36 is what?

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.000
144 minus 30 is 114.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.080
And then you
subtract 6, is 108.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.910
So this is going to be 108.

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.630
So that's what B squared is,
and now we want to take the

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.600
principal root, or the
positive root, of both sides.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.430
And you get B is equal
to the square root, the

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.650
principal root, of 108.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.550
Now let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.550
The square root of 108.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.930
And what we could do is
we could take the prime

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.670
factorization of 108
and see how we can

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.410
simplify this radical.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:07.590
So 108 is the same thing as 2
times 54, which is the same

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:15.570
thing as 2 times 27, which is
the same thing as 3 times 9.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.780
So we have the square root of
108 is the same thing as the

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.550
square root of 2 times 2
times-- well actually,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.520
I'm not done.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.760
9 can be factorized
into 3 times 3.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.170
So it's 2 times 2 times
3 times 3 times 3.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.820
And so, we have a couple of
perfect squares in here.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.680
Let me rewrite it a
little bit neater.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.160
And this is all an exercise in
simplifying radicals that you

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.200
will bump into a lot while
doing the Pythagorean theorem,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.460
so it doesn't hurt to
do it right here.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:55.820
So this is the same thing as
the square root of 2 times 2

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.790
times 3 times 3 times the
square root of that last

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.510
3 right over there.

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.090
And this is the same thing.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:05.785
And, you know, you wouldn't
have to do all of

00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:07.960
this on paper.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.970
You could do it in your head.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.530
What is this?

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.780
2 times 2 is 4.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.200
4 times 9, this is 36.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.030
So this is the square root of
36 times the square root of 3.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.610
The principal root of 36 is 6.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:25.380
So this simplifies to
6 square roots of 3.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.730
So the length of B, you could
write it as the square root of

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.040
108, or you could say it's
equal to 6 times the

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.040
square root of 3.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.150
This is 12, this is 6.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.580
And the square root of 3,
well this is going to be a 1

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:41.600
point something something.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.360
So it's going to be a
little bit larger than 6.
