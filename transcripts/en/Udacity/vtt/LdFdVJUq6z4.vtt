00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.900
What this means as far as the actual delivery of services is once again you

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.030
have self contained, self defined modular applications.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.900
You can think of these as more or less vertical slices through the system.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.750
That each service is capable of self contained that it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.790
has all that it needs in order to provide that functionality to the user.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.960
There's a definition for it, so that the remainder of the system and

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.220
the architecture can have a configuration that it understands. And it's modular,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.270
okay? It obeys certain rules about interactions. In particular,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.560
there's a use protocol use at the level of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.890
the software architecture protocol describing, how the pieces work together.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.980
The overall intent is to try to directly relate, the business needs of the user,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.750
to functionality that's being provided. And typically this means that

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.920
as a developer, an architect, you're coming up with a suite of sub-services,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.700
that together can be composed into. These user facing services. You publish

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.230
them, you located them in particular places and you can dynamically invoke them.
