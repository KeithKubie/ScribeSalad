00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.360
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yeah, but like
all mathematicians, he's

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.970
tall, blond, and handsome.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.120
Yeah?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.310
Yeah?

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.690
-Well, he's not tall
or blond or--

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.085
is he?

00:00:09.085 --> 00:00:09.480
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:09.875
-Is he?

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:10.790
He's not tall.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.730
DR. JAMES GRIME: I don't know.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.370
I wasn't counting.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.430
I guess the choice of
maths was arbitrary.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.780
They wanted to do a film about
a troubled genius.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.670
And originally they were going
to do physics genius.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.760
And then they were advised to
pick a mathematical genius

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.740
because it might work better
with the script.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.250
It's a really good film.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.860
And the maths is
less important.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.660
Should we talk about what they
did in the film, the maths?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.150
-Yeah.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.840
DR. JAMES GRIME: All right, so
we'll talk about that first.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.780
Near the beginning of the film,
the MIT professor sets

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.660
his students a challenge.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.430
Who can solve this?

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.410
I put it on the blackboard in
the corridor, and who can

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.270
solve this problem?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.880
And it's taken MIT professors
two years

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.510
to solve this problem.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.860
Can you do it?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.550
Now, is it as hard
as he made out?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.819
So what was the problem?

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.030
If I say it first of all--

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.870
I'm going to say the problem
that he gave the students.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.070
It might sound like Greek
to you, because

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.580
some of it is Greek.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.530
Right so then I'll
say the problem.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.760
Then I'll tell you
how it works.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.140
And it's a problem we
can all do at home.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.110
I promise.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.290
So the problem is, draw all
homeomorphically irreducible

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.350
trees of size n equals 10.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.790
What does that mean?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.100
All right, let's try this out.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.350
These things are called trees.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.110
So I have trees.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.220
Instead of that, they are
networks of dots and lines.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.530
So these are called graphs.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.440
It's like the London
Underground map.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.300
So a network of dots
and lines.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.320
So this is called a tree.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.580
And what's not allowed,
what is banned is

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.566
something like this.

00:01:58.566 --> 00:02:00.050
This is banned.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.320
This has a cycle in it,
and cycles are banned.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.120
Now what was that other
big word I said?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.960
Homeomorphically.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.790
That's the worst one.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.410
That's actually not so bad.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.820
That means if I did
this, these two

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.050
are the same picture.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.170
Can you see what I've done.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.810
I've just moved the
dots slightly.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.370
So you can rotate them
and reflect them.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.310
Or you could move them
around slightly.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.570
But those two pictures would
count as the same thing.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.865
And there was another
clever word.

00:02:29.865 --> 00:02:32.750
There was the word irreducible
in there.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.070
So that's another
banned thing.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.905
Here this time what is banned
is something like this.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.600
This is banned.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.500
Only two lines go
into that dot.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.530
Which means pretty much
nothing happens.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.460
You go in and you
go out again.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.770
Nothing happens.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.720
There's no change.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.380
Nothing interesting here.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.390
So this is banned as well.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.210
Those are the rules.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.240
We want to do it for 10 dots.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.550
This is the problem
Will Hunting had.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.630
10 dots, how many ways
are there to do it?

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.570
I can tell you, there are
10 ways to do it.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.960
What I thought might be fun is
if I did a couple of them, and

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.075
maybe leave some for people
to try and work

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.240
out what I've left.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.854
No?

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:24.790
-I want to see all of them.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.610
DR. JAMES GRIME: You want
to see all of them?

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.235
All right.

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:28.485
So the first one is.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.230
So it's there.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.890
So if you can do that in less
than two years, then you're

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.120
better apparently than
MIT professors.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.660
Or if you prefer, these are
all the trees of size 10.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.435
Or this is a spider with nine
legs and that's a guy with a

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:09.210
funky Afro.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.410
I don't think that's
a particularly--

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.940
I think people can
do this at home.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.600
But the problem isn't
the important thing.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.029
What I really would like to talk
about is who was the real

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.235
good Will Hunting.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:23.680
The story is, well--

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.650
so Will Hunting solves
this problem.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.260
There is an urban legend that's
similar of a student

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.790
who ran into his exam late.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.410
And he copied down the problems
from the board.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.870
And he went and solved them.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.130
And the last one seemed
really hard.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.380
But he kept working on it.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.750
And he managed to solve it.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.340
And he handed in
his exam paper.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.640
And then the professor rings
him that night saying, you

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.400
were only meant to do the
first few problems.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.540
The last one was an unsolvable
problem.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.780
Ah, you solved it.
