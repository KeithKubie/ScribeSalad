00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.713
- You said you run obstacle
courses, right? Like--

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:05.922
- You should try.
It's a lot of fun.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:07.507
- I might.

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:08.717
I've got to get through this
marathon in December first.

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:10.301
- Oh, good God.

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:13.054
Oh, that's great, so how do you
like to train for that?

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:15.515
- Four-day-a-week runs and
then--

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.560
or base mileage runs--and then
long runs on the weekend.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.353
So how do you train for
obstacle courses?

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.980
Do you have one in your
backyard?

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.107
- No.
God, I wish I did.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:25.358
- That would be nice.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.860
- There's a park, actually, a
local park

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.153
that is an obstacle course.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.196
- Oh.
- And you can go there

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.990
and run the course a time
couple times--

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.491
however long--how many times
you want.

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.786
- Yeah, so is that how you lost
all your weight

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:37.787
since you got into this, or...

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:38.997
- [indistinct].

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:42.167
I started just walking and
dieting.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.085
And I don't--I wasn't starving
myself.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:46.796
But I followed a calorie count
until I lost

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.006
the first 50 pounds.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.299
- Yeah.
- And then after that

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.717
is when I really started
getting into

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.051
more exercise again.
- Yeah.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.678
- I've always been active,

00:00:53.678 --> 00:00:57.515
but I kind of just let myself
drop off for a long time.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.184
- Yeah.
- But especially when you have

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:00.560
a kids, you know...
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.978
Same thing happened to me.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.189
I played sports all my life
growing up,

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.025
and then I had my daughter in
'98, and...

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:08.693
- So did I.
- You just--really?

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.195
- In '98, yeah.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.863
- You get focused on taking
care of your kid.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.240
Then you forget to take care of
yourself. That's the--

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.992
- Well, you always put them
ahead.

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:17.202
- Yeah.
- So how did you--

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.953
what did you do to drop the
weight?

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.039
- I found the Couch to 5K plan.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.540
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.543
- And when I started, I was
about 198 pounds,

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:28.880
and I thought I was gonna die
just running two minutes.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.757
- Yeah.
- It was terrible.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.551
But within three months had
dropped [indistinct]

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:35.762
and then three months was
running three miles

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:39.516
four to five times a week and
then dropped about 35 pounds.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.226
- Wow.
- Then found out I was pregnant

00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:43.394
with my third child.
- Oh, my goodness.

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:45.188
- So are you excited about the
course?

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.439
- I'm super excited.
- Are you nervous about

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.024
the course?
- I'm very nervous.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:49.442
- You're very nervous.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.652
- Yeah, I've never done
anything like this before.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:52.153
- Me neither.

00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:54.239
My biggest concern is just
remembering my plan

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:56.366
once I get out there.
- Yeah, yep.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:58.785
You've got to remember to just
stop for a second...

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.119
- Yep.
- And not just run right

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.871
through it; try to--

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.206
- Square up.
- Yeah.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.667
- And think for just a--just
for a second,

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.001
and then go for it.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.795
- It's gonna be hard to do,
though,

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.547
'cause you want to rush through
it; you want to get done, but--

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:12.006
- Yeah, well, time, that's
gonna be going through my head

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:14.050
is this, "Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go."

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.301
- I'm gonna treat it like a
marathon.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.928
- Yeah.
- I run just to finish.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.388
- Yeah.
- I don't run for time.

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:21.683
- I'm not fast, but we'll see
how it goes.

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.518
- We'll see.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.144
It's exciting.

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:26.896
And it's really exciting
there's two girls.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:29.524
- Yes, yes, I was shocked,
because I think there were

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:32.151
only three or four on the first
season.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.403
- It's gonna be fun.
- That's awesome.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.612
- I know.
- I was thinking I'd be

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.030
the only girl here.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.116
Girl power.
