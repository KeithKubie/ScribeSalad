00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.639
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Subaru.

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.560
I'm pretty tall, a six-two or so, but there
are people who are smaller…

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.959
Amy for instance… but there are also HUGE
in comparison.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:22.740
Just HOW BIG can we get?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.849
Height is a big deal.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.750
It affects every aspect of a person's life
from their own perception of the world to

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.550
how they're perceived.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.629
It's a pretty common misconception that people
were shorter back in the day, but it's simply

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.629
not true.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.399
1,000 years ago people were as tall as we
are today, but during the 17th or 18th century,

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.960
nutritional deficits during youth caused humans
to shrink 2 and a half inches on average.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.480
Dietary hardship, climate, and disease throughout
history all affect height.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.629
People were NOT shorter in the past, but had
the potential to be as tall as we are now;

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.500
though, humans do seem to have some kind of
unofficial upper limit.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.870
The tallest known person in history was Robert
Wadlow.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.180
He stood 8 feet 11.1 inches (2.72M) and was
almost 200 kilos when he died at 22 in 1940.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.400
The man was massive.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.400
The current "world's tallest man," is Sultan
Kösen from Turkey, and he has the same disorder

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.530
as Wadlow, a tumor on his pituitary that causes
it to squirt human growth hormone into his

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.760
body; increasing his height abnormally.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.190
The reason we don't just keep getting larger
is, we have to live in the world.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.600
Gravity is constantly pulling us down, requiring
our bodies to create bones which counteract

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.090
that force.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.210
It's all about balance.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.810
We're reaching the upper limit for human height
because more weight requires larger bones,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.009
which requires more bodily resources to maintain.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.130
As an animal grows, its support structure
must grow with it; which means bones and muscles

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.460
must thicken; which can only happen so much.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.450
Plus, seven to eight percent of your body
weight is blood, so if you weigh 200 kilos,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.229
like Wadlow, you'd have 14 kilograms of blood.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.450
That blood needs to be pressurized, and pumped,
which as size increases, it gets more difficult

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.000
for the heart; so it needs MORE muscle, and
there's only so much room in the human body.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.260
Elephants and giraffes have highly pressurized
circulatory systems, to keep their blood flowing!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.150
Whales can grow larger than us because they
don't live on land!

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.970
The buoyancy of the water around them helps
support their weight; while their bones give

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.550
structure to their body.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.570
Air buoyancy is extremely low, only about
zero point one two percent of your weight

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.010
at sea level, where the air is thickest.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.950
If our air was thicker, it would help hold
us up, allowing us to grow larger, but it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.930
would have to be a LOT thicker, which could
affect our ability to breathe it in at all.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.940
In space astronauts gain a little height,
growing as much a 3 percent taller because

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.910
the fluid in between the vertebrae relaxes
and expands when not under the load of gravity.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.570
For someone like me that could mean adding
another 2 or more inches.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.760
On Mars, where gravity is only 38 percent
of Earth, you'd also get taller.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.570
But if children were sent to Mars, they'd
get big, but Earth gravity would be a struggle

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.090
of real proportions.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.510
So they'd kind of be stuck.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.370
If we lived under the water could we grow
larger due to the buoyancy?

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.370
Maybe?

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.760
But we couldn't walk on land at all because
our bones would break due to the lack of support.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.180
This is also why insects are limited in size;
exoskeletons can only grow so large before

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.480
they're too heavy to support themselves!

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:39.950
If you could be a giant safely, would you
want to be?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:49.570
What's 
your ideal height?
