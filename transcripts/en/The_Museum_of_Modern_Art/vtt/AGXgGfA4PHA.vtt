00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
- The idea of looking
at the story of Ireland,

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:06.432
and Irish America on film,

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:08.518
is something that had
always fascinated me,

00:00:08.518 --> 00:00:10.201
because I had grown up in a country,

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:14.102
where the depiction of
ourselves in cinema was so rare,

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:17.457
that I remember once being at a film,

00:00:17.457 --> 00:00:20.998
which was preceded by a short
documentary about Dublin.

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:23.807
And it was so rare for Dublin
to see itself on the screen,

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:26.195
that when it came on in
this short documentary,

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.416
it got a round of applause.

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.239
What I really wanted to do, I think,

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.697
was to examine something at a filmic level

00:00:34.697 --> 00:00:37.019
that had occupied me, which is,

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.805
who are we and how are we perceived

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:44.580
by audiences outside Ireland?

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.165
It occurred to me that a great deal

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:49.628
of what we think and know and perceive

00:00:49.628 --> 00:00:52.148
about each other is
through the world of film.

00:00:52.148 --> 00:00:55.747
We need to hear the
authentic, indigenous voices

00:00:55.747 --> 00:00:57.883
of other people through film.

00:00:57.883 --> 00:01:02.144
The problem with not having
an indigenous film industry,

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:05.950
is that other people come in
and make your films for you.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.214
Your point of view, your
perspective of the world

00:01:09.214 --> 00:01:12.174
is told through somebody else's focus.

00:01:12.174 --> 00:01:14.710
The most well-known film
that was made in Ireland

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.056
was "The Quiet Man".

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.469
It was a film that mythically invented

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.677
the kind of Ireland, that,

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:23.370
not just Irish people wanted to see,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.012
but that seemingly
everybody around the world

00:01:26.012 --> 00:01:27.398
wanted to see.

00:01:27.398 --> 00:01:30.173
I think it was in about in 1982,

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.611
Neil Jordan made "Angel",

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.642
which was the first film
by a young, Irish filmmaker

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:38.102
to deal with, as they call them,

00:01:38.102 --> 00:01:40.378
the troubles in the north of Ireland.

00:01:40.378 --> 00:01:41.824
It was a very tumultuous time

00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:45.504
in Irish and British politics.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:48.592
But out of that came Jordan and Sheridan,

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.624
and this was the first
time that Irish filmmakers

00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:54.803
had access to the means of
telling their own story.

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:56.521
It kind of interests me when people say,

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.625
"Oh, Ireland. Yeah,
Ireland, they've always

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:02.221
"had their troubles with
politics over there."

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.672
But, the Irish peace process,

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:06.482
which was many years in the making,

00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:08.259
was signed ten years ago.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.116
And it's an inspiration to the world,

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:12.179
that after 400 years of warfare,

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.064
a peace accord was signed.

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:15.894
The other film that I chose,

00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:17.421
"The Wind That Shakes the Barley",

00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:19.592
is the first film that
I could look at and say,

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:22.332
"If I knew nothing about
the history of Ireland,

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:25.478
"that's the film that would
tell me the story of it."

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.207
It also has huge parallels with

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:29.124
the war in Afghanistan and Iraq,

00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:31.678
although it's set in Ireland in 1920.

00:02:31.678 --> 00:02:34.940
The idea of invasion and terrorism,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.520
and I hope that the themes
will be as compelling

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.510
to American audiences as they will be to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.574
people from other places.

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:46.967
There's a kind of an audience, I think,

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:50.833
that wants to see just a certain
kind of film from Ireland.

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:52.493
And young, Irish filmmakers,

00:02:52.493 --> 00:02:54.606
their problem is that, off their back,

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:56.870
they have to get the label of being Irish.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.127
Just like Roddy Doyle
said about being a writer,

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:02.372
he said, "Every Irish writer
has to get Joyce off his back

00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:07.272
"before he can become the
writer he's meant to be."

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:09.571
The future of Irish film depends on

00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:11.626
young filmmakers like that,

00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.274
that they can tell their own stories,

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:16.130
and that they can be universal.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.464
I think these are not just Irish films,

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:20.124
they're also American films,

00:03:20.124 --> 00:03:22.511
in the sense that we're all connected

00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:26.613
by the same concerns through the ages.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:30.410
Not just 1950 or 1850,
but way before that.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.183
Although technology has advanced hugely,

00:03:33.183 --> 00:03:36.888
the human condition,
it's debatable whether

00:03:36.888 --> 00:03:39.883
that has changed, and that's
why people make films.

00:03:39.883 --> 00:03:42.830
They make them about the human condition.
