Hi there.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.250
So this is going to be an interesting,
fairly short course.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.651
We've primarily built it to help
you learn more about Backbone.js.

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:11.940
Backbone.js is a library that helps
you organize your web applications.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.640
If you're completely new to organizing
web applications consider going through

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.020
JavaScript design patterns first.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.869
I've put a link to that course
in the instructor notes.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.600
Now i'm going to be honest with you,
learning about backbone

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.950
is an important objective for this
course but it's not my only objective.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.620
The other objective I have is for
you to refine your ability

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.380
to learn new things by exploring
resources on the internet.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.710
This is a critical trait to have for
any professional web developer.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.625
So here's how the course
is going to work.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:44.350
We've created a list of
resources from the internet.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.545
Things you might find in a Google search
to help you get more familiar with

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:48.148
Backbone.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.455
Spend the time to really
go through each resource.

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:55.275
Now, trust me on this, these
resources will help you get better.

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:57.935
I've read them all myself and
they're all pretty good.

00:00:57.935 --> 00:00:59.075
Also, don't rush.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:01.455
You'll be spending between 30 and
90 minutes on each one.

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:03.315
For each resource,

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:07.245
we also will give you the opportunity
to engage with your peers.

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:09.265
Ask an answer each other's questions.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.315
Teaching is another incredible way
to solidify your own knowledge, so

00:01:13.315 --> 00:01:14.920
help each other out.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.040
Once you're done with these resources
you'll be in a great place to tackle

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.560
your next project.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.550
Now let's dive into those resources.
