00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.150
Are you ready to give it a try?

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.850
What are the set of media queries,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.590
you need to apply in order to
apply styles from these classes?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.950
Use this diagram as a guide.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.010
Class AA applies from 0 to 400 pixels.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.380
Class BB applies from 301 pixels to 600.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.650
CC applies for any browser with a width,
greater than 601 pixels.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.131
And DD applies for any browser with
a width greater than 961 pixels.

00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:31.900
You'll need to write four media queries.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.130
One for class AA, one for
class BB, CC, and DD.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.200
In order for a class to display,
set it to display block.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.890
And when you type out your answers.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.210
Don't worry about new lines, just make
your media queries one long line so

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.720
they fit in the box.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.970
I'll go ahead and start you off with
@media for each of the media queries.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.580
And then at the end of it I went
ahead and drew these curly braces.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.170
If these were real media queries,
this is where the styles would go.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.330
Finish them up and good luck.
