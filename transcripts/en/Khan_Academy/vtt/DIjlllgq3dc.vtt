00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.390
To win a particular lottery
game, a player chooses 4

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.490
numbers from 1 to 60.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.490
Each number can only
be chosen once.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.040
If all 4 numbers match the 4
winning numbers, regardless of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.149
order, the player wins.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.340
What is the probability that the
winning numbers are 3, 15,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.550
46, and 49?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.920
So the way to think about this
problem, they say that we're

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.330
going to choose four
numbers from 60.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.600
So one way to think about it
is, how many different

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.230
outcomes are there if we choose
four numbers out of 60?

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.610
Now this is equivalent to
saying, how many combinations

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.080
are there if we have 60 items?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.990
In this case we have 60 numbers,
and we are going to

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.770
choose four.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.050
And we don't care
about the order.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170
That's why we're dealing
with combinations, not

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.900
permutations.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.660
We don't care about the order.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.310
So how many different groups of
four can we pick out of 60?

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.460
And we don't care what order
we picked them in.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.810
And we've seen in previous
videos that there is a formula

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.920
here, but it's important to
understand the reasoning

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.459
behind the formula.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.210
I'll write the formula here,
but we'll think about what

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.660
it's actually saying.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:18.560
So this is 60 factorial over 60
minus 4 factorial, divided

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.080
also by 4 factorial,
or the denominator

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.620
multiplied by 4 factorial.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.135
So this is the formula
right here.

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:28.370
But what this is really saying,
this part right here,

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.640
60 factorial divided by 60 minus
4 factorial, that's just

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.720
60 times 59, times
58, times 57.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.100
That's what this expression
right here is.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.050
And if you think about it, the
first number you pick--

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.170
there's 1 of 60 numbers, but
then that number is kind of

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.100
out of the game.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.340
Then you can pick from 1 of
59, then from 1 of 58,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.840
then of 1 of 57.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.010
So if you cared about order,
this is the number of

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.830
permutations.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.620
You could pick four items out of
60 without replacing them.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.860
Now, this is when you cared
about order, but you're

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.169
overcounting because it's
counting different

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.930
permutations that are
essentially the same

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.760
combination, essentially the
same set of four numbers.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.220
And that's why we're dividing
by 4 factorial here.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.840
Because 4 factorial is
essentially the number of ways

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.250
that four numbers can be
arranged in four places.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.530
Right?

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.800
The first number can be in one
of four slots, the second in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.860
one of three, then
two, then one.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.090
That's why you're dividing
by 4 factorial.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.830
But anyway, let's just
evaluate this.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.200
This'll tell us how many
possible outcomes are there

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.240
for the lottery game.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.150
So this is equal to-- we already
said the blue part is

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.110
equivalent to 60 times 59,
times 58, times 57.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.540
So that's literally 60
factorial divided by

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.410
essentially 56 factorial.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.210
And then you have your 4
factorial over here, which is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.320
4 times 3, times 2, times 1.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.830
And we could simplify it a
little bit just before we

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.150
break out the calculator.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.020
60 divided by 4 is 15.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.235
And then let's see, 15
divided by 3 is 5.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.910
And let's see, we have a
58 divided by 2 is 29.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:34.460
So our answer is going to be 5
times 59, times 29, times 57.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.520
Now this isn't going
to be our answer.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.720
This is going to be the number
of combinations we can get if

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.950
we choose four numbers
out of 60 and we

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.090
don't care about order.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.710
So let's take the calculator
out now.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:54.950
So we have 5 times 59,
times 29, times 57.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.590
It's equal to 487,635.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.720
So let me write that down.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:16.450
That is 487,635 combinations.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.810
If you're picking four numbers,
you're choosing four

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.270
numbers out of 60, or
60 choose four.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.670
Now, the question they say is,
what is the probability that

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.090
the winning numbers are
3, 15, 46, and 49?

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.420
Well, this is just one
particular of the

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.620
combinations.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.850
This is just one of the 487,635
possible outcomes.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:51.020
So the probability of 3, 15, 46,
49 winning is just equal

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:58.670
to-- well, this is just one of
the outcomes out of 487,635.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.890
So that right there is your
probability of winning.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.860
This is one outcome out of all
the potential outcomes or

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.070
combinations when you take 60
and you choose four from that.
