Hey, Vsauce. Michael here,
and today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.769
DONGS.
Things you can do online now guys.
First of all,

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.730
"danceromg577" brings up GogLogo.com

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.299
where you can make your own Google
looking home page with whatever text you

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.949
want.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.539
Or be like the "Thetom5000" and take
control of the wheel of fortune board.

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.070
Make up the hint,
use underscores for blanks and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.119
ta-da.
They actually look pretty good.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.320
Atom.Smasher[.org] has a bunch of others,
like this marquee.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.370
Then keep being sneaky like "cheseeh"
and sleuth around with no legs

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.559
as the man with the invisible trousers.
The surface you're on determines how

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:42.149
gravity

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.789
works, so use it to your advantage to get
to places you normally couldn't reach.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.039
"MrsLilSensation" showed me 'Loved.'

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.050
A confrontational guide makes it uneasy
and being a good boy

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.199
or a good girl evolves the world
differently than being bad.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.030
The humming drone in the background makes
it even more powerful.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.360
But for something more puzzle based,
check out Tealy

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.970
and Orangey. The arrow keys control
each ball at the exact same time in the

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.720
same way,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.729
but their worlds can be different, so watch out.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.750
Now, if you want variety, try "NoTrollzAllowed's"

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.909
'I wanna win.'
Every level is a new type of puzzle.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.990
Chess, search, a shell game,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.580
brickbreaker, aiming.
It goes on and on and on. Speaking of variety,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.479
"Left2Kill" showed off 'BoxCar2D,'
an evolution simulator similar to a screen

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.549
saver I once showed.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.079
It's a sight where objects are randomly
generated and then left on a track

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.380
to see how far they move.
At the end of a generation

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.560
the computer takes the ones that moved
the furthest and combines them in random

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.119
ways,

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.640
like they're having kids.
You can alter the occurrence of mutations

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.009
and sit back, let it run and watch it try
to accomplish its goal -

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.909
a naturally selected impressive moving machine.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.640
For more terror check out "tanos1998's"

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.600
and Dead Frontier Outbreak 2.
This text adventure test your wits.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.000
Would you be able to make the right
decisions during a zombie apocalypse to

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.160
protect yourself

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.410
and save your wife?
Then relax and feed the head,

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.020
a big blue head you can feed, pull on, click on.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.300
What's the point?
Well, who knows?

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.520
And how could I forget YouTube.com/cosmicpanda.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.680
It's not a channel.
Instead, it's a place where you can toggle

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.750
into YouTube experiments.
There are some cool things like, for instance,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.569
if you're on the Vsauce channel page
you can watch our explosion video

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.920
and boom. All of our other videos
are right there underneath,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.470
ready to play one after the other.
And if you decide to go back to our channel

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.989
page

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.360
the video keeps playing.
It's still right up there

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.060
in the corner. And that's just one of a
bunch of cool experiments going on in

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.610
Cosmic Panda.
Try it out.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.480
Let me know what you think.
"legoluke2000" has Oddcast's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.810
text-to-speech site.
Their eyes follow your cursor

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.150
and they'll say whatever you type, which is
a perfect way to tell you to subscribe

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.330
to Vsauce,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.710
so you're always up to date.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.980
And as always,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.200
thanks for watching.
