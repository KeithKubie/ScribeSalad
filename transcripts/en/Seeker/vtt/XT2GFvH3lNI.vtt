00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.009
We know neanderthals were a parallel group
of humans who went extinct tens of thousands

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.460
of years ago.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:15.290
What if before it happened they asked for
our help?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.020
Howdy humans, Trace here for DNews -- HOW
can you NOT find the story of neanderthals

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.020
riveting?

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.029
New research published in PLoS One examined
a 60,000 year-old neanderthal hyoid bone and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.700
found our human cousins were likely able to
SPEAK!

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.490
The hyoid bone is situated right below the
jaw.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.160
It's attached via muscles and ligaments to
the larynx, pharynx, epiglottis and the floor

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.980
of the mouth -- it's the ONLY bone in the
human body not attached to any other bone,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.899
and it's main function is to anchor the tongue.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.620
Around 300,000 years ago, a baby Homo heidelbergensis
was born with its hyoid bone slightly lower

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.800
than most.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.079
It was attached to the larynx which allowed
this baby a lot more control of both its tongue

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.649
and layrnx, usually known as the 'voice box.'

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.029
Fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, birds
all have hyoid bones -- but only the homo

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:10.560
heidelbergensis had this strange dropping
mutation.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.509
Both neanderthal and human descended from
heidelbergensis -- us in Africa and them in

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.509
Europe.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.670
All this has been known for a while, but though
the neanderthal had a similar hyoid bone,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.219
it wasn't until recently scientists could
show they had enough brains to make a language.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.849
Researchers used new 3D x-ray imaging technology
to scan the 60,000 year old hyoid bone and

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:33.450
created a computer model.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.780
The model revealed not only the external similarity
to modern humans, but also how the internal

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.360
structures were formed and shaped by the bone's
use.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.360
The kicker?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.579
The neanderthal bone is indistinguishable
from a modern human's, indicating it's highly

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.259
likely they used it the same way!

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.739
Neanderthals could speak!

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.639
This pushes language development in humanoids
even farther into the past.

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:03.200
It's been shown by paleontological and anthropological
studies before that neanderthals had art and

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.450
tools, they built houses and formed communities,
they even had religion and buried their dead,

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.459
but this is the strongest evidence yet this
was done with a verbal language.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.120
When the homo-sapien arrived from Africa,
we could ALSO speak; though with a smaller

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.400
skull, and wider, shorter noses than the neanderthal,
our speech patterns were likely stronger and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.599
more varied.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.689
Evolving in warm, sunny Africa, the homo sapien
was better adapted for life on our planet,

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.040
with smaller eyes and a more evolved frontal-cortex.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.599
The large eyes and bodies of the neanderthal
couldn't keep.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.150
The homo sapien travelled in larger community
groups than the neanderthal, and either absorbed

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.580
or destroyed their population as they spread
across Europe and Asia.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.769
Regardless of which, every year more evidence
comes out that these neanderthals weren't

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.379
mindless cavemen brutes, but were a parallel
culture of evolving beings.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.909
Not only were we all talking sooner, but we
were perhaps a little more similar than we

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:02.909
once believed.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.459
Which makes the history of these ancient people
all the more intriguing.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.110
I wonder if ancient neanderthals and homo
sapiens talked to each other?

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.760
Were there translators?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.319
We know we interbred, and lived at the same
time -- so... what do you think?
