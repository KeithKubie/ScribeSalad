DANIEL ALEGRE: Buongiorno.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.400
Hello, good morning.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.450
I'm Daniel Alegre.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.150
I'm responsible for Google's
global partnerships.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.470
And it's just an
incredible morning.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.220
It's great to see so
many people out here.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.040
There are a few seats
up here in the front.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.830
Please come up, for
those who are standing.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.440
Yes, please.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.445
Please come up.

00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:21.355
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:28.760
Oh, no, no.

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.859
That's for Veronica.

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:36.805
No, no.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.650
OK.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.500
Thank you.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.360
Great excitement.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.782
Obviously, you're
not here to see me.

00:00:47.782 --> 00:00:49.160
That's too bad.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.840
Andrea Bocelli.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.450
What can be said about
this inspirational artist

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.140
and human being?

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.140
I'll give it a shot.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.530
Maestro Bocelli has recorded
15 solo studio albums, three

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.750
greatest hits albums,
and nine complete operas,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.250
selling over 80 million
records worldwide.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.910
In 1998, he was named one
of People Magazine's 50

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.650
most beautiful people.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.370
In 1999, he was nominated
for the Best New Artist

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.970
at the Grammy Awards.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.500
The Prayer, his duet
with Celine Dion,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.780
won the Golden Globe
for best original song

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.330
and was nominated for an Academy
Award in the same category.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.080
With the release of his
classical album, Sacred Arias,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.860
Bocelli captured a listing
in the Guinness Book

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.900
of World Records as
he simultaneously

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.500
had the top three positions on
the US Classical Album Charts.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.770
Never done before.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.350
Seven of his albums have
since reached top 10

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.350
in the Billboard 200.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.690
With five million
units sold worldwide,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.880
Sacred Arias became the
biggest-selling classical album

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.620
by a solo artist of all time.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.190
And now, with over 20 million
copies sold worldwide,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.190
his 1997 album, Romanza,
became the bestselling album

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.290
by any Italian artist
in his genre in history.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.870
Maestro Bocelli was
made grand officer

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.350
of the Order of the Merit of
the Italian Republic in 2006.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.190
And he was also honored
with the Hollywood

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.890
Walk of Fame for his
contribution to live theater.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.400
Maestro Bocelli
recently released

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.140
Cinema, his 15th
studio album, featuring

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.190
renditions of classical
film soundtracks and scores.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.600
And in 2011, something that
is very important to him

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.440
and very personal,
Maestro Bocelli

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.200
founded the Andrea
Bocelli Foundation,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.360
whose goal is to enable
the less fortunate or weak

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.055
to have the possibly to have
a better future of beauty

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:38.805
and opportunities.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.840
It is incredible to have
such an individual here

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.630
and an internationally-renowned
artist, dedicated family man,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.832
and philanthropist with a true
purpose to change the world.

00:02:57.832 --> 00:02:59.540
Maestro Bocelli will
be accompanied today

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.790
by pianist Eugene Kohn, who
will be joining us up here.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.432
And if we give them a very,
very, very warm welcome,

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:09.140
maybe we'll also be
able to convince them

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.340
to sing a song or two for us.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.635
in giving Andrea Bocelli
a warm welcome to Google.

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:20.912
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:35.732
ANDREA BOCELLI: Thank you.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.210
Thank you very much.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.490
Thank you for this invitation.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:54.180
All my friends will be very
jealous because honestly,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.620
me too, I was very
curious to be here.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.870
And thank you also
for the presentation.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:08.830
Also, I think that if somebody
here is able to use Google,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.280
I think it's possible to
find every kind of news

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.220
about me online.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.594
So thank you very much
for this opportunity.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.620
I tell you, sadly, that
I prefer to speak Italian

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.100
because my English is horrible.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.270
So I want to be clear to
answer to your questions.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.430
But I know I have a
very nice interpreter.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.600
So I'll give you
the words and I will

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.205
answer to every kind of
question you want to pose me.

00:04:51.205 --> 00:04:52.080
DANIEL ALEGRE: Great.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.070
Well, first, thank
you and welcome.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.820
Welcome to Google.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.970
And I'd say probably
everyone here

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.130
in the audience has
friends who are saying

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.890
they are so jealous that we get
to see-- experience-- Maestro

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.527
Bocelli here live, including my
mother, my sister, my brother,

00:05:06.527 --> 00:05:07.110
and my father.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.030
You just flew in from Seattle.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.600
I know I also
appreciate you being

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.220
here at such an early hour.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.310
Because I think you landed
from Seattle around 2,

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.600
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.290
How are you feeling
this morning?

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.580
ANDREA BOCELLI: I flew
by Italy yesterday.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.940
Then I had a concert
yesterday evening.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.787
And now I'm here, so it means
that I'm still strong enough.

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.220
DANIEL ALEGRE: OK, good.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.970
Well, you were supposed to
perform on Saturday at San Jose

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.930
SAP Arena, and the
concert was moved

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.780
to Friday because of the
success of the San Jose Sharks.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.880
So for anyone who is--

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.300
So I guess we have some
San Jose Sharks fans here.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.760
But you perform in some of the
largest, most beautiful venues

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.210
in the world, whether it's
Carnegie Hall, the Wiener

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.510
Staatsoper, the
Metropolitan Opera House.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.830
And you travel everywhere
around the world,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:17.150
meet celebrities, meet
all the different popes.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.480
I guess the question is,
how do you stay grounded?

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.620
You know, what is normal
for Andrea Bocelli?

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.504
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.330
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING  ITALIAN]

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.820
INTERPRETER: I think
that whatever you

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.235
do every day becomes normality.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:44.420
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.330
INTERPRETER: If I think of
every day of my life of today--

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.110
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.930
INTERPRETER: And if
I could have foreseen

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.290
when I was a child what
would happen today--

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.870
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.328
INTERPRETER: I
would have gone mad.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.070
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.730
INTERPRETER: Because when I was
dreaming to become a singer--

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.580
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.620
INTERPRETER: I thought I would
sing in some Italian theater.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.997
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:21.997 --> 00:07:24.455
INTERPRETER: Maybe some radio
interview in my home country.

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:25.540
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.300
INTERPRETER: Nothing
more than that.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.330
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.380
INTERPRETER: I would've
been happy with that.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.790
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.025
INTERPRETER: Instead,
reality exceeded my dreams.

00:07:40.102 --> 00:07:43.010
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.030
INTERPRETER: And slowly, it
became something normal for me.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.960
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:00.460
INTERPRETER: Although
I'm very grateful for all

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.670
the populations, all the people
that gave me so much affection

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.660
and trust.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.145
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.280
INTERPRETER: And in
particular, the United States

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.940
have been very, very nice to me.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.080
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.680
INTERPRETER: And the symbol
of this link with the United

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.672
States has been the
concert in Central Park.

00:08:32.672 --> 00:08:36.320
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:38.737 --> 00:08:40.320
INTERPRETER: In these
cases, I try not

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.250
to think about what I'm doing.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.730
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.150
INTERPRETER: To fight
anxiety and tension.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.380
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:08:54.772 --> 00:08:56.980
INTERPRETER: It's better to
forget what you're doing.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.630
Just think, this is normal,
this part of our lives.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.860
DANIEL ALEGRE: You said
that, from a very early age,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.570
you knew that you wanted to
be a singer and performer.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.610
Do you remember when that was?

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.045
What, was it from
the very early age,

00:09:18.045 --> 00:09:22.010
or was it an event in your
life that spurred that desire?

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.730
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.220
INTERPRETER: It wasn't my fault.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.020
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:09:34.402 --> 00:09:36.110
INTERPRETER: It's
always been others that

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.380
cultivated this dream in me.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.680
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:09:43.674 --> 00:09:45.340
INTERPRETER: Since I
was a little child,

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.270
I always loved opera singers.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.250
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.520
INTERPRETER: And I
try to imitate them.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.590
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.210
INTERPRETER: And it was partly
the curiosity of the adults

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.620
that always got me to sing.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.650
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:14.419 --> 00:10:16.710
INTERPRETER: So I started
singing at birthday parties--

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.970
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.730
INTERPRETER: The church,
anywhere, at school.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.820
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.270
INTERPRETER: My classmates,
they were always

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.910
asking me to sing at school.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.180
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:35.992 --> 00:10:37.450
INTERPRETER: This
was a good excuse

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.380
to stop the lesson at school.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:45.220
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:50.820
INTERPRETER: So step
by step, I started

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.600
thinking that, well,
this might be my future.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.730
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:10:59.952 --> 00:11:01.410
INTERPRETER: I
mean, people ask me,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.460
what do you need to
do to become a singer?

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.060
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.220
INTERPRETER: And I say
that the best thing to hope

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.020
for a career in singing--

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.890
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:11:22.037 --> 00:11:23.620
INTERPRETER: --is
to realize that it's

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.425
others that want
you to sing, not you

00:11:25.425 --> 00:11:26.700
that wants to sing for others.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.360
DANIEL ALEGRE: And
you actually had

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.510
a potential different career.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.560
You studied law very
early in your life.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.340
And you could have been a
partner at Bocelli &amp; Bocelli

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:42.840
Law Firm.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.442
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:11:46.442 --> 00:11:47.650
DANIEL ALEGRE: What happened?

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.941
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:52.930
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:11:57.786 --> 00:12:00.900
INTERPRETER: In my family,
several of my relatives

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.930
were lawyers.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.300
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:07.720
INTERPRETER: So I thought
the most obvious step

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.390
would be to study law
and do the same career.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.540
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:24.200
INTERPRETER: But heaven
sometimes comes to save humans,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.690
and they save them from
having a terrible lawyer.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:33.890
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:12:34.514 --> 00:12:35.930
INTERPRETER: And
it made me become

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.910
a singer for this reason.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.980
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:49.990
INTERPRETER: So nothing
should be wasted in life.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.440
In Pisa, my hometown, there
is a prestigious university.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:13:00.320
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:07.020
INTERPRETER: So when I
was at the university,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.950
I had many amazing
years, and I even enjoyed

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.110
studying law at some point.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.710
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.278
INTERPRETER: I confess, I've
never read a contract of mine.

00:13:19.278 --> 00:13:22.107
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:22.107 --> 00:13:24.690
DANIEL ALEGRE: Hopefully, you're
surrounded by a good attorney

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.720
now.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.370
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.180
DANIEL ALEGRE: Do you
mind just walking us

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.150
through what was a
key turning point

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.280
in your professional career.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.210
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.746
DANIEL ALEGRE: And what role did
Maestro Pavarotti have in it.

00:13:45.746 --> 00:13:48.180
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.480
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:13:51.876 --> 00:13:53.250
INTERPRETER: So
Luciano Pavarotti

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.760
was key in two
different moments.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.586
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.970
INTERPRETER: So
first, when he said--

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.870
he had the courage to say I
would have been a good singer.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.280
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.740
INTERPRETER: Until then, no
one in the music business

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.480
had ever wanted to invest in me.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.640
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:14:33.742 --> 00:14:35.950
INTERPRETER: Everyone said,
you're good, you're good,

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.020
but no one ever put
a dollar or two.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.600
They made me do a--

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.000
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.280
INTERPRETER: So Pavarotti was
key in this sense, of course.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.924
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:55.340
INTERPRETER: And
the second moment

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.980
that's even more important
than the first one--

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.110
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:05.080
INTERPRETER: --was when
I had the opportunity

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.780
to sing close to him.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.730
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.170
INTERPRETER: I listened to him.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:15.545
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:15:15.545 --> 00:15:17.420
INTERPRETER: And I
thought, oh my god, I need

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.340
to start from scratch again.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.900
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:31.540
INTERPRETER: Because I had
understood that my technique

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.950
was very rough.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.720
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:15:46.217 --> 00:15:48.550
INTERPRETER: And thanks to
this, I started from scratch.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:53.305
And thanks to this, I can
now sing like pretty easily.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.100
DANIEL ALEGRE: And
I'm curious, what

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:02.030
is it like to sing
alongside Maestro

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:06.290
Pavarotti or other
well-known opera singers?

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.330
Is it intimidating?

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.280
Is it collegial?

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.419
How does that work?

00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.710
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.260
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.126
INTERPRETER: When I first sang
with him, we were at his place.

00:16:23.126 --> 00:16:26.155
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:26.155 --> 00:16:29.960
INTERPRETER: We were three--
myself, him, and the pianist.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:36.830
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.340
INTERPRETER: That was,
you know, a situation

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.210
where I felt at ease because
there was just the three of us.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.610
And it was like a
familiar situation.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:54.080
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:16:55.244 --> 00:16:56.660
INTERPRETER: But
then, when we had

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.370
to sing in front
of a big audience,

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.530
that was a different story.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.200
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.530
INTERPRETER: I got sick.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:08.710
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.440
INTERPRETER: And my I sang
with high temperature.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.190
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.579
INTERPRETER: But I had an
angel on my side and I made it.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.000
DANIEL ALEGRE: And
after more than 20 years

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.700
of performing live, do you still
get nervous going up on stage?

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.950
And if you do, how
do you handle that?

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.670
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:36.260
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:39.816 --> 00:17:41.440
INTERPRETER: You're
always nervous when

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.770
you sing in front of a
public, because a voice is

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.580
an intimate thing.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.389
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:47.389 --> 00:17:49.680
INTERPRETER: It's something
that comes from the inside.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:55.370
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:17:58.774 --> 00:18:00.440
INTERPRETER: Singing
in front of someone

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.100
who came to hear you
is like, you know,

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.970
getting yourself naked
in front of them.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.400
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.200
INTERPRETER: So there's always
this sense of [ITALIAN],

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.290
you never know how
you feel when you are

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.120
in front of these audiences.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.130
DANIEL ALEGRE: And
what does the song

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.890
"Time to Say Goodbye" mean
to you and to your career?

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.350
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:41.210
ANDREA BOCELLI:
Well, honestly, it

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.360
has been very important
because it's a song

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.850
that everyone loves.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.140
I think there is a
secret inside it.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.040
I don't know what
it is, but there

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.120
is a very special message.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.100
DANIEL ALEGRE: And
it also made you

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.090
as a well-known household name.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.720
And it's been recorded in
Portuguese, Spanish, French,

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.000
multiple languages.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.630
Do you still like performing
it or does it become a burden

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.620
after so many times?

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.200
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.460
INTERPRETER: What
I like to do is

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.240
to see how much
people like my songs.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.150
DANIEL ALEGRE: That's great.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.570
And I think that leads me to
an obvious question for someone

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.510
who has such a passion
for music and for art.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.190
How does it feel for you
that your passion is also

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.260
a profession?

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.840
The commercial expectations
relative to your love

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.780
for music, do they
work hand in hand?

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.525
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:58.980
INTERPRETER: You'll
hardly believe me--

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:04.800
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.090
INTERPRETER: Here we have
a few-- sorry-- witnesses

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.505
like my Veronica, my
wife, and my brother

00:20:11.505 --> 00:20:13.500
that can witness it for you.

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:18.360
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.030
INTERPRETER: I don't care
what happens around me

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.020
from the business point of view.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.129
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:29.920
INTERPRETER: Sometimes,
I come to a concert

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.560
and I don't know nothing.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:36.455
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:39.830
INTERPRETER: Many people
ask me, how many--

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:44.300
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.760
INTERPRETER: I don't know
how many records I've sold.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760
People tell me things,
but I don't believe them.

00:20:51.812 --> 00:20:53.770
DANIEL ALEGRE: That's
what the attorney is for.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.512
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:55.512 --> 00:20:57.406
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:57.406 --> 00:20:59.267
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:20:59.267 --> 00:21:00.610
INTERPRETER: Exactly.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.150
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.850
INTERPRETER: The firm gives
a much higher, bigger numbers

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:12.730
to the newspapers.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:18.420
But then to me, they
give me another number.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:24.060
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:21:32.261 --> 00:21:34.510
INTERPRETER: Seriously, I've
never been too interested

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.230
in these things.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.640
My only concern is to sing well.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.490
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.670
INTERPRETER: Everyone needs
to do well what he does.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:50.816
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:21:54.454 --> 00:21:56.870
INTERPRETER: There's people
who take care of the business.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:00.750
I will take care of
singing well, the notes.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:07.874
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:22:12.104 --> 00:22:13.520
INTERPRETER: And
if any one of you

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.960
could attend one of
the studio sessions

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.320
that I do with
Eugene here, that has

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.290
worked with some of the
best people in the world--

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:28.510
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:22:33.535 --> 00:22:37.845
INTERPRETER: So Eugene worked
with Renata Tebaldi, Callas--

00:22:37.845 --> 00:22:39.220

INTERPRETER: I
was saying, if you

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:18.440
were attending one of the
studio sessions with Eugene--

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.780
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:23:22.636 --> 00:23:24.010
INTERPRETER:
--you'd be surprised

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:29.800

that goes well, that is good.

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:23:44.494 --> 00:23:46.410
INTERPRETER: So if I
want to optimize my work,

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.950
there's no time to
think about business.

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.670
DANIEL ALEGRE: And I will say,
I did witness backstage Eugene

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.915
doing exactly what
Maestro Bocelli mentioned.

00:23:54.915 --> 00:23:57.777
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:23:57.777 --> 00:23:59.610
DANIEL ALEGRE: And I
know that in your home,

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.300
you possess a very
sophisticated recording

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.580
studio where I
believe you recorded

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.670
your last album, "Cinema."

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.390
And I think you're
starting to see

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:13.700
a trend in speakers
of going into smaller

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.820
and smaller speakers and
potentially loss of fidelity.

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.240
How important is fidelity
sound to music enjoyment

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:26.400
relative to access to music
at any point in your life?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.300
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.370
INTERPRETER: I've
been crazy in love

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.730
for recording since I was a
little child, since I heard

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.640
for the first time my voice.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:53.800
And at home, I used to
have a small recording

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.980
that I used to enjoy a lot.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.110
ANDREA BOCELLI:
It's so magic, no?

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:05.890
To listen to our voice in
a small box is incredible.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.880
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:25:14.027 --> 00:25:15.610
INTERPRETER: And
since then, I started

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:22.380
collecting a countless number
of technological pieces.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:26.045
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.920
INTERPRETER: I visited every
single shop here in America

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.950
where they were
selling recorders.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:39.330
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.870
INTERPRETER: And
besides that, I'm really

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:44.700
fascinated by technology.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.920
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.210
INTERPRETER: Technology, like
beauty, will save the world.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:59.140
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:03.270
INTERPRETER: So like
every other thing,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.220
man can do good or
bad use of technology.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.526
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:26:09.526 --> 00:26:11.650
INTERPRETER: But I have
trust, I have faith in man.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:16.360
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:26:16.557 --> 00:26:18.640
INTERPRETER: And I'm sure
that man eventually will

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.220
make good use of technology.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:26.350
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.270
INTERPRETER: Technology
made huge steps.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:44.540
Just imagining a small
box, you can have thousands

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:49.420
of songs, thousands of books.

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:54.360
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.665
INTERPRETER: All this required
a lot of money in the past,

00:26:58.665 --> 00:26:59.230
of course.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.720
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.520
INTERPRETER: Now it's
all in your pocket.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.260
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:27:14.274 --> 00:27:16.190
INTERPRETER: This is an
incredible opportunity

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.960
to grow, to learn more.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.970
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.380
INTERPRETER: And this means
equality, in one word.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.880
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.780
INTERPRETER: Not
a forced equality,

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.020
forced by blood and
weapons, but something

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.180
that comes from the heart.

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:50.410
DANIEL ALEGRE: You
mentioned the inspiration

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.370
that you got from
Maestro Corelli

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.550
when you first heard him, how
important Luciano Pavarotti was

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:57.380
for your career.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.730
How important is it for you
to mentor young artists?

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:04.944
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:28:04.944 --> 00:28:07.470

inspire new artists?

ANDREA BOCELLI:

00:28:09.542 --> 00:28:11.500

had the chance to do it.

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.130

responsibility, obviously.

INTERPRETER: I'll do my best,
and let's see what I can do.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.333
DANIEL ALEGRE: So
is it safe to assume

00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:45.140
you're not going to push
your sons to be lawyers?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.969
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:28:46.969 --> 00:28:47.760
ANDREA BOCELLI: No.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.095
DANIEL ALEGRE: To
follow their passion.

00:28:54.095 --> 00:28:54.970
ANDREA BOCELLI: Yeah.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:59.130
DANIEL ALEGRE: In 2011,
I know that giving back

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:03.620
to the community and the
importance of giving people who

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.100
don't necessarily have a
chance and opportunity in life,

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.410
you founded the Andrea
Bocelli Foundation

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.160
with the aim of supporting
those living in poverty

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.380
in overcoming barriers caused
by illness and disability.

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:18.780
If you don't mind, I would
like to just show a quick video

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.897

it in just a second.

have to tell you

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.310
how unique it is to hear
a video here and then

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.680
hear the harmonizing
of Maestro Bocelli

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.760

out of my two ears.

DANIEL ALEGRE: What have been
the greatest achievements

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:05.380
of the Foundation
to date, and how

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.310
do you think it's
made a difference?

ANDREA BOCELLI:

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.060
INTERPRETER: The
biggest achievement

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.360
has been certainly to take a lot
of children out of the streets

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.280
and give them food, give
them education, give them

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.112
hope for the future.

you complete your path.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.029
But yeah, when there is
a lead, there is a way.

there's a will, there's a way.

that your lovely wife Veronica
and your son were in the video.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.110
Do they participate in the
Foundation actively as a family

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.290

heavily involved in all this.

My wife Veronica became vice
president of the Foundation

00:33:51.296 --> 00:33:52.295
from the very beginning.

architectural skills

operated in Italy,

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.400
INTERPRETER: Now sure,
this is a hard bet to win.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:50.980
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.730
INTERPRETER: But
this is the message

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:02.260
I sent everywhere in the world
to companies like Google,

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:02.760
for example.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.950
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.700
INTERPRETER: With the
hope that, together,

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:10.905
we can tackle this problem.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:16.050
DANIEL ALEGRE: I think we'll
have time for one or two

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.880
live questions.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:20.110
So prepare yourself for that.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:23.700
And usually when we have
people come here to Google,

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.280
and particularly considering
the impact that you

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.820
can have globally to
people around the world--

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.720
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.950
DANIEL ALEGRE: --we
ask, what can Google

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.941
do for you, for your foundation,
or for you personally,

00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:38.565
Andrea Bocelli?

00:38:38.565 --> 00:38:40.238
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:48.880
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:38:53.994 --> 00:38:56.410
INTERPRETER: So certainly, one
thing that comes to my mind

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.670
is collaboration with Google
to win this bet that I just

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.610
talked about.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:10.800
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:39:14.815 --> 00:39:17.190
INTERPRETER: Naturally, I came
to know about Google Glass

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.830
and I found it very
interesting work.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:27.045
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.030
INTERPRETER: There's
already some devices

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.910
that tell you like
who's the person that

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.980
is coming towards
you or the shops

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.980
that you are walking beside.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:49.980
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.380
INTERPRETER: But the problem
is much simpler and much

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.750
more complicated
at the same time.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:40:02.775
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.460
INTERPRETER: If you are
blind and walk in a city,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.660
you need to know which
are the obstacles that you

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.360
need to avoid.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:20.650
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:40:25.702 --> 00:40:28.160
INTERPRETER: This seems simple
because there's already cars

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.450
that are self-driving, right?

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:37.960
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.630
INTERPRETER: All our
cars have sensors

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.380
that tell us if there's
obstacles on all sides.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:50.720
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.220
INTERPRETER: But we are still
far from resolving the problem

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.980
that we're trying to
face at the moment.

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:58.410
ANDREA BOCELLI: But where there
is a will, there is a way.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:00.084
INTERPRETER: There is a way.

00:41:00.084 --> 00:41:04.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:06.972 --> 00:41:08.830
DANIEL ALEGRE: Are there
any live questions?

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:11.270
There are two microphones
here, and also the Dory,

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.350
but I see-- can you please
go up to the microphone?

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.354
I think we'll have a
chance for two questions.

00:41:17.354 --> 00:41:19.020
And hopefully, we'll
be able to convince

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:23.530
Maestro Bocelli to grace
us with one or two songs.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.430
Please.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.221
AUDIENCE: I really
liked the "Cinema" album

00:41:26.221 --> 00:41:29.730
and how it's just a great
tribute to film and composers,

00:41:29.730 --> 00:41:33.310
you know, Ennio Morricone
and Hans Zimmer and such.

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:35.810
I was wondering if
you ever thought

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:39.190
of working with one
of these composers,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.330
and who would you
like to work with,

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.780
if you had a composer of choice
or even maybe a director?

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:55.980
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

ANDREA BOCELLI:

00:42:03.845 --> 00:42:05.970
INTERPRETER: Except for
Verdi, Pucinni, Lorenzetti,

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.530
or Rossini.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:13.380
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.810
INTERPRETER: There's a
contemporary [INAUDIBLE] first.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:24.885
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.260
INTERPRETER: There's one
in particular, Sartori,

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.260
who wrote all the songs
for me and who I admire.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.055
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.690
INTERPRETER: And he's the author
of "Time to Say Goodbye"--

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:45.050
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.200
INTERPRETER: --and of many
other songs that I sang.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:56.160
ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:58.500
INTERPRETER: Then there's
Pierpaolo Guerrini,

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.270
who comes from my own land.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.065
ANDREA BOCELLI: He's
my sound engineer.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:13.350
He has a very nice recording
studio close to my house.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:18.920
And he wrote some very
interesting songs for me.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:24.070
For example, "Melodramma,"
"L'abitudine"-- it's a duet.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:35.280
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:43:36.144 --> 00:43:37.810
INTERPRETER: These
are the two composers

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:42.430
that wrote the pop songs
that are more-- that suit

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.502
me best for my skills.

00:43:45.502 --> 00:43:46.584
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:46.584 --> 00:43:47.500
DANIEL ALEGRE: Please.

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:48.356
Next question.

00:43:48.356 --> 00:43:49.210
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.350
So I'm interested
in how you practice.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.920
So I was wondering if you
could mention or demonstrate

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:56.390
some vocal exercises
that you use

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.803
that may be beneficial for
aspiring classical singers.

00:43:58.803 --> 00:44:01.268
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:44:01.268 --> 00:44:02.254
ANDREA BOCELLI: Wow.

00:44:02.254 --> 00:44:04.226
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.732
No?

00:44:07.732 --> 00:44:08.565
DANIEL ALEGRE: Sure.

00:44:11.427 --> 00:44:14.010
ANDREA BOCELLI: I think it would
be very boring for everybody.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:21.010
There are many, many
different exercises,

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.900
but very, very
boring, believe me.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.599
They are scales, arpeggios--
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:44:27.599 --> 00:44:28.890
INTERPRETER: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.910
ANDREA BOCELLI: And
also phrases, you know,

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:37.846
that I have repeated and
repeated and repeated again.

00:44:37.846 --> 00:44:42.080
So I think it's not
the best place where--

00:44:44.837 --> 00:44:45.670
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.100
DANIEL ALEGRE: And then I
think one final question.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.800
AUDIENCE: So this is kind
of a little-- first of all,

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.674
thank you for coming.

00:44:50.674 --> 00:44:52.120
This is great for all of us.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.790
Awesome.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:56.180
Is there a short story that
you haven't typically shared?

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.305
Like something odd that's
happened before a concert

00:44:58.305 --> 00:45:01.050
where, I don't know, your
voice wasn't cooperating

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.000
or just something funny
that's happened that you'd

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.920
like to share with us.

INTERPRETER: Well,
actually this morning

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.730
will be in one of the things
that I will tell to people

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.342
that will ask me about that.

INTERPRETER: The
career of an artist

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:57.900
like me is made of a lot
of occasions and, you know,

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.490
anecdotes that happened
throughout life.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.280
So it's hard to pick one.

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.770
INTERPRETER: One
of the first times

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:14.910
that I sang at
Madison Square Garden.

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:46:21.664 --> 00:46:23.330
INTERPRETER: So I
wake up in the morning

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.430
and I have high temperature.

ANDREA BOCELLI:

00:46:29.276 --> 00:46:33.030

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:48.100
INTERPRETER: So I call everyone,
like my brother, my manager,

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:51.450
a few friends from Italy.

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:07.940
INTERPRETER: So I told them,
like, I'm sorry, I can't sing.

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:10.470
And they were all around my
bed as if I was about to die.

ANDREA BOCELLI:
[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

00:47:23.017 --> 00:47:25.350

manager was the most worried

of everyone.

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:55.460

let me go in the bathroom.

ANDREA BOCELLI: And I began
to do, [SINGING SCALES]

00:48:14.428 --> 00:48:16.110
My voice was very rough.

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.870
But I continued.

[SINGING SCALES]

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:28.240
I stayed close in my
bathroom for half an hour.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.150
And at the end, I came out and
I said, OK, I'll try it tonight.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:40.360
And after 10 hours, because
the concert was at 8 o'clock,

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:45.070
more or less, I sang-- I sung?

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:45.730
I sang.

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:46.920
INTERPRETER: Sang.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.878
ANDREA BOCELLI: I sang.

00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:53.630
Because where there is

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.010
DANIEL ALEGRE: Well,
you got your answer

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:05.960
to the vocal exercises:
lock yourself

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.470
in a bathroom for half an hour.

DANIEL ALEGRE: Well, where

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.280
We are willing to see
if there's a way we

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:23.090
can lure you to perform a song.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:25.470
We have a piano, Eugene,
here, and a microphone.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:25.700
ANDREA BOCELLI: No.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.616
DANIEL ALEGRE: Any chance
we can convince you?

00:49:27.616 --> 00:49:29.390
ANDREA BOCELLI: I
hope that-- now I

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.640
really hope that it's true
that where there is a will,

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.265
there is a way.

00:49:32.265 --> 00:49:37.540
Because my voice is very tired
after the concert yesterday.

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.060
