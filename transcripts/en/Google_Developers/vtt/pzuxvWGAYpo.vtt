[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:29.190
MIHAI IONESCU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.000
Welcome to another "Payments
Live" Show.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.880
Today we have a very exciting
topic, which is how to

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.830
implement, distribute, and
monetize online games.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.460
And, even more exciting,
we have a partner

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.820
to talk about it.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.480
From Seattle, please
welcome Matt

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.140
Endsley from Carbon Games.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.480
Hi, Matt.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.332
Can you hear us?

00:00:50.332 --> 00:00:52.010
MATT ENDSLEY: Hello, yes, yes.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.410
Can you hear me?

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.270
MIHAI IONESCU: Sure.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.650
Yes.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.450
So to give a little bit of
context, one of the great

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.040
things about Payments APIs is
that we get to work with all

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.860
kinds of online technologies
and partners looking to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.270
monetize successful
online apps.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.960
And games is one of
our favorites.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.820
PENG YING: Definitely one
of the favorites.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.000
MIHAI IONESCU: Who wouldn't
like to play games and get

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.750
paid for it.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.000
So you can't blame us.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.060
Today we're taking a top-level
view and get an expert opinion

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.130
on what it takes to successfully
build a game and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.640
monetize it online.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.860
So Matt, tell us a little bit
more about the Carbon Games,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.696
AirMech, and yourself.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.830
MATT ENDSLEY: So we're
a small studio.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.130
We're about seven people now
in the Seattle area up in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.770
Washington.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.740
We've been making games together
for a while now, the

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.980
core group of us.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.010
And we just wanted to get back
into making small, more

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.680
personal games.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.960
We've worked in big, huge
companies before.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.010
We wanted to get back to that
making core games that we

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.960
enjoy playing.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.420
That's kind of the background
story for how we started

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.046
working on AirMech.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:05.260
PENG YING: Cool.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.400
And then your current
games, so AirMech.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.210
Let's jump into AirMech.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.360
What is it?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.960
I actually have it on my
computer right now so we can

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.850
show off a little bit
of what you can do.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.690
MIHAI IONESCU: Oh, so now we're
playing games live?

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.490
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.210
Food lovers live, playing
games live.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.420
MIHAI IONESCU: Perfect
use of our time.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.760
PENG YING: So why don't you talk
through a little bit of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.340
what's going on on-screen.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.400
We are in the midst of--

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.316
I guess it looks
like a battle.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.590
MATT ENDSLEY: Yes.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.940
The AI has kind of overrun
us right now while

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.780
we're waiting to play.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.235
PENG YING: We're
in a bad place.

00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:40.550
MATT ENDSLEY: At the core of
it, AirMech, we call it an

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.070
action strategy game.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.340
So you immediately notice
that you're

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.540
controlling a main hero.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.220
You're flying around as this
transforming robot, and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.770
there's enemy transforming
robots that are trying to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.040
destroy your base.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.450
And then on top of that, there's
this lightweight RTS

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.540
element where you are building
units and commanding units on

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.860
the field to assist
your main hero.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.640
PENG YING: Got it.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.112
MATT ENDSLEY: So if you're
familiar with a League of

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:14.300
Legends or a DOTA style game,
it'll have kind of the same

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.790
feel to it, but you're the one
actually controlling the

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.310
creeps and controlling what's
spawned and where.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.550
So it's definitely a bit
more of a strategy

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.470
game than your typical--

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.880
PENG YING: And then
are there any--

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.090
MATT ENDSLEY: --action game.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.945
PENG YING: --strategies that we
can use right now to push

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:33.590
back the AI?

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.160
MATT ENDSLEY: The biggest ones
you'll see, these little

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.970
runner guys that are spawning on
the map, they are trying to

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.500
capture these outposts.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.770
And so you'll see these outposts
have these little

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:46.825
lights on top of them.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:50.000
And when four guys go in, the
outpost becomes yours.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.530
You can heal over it, you can
regenerate energy over it, and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.920
you can also pick up units
that you build.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.140
So if you use the mouse wheel
or if you use the Q button,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.930
you can pull down
your build menu.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.195
That shows what units you
can build on the map.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.450
PENG YING: Oh, man.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.090
MATT ENDSLEY: And when the unit
is ready, you can fly

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.670
over any of the buildings
that you control.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.260
PENG YING: We're getting hurt.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.079
MATT ENDSLEY: In our case,
any blue building, yeah.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.260
And you can pick up those
units from any

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:18.920
building you control.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.339
So these little guys running,
they're weak, but they're

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:25.770
really important because they
are what establishes your

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.406
bases in the map.

00:04:27.406 --> 00:04:27.810
PENG YING:OK.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.720
And then what's the end
goal of this game?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.240
What am I trying
to accomplish?

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.055
MATT ENDSLEY: If you fly
carefully to the right side of

00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:38.090
the map, there's this giant red
base that the AI's built

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.000
up right now.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.700
And our goal is to destroy
that base.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.355
PENG YING: Yeah, I
think I found it.

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:45.966
MIHAI IONESCU: You're
doing pretty well.

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:48.662
PENG YING: I play a little bit
of games in my free time.

00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:50.450
MATT ENDSLEY: And so the enemy's
trying to do the same

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.830
thing, and you'll find that your
healer unit isn't very

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.120
effective at damaging
the base.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.650
And so it's important to build
up an army and strategically

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.524
move it across the map
to destroy the base.

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:02.660
PENG YING: Got it.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.110
I think one of the awesome
things about this is that,

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.420
hey, look, we're playing
within the browser.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.780
MATT ENDSLEY: Yes.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.970
PENG YING: So for everybody
that thought that this was

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.020
your standard PC game, this is
actually accessible on all

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.360
devices that support Chrome.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.160
MIHAI IONESCU: How
is that possible?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.040
How do you do that?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.980
PENG YING: What are you using
to enable this high-quality,

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.160
high-fidelity graphics
within the browser?

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.140
MATT ENDSLEY: Google has this
new technology called Native

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.530
Client that--

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.650
I guess it shipped sometime last
fall, is when it first

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.340
started coming out in public
releases of Chrome.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.040
And it basically allows you to
run a C++ application inside

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.980
of Chrome's sandbox.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.870
And so you get you get the power
of running native code

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.170
but still have the security
model that you'd normally

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.430
expect from something like doing
HTML5 and JavaScript.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:01.260
So we can take what normally is
a PC or a console game and

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.395
hook right into the GPU and run
the exact same code that

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:06.980
we'd be running in our native
PCR or native console versions

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.314
of the game inside
the browser.

00:06:09.314 --> 00:06:10.180
PENG YING: Sweet.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.070
So I'm guessing that
this is like pretty

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.820
cutting edge stuff.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.840
I haven't worked with it.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.890
I've heard that it launched,
and I've helped a few

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.020
developers implement Payment
APIs for it.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.550
But since you've already dived
into it, are there any lessons

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.850
learned that you can share with
other developers about

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.180
your experiences in integrating

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.775
NaCl, or Native Client?

00:06:29.775 --> 00:06:30.860
MATT ENDSLEY: Yes.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.900
I'd say a lot of them carry
over to any sort of game

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.000
development thing where you're
talking about working on

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.910
multiple platforms.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.980
It's just making sure that your
code is easily portable.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.960
We went into AirMech knowing
we're going to be working on

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.720
multiple platforms and so we had
the advantage of building

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.400
everything from the ground up
to make it as cross platform

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.860
as possible.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.080
But it's definitely something
you want to keep in mind

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.370
because NaCl's more like
developing on Linux than it

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.610
would be developing on
a traditional Windows

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.700
development environment
that most developers

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.660
are familiar with.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.260
MIHAI IONESCU: Looks
awesome to me.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.700
I didn't realize you started
in the browser.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.450
I knew it worked in the browser,
but I thought you

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.495
were just sharing your screen.

00:07:16.495 --> 00:07:18.040
PENG YING: If there are more
games like this, it'll be

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.571
trouble for productivity.

00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:24.170
MIHAI IONESCU: So Matt, let's
talk a little bit about

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.520
another important aspect that
game developers are facing.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.970
You build a great game, but
now you have to put it in

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.740
front of a lot of people.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.830
In this case, going the browser
way enabled you to

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.930
distribute it much more
easily to places like

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.920
the Chrome Web Store.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:44.670
Tell us a little bit how has
that impacted adoption, the

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.070
fact that your game now
runs in the browser.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.990
MATT ENDSLEY: Chrome Web Store
is definitely great from just

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.590
that people know they can go
and find stuff that runs in

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.510
the browser.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:08:00.010
One of the biggest hurdles we
had is that when you tell

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.400
normal game media sites, normal
gamers, that your game

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.830
runs in a browser, they have
this tendency to dismiss it

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.560
because they don't realize
what you can actually do.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.190
The Chrome Web Store is a good
place to show off that kind of

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.250
game because it's a centralized
place where you

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.805
can find high-quality
applications.

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:19.810
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.090
And it makes it easier to use
all kind of frameworks and

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.400
technologies that have already
been built for the browser.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.280
All open source.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.630
MATT ENDSLEY: We didn't have
to worry about patching or

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.880
versioning.

00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:38.059
PENG YING: Now that we've seen
the game a little bit, can we

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.679
talk a little bit about
the metagame?

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:44.150
That's the game built
on top of the game.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.470
I'm going to jump out of this
game right now and show the

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.000
viewers a little bit of
what the metagame is.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.950
It's basically a way to engage
players outside of the core

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.000
gameplay itself and then
incentivize them to come back

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.620
and keep playing,
stuff like that.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.030
But Matt can probably do a way
better time defining what's

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.290
going on or what
I'm looking at.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.930
So tell me what you want to show
off about the metagame.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.630
MATT ENDSLEY: Yeah, so if you
go at the top level of your

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.570
UI, you should have a big
Customize button.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.870
And at the core of it, every
game that you play, win or

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.730
lose, you're gaining experience
that slowly

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.530
increases the level of your
out-of-game character.

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.490
So you gain experience and
levels in game, but every time

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.220
you go into game, that resets.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.410
So every game is a fresh
beginning as

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.340
far as gameplay goes.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.950
But then out of the game, you
have your own level that

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.150
allows you to unlock
new units.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.870
We took an approach with AirMech
that we didn't want it

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.380
to be that units were
necessarily

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.660
better than other units.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.700
They're just different.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.260
So you can vary your strategy
by, say, you're taking in some

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:57.820
artillery units instead of
tanks to have a more

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.220
long-range strategy for
attacking enemies and try to

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.480
outrange them and play
more defensively.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.060
PENG YING: I've noticed that
some of these units are

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.670
unlocked, so--

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.872
well, continue what you
were talking about.

00:10:10.872 --> 00:10:12.790
MATT ENDSLEY: Yes.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.010
Some of them will start on trial
where you could play

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.530
with them for free, and then we
kind of rotate those in and

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:24.030
out what's available for
everyone at the beginning.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.270
So every time you play a game
you get experience, and you

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.540
also get Kudos, which is one
of our in-game currencies.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.870
We really wanted to make the
game fair from a gamer's

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.840
perspective where the more money
you put in, you don't

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.330
get a gameplay advantage.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.790
And so everything that affects
gameplay you can unlock with

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.390
Kudos, which is what you're
earning while playing.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:52.850
And then if you click on your
AirMech and you look at the

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.560
different AirMechs that you can
play as, you'll see that

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.540
each class of AirMechs
has a handful of

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.650
different looks to it.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.710
We call them skins, and all they
are is they're cosmetic

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.210
differences.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.520
Like the Chrome Sauce
is a good example.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.070
From a gameplay standpoint, it
is identical to the normal

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:13.860
saucer, it just looks
different.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.360
And so it's a way that you can
customize what you look like

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:17.820
in the game.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:18.690
PENG YING: Cool.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.940
A lot of these look
really sick.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.350
You guys have great artwork.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.560
MATT ENDSLEY: Yeah,
I agree with that.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.120
I can't take any
credit for it.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.090
I work all on the technical
side of things, but I

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.240
love the art here.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.080
PENG YING: What about the social
aspects of the game?

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.660
Can you talk about the social
aspects at all?

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.560
MATT ENDSLEY: Yeah, so we
recently added in what we call

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.230
global chat.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.890
And if you have the game open,
it's that window where people

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:46.920
are talking about whatever
random stuff they're talking

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.785
about at 10:00 AM
in the morning.

00:11:49.785 --> 00:11:53.035
PENG YING: it's a
productive day.

00:11:53.035 --> 00:11:56.340
MATT ENDSLEY: Just having a
window where people can talk

00:11:56.340 --> 00:12:00.180
about nonsense with everyone
tends to let people--

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.350
they stay in the game longer.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.510
They're more engaged.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.550
We find that there's players
that enjoy just hanging out to

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.410
chat, and they don't actually
play the game, which

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.180
was weird for us.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.340
And one of the things we do is
everyone on every platform and

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.610
version can talk with
everyone else.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.550
So even if you're a version
behind and haven't patched

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.500
yet, you can still get into
this global chat room.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.090
We find that in addition to
having that staying power of

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.630
keeping people in the game, that
it also works as kind of

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.140
like a crowd-sourced support
group where people come in,

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.330
they'll have a question about
something, and other players

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.506
will be able to answer
it for us.

00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:42.230
MIHAI IONESCU: That's awesome.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.820
So we saw multiple technologies
coming together--

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.850
the game, the browser, with
the new Native Client

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.570
technologies, using the metagame
and all kinds of

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:57.780
skinning and nice graphics and
special effects, and, of

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.710
course, the social aspect, which
makes the game so much

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:01.830
more interesting.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:06.780
But there is one more step to
really make it profitable and

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.130
a nice successful business for
a developer, and that's

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.190
monetizing the game.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.215
You mentioned, briefly, you're
using a freemium model--

00:13:15.215 --> 00:13:15.550
MATT ENDSLEY: Right.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.230
MIHAI IONESCU: --for the game.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.190
Everyone can play for free.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.120
Tell us a little bit about
your strategy.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.370
How do you monetize the game?

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.580
MATT ENDSLEY: So it's a
free-to-play game, where the

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.580
core game, you can get it, and
you can play it for free.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:34.630
And then we charge for cosmetic
upgrades like the

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.880
AirMech skins.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.550
And we also charge for time
unlock, so if you don't want

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.160
to play like 10 games to unlock
some cool unit, you can

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.920
pay a dollar or something
to unlock it.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.750
It's time shortcuts and
cosmetic things.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.280
We kind of viewed it as, if
you remember the mid '90s,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.400
shareware was a huge
thing back then.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.790
And it's kind of getting back
to that same type of model,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:03.700
where you have a demo version of
the game that you can play,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.890
and then if you really enjoy
the game, you end up paying

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.771
money for it.

00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:13.310
MIHAI IONESCU: What APIs are
you using to monetize?

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:17.930
MATT ENDSLEY: We use three right
now in our main game.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:21.180
We use Google Wallet, we use
Amazon Payments, and we also

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.180
use PayPal.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.460
MIHAI IONESCU: Awesome.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:31.480
And it made it easier to
integrate in the browser how

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.324
was the entire API process?

00:14:34.324 --> 00:14:35.490
MATT ENDSLEY: Actually,
it was.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.740
It was pretty easy.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.470
So we built our own servers that
handle the server-side

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.380
back end for the billing
process.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.790
And having it in the browser,
especially with Google Wallet,

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.620
makes for a really smooth
transition for purchasing

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.060
things without having to open a
new tab or switch to another

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.225
application.

00:14:57.225 --> 00:14:58.420
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.180
Great.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:06.260
Any lessons learned and tips
and tricks suggestions for

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.840
developers looking to monetize
their games similarly to what

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.835
you've been doing?

00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:14.270
MATT ENDSLEY: I would say get
your game up and running as

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.260
fast as possible and get to
the point where you can

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.180
actually charge people for it.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:25.230
I think a lot of people
underestimate the point at

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.200
which people will start paying
money for something.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.170
I think, from a monetization
standpoint, just getting to

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:35.590
the point where you have the
ability to charge people for

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:39.570
stuff forces you to get your
game done and forces your

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:40.190
prioritize.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.490
Once you start having revenue,
you're forced to work on

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.290
what's really important instead
of having these long

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.670
far off deadlines that
are kind of nebulous.

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.050
MIHAI IONESCU: That's nice.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.650
PENG YING: Speaking of getting
your game done, you told us

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.470
earlier that the engine that
you guys built for 3D

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.575
rendering is open sourced.

00:15:58.575 --> 00:16:01.560
MATT ENDSLEY: Yes.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.520
We have a culture here of

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.740
contributing back to community.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:07.960
We use a lot of open source
technology to build the game,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.010
and so we thought it wouldn't
be fair to use all the stuff

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.225
that's built up by the great
software community without

00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:15.350
contributing back.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.180
And so on GitHub, we have our
rendering engine, our network

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:24.150
API, and a handful of other
platform level stuff things

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.285
for audio and core-level
libraries.

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:27.650
PENG YING: That's
really awesome.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:33.590
If somebody wanted to build off
your open source platform,

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:34.420
where should they search?

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.290
What should they search
for on GitHub?

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.410
MATT ENDSLEY: The easiest way
to do it is if you go to

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:41.660
carbongames.com/
opensource.html.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.240
It will have a link to all the
open source stuff that we use,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.340
including our own.

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.370
It's our central repository
for what we're using

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:53.620
to build the game.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.030
PENG YING: If somebody just
wants to play the game, where

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.775
do they go?

00:17:00.775 --> 00:17:01.910
MATT ENDSLEY: That's
really easy.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:04.319
You can just go to airmech.com,
and it will have

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.166
instructions on how to
get it right there.

00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:07.440
PENG YING: Awesome.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.099
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.310
Thank you, Matt.

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:17.050
Very insightful and expert
opinion on how you guys

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:18.510
implemented the game.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:22.170
We have a few questions on the
Moderator related to this.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:26.569
People found out that you were
coming on, and we made sure we

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.070
had some questions
ready for you.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.780
So here is one.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.480
"Do you have any recommendations
for pricing

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.730
virtual goods?

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.770
What is the optimal transaction
amount?" You can

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.695
talk about AirMech or if you
guys have other thoughts to

00:17:40.695 --> 00:17:42.430
share from other games.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:46.180
MATT ENDSLEY: I'm not really
sure what it is.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.770
I'm certain if you found someone
with a degree in

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.865
economics, they could probably
tell you how all this works.

00:17:51.865 --> 00:17:54.180
But we kind of played around
with a bunch of them, and we

00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:01.520
settled on price points around
$0.59, $1.99, $5.99 is what

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:02.750
our big ones used to be.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:07.300
And then we started doing this
thing where we bundled a bunch

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.120
of in-game currency
at a huge value.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:17.050
It's like four to five times
value of what it would be if

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.400
you bought it normally, and
then we charged $10, like

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.430
$9.99 for that.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:27.720
And that's our predominant
sale right now, is these

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.210
bundles that--

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.330
I don't know how to
best describe it.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.170
You anchor a price point, and
then you have a good value,

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.340
and people will go for that.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.800
MIHAI IONESCU: I think
you put it best.

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.630
Someone can write a PhD
dissertation on what's the

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.420
optimal pricing strategy.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:47.280
And from what we also saw, we
have a bunch of games on

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.330
Google and also on
Chrome Web Store.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.070
Developers are experimenting
with various price levels and

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.690
various bundles.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.940
It depends on your game flow.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.560
You have to gather a lot of
analytics and a lot of data.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.230
MATT ENDSLEY: As you say, one
thing that's important is make

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.620
sure that you can track the
success of whatever you're

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.300
changing and then don't be
afraid to change stuff.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.330
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes,
absolutely.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.290
Experiment with it, and I
think our recommendation

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:16.740
endorses, play around with
various price points, test it,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.390
reiterate, and see where
most of your

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.600
revenue is coming from.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.860
PENG YING: Do any of your
customers feel burned if they

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.680
purchase something and then
later on see it for a

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.330
different price?

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.930
Or is it that every time you
introduce a new item, you're

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.310
playing with the price a
little bit that way?

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:34.710
MATT ENDSLEY: Sometimes we do
do things like we put our

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.920
bundles on sale for
like 30% off.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.850
And so far, we really haven't
seen a negative backlash from

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:43.480
someone who bought something
at full price and

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.190
then it goes on sale.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.960
I think customers in the gaming
space are kind of used

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.910
to that, that there's these
cycles of things that go on

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.370
sale and come off of sale.

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:56.460
So it's not something that's
been a big issue for us.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.140
MIHAI IONESCU: We'll keep an
eye on your next sale.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.315
PENG YING: Black Friday.

00:19:59.315 --> 00:20:01.971
Cyber Monday, Cyber Monday.

00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:03.555
I guess it'll be a
post-Christmas sale this time.

00:20:03.555 --> 00:20:05.150
MIHAI IONESCU: Make
sure I get lots of

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:08.800
ammo for my next conquest.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.070
OK, one more question.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.020
Let's see, what do
we have here.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.010
So we have a question about the

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.040
Payments Merchant accounts.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.940
The question is, "Do you use a
single merchant account for

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:22.730
multiple games or one Merchant
account for every game?

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.820
Which option do you
think is better?"

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:28.570
MATT ENDSLEY: So right now, we
only have the one game, and we

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.670
have one merchant account.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.670
I can't see going forward trying
to split games between

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.470
merchant accounts.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.960
I would imagine that we'd just
keep one merchant account.

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:44.910
We do a bunch of our own
reporting outside of what the

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.440
Google Wallet API does on the
Wallet merchant page, and

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.440
that's mainly so that we can
collate data from all of our

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.900
payment providers.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.805
So if we're going to be doing
filtering by gaming, it would

00:20:55.805 --> 00:20:59.720
be at a higher level than at
the payment provider level.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.570
I don't know if I'd see an
advantage to doing multiple

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.965
merchant accounts.

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:06.800
MIHAI IONESCU: Makes sense.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.960
And probably we can also do
a better job at providing

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.720
developers with more features on
the Merchant Center site so

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.020
they get some benefit of
using one merchant

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.110
account versus others.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.420
And on our side, we have seen
people go both ways.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.230
If you have a few games but not
that many transactions,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:32.600
then you can definitely just
stay with one merchant account

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.450
and keep using it for
multiple games.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.410
If you see a lot of transactions
coming in, then

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.500
it's probably better to have one
merchant account per game.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.370
So it's a personal preference,
and as always, we are looking

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:50.620
for feedback from developers and
suggestions on what extra

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.580
features we need to add to the
Merchant Center to make that

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.820
hassle-free and a better
experience for the developer.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.380
PENG YING: We should suit
everybody's needs to satisfy

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.300
as much of the developer
needs as possible.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.470
Anything else?

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.460
MIHAI IONESCU: Any final
thoughts, Matt?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.450
MATT ENDSLEY: I just say if
you're interested in games,

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.410
just go and start making them.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:17.625
See where it takes you.

00:22:17.625 --> 00:22:18.070
MIHAI IONESCU: Fantastic.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:21.567
And everyone, if you want to
join us playing AirMech, you

00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:23.700
can find it at carbongames.com.

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.795
You can search for it on
the Chrome Web Store.

00:22:25.795 --> 00:22:27.640
PENG YING: Airmech.com.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.950
It's all over the place.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.010
MIHAI IONESCU: It's all over.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:31.350
Great.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.620
Thank you a lot, Matt.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.060
Before we finish, I have a few
announcements to make.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.020
One is related to our online
documentation.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.640
We are looking for developer
feedback on how to improve it,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.490
and we just added
a feedback link.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.910
You'll see at the top
right of every page.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.720
So anything you find wrong with
the documentation or you

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.310
want to improve it, have
suggestions, please click on

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.330
that link and let us know.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.390
And the second announcement.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.780
We just have a new device
launched a couple of days ago,

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.250
which comes pre-loaded with
Google Wallet, is the Samsung

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.810
Galaxy Axiom.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:19.100
So one more fun phone
to play with and

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.800
play with Google Wallet.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.170
So with that said, thank
you Matt, once again.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:25.596
MATT ENDSLEY: Thank you guys.

00:23:25.596 --> 00:23:28.390
MIHAI IONESCU: And let's go--

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:29.480
PENG YING: See you
in two weeks.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.400
MIHAI IONESCU: Go play
some AirMech and see

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.110
everyone in two weeks.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.360
Bye.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:58.600
