Pretty soon we're going to look at some even more interesting functions, ones

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:08.050
that involve absolute value signs. But I think that before we do that, we

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.100
should do a little refresher on absolute value itself, or absolute value

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.886
functions. I've written down several equations for you and also drawn several

00:00:15.886 --> 00:00:20.919
graphs. Please match the letter of each graph with the proper equation.
