Announcer: Live from New York, Tonight with
Belafonte.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.170
Harry: My relationship with Charlie, I was
not just an acquaintance.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.420
Our survival was dependent on one another.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.840
When you look at Charlie White, and you look
at the faces of black people, there's a serenity.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.180
There's always a strength in his characters.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.080
The limbs of the black subject is always powerfully
displayed.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.540
Strong arms.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.940
When the good fortune hit I got my own space
to command my time on television, I overdid it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.620
with a Charlie White.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:50.760
♪ I don't want no bald headed woman,
She too mean, Lord, Lordy well she too mean

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.760
♪

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.120
It shook up television because you never quite
saw anything quite like that,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.660
all of this blackness.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.040
I bought everything I could of his and I displayed
it and I put it on television.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.060
I couldn't get enough of it.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
Charlie White had a great champion in me.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.329
♪ Better bow your head, Lord, Lordy, better
bow your head

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:24.040
Better bow your head, better bow your head
Hold that line ♪

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.720
Our dear Charles.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.920
What are you doing now?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.040
And wherever you are, Heaven or Hell, make
a space for me.
