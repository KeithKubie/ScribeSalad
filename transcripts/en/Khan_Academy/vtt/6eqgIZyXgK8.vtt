00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.880
Let's solve some rational
equations.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:10.590
Let's say I had 5 over 3x
minus 4 is equal to--

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.590
actually, let me write it.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.610
Let me scoot it over
a little bit.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.240
So let's say I have 5 over
3x minus 4 is equal to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.548
2 over x plus 1.

00:00:24.548 --> 00:00:26.790
So your first reaction
might be, geez, I've

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.330
never seen this before.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.520
I have x's in the denominators,
how do I

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.290
actually solve this equation?

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.470
And the easiest way to proceed,
and there's other

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.000
ways to do this, is to try to
multiply both sides of this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.730
equation by expressions that
will get rid of it these x's

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.680
in the denominator.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.360
So if we multiply both sides of
the equation by x plus 1,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.320
it's going to get rid of this
x plus 1 in the denominator.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110
Of course, we have to
do it to both sides.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.510
We can't just do
it to one side.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.080
But we also want to get rid of
this expression right here.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.850
So let's multiply both sides of
the equation by that, by 3x

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.740
minus 4, so you're multiplying
by 3x minus 4 on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.060
this side as well.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.000
So I'm just multiplying both
sides of the equation times

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.510
this and times this.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.760
So whatever I multiply on
this side, I also have

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.550
to do on this side.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.570
What is it going
to simplify to?

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, this 3x minus 4 is going
to cancel out with this 3x

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.460
minus 4, so the left-hand side
is just going to be x plus 1

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.770
times 5, or 5 times x plus 1.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.150
And my right-hand side, this x
plus 1 is going to cancel with

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.390
that x plus 1.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.100
It's just going to equal
2 times 3x minus 4.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.630
And if you just look at it, if
you didn't look at what we

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.310
actually did, it looks like
we did something called

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.810
cross-multiplying.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.530
When you have something over
something is equal to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.930
something else over something
else, notice, the end product

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.220
when we multiplied both sides
by both of these expressions

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.050
was 2 times 3x minus 4 is equal
to 5 times x plus 1.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.680
So it looks like we
cross-multiplied.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.870
5 times x plus 1 is equal
to 2 times 3x minus 4.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.360
But the reality is we didn't
do anything new.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.830
We just multiplied both sides
by this expression and that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.750
expression.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.690
But now we just have a
straight-up linear equation.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.810
We can just simplify
and solve.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.360
So the left-hand side becomes 5x
plus 5, just distribute the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.620
5, is equal to 6x minus 8.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.730
Now, let's say we subtract
5x from both sides.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.800
If we subtract 5x from both
sides, the left-hand side just

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.130
becomes a 5.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.880
The right-hand side, we are left
with x minus 8, and now

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.800
we could add 8 to both sides.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.970
The left-hand side becomes 13,
the right-hand side is just an

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:02.902
x, and we're done.

00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:06.640
x is equal to 13 solves
this equation.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.700
You could even try it out.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.260
5 over-- 3 times 13 is 39.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.680
39 minus 4 is 35, and this
should be equal to 2 over 13

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.030
plus 1, or 14.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.370
And they both equal 1/7.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.410
So it checks out.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.640
Let's do a more involved one.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.060
Let's do a more involved
problem.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.730
So let's say I had--
this one's pretty

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.200
involved right here.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:47.230
Let's say I have negative x
over x minus 2 plus-- I'm

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.580
going to give it some space
here-- 3x minus 1 over x plus

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:03.390
4 is equal to 1 over x squared
plus 2x minus 8.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.490
So once again, if we want to
get rid of all of these x

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.500
terms in the denominator, we
want to multiply essentially

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.720
by the least common multiple
of this expression, this

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.240
expression, and this
expression.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.070
So this one looks like
it can be factored.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.185
So maybe it already has some
of these guys in it.

00:04:22.185 --> 00:04:24.700
So let's try to figure
that out.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.820
So this right here,
this is what?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.240
This is x plus 4 times x minus
2, so it does, indeed, have

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.330
both of these in it.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.920
So lets them multiply both sides
of this equation by this

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.400
thing or by x plus
4 and x minus 2.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.700
So if we multiplied-- so this
thing, it could just be

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.100
rewritten as that, so
I just did that.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.450
Now let's multiply both sides
of the equation by that.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.520
So let's see, we're going
to multiply by x plus 4

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.690
times x minus 2.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.910
If we do it on the right-hand
side, we have to do it on the

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.770
left-hand side.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.650
Scoot over a little bit.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.400
So this term, I'm going to have
to multiply by x plus 4

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.500
times x minus 2.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.700
Same thing for this term.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.925
That's why I left some space.

00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:15.890
X plus 4 times x minus 2.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.120
I'm just multiplying every term
in this equation by this

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.420
right there.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.540
Now, on the left-hand side,
what do we get?

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.070
This x minus 2 cancels
with this x minus 2.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.070
We have nothing left
in the denominator.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.760
This term right here will
become negative x

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.440
times x plus 4.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.570
That's that term right there.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.420
Now, this term and this term
right here, this x plus 4 will

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.670
cancel with that x plus 4.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:53.090
So we're a left with plus 3x
minus 1 times x minus 2.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.610
And then the right-hand side,
that cancels with that, that

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.740
cancels with that.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.820
And we've essentially multiplied
both sides by this

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.875
denominator or by the inverse
of this whole expression.

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:05.910
So we're just left
with this 1.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.720
And now, we have to simplify
it, or we have to multiply

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.160
things out.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.510
So negative x times negative
x is negative x squared.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.030
Negative x times
4 is minus 4x.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.790
And then we have 3x times
x is plus 3x squared.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.740
3x times negative
2 is minus 6x.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.740
Negative 1 times x is minus
x or negative x.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.790
Negative 1 times negative
2 is plus 2.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.660
All of that's going
to be equal to 1.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.530
Now let's add the same degree
terms. So we have a second

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.040
degree term and a second
degree term.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.290
3x squared minus x squared.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.420
That gives us 2x squared, and
you have a negative 4x, a

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.110
negative 6x and a negative x.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.410
So what is that going
to be equal to?

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.930
Negative 4 and a negative
6 is negative 10.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.380
Minus another 1 is
a negative 11x.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.900
And then finally, we just have
that constant term out here,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.670
plus 2 is equal to 1.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.070
Let me make sure I got all the
terms. Yeah, I got all the

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.030
terms. Now we could subtract
1 from both sides and the

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:25.610
equation becomes 2x squared
minus 11x plus

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.690
1 is equal to 0.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.510
So it just becomes a
straight-up, traditional

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.630
quadratic equation.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.320
And if we're just looking for
the roots, we set it equal to

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.290
zero, we're just looking for the
x's that satisfy this, we

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.640
can use the quadratic formula.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.510
So the solutions are x is going
to be equal to negative

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.100
b. b is negative 11.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.990
So negative negative 11 is
positive 11 plus or minus the

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.320
square root of b squared.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.960
Negative 11 squared is 121 minus
4 times a, which is 2,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.840
times c, which is 1, all of that
over 2 times a, all of

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.760
that over 4.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.450
So x is equal to 11, plus or
minus the square root of-- 4

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.460
times 2 times 1 is 8.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.190
So 121 minus 8.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.750
So what is that?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.180
That's 113; is that right?

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:30.890
The square root of 113,
all of that over 4.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.400
Can I factor 113 at all?

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.340
Did I get that right?

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.220
4 times 2 times 1.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.120
Yeah, that looks right.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.860
Let's get our calculator out
to actually figure out what

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.929
these values are.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:49.360
Let me see, so we want to
turn the calculator on.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.140
Go to my main screen, and
we want the square root

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.680
of 121 minus 8.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.370
10.63.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:11.490
So this is equal to 11 plus
or minus 10.63 over 4.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.750
Those are two answers.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.430
And if we want to find the
particular answers, it would

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:20.350
be 11 plus 10.63 over 4,
which would be what?

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:24.460
That would be 21.63/4.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.480
We could try to calculate
that in a second.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.670
And then if you subtract it,
11 minus 10.63 is-- so 11

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.980
minus 10.63 over 4, this
is equal to what?

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:44.460
Like 0.37, 0.37/4, if I'm
doing my math correctly.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.940
So what do we get?

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:55.710
So let's see, 21.63 divided
by 4 is 5.51, so

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.990
this is equal to 5.41.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:03.556
And then the other solution,
0.37 divided by 4 is going to

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:06.370
be like 0.09 something.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:17.930
So then we have the other
solution is 11 minus 10.63.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:25.960
Yep, we got our 0.37 divided
by 4 is equal to 0.0925 So

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:37.500
this is equal to 0.0925.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.140
So I lost some precision.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.950
This isn't the exact, because
this wasn't 10.63.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:41.980
It was 6301.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.060
It just kept going.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.750
It's an irrational number, but
this should get close.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.550
So let's check.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.570
Let's verify that these
actually work.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:55.480
So let's try the 5.41 solution
first. So if this is true, if

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.070
we take-- so let me put 5.4--
let me just do it.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.490
So if we do-- so we're going
to start off with 5.41.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:10.340
So our original equation was
negative x, so negative 5.41

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.580
divided by x minus 2.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.280
So 5.41 minus 2 is 3.41.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.760
So that's that term.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:36.130
And then we have plus 3 times
5.41 minus 1 divided by-- 5.41

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.320
plus 4 is 9.41-- 9.41.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:49.190
So the left-hand side
gives us 0.0319.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.320
So that's what the left-hand
side equals.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.510
Now let's see what the
right-hand side equals when we

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:56.430
substitute x equals 5.41.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.540
And of course, we've lost
some precision here.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.680
We've lost some of the
zeroes, but we

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.140
should get pretty close.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:10.870
So the right-hand side, if we
take 1 divided by 5.41 squared

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:19.340
plus 2 times 5.41 plus-- this
is a minus 8, I think.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:19.920
I lost that.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.760
That's a negative 8 right
there, so minus 8.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.670
That is that, and they are very,
very, very close, at

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.740
least up to three
digits, 0.31.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.030
So it does work out.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.060
And these other things, they
don't equal past that because

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.200
we weren't precise enough.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.010
If we added the trailing zeroes
here when we took the

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.940
square root of 113, we would
have gotten the right answer.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.740
If you actually kept it in
this form you would have

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.490
gotten the exact right answer.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:51.140
So I'll leave it up to you to
verify that this is also

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.650
another solution.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.590
But, hopefully, you found that
slightly instructive.
