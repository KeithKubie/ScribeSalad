00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
Now, it's important to remember 
that we're not here to teach you

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.950
how to build a weather app.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.562
It's not even to teach you all the Android
APIs that we use to build it.

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:13.462
It's really about retraining your brain 
to start thinking like a mobile developer,

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:16.335
which is really important, 
because at the end of this course

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.014
we're gonna ask you 
to build your own final project.

00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:30.939
We're expecting you to already be familiar
with object-oriented programming,

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.649
and to have experience 
with Java or a similar language.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.570
Personally, I got started with Android
after years of Delphi and C# development.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.560
As engineers, we're trained to map our
experiences in one language

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.310
or SDK into new ones.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.620
Looking for patterns and shortcuts we can
get up to speed as quickly as possible.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.750
But mobile, and Android in particular,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.220
have some fundamental differences 
that mean some of our experience

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.310
and intuition will actually make us 
worse mobile engineers.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.370
We like to think of Smartphones 
as computers that fit into our pockets.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.240
In a way that's true, but they're 
computers from the 90s,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.260
like this Powerhouse I was using 
nearly 20 years ago.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.660
With limited internet connectivity, 
low speed CPUs, and limited RAM,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.430
on top of which, they're all
running on batteries.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.890
As we go through the course,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
I'll be returning to each 
of these key mobile challenges.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.970
Looking for places where you're
experienced on desktop or server,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.250
or even other mobile platforms
might lead you in the wrong direction.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.060
I will also be back to tell you some
stories from the early days of Android.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.560
Stories that describe how the Android
platform has evolved.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.230
And nowhere is that more 
readily apparent than here,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.830
at the Android Lawn sculpture garden.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.190
Join me here, at the very heart
of Android, at the end of this lesson,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.990
to find out how this sculpture garden 
of tasty treats,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.300
also tell us the story 
of Android's history.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.840
For now, let's get back to building 
that weather app.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.000
So, we'll cross to Dan, to take a look 
at some mocks.
