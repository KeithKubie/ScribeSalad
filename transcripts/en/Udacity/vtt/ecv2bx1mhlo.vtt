Caching the photos is great, but

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.930
like we saw with the database earlier,
we can't just keep adding stuff.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.830
We need to remove stuff
that we don't need anymore.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.260
This involves a couple of cache
methods that we haven't seen yet.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.590
If we want to remove specific entries
from the cache, we can use cache.delete,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.768
passing in the URL or the request
of the thing we want to delete.

00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:21.760
There's also cache.keys.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.590
That returns a promise that gives us all
the requests for entries in the cache.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.702
What I haven't mentioned so far,

00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:32.445
is all of this is available from
pages as well as service workers.

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.740
In the next chapter, we'll use these
methods to clean the image cache.
