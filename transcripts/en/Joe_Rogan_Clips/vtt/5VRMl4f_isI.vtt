Houston,
uh,

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.050
you said that kicks in Greenley and pineapple did,

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:10.170
you know,
prior map works with pineapple once he,
you know,
he used to do,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.430
he would drive all the way across Houston to ignore me.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.920
That's what he did it,

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.290
he did it all the time and he had no reason to be there.
And I,

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.600
and I know that some of those guys that didn't like me because I don't,

8
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.050
I dunno why,
I dunno why,
but they were really,

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:32.310
really clickish and I went in there one night and had a horrible set and a,

10
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.870
and I was following Hicks and uh,
you know,

11
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.230
and I have a really green show,
but in the right circumstance,
you know,

12
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:44.490
in a comedy club with nothing great happening before you,

13
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:49.020
it kind of worked a little bit that night and didn't work at all.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.943
And uh,

15
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.240
but and I was probably getting a little more work than those guys were,

16
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.380
some of them.
And they're like,
oh,
he sucks.
Well,

17
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:02.660
the fact of the matter is I did suck because of my act with,
uh,
you know,

18
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.390
you don't want to follow [inaudible].
I say that to make the story better.

19
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.780
I wasn't following Hicks,
but he was,
you know,

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.910
or Kennison but they were both there.
Oh,
okay.
No,
I had done said,

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.610
but everybody was good.
I mean the green leaves good.
All these guys,

22
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.420
we're seasoned pros.
So that was a hotline up and uh,

23
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.480
but,
but I never felt,
you know,
like they get him like me except for headaches.

24
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.370
And I came to see him,
you know,
do,
do shows and uh,
uh,

25
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.260
I asked him to do the story about,
uh,

26
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.140
just John Davidson and the mask and he goes,

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.550
here's what he says.
He goes,
don't stand next to the exit is just a tip.

28
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.670
Cause people just walk out of the show.
When he died,

29
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.050
<v 1>watched him do that.
He,
he uh,</v>

30
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.230
he did that at the Nick's comedy stop in Boston and he cleared the fucking room

31
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:56.890
man.
And it was,

32
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.840
it was crazy because at the end of the show there was me and Greg Fitzsimmons

33
00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:05.470
and then maybe three or four other comics of five or six people in the crowd.

34
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.910
There was like maybe 20 people left,
all told,
laughing our fucking asses.
Right.

35
00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.800
Everybody else is getting up angry.

36
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.510
<v 0>I saw it go both ways.
You know,
I've seen him beat crowds to death.
Uh,</v>

37
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.760
I saw the set one night at the last stop and Austin and nobody in the room could

38
00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:28.000
breathe and he was in the mood to do it.
And Eh,
you know,
and you know,

39
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.950
and,
and I think sometimes he was,
sometimes he wasn't or whatever,

40
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.430
but he was in the mood and decided to just fucking stab us all in the face.

41
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.480
And it was just,
it was beautiful.

42
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.290
<v 1>He was exceptional.
Now whether or not people think he was one of the greats,
like</v>

43
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.700
that's entirely subjection.
Subjectual right?
It's subjective.

44
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.790
Rather you'd say it's completely up to your own interpretation.

45
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.090
But to me he changed comedy and a lot of ways because he,

46
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.370
people talk about things that were important because everybody else was talking

47
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.031
about nonsense.

48
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.810
You're talking about airline food and how come I can't lean my seat back?

49
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.070
Standard normal shit.
I'm following it up.
Exactly right.

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.880
And he was coming along talking about a positive drug stories.
You know,

51
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.790
a man on acid realize it all matters,

52
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.030
manage energy condensed to a slow rhythmic vibration.

53
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.850
Like that whole fucking bit was here's Tom with the weather app.

54
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.990
That was amazing.

55
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.440
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
no,
it was anyways,
influential.
I mean,
I know,</v>

56
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.860
I think I can say this about Bill Hicks and I am an expert at stand up comedy.

57
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.980
I would have a triple doctorate in,
uh,

58
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.810
if you gave those kinds of things for the work.
I've,

59
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.310
their amount of time I've put into [inaudible] and a,
and a,

60
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.950
and you as a peer would have the exact same thing.

61
00:03:50.951 --> 00:03:55.060
So for me to listen to someone's opinion about standup comedy,

62
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.800
they have to have a lot of credit to me before I really give a shit what they

63
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:03.070
think.
Okay.
So here's what you should think.

64
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.960
The only thing that every comic from my generation agrees on is he was better

65
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:16.770
than us.
And that's the only thing that they agree on.
And,

66
00:04:16.771 --> 00:04:17.800
and they,

67
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:22.510
and I can't find anybody that has a big argument that he wasn't,

68
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:25.000
and that was the,
the,
the best that ever lived.
No.

69
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:27.490
But did he influenced me more than anybody else.

70
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:31.390
And you probably more than anybody else because you're certainly that way also,

71
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.160
you know,
write some look.
Somebody built that bridge.
Yes.
And you,

72
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:38.680
and now you feel free to talk about anything,
you know,

73
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:43.150
none of yours act as ever hack.
You know,
there were a lot of hacks,

74
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:46.270
but I think it's freed people not to be a hack,
you know?

75
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.670
<v 1>Yeah.
He,
uh,
he cured people that he made it shameful,
you know,</v>

76
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.530
are talking about hat,
but there was also,

77
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.800
<v 0>and then you're,
you're cured above ceiling material.</v>

78
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.270
<v 1>So I don't know if I did I,
yeah.
Well,
I think it's still going on.</v>
