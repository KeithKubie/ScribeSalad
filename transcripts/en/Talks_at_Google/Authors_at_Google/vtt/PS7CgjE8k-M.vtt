00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:08.370
SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.030
Welcome, everyone, to
the Authors At series.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.070
I'm thrilled to introduce
Jeffrey Gettleman.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.160
He is the East Africa bureau
chief for the New York Times.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.810
He recently won
the Pulitzer Prize

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.600
for international reporting
on his work in Africa.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.480
He has covered warlords,
pirates, rebels,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.644
and elephant poachers.

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.060
He's traveled
across the continent

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.880
several times, using just
about every motive conveyance

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.430
from donkey cart and dugout
canoe to a battered tandem

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.540
bike.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.100
And he studied
philosophy at Cornell

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.570
and earned a master's
of philosophy

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.600
from Oxford, where he
was a Marshall Scholar.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.020
He has appeared as a foreign
affairs commentator on BBC,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.970
CNN, NPR, and other networks.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.730
He's also written for "Foreign
Policy," "The New York Review

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.970
of Books," "The New York Times,"
"Sunday Magazine," "The New

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.470
Republic," and "GQ."

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.000
He currently lives
in Nairobi, Kenya

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.200
with his wife and two boys.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.810
And we're thrilled to
have him here today.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.150
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Thank You.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.450
Thank you, everybody.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.250
I'm just going to put
this down for now.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
So let me begin
just by asking so I

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.160
know what I'm dealing with.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.320
One person here's
been in East Africa.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.540
Anybody else?

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.850
OK.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.780
Let me start at the beginning.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.020
So I grew up in a suburb of
Chicago, Evanston, Illinois,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.440
and after my freshman
year of college,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.710
I found myself on a
trip to East Africa.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.910
And it was kind of a fluke.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.900
I had a friend who knew somebody
who knew somebody else that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.030
was putting together
this trip to drive

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.080
from Nairobi to the southern
part of Malawi, which

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.210
was about 1,000 miles.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
And I asked my
parents, I said, hey,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.340
do you mind if I go on this
trip and go with these guys

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.590
to bring these medical
supplies to refugees?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.630
Because that was the
mission of the trip.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.020
And my parents,
unbelievably, said yes.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.350
The leader of our group was
just a year older than me

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.210
and was a college dropout.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.940
That part I left out.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.440
And I had this--

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.850
this was 1990 and I
was 18, as I said.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.270
And I had this
amazing summer that

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.950
was like a left turn in my life
because, for the first time,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.540
I was around people that
had very, very little.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.690
And yet we were driving
through rural Africa

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.620
and meeting people who were
literally wearing rags,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.914
living in little houses and
huts with nothing in them.

00:02:39.914 --> 00:02:41.330
We'd peek in their
houses and we'd

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.660
see some blankets
balled up on the ground.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.540
The kids had no toys.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.166
They made soccer balls
out of plastic bags.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.040
I don't know if you guys
have ever seen this,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.650
but they'll take
discarded plastic bags

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.260
and pack them really tight
almost like a snowball

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.730
and then put strings around it.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.120
And that was their soccer ball.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.790
And I had never experienced
poverty like that.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.970
I grew up pretty sheltered
in this affluent suburb.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.660
But beyond the poverty
was this spirit,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.360
this warmth, this sense
of being around people

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.090
who were very joyful and open
and eager to share and to take

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.470
us in.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.660
It gives me a chill
just thinking about it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.130
because they had they had so
little, yet they had so much.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.790
And I came back from
that trip transformed,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.270
thinking, you know, maybe we
have it all wrong in the West.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.210
You know, chasing wealth and
chasing status, and getting

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.400
obsessed with material goods.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.100
Because here are people
that have almost nothing,

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.610
and they seemed happier than
us and they were welcoming.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.240
And that just made me want to
live and work in East Africa.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.720
But I didn't know how.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.800
I had the where,
but not the what.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.380
And so I then was kind of cast
in confusion because I didn't--

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.670
I hadn't-- none of my parents'
friends knew much about Africa,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.824
I didn't know anybody that
was working in Africa.

00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:14.240
I had done this
summer experience,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.240
but that didn't really amount
to anything professionally.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.460
So I just kind of thought
deeply about what I could

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.220
do in this part of the world.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.790
I also studied Swahili at
Cornell when I came back.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.170
That was one thing
that I did do.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.635
And the first thing I tried is
I thought I'd be an aid worker.

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:36.760
I said, you know what, I'm
going to save the world.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.710
I'm going to be an aid
worker in Ethiopia,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.720
which was like the
poorest country

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.920
in the region at the time.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.470
It still is one of
the poorest countries.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.150
It had just come
out of a civil war.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.890
And so I did an internship for
Save the Children in Ethiopia.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.750
And it was a terribly lonely,
discouraging, frustrating

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.980
summer.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.550
Just about everything
we did wasn't working.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.840
There was a real
resentment toward us.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840
You know, we were talking
before about that sort

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.730
of savior dynamic.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.980
And that's really
hard to get through

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.070
because we were having all these
programs, and a lot of them

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.809
made sense.

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:15.350
You know, here's a
more efficient way

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.882
to farm your fields.

00:05:17.882 --> 00:05:20.090
If you're going to have sex,
you know, wear a condom.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.300
That will cut down on your
chances of getting AIDS.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.390
Here's some materials
for better schools.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.840
But there was-- there
was this resentment

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.080
that we kept running
into where people just

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.770
felt like we were patronizing
or humiliating them.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.630
Just that dynamic of telling
somebody how to live their life

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.892
is problematic.

00:05:42.892 --> 00:05:44.850
And that doesn't mean
you should give up on it,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.500
but I felt like as an outsider,
as a white guy in Africa,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.320
you already feel enough
like an outsider.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.380
You already feel very
conspicuous and different.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.100
And this dynamic with
distributing aid just kind of

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.310
added to that.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.510
So then I was confused.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.275
Welcome.

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:04.400
We're just getting started.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.000
No sweat.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.896
So then I was really confused.

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:11.270
And what I had
studied in college

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.450
was absolutely no
professional help.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.900
On my transcript, you know,
I had Swahili, Indonesian,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.760
sculpture, English literature,
creative writing, history.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.844
I was all over the place.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:27.260
There's a line in
the book where I

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.680
said my college
transcript was like a map

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.820
to nowhere drawn by
a blind cartographer.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.380
Because it was like just--
you'd look at it and be like,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.870
what does this kid really
want to do with his life?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.810
But then I got like
an escape rope,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.720
which is I won the scholarship
to go to Oxford, which

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.720
basically just bought me like
two years to kind of figure

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.090
out what I wanted
to do with my life.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.350
And that's when I
decided that journalism

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.440
was a good fit for me.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.862
And journalism was
my ticket back.

00:06:59.862 --> 00:07:01.070
That's what I started saying.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.890
I said, you know what?

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.431
I'm going to live
and work in Africa.

00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:05.480
I'm going to be a
journalist in Africa

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.270
and I'm going to do whatever
it takes to get there.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.300
So I started by
applying to newspapers

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.896
all across the country.

00:07:12.896 --> 00:07:14.270
And this was at
a different time.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.940
Like the newspaper
industry today in 2017

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.934
is much different
than it was in 1996.

00:07:20.934 --> 00:07:22.850
Actually, when I got
into the business looking

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.620
at historical figures
of circulation

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.400
for newspapers, like
1996 was like the peak

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.715
of American newspapers.

00:07:32.715 --> 00:07:35.090
There were papers all over
the country that were growing,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.790
that were hiring, that were
looking for young people.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.460
And I cast like a
wide net, trying

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.280
to find anybody
who would hire me.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.870
And I got exactly one job offer.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.520
And that was in a little
redneck town in central Florida,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.210
north of Tampa.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.990
The newspaper was the "St.
Petersburg Times," which

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.850
is a good regional newspaper.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.840
But St. Pete was like Manhattan
compared to where I started.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.160
I started in this little
redneck town, population 5,000.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.490
Confederate flags everywhere,
very racist, very violent,

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.770
a lot of domestic abuse.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.420
And one of the first
stories I covered

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.120
was a scary one
about a man who was

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.690
accused of killing a little
girl and disappearing her body.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.970
And I came into the office one
day-- this is all a true story.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.710
It's in my book.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.049
I came in the office one
day and the editor said,

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.590
I need you to do an
interview with Willie Crain.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.030
And I said, who's Willie Crain?

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.549
Because I had actually--
another piece of my story

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:43.280
is I had a long
distance relationship

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.440
with a woman who's now my wife.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.450
We met when we were
in college and we

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.420
kept getting jobs in different
places and we never--

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.270
it took us years to get
our acts together and get

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.491
in the same place.

00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.990
So I would go visit her on the
weekends in Washington or New

00:08:56.990 --> 00:09:00.830
York and then come back to this
little redneck town, which just

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.080
intensified the culture shock.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.490
So I came back on this
Monday and the editor says,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.070
I need you to
interview Willie Crain.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.960
And I said, who's Willie Crain?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.350
And he says, well,
there's a girl missing

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.400
and Willie Crain is suspected
of kidnapping and killing her.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.860
And what happened was he met
a woman-- this guy Willie

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.660
Crain was a crab fisherman, and
he would go out into Tampa Bay

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.770
and put these steel crab
traps under the water.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.400
Have you guys ever
seen a crab trap?

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.200
Or a buoy that sort of
floats on the water?

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.150
And they're these
steel cages that

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.780
sit on the bottom of the ocean
and the crabs come in there.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.230
And this was his job, he had
hundreds of these crab traps.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.030
And a few nights before,
he had met a woman who

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.760
invited him back to her house.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.350
They were watching TV--

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.010
actually the movie
"Titanic"-- in her bedroom.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.530
She said her back
hurt, he offered

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.300
to give her some Valium.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.380
He gave her like five times
the normal dose of Valium.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.420
They kept watching the movie.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.750
The woman had a little girl
who was eight years old.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.120
And when she woke up, he was
gone and the girl was gone.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.115
And that's all anybody knew.

00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:19.240
And when the woman then
called the police and said,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.570
I just woke up and I had this
guy, Willie, and my daughter's

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:26.320
missing, they ran his name
and they told the woman

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.530
that he had gone to prison
for molesting little girls

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.330
the exact same age.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.930
And he should have been
in prison for 50 years,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.600
and he got out early because
it was at the time when

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.990
the Florida prison system was
very crowded and they were just

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.530
kicking people out, and he got
out way before he should've.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.000
So I'm this like
cub reporter who

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.160
wants to go to Africa, right?

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.610
I'm not trained to
cover the police.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.060
I'm just kind of faking it,
as you do on a first job.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.250
You don't ask a lot of
questions because you talked

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.470
your way into the job,
and if you start saying,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.220
well, actually, how
do you do an interview

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.950
and what questions
should I ask, the boss

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.366
is going to look at you and
be like, well why the hell did

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:07.700
we hire you?

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.620
So that's part of the
whole magic, right,

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.560
of those first jobs.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.760
It's like you sort of bite off
a lot and really sell yourself,

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.580
and then you have to sort
of figure it out on the job.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.400
And there was a lot
of that in this job.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.640
So I got an address
for this guy.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.450
And this is back in the day
when our first resource--

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.390
and this is crazy to be
standing in Google saying this--

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.080
but our first resource
was a phone book.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.180
A printed-- I know,
it's funny, right?

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.260
Printed phone book.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.340
That was the first
thing we would do.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.589
We'd look up somebody's name,
and look for their phone

00:11:39.589 --> 00:11:41.226
number and their address.

00:11:41.226 --> 00:11:43.100
And then we would sort
of take it from there.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.740
We had these map books that--

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.080
you guys remember the
Thomas Guide LA map books?

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.400
Does that ring a bell?

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.610
So way before GPS and
Google Maps and all that,

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.710
you would have these
analog, spiral-bound map

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.220
books where they would list
the streets in the back

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.514
in alphabetical order.

00:11:59.514 --> 00:12:01.680
And so if you had to go to
Cherry Street, you'd look

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.640
and it would say, Cherry
Street page 50, A5,

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.060
and you'd find-- that's
how we got around.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.600
So I drove up to this guy's--

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.750
this guy, Willie's, house.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:13.830
And he had been denying.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.090
He was on the loose.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.840
He was the prime suspect
because of his background,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.980
but they had no evidence.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.170
This girl had vanished.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.420
The police were looking
in the crab traps,

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.570
they were pulling up these
seaweed covered crab traps,

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.270
they were looking in his
boat, all around the area

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.160
for any trace of this girl.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.240
Nothing.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.190
They didn't find-- nothing.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:36.840
No evidence whatsoever.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.730
So they couldn't
arrest this guy.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.100
So everybody knew
he was the suspect,

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.140
but they had no evidence on him.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.670
So I knock on his door,
and I'm terrified.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.940
I'm like 25 years old,
knocking on the door

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.910
of an accused murderer's
house by myself.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.070
It's part of the job.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.300
And he opens the door, and
he looked very agitated.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.520
His hair was really messy
and his clothes looked dirty.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.260
And I was like 25, he
was close to 50, I think.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.640
The strangest thing, though,
is he had these black lines

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.820
on his neck that he had
taken a magic marker

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:19.310
and traced these lines on his
neck, like tribal markings

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:20.370
or something.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.749
So he welcomes me
into his house.

00:13:22.749 --> 00:13:24.665
He was actually kind of
surprisingly friendly.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.390
And I left one thing out.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.840
I had met his daughter,
and his daughter somehow

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:37.160
trusted me and arranged
for me to go meet the dad.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.680
The daughter was an
adult, maybe 30 something.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.260
And so she had convinced
her dad to talk

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.870
to me, because he had refused
to talk to anybody else.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.402
So this is like a big scoop.

00:13:46.402 --> 00:13:48.860
I'm talking to this guy, Willie
Crain, who everybody thinks

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.960
is this child molester, killer.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.880
And in local news,
these are big stories.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.760
Like this is on the
evening news every night,

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.510
it's on the front page
of the local paper.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.120
Everybody wants to know what
happened to the little girl.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.887
There were dozens of
people volunteering,

00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:01.970
looking in the crab traps.

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.080
It was like a big--

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.510
it was like a storm in
Tampa for a few weeks.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.670
You know, what
happened to this girl?

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.980
So Willie takes me
into his trailer.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.357
He lives in like a double wide--

00:14:13.357 --> 00:14:15.690
you know, what they call like
a double wide mobile home.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:19.580
Aluminum siding, you know, very
cheaply made, kind of rotting,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.690
sinking into the jungle
almost because this

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.060
is a very kind of
lush part of Florida.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.120
We sit down and I
say, Willie, what

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.160
are these lines on your neck?

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.590
And he's got a knife on
the table next to him.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.000
I kid you not.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.060
He's got his big buck
knife and sharpening stone

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.650
right next to him.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.650
And he says, I drew
those lines on my neck

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.890
because they're asking
me for a blood sample,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.760
and if they make me
give a blood sample,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.870
I'm going to give them all
the blood they can get.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.750
Meaning he's going
to slit his throat.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:58.840
And so I'm like this 25-year-old
kid on like a suicide watch

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.070
now.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.980
And so I'm nervous,
but I have a job to do.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.680
I'm trying to talk to this
guy and get some information.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.990
And so he sits down and he's
got this big plate of food.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.280
He was eating lunch when
I knocked on the door.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.930
And he's got this big plate
of food, and it's porkchops.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.800
And he's cutting
up these porkchops.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.960
And I'm just trying to keep
the conversation going,

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.120
because I don't know.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.230
I'm overwhelmed.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.840
Nobody's ever taught
me how to handle myself

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.040
in this situation.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.050
I'm scared, like personally.

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.144
You know, that this guy
might do something to me.

00:15:34.144 --> 00:15:36.310
I'm thinking he probably
won't, because he's already

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.774
under so much suspicion.

00:15:37.774 --> 00:15:39.190
That kind of gives
me some safety,

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.030
but he could be totally crazy.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.370
Who knows?

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.065
And so we're talking, talking.

00:15:44.065 --> 00:15:46.210
And finally, I
say, "Willie, looks

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.280
like you're pretty hungry."

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.220
And he puts down his knife
and fork, and he looks at me.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:53.950
And he says, "damn
skippy I'm hungry.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.550
This is the first meal I've had
since that little girl died."

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.160
Which was a slip-up.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.640
Because he had been denying
that he knew anything about what

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.590
happened to that little girl.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.530
He had told the police, "I just
left that house that night.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.690
She was sleeping in bed.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.320
I have no idea what
happened to her.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.390
She maybe ran away.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.200
She's out there somewhere."

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.080
And so he's just admitted to
me that he knows she's dead.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.590
And the instant he said that,
the muscles under his eyes

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.630
started twitching.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.750
And I just was terrified.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.730
Because I thought, "he did it.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.440
He killed this little girl."

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.910
And I'm sitting across from
him, and nobody knows that.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.890
So eventually I
extracted myself safely.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:45.240
We did a big story on it.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.896
It became a big scoop, because
you know, he made a slip-up.

00:16:49.896 --> 00:16:51.020
And I had to call him back.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.170
And I kind of felt bad.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.320
I felt like I sort of
tricked him a little bit.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:59.550
And as a young reporter, it
wasn't my job to defend him,

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.847
but I also felt sort of guilty,
like I'd manipulated him,

00:17:02.847 --> 00:17:04.680
I had tricked him into
saying something that

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.760
was going to really hurt him.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.619
Or I shouldn't say
hurt, but something

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:16.560
that seemed almost unfair,
like I had ambushed him.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.560
So I called him back up.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.160
I was like, "Willie, what did
you mean by the first meal you

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.660
had since that girl died?"

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.030
And he made up some
excuse about how, oh well,

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.410
everybody was saying she's
dead, so she's got to be dead.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:28.470
He just dug the hole deeper.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.790
So we ran the story.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.850
It became a big scoop.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.190
And that led to
me getting on a TV

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.920
show, that then led to a job
at the Los Angeles Times.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.130
That was my ticket out.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.530
And his case meanwhile went on.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.520
And he was convicted, first
degree murder and kidnapping,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.920
because eventually they did
forensic analysis of all

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.940
of his stuff in his trailer, and
they found a pair of underwear

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.800
with a drop of blood.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.520
That was the little
girl's blood.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.160
And that's all they
ever found to this day.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.257
And he got convicted
and sentenced to death.

00:18:07.257 --> 00:18:08.465
He's on death row in Florida.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.310
And that was my first
taste of a big story,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:20.010
and a weird, dark, kind
of scary, strange story.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.385
But that began, that
gave me momentum.

00:18:22.385 --> 00:18:24.260
And it's like, these
things are so much luck.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.676
Like, maybe everybody
in this room

00:18:25.676 --> 00:18:27.410
has the same type
of something that

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.590
happened to them at some point
that just turned their career

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.850
in a different direction.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.670
Purely kind of luck.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.100
So I worked at the LA Times, and
then September 11th happened.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.840
And that just opened
up the landscape,

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.780
because all of a sudden there
was a need for young reporters

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.240
to go across the world
looking for information

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.620
about terrorism.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.130
So I was sent to Egypt, to
Yemen, to Afghanistan, and then

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:53.940
to Iraq.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.420
And I spent a lot of time
covering the Iraq War.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.060
That was also terrifying
because journalists

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.780
are supposed to be
the observers and not

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.080
a factor in the equation.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.010
And in Iraq, there was
such deep resentment

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.890
towards any American.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.250
There were a few Iraqis
that were initially

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.300
excited about the overthrow
of Saddam Hussein,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.280
but that went away
pretty fast, and there

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.150
was a huge part of the
population that hated us.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.200
And I was kidnapped by
insurgents in Fallujah.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.740
I was driving down a road.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:41.150
And the road was supposed
to be clear, and all of us,

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:43.891
we had talked to people that had
traveled on that road earlier

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:44.390
in the day.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.848
And we said, "hey,
is that road OK?

00:19:45.848 --> 00:19:48.140
You know, there's some
insurgent areas around there."

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.740
And they said, "no, no.

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:49.620
We were just on it.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.750
It's fine."

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.804
Which is as best you
can do sometimes.

00:19:53.804 --> 00:19:55.220
And we were driving
down the road,

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.460
a van cut off the
road in front of us.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.500
And these guys with
masks on their faces

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.150
jumped out with guns.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.370
And then all of a
sudden, at the same time,

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.620
there was dozens of
other guys with guns,

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.440
surrounded us, pulled us out of
the car, held us at gunpoint,

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.020
and started asking us
questions, shouting questions.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.420
"Who are you?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.360
Why are you here?

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.680
Who sent you?

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.460
And most importantly,
where are you from?

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.700
Are you American?"

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.960
I had an American passport
just a few minutes

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.030
before this in my pocket.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.740
And as we were
getting surrounded,

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:35.180
I took it out and handed it to
a female photojournalist who

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:39.290
was sitting next to me, who
stuffed it down her pants

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.180
along with her passport.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.660
And so I then went through this
lie for the next several hours,

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.830
where I told these
guys I was Greek.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.320
I just thought of
that on the spot,

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.620
because Greece was one of
the few Western countries

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.030
that was not in Iraq.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.250
France was the other one,
but I don't speak French

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.010
and a lot of people
do speak French.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.120
But so many other countries, you
know, England, Australia, New

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.020
Zealand, Canada, Italy, they
were all part of this coalition

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.910
to overthrow Saddam Hussein.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.730
So if you said you were from any
of those countries, you could--

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.260
they wouldn't like that.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.410
So I spent the next several
hours interrogated at gunpoint

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.851
with these guys looking at
me, saying the same questions

00:21:20.851 --> 00:21:21.350
again.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:23.840
They kept passing us up to
different people, saying,

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.851
"who are you?

00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:25.850
What are you doing here?

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:26.641
Where are you from?

00:21:26.641 --> 00:21:28.370
Are you American?"

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:32.342
And at the end of the day,
finally, some commander

00:21:32.342 --> 00:21:33.800
put us through the
questions again,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.212
and then just said,
"get out of here."

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:37.420
And we drove back to Baghdad.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.300
And it was only when
we got back to Baghdad

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.880
that I realized how--

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.100
I was so caught up in
the moment of just trying

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:52.410
to save my skin that I didn't
understand the gravity of it.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.270
And it was only at the end
of the whole experience

00:21:55.270 --> 00:22:00.460
when all of our staff were lined
up on the lawn of our house

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.920
in Baghdad, the Iraqi staff.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:07.230
And they hugged us, and
they just started bawling.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.690
And it was then that I realized
they thought they were never

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.350
going to see us again.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:19.730
And so this is like the ups
and downs of journalism.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.940
From Iraq, I then
finally got my dream job.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.270
It took much longer than I
ever thought it would take.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.350
It took me 10 years from when
I started, but finally in 2006,

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.940
I was sent to Nairobi, Kenya.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.570
Nairobi is a beautiful place.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.120
It's a big city,
one of the biggest

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.040
cities in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.600
It's very green.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.840
It's right on the equator,
but at 6,000 feet.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.915
So it's got this perfect
climate, where every day

00:22:48.915 --> 00:22:51.870
it's warm and
sunny, but it never

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.390
gets too hot because
of the altitude.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.820
And there's flowering
trees everywhere,

00:22:56.820 --> 00:23:02.400
and lots of little, windy roads,
even in great central Nairobi.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.690
And the job was to
cover East Africa, which

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.160
is 12 countries, different
degrees of development

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.460
and conflict, and different
issues of poverty,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:21.830
bad governance, histories
of ethnic tensions,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.126
different in each country.

00:23:23.126 --> 00:23:24.500
Each country has
its own dynamic,

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.960
and I sometimes get
criticized, and other people

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.290
get criticized for talking
about Africa as a country,

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.810
or just making these huge
sweeping generalizations

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.510
about Africa.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.800
That's valid.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:41.120
Africa is 54
independent countries.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.870
But many of them do share a
certain very, very obvious

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:45.980
similarities.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.350
And if you look at like the
United Nations Development

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.320
statistics, they're all
grouped together, sadly,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.540
at the bottom for
education, lifespan, income,

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:57.700
industrial levels.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.710
There's a lot of similarities
to these countries in Africa.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.740
So I do make some
generalizations,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:08.940
but I think that's helpful to
understand the bigger picture.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.280
So in East Africa, my job
is to cover the big news.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.840
There's only one of me.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.120
The New York Times
is a big newspaper.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.560
We're still
committed to quality,

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.360
on the ground journalism.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:26.270
But Africa remains a place that
isn't that closely covered,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.460
and we have a correspondent
in South Africa,

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.830
a correspondent in West
Africa, and one correspondent

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.760
in East Africa.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.870
That was my job.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.560
Is my job.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.100
And I cover like
400 million people

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.200
in 12 different countries.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.720
And a lot of the
work is conflict.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.450
Because a lot of these
countries are really badly

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:50.450
governed, and have had long
histories of ethnic conflict

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.220
and civil war.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.780
Almost every one.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.660
Kenya is one of the exceptions.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.697
And my first year there,
there was a bungled election

00:24:59.697 --> 00:25:02.030
where there was suspicion
that the government had rigged

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.130
the election to stay
in power, which it's

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.720
pretty obvious that they did.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.390
And the country blew up
in this spasm of violence.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.850
And all around us,
even in Nairobi,

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.600
people were killing each
other based on ethnic lines.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.110
There were fires in the street.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.660
I could stand on my porch and
smell burning tires at night.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.630
Even a place like Kenya
that's got so much promise

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.020
was very quickly upended
by the same problem

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.850
that a lot of African
countries have,

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.670
which is these tensions
between ethnic groups.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:32.570
And this goes back.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:37.010
I don't want to lecture anybody
for something you already

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:41.000
may know, but this goes back
to the history of colonialism,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.040
that the colonial
powers took these spaces

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:47.690
on the African map, and they
said, "today you're Kenyan.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.510
The guy crossed that
line, he's Tanzanian.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.830
This person is Ugandan.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.549
That person is Sudanese."

00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:55.340
Even if they were in
the same ethnic group,

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.180
even if they had traded and
coexisted together for as long

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:01.250
as anybody could
remember, all of a sudden,

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.530
there were these new
nation states created

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.561
that were supposed to have
their own senses of identity.

00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:08.060
And that sense of
identity is pretty

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.100
weak in a lot of these places.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.230
People have a stronger
sense of their ethnic group.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.860
So on the streets of Kenya,
I can walk out of my house

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.680
and hear five different
languages being spoken.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.470
Because people will
speak their tribal tongue

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.930
before they'll speak
the national language,

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:26.360
which is Swahili or English.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:33.180
So over the years, I've
struggled because part of me

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.570
wants to honor what brought me
to Africa in the first place,

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.530
which was this sense
of warmth and the sense

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.650
that people who had so little
are really open hearted

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:46.560
and in a way have better
values than we have,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.524
that they're more
connected to each other.

00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:50.190
You can even see it
like in hand-shakes.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.542
Like when Kenyans shake hands,
they come up to somebody,

00:26:52.542 --> 00:26:54.000
they shake hands,
and they'll still

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.250
stand there going
like this, holding

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.955
hands for several minutes
while they're like,

00:26:58.955 --> 00:26:59.830
"hey, how's it going?

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.280
Haven't seen you for a while.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.400
How are your kids?"

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.410
And they're still holding hands.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.810
It's not like a quick
handshake and a retreat.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.840
And that's just a symbol of
how connected people are,

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.900
like physically connected,
spiritually connected.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.040
And I love that.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.150
That's a big reason why I
have been there for so long.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.300
The job I'm in is typically
a three to five year job,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.620
and I've been there 11 years.

00:27:25.272 --> 00:27:26.730
But at the same
time, there's a lot

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.313
of conflict in this
part of the world.

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:30.600
These countries are
poorly governed.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.410
South Sudan, have you guys
been following the news at all?

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.890
Or does that just not
conjure up anything specific

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:40.180
when I say South Sudan?

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.580
Yeah.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.750
So South Sudan is an
interesting story.

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:46.810
It's the world's newest country.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:49.360
The South Sudanese
fought for decades

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.080
to get their own country.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.040
They felt like they were being
oppressed by the Arabs who

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.930
are in control in the
north of the country,

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.690
and they started this
guerrilla war in the '50s,

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:00.730
and fought, and fought,
and fought, and fought,

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.770
with different
countries helping one

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:07.040
side or the other for their
own strategic interests.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.080
And finally, in 2011, they
won their independence,

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.040
in big part because the United
States shook a finger at Sudan

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.190
and said, "you've got to give
these guys their independence."

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.770
We gave them a lot of money,
the South Sudanese, billions

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:23.230
of dollars from
American taxpayers

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.110
for a relatively small country
of about 10 million people,

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.719
very underdeveloped.

00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:29.260
And there was a
couple of years there

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.050
was there was a lot of
pride and joy in the fact

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.700
that they were an
independent country.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.110
And then in 2013, one of the
worst civil wars in Africa

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.660
in recent years erupted.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:43.030
And the two leading ethnic
groups in South Sudan

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.180
began fighting for who was
going to control the country.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.150
And it was like a fuse that
ripped across the country

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.690
and just started igniting
fighting everywhere.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.720
And it wasn't just like men
on men shooting each other.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.650
It was soldiers going into areas
of the opposite ethnic group,

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:04.140
raping women, killing
kids, burning down houses.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.570
This kind of
complete destruction

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.000
is the way war is fought.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.130
The same thing had
happened in Darfur earlier.

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:14.230
That was one of
my first stories.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.020
It's this very brutal
form of warfare,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.300
where there's no battle,
there's no battlefields,

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.680
there's no lines.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.550
It's about making the
other side suffer,

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:28.450
and just venting all
your anger and resentment

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.350
towards the other.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.910
And so South Sudan,
today, is a mess.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.560
It's totally
paralyzed in conflict.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:41.060
There's now a famine,
because people need food,

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.450
and they have been blocked
off by the fighting.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:47.360
And the government and the
rebels are hijacking aid trucks

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.920
and not letting any aid in.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.140
And there's been a
drought in East Africa.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.880
So some of this has ecological
or environmental causes.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.130
So there are
droughts everywhere.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.724
Like, California's
had a bad drought.

00:30:03.724 --> 00:30:05.390
But in Africa, if you
have a bad drought

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:09.320
and you have a conflict, drought
plus conflict equals famine.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.860
Because all of a sudden,
these people, they need help.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.750
And there's no way to
get the food in when

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.150
people are blowing up the road.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.400
You can do some
airdrops with airplanes,

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.740
but there were even
some UN planes that

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:24.080
were shot at by the rebels.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.470
So there are millions
of people now

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:30.800
that are desperate to
get their next meal.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.830
Like this close to starving to
death today, as we sit here.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:41.480
So in my job, I try
to bring this home.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.820
Like right now, I have you
guys as a captive audience,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.920
doors closed,
you're sitting here,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.200
made the commitment to
come here and listen to me.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.480
But that's not how
it usually works.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.090
I write for a newspaper.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.520
The information goes on the
web or in the print edition.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.485
People are distracted.

00:30:56.485 --> 00:30:57.860
They're thinking
of other things.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.550
They're interested
in other things.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:02.960
And so I have to try to tell
these stories with some urgency

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.370
and to make them
interesting or moving

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.020
so you continue to read
through this story.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.170
So I was in South Sudan
a couple of months

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.750
ago, trying to do this bigger
story about the conflict

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.850
and everything I've
sort of told you.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.800
And I'm looking
for some characters

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.220
to tell the story,
because in a way,

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.250
I'm in the empathy
generation business.

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.950
I'm trying to get
people to care.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.250
Because Africa seems so
far away and disconnected.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:33.510
I care about it.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.424
Other people who've been
there feel the same feelings

00:31:37.424 --> 00:31:39.090
that I felt as a young
person, that this

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.370
is a special part of the
world that they feel close to

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.310
for whatever weird reasons.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.440
But if you've never
set foot there,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.370
you're not going
to feel that way.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:51.930
And so when I was in
South Sudan, I found--

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.050
so just to give you a sense of
my job, I'll plan out a trip.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.150
I'll say, I'm going to
go to a conflict zone

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.950
because that's the best
place to set the story.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.950
It's not in the
capital of South Sudan,

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:06.066
where I'm sitting in a nice
hotel, relatively nice hotel.

00:32:06.066 --> 00:32:07.440
No, I gotta get
out to the field.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.814
I gotta talk to people who
are suffering, because they're

00:32:09.814 --> 00:32:11.160
stories about suffering.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.770
So I'll then make arrangements
to take, let's say,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.006
a UN flight.

00:32:15.006 --> 00:32:16.380
Because often in
these countries,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.430
the United Nations is the
only one that has an airline.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:22.330
There's no other way to travel.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.330
There's no local airline,
and it's too dangerous

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.412
to go by road.

00:32:25.412 --> 00:32:27.120
If you go by road and
you leave the city,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.510
you could get carjacked
by soldiers, or rebel.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.010
And they'll pull
you out of the car,

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:33.900
kill you, and take your stuff.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.380
It happens all the time.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.650
So just getting to these places
becomes very complicated.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.730
So I go to a place in the
southern part of South Sudan

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.610
through a UN flight.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.460
We're staying at a UN camp
that's relatively safe.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.020
We then get cars to go
out to outside the camp.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.860
And we go to these areas where
people have lost everything.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.550
And we're walking
through burned villages.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.170
We're in camps of
displaced people

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.440
that are waiting for the
food supplies to come.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.780
And these are like
concentrations of misery.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:10.620
And so then I get out,
and I introduce myself.

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.360
And most people have never--

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.510
some places, they haven't
seen many white people.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.260
And they definitely have
never seen a journalist.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.790
The only white people
they've seen are aid workers.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.830
And so immediately
people of surround me,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.670
and they're like, "hey, can
you give some help to me?"

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.520
My son is sick, or
my mother is hurt.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.160
And that's a very helpless
feeling that I then feel.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.040
Because I'm just there
to take things from them.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.840
For a higher purpose,
I like to think,

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.300
but I don't have a
first aid kit in my car.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.890
I don't have huge
supplies of food.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.982
That's not my role.

00:33:44.982 --> 00:33:46.440
And sometimes we
get to these areas

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.540
and there are no aid workers.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:50.610
And we beat the
aid workers there.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.700
And so we show up, and
everybody surrounds our car,

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.120
and they think "oh great, save
the children has arrived."

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:01.020
And it's like no, the New
York Times has arrived.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.820
Tell me your story.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:06.720
So just to use this as an
example, so in this situation

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.510
just a couple of months
ago, I found a man

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.370
who had just lost his wife.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:15.270
And he told a very sad story
about how he lived on this farm

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.750
with his wife.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.179
They were very poor.

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.840
They had a plan, finally, to
go get their first cell phone.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.780
They were going to walk to
town on a Saturday afternoon

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.389
and buy a cell phone
for the first time.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:30.270
Because in a lot of these
places, you'd be surprised.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.080
Almost everybody now has
usually not a smartphone

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.790
but a little Nokia phone.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:36.760
That's pretty common.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.560
You have to be rather poor
these days to not have that.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.510
But these people were like that.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:45.900
And this man had this plan to
go get a phone with his wife.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.679
Came back to his house
after working in the fields.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.070
House was on fire.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.540
Farm was burned.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.870
His wife was dead on the ground.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.450
Part of an attack, where the
government-- the government,

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.390
the government, the same
government that United States

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:01.800
funds and supports--

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.550
had gone into this area,
infuriated about rebels,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.910
and just wiped everybody out.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:12.284
And a lot of times, people
are very stoic, especially

00:35:12.284 --> 00:35:13.950
in this part of the
world, where they've

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:18.190
dealt with a lot more
adversity than most of us

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.600
will hopefully ever deal
with or probably ever have.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.482
But that became a
basis for my story.

00:35:23.482 --> 00:35:24.690
So I thought, "you know what?

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.900
People will be able to
connect to this guy."

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.630
We all can just imagine
the shock and sorrow

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.190
we would feel to come home and
be expecting to see our loved

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.750
one and they're dead.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:39.990
And not just dead from a
disease or some accident,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.240
but somebody killed them.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:46.792
And so that became a front page
story in the New York Times.

00:35:46.792 --> 00:35:48.000
What difference does it make?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.170
I don't know.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:53.010
I mean, I like to think
it's at least reminding us

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.190
of what's happening.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.720
Where we're sitting,
we're in one

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:00.250
of the most successful
nations in the world,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:03.660
and one of the most successful
parts of that nation,

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.310
this part of
northern California,

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:08.220
and one of the most
successful companies ever.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:11.970
And it's easy to forget
that there's a whole nother

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.920
existence out there.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.860
And just to finish
up and then I'd

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.820
like to hear some
questions from you guys,

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:21.360
but I just think
that idea of empathy

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.250
is the most important thing.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.640
Because if you can start
to of empathize and relate

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.670
to people with a totally
different outlook,

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.890
and walk of life,
and experience,

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.870
then you'll care a little more.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.290
And it's like I tell my kids.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.550
I have a five and
seven-year-old son.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.660
It's really all about sharing.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.660
You tell your kids that.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.966
Share, don't fight.

00:36:42.966 --> 00:36:44.590
And it's like that's
all we need to do.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.610
We just need to share some of
our time, some of our feelings,

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:51.300
some of our money, and
it will go a long way.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.350
And it's hard.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:53.814
Like in South Sudan, we tried.

00:36:53.814 --> 00:36:55.230
The United States
government tried

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.250
to help this place stand
up on its own two feet.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:01.155
And it didn't-- it
hasn't worked out.

00:37:01.155 --> 00:37:03.030
But that doesn't mean
we should just give up,

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:05.160
because the people like
that guy I wrote about,

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.130
they had nothing to
do with the conflict.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.740
They bear no
responsibility whatsoever.

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.470
They are victims that were
just living their lives

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.560
and got caught up in this
collapsing state that's

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.480
eating itself.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.540
And so I just
think like you guys

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:24.900
are in a position where you
work for a powerful company that

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:29.310
is increasingly connected
to the entire world.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:30.960
That's your mission.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.850
And you just should
think about these people.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:33.270
Think.

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.728
You're sitting in your office,
you're sitting in this room,

00:37:35.728 --> 00:37:38.310
and there's some kid in
South Sudan desperate to get

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.770
on Google right now.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.130
His phone doesn't work, or
his power just went out,

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.670
or his battery died, or
the speeds are really slow

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.540
and he can't get
anywhere, or he's on

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.430
and he's starting
to explore the world

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:57.580
from his situation in some
little village in South Sudan.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:05.670
So whatever message I would
impart to you guys, it's that.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.470
It's just, try to remember.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:08.850
It's hard.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.250
We're all caught up
in our own things.

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.720
That's how human beings are.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.620
But just try to remember
there's another world out there.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.910
And the more we're connected
and empathic with that,

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.010
the happier we'll be
as people, and the more

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.570
help we'll be giving.

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.140
And so in the book I
wrote, just to plug my book

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.440
and then we'll go to questions,
I just talk about this.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.830
I talk about why I
really care about Africa,

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:38.880
what I've learned from it,
and if anything, just how it's

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.770
helped me be a better person.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:44.640
A big part of my book
is a moral journey.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.470
As a college kid, I did
a lot of stupid things.

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.650
I hurt people.

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:53.220
I made mistakes that I regret.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.040
It took me a long time to learn
how to be a better person.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.720
And I get a lot of that from
living in a part of the world

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.340
where I think people have
better values in many ways,

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.130
despite all this I've
said about conflict.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:10.590
A lot of that is just coming
from a few people at the top,

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:14.642
and it's making many suffer,
but people are more connected.

00:39:14.642 --> 00:39:17.100
And it's like that's what we're
doing with this technology.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:21.720
We're bringing the world
more into closer contact

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:23.170
with each other.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:27.760
So that's my spiel.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.940
I appreciate you guys
giving me some of your time,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.960
and I would love just to take
a few questions about my book,

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.760
or myself, or this part
of the world, anything.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.137
Fire away.

00:39:43.137 --> 00:39:44.220
You can hold the applause.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.540
Yes, sir.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.820
AUDIENCE: You mentioned bad
governance several times,

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.710
right?

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:53.980
But I guess they're not equal.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.680
Out of these countries, where
do you see the most hope?

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.440
For example, I went
to Tanzania on safari,

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.230
thinking that it's one of
the better run countries

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.732
and the concept of
family and ujumaa.

00:40:05.732 --> 00:40:07.315
So I mean, what are
some good examples

00:40:07.315 --> 00:40:08.866
of some good governance there?

00:40:08.866 --> 00:40:12.274
Or which is better out
of those countries there?

00:40:12.274 --> 00:40:14.190
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Where
were you in Tanzania?

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.410
AUDIENCE: I went on
safari so I did the usual.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.700
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN:
Serengeti and Goro Goro.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.700
AUDIENCE: And Tarangire.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.197
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN:
When was this?

00:40:21.197 --> 00:40:22.510
AUDIENCE: This is 10 years ago.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.980
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: 10 years ago?

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.664
OK.

00:40:23.664 --> 00:40:24.580
So it's changed a lot.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.470
Tanzania is an
interesting example,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:33.170
because there is
harmony in Tanzania.

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:35.740
Which there is not in
many African countries.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.270
There's a sense of national
identity in Tanzania, which

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.270
there is not in many countries.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:44.410
But Tanzania is really poor,
and Tanzania will always

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.900
be behind Kenya and some
of the other countries

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.340
in that region because of
its history of socialism.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.310
And some of it failed really
bad, like these forced forms

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:55.440
and things.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.050
It was kind of like
the Great Leap Forward.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.560
But they got some things right.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.660
And their governance-- so their
economic policy was really bad.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:11.200
But they got some political and
social issues absolutely right.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.560
And that was, "let's think
of ourselves as Tanzanian.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.620
For better or for worse, we're
stuck in the same space that's

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.060
called Tanzania."

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.162
We can complain
about colonialism.

00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:22.870
We can look back and
say, "you know what?

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:27.040
It makes no sense that that
Maasai 50 yards away from me

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.900
is a Kenyan and
we are Tanzanian."

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.650
Because those lines went
right through ethnic areas.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.120
But that's the way it goes.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.130
And the African Union
actually made a decision

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:38.470
in the '60s, when
it started, not

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:41.050
to revisit colonial borders.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:44.440
Because it would be
this endless problem.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.570
There would be disputes
all over the continent,

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.580
because none of those
borders make sense.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.040
So the Tanzanians
did something smart.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.410
The first president,
Julius Nyerere.

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.740
And he said, "we're Tanzanian.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.150
Everybody's gotta
speak Swahili."

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.340
No local language.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.690
You've gotta to speak Swahili.

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:06.910
And to enforce that, they did
it was almost like desegregation

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:07.840
busing.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.700
They took kids from
Western Tanzania

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.290
and they sent them to Eastern
Tanzania for high school,

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.920
or from the north to the south.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.410
They mixed mix
people up, so there

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.480
was no way to just get
comfortable in your area

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.370
and only speak your
local language.

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:24.280
And to this day, like I
studied Swahili in college,

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.980
and in Tanzania, it's
beautiful Swahili.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:28.930
That's their national language.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:32.920
And that permeated more than
just a linguistic issue.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.592
It resulted in more
social cohesion.

00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:38.050
And Tanzania has no history--
it's one of the few countries

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:39.010
in Africa--

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:41.860
literally, there's
very, very few

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.560
out of all those 54
countries with no history

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.120
of ethnic conflict.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:50.200
So that's an example of
some very good governance,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.495
but they did disastrous
economic policy,

00:42:52.495 --> 00:42:55.120
where they said everybody should
live on these collective farms

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.930
and work together.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.990
And the productivity went
down, and people starved.

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:02.500
It was just all that we
know from history shows that

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.290
doesn't work.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.470
I think Tanzania is one
of the signs of hope,

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:12.340
because that cohesion
and stability is there.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.400
I don't think anything
is going to shake that up

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.590
in the near term.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.330
Kenya's very hopeful too.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.950
It's just messy, politically.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.420
It's very ethnic.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.570
I can look at somebody's
ID, see their name,

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.890
and have a 90%
chance of guessing

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:29.140
who they're going to vote for.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.152
Because I can tell their
tribe by their name, and I'll

00:43:32.152 --> 00:43:33.610
know who they're
going to vote for.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:36.640
Because people vote,
like almost everybody

00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.350
in that country except a
few urban intellectuals,

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.860
will vote for the
person of their tribe.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.500
And that results in all this
kind of crappy politics.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:50.500
Because if you have a corrupt
leader, a corrupt politician,

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.300
and he's from your
ethnic group, you're

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.540
going to vote for him,
because he's your guy.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.850
And so these guys
get away with murder.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:43:59.623
Like, the salaries
in Kenya, this

00:43:59.623 --> 00:44:00.870
is a really interesting fact.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:03.640
The MPs, the members
of parliament in Kenya,

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.650
make something like
$200,000 a year.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.200
So in absolute terms, they
are some of the highest paid

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.340
lawmakers in the world.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:18.250
If you compare it relative to
the per capita national income,

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.680
average income, it would
be like a congressman

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.510
making like $20 million a year.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.880
Because the average income
in Kenya is like $800.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.740
These guys make $200,000.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.720
If you look at the
American average income

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.000
and then project it
out by the same factor,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.480
it would be like a congressman
making $40 million a year.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.996
They keep getting elected.

00:44:35.996 --> 00:44:37.120
People vote for these guys.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.286
They give themselves raises.

00:44:38.286 --> 00:44:41.020
It's all because of
the ethnic politics.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.297
So some of that has deep roots.

00:44:43.297 --> 00:44:45.130
It was the way these
countries were created.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.120
They're young.

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.720
Most of the countries in Africa
are less than 60 years old.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.690
America was a mess 60 years in.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:56.500
That's when brother was killing
brother in the US civil war.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.460
So you gotta keep that in mind.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.640
It's not an excuse, but
it brings up this issue

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.710
of what's the yardstick.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:06.430
Do we hold them to the same
standards as our countries?

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.250
Or do we hold them to their
own relative standards?

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.570
Or something in between?

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:11.860
Because you don't want
to get to relative.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.420
Like, what's happened
in South Sudan

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.010
with people
slaughtering each other

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.095
is absolutely
wrong in all cases.

00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:21.460
So I think governance is key.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.320
And then there
are a few examples

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:27.230
of good central planning
but repressive governments.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:30.580
So like Rwanda, very
good poverty programs,

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.200
very good development programs.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.230
Rwanda is this tiny little
country packed with people.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.230
It's one of the most
densely populated countries

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:39.710
in the world.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:40.840
And that's a problem.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.870
And so they've got to be really
smart how they use their land,

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:48.610
where they put their roads,
everything, family planning.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.170
And they're doing
it, but there's

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:51.880
almost no freedom in Rwanda.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.940
If you have a difference of
opinion, you're thrown in jail

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:56.860
or killed.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.760
And so that's the choice
a lot of Africans have.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.970
It's not even a choice.

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.510
That's the two alternatives
that they face.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.690
It's either a really shitty
kind of crazy government that

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:10.570
doesn't care about you,
but you have some freedom,

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.320
or a government that's not
bad about improving your water

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.980
or giving your kids school
or a road that you can use,

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.954
but you have no freedom.

00:46:20.954 --> 00:46:21.745
Not a great choice.

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.847
Yes, sir?

00:46:25.847 --> 00:46:26.680
AUDIENCE: Two parts.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.600
You mentioned several times
about making the difference

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.930
and actually seeing it
over the course of 11 years

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:36.290
from when you first
got there till now.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.350
Do you actually
see the difference?

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:40.820
I know from your articles,
looking at it from a job

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.466
perspective, that
you live there,

00:46:41.466 --> 00:46:43.260
you have children
there, how has that

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.987
changed involved with--
especially with two kids.

00:46:45.987 --> 00:46:47.820
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: No,
it's a good question.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.560
So things are different.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.310
Things are better in
the most urban areas.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.220
For instance, when I
got there 10 years ago,

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.710
we had dial up internet.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:00.420
This was not that long ago.

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.190
I had dial up internet,
very slow speeds.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.980
So we had to get
a satellite dish

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:10.830
and pay like $2,000 a month
for medium speed internet.

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.600
About five years ago
or four years ago,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.090
a fiber optic line
finally was brought

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.340
to East Africa from Dubai.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.890
Finally, they wired
the East African coast.

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.720
Internet speed is
now really good.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.240
And that catalyzes a
lot of different stuff.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.980
You start getting
better services.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.840
There's online businesses.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.130
You can get tickets online.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.320
It just changes your
life, like it would here.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.592
Infrastructure is
getting better.

00:47:36.592 --> 00:47:37.800
The roads are getting better.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.650
The airports are getting better.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.660
The middle class is growing.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.860
So you have more Kenyans--

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.370
I use this example.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:50.430
So I left this out, but those
of you who have been there,

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.050
this will sound familiar.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:54.140
Crime is a problem.

00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:57.090
So living in Nairobi
in a nice house,

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.010
we have guards that
sit on our porch

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:03.930
every night with billy clubs and
a panic button, where they have

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.830
a necklace that they
press this button,

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:07.800
and then that will
alert a security company

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.890
to come and back them up.

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:12.640
That's just a feature of life.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.750
That's one of the downsides.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.885
There are these great
disparities of wealth,

00:48:17.885 --> 00:48:19.260
and there's a lot
of poor people.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:24.210
And it tends not to be super
hardcore violent crime,

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.390
but there's still home
invasions and carjackings.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.830
But it's usually not gratuitous.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:34.230
So we have these guards
that sit on our porch.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.410
10 years ago, when
I moved to Kenya,

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:38.700
their phones would never ring.

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.040
I'd never hear them
talking on their phones.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.620
Now I hear these guys
talking all the time

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.631
on their cell phones.

00:48:44.631 --> 00:48:46.380
They're getting calls
from their villages,

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.920
they're talking to their wives.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.150
That little improvement in
their disposable income,

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.430
their salaries have gone
up, the cell phone costs

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.900
have gone down.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.610
They might not be
quite middle class,

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.830
but they're gainfully employed.

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.600
Their lives are getting
a little better.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:05.100
They now have enough money to
talk to their people back home.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.860
So that stuff, the
development is happening.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:08.940
You're seeing it.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:14.940
Sometimes, we're like exporting
the wrong stuff, I would say.

00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.410
You know, there's
Domino's Pizza.

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:17.640
There's Burger King.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.260
There's Coldstone Creamery.

00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:23.850
You know, this kind of like
high cal, unhealthy food.

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:25.860
Kenyans actually eat pretty--

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.660
everything there
is very natural,

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.650
because like fast food
hasn't, up until recently,

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.589
been a phenomenon.

00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:35.880
So if you go to a Kenyan
restaurant, you order a burger

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.310
and fries, it's going
take a half an hour.

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:41.522
But there's somebody
peeling the potato.

00:49:41.522 --> 00:49:42.480
It's going to be fresh.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.188
When you do get it,
it tastes really good

00:49:44.188 --> 00:49:45.840
because it's made fresh.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.230
So some of that's going away.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.360
It's like Americans are
trying to eat more healthy.

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.020
Like red meat.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:53.850
I'm doing a story
about land issues,

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.120
because Africa's population
is growing very fast.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.220
And Africans rely on land.

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.190
And there's going to be these
pressures on too many people,

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.480
too little land.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.859
And so I was looking at
beef stats, because beef--

00:50:08.859 --> 00:50:09.900
I'm not like a hardcore--

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.420
I eat beef, but a
lot of vegetarians

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.500
will go on and on about the
resources that are needed

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.620
to feed a beef cow, right?

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.780
So the US and Europe,
they're decreasing the amount

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:22.800
of red meat that we eat.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.674
Mostly for health reasons,
but other reasons.

00:50:24.674 --> 00:50:27.270
In Kenya, people now
have enough money

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:30.210
to eat red meat,
which is a luxury.

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:32.160
And so there's more
herds, there's more cows,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:33.030
and they need more space.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.821
And that's creating
all these other issues.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.380
So development brings
these complications,

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:43.860
but overall, lifespans
are getting longer,

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:46.170
kids are healthier, more
people are being educated,

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:48.230
they have more
access to technology.

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:50.199
In the urban areas, that's true.

00:50:50.199 --> 00:50:51.990
But at the same time,
you have these places

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.660
like South Sudan, or Congo,
or Somalia that I cover.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:57.150
And they're stuck.

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.370
They're not much
different from how

00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:03.550
they were 10, 15, 20 years ago.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:07.010
And those factors about bad
governance and conflict, that's

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.780
still embedded in these places.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.480
So there's no quick solution.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:18.276
All the leadership in South
Sudan is has been tainted.

00:51:18.276 --> 00:51:19.400
That's putting it politely.

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.650
They're all really bad.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:22.830
They're all pretty
brutal and corrupt.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:23.890
All of them.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.430
So you're going to need
another generation or two

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.340
for these guys to fade
out before you have

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.680
any hope of better leadership.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.680
And then one thing I'll
bring up because we just

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.580
have a few more minutes,
wildlife is a big issue.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:44.600
Because as these
populations grow,

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.470
people need more space for
farms, for roads, for housing.

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:53.300
And what you're seeing right now
is this onslaught on elephants,

00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:56.000
on rhinos, on
natural environments,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.560
where these animals live.

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.002
Sometimes, it's intentional.

00:51:59.002 --> 00:52:01.460
There are people that are going
out and poaching elephants,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.540
because the ivory, there's a
demand in China especially,

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.880
but in other Asian
countries, for ivory.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.680
And that's pushing up the
price of elephant tusks.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.760
And so you get these
poor guys in Kenya

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.660
that maybe make $100 a
month, if that, $50 a month.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.090
And they can make
thousands of dollars

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.040
by killing one elephant.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.760
And that's hard
economics to overcome.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.280
So right now as
we speak, there's

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.340
been more elephants killed
in the last 10 years

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.830
than a higher proportion
of the elephant population

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:38.220
than ever before.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:39.110
And it's scary.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.930
Because it's a finite--

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.680
there's a few 100,000
elephants left.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.630
That's it.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.759
And they only live in
these big, wild spaces.

00:52:47.759 --> 00:52:48.800
That's the direct threat.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.710
The indirect threat
is just development.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:52.550
I see it in Nairobi.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:54.680
The city is growing
into these areas that

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.840
used to be rural or the bush.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.970
And now they have
housing neighborhoods

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:00.680
on them, subdivisions.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.990
And there used to be wild
animals there, or farms.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:07.470
And so there's going to be
some problems with that.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.570
And they're hard
choices to make.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:10.820
You have a growing population.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.819
You need to feed people.

00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:14.840
Do you set aside land
that could be farmed

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.030
and say "no, you're not
allowed to farm that.

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.500
That's where elephants live."

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.630
Or do you just kick
off all the elephants,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:25.460
or kill them off, and then say
we need to use that for a farm.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:26.550
Those are hard questions.

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:31.179
Yes, sir.

00:53:31.179 --> 00:53:32.470
AUDIENCE: It's about Al-Shabab.

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:34.225
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Yes.

00:53:34.225 --> 00:53:37.430
AUDIENCE: Seems like the peak
was the Westgate terrorist act,

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:41.779
and from then it
glimpses, but I actually

00:53:41.779 --> 00:53:43.570
am not current on where
they are right now.

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:45.435
I know they're shutting down--
but there's talk about shutting

00:53:45.435 --> 00:53:47.160
down Dadaab, the refugee camp--

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.811
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Right.

00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:49.310
No, no.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:52.360
That's a good-- let me knock
on wood as I answer this,

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.810
because they've been down.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.810
They've been down over
the last couple of years,

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:57.310
but they were down
before Westgate,

00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:58.730
which was what was scary.

00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:02.050
So the Westgate Mall
was a big mall in Kenya.

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.980
In 2013, these four
guys came in there,

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:07.510
part of an Islamic group,
and they just started machine

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.820
gunning shoppers and civilians.

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.950
And then they took over
them all for a few hours

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:15.660
until they were kicked out and
about 100 people were killed.

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:22.110
Kids, shoppers, just ordinary
people, terrorist attack.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.692
They had been quiet before that.

00:54:23.692 --> 00:54:25.150
And everybody was
saying, "oh yeah,

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:26.233
what happened the Shabab?"

00:54:26.233 --> 00:54:28.270
And all of a sudden,
boom, one of the worst

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:31.550
terrorist incidents in
recent memory anywhere.

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:33.170
They're under a lot of pressure.

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:36.410
The US has done a
good job of killing

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:38.570
the leaders with drone
strikes and air strikes.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.660
They've struggled for years
to get good intelligence,

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.180
and they now seem to have
it, because they're hitting--

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.950
they're killing the leaders.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:48.230
But it's a big group.

00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:50.510
Somalia has really
bad governance,

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.780
and is just an open space
where you can do anything.

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.010
So they're still there.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:55:00.390
My guess is, they're
on the decline,

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:03.840
but they're capable of
doing some more nasty stuff.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.630
And it's just kind of
a miracle that they

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:10.387
haven't attacked a big
Western target or an embassy.

00:55:10.387 --> 00:55:11.970
Because that's who
they really don't--

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:13.710
that's who they're fighting.

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.210
The US is killing the leaders.

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:19.680
Why aren't they trying
to kill Americans?

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.480
They probably are.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.880
It's just harder because the
American embassy in Nairobi

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.300
is a fortress.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.710
So that's not an easy target.

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:28.250
The mall is a much
better target.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:31.380
Dadaab, they've cooled off
on trying to close that.

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:33.870
The Kenyan government
really wanted to close that,

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.530
and they have been
sort of smacked back.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.600
And their own courts
said, "no, it's

00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.270
illegal to kick these guys out
because you've recognized them

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.520
as refugees."

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.650
And all the donors
who pay for Dadaab

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:49.050
are like, "we're not
giving you a cent

00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.310
to relocate these people."

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:52.474
So they could do it.

00:55:52.474 --> 00:55:53.890
Physically, they
could go in there

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.160
and push people out at gunpoint.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.170
But they would
take so much crap,

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.730
and even their own courts
have said that's illegal.

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:03.900
So I don't think
that's going to change.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.830
I think those people
are stuck there.

00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:07.080
There's three generations now.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.250
There's people that are--

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.080
there's grandchildren,
people that

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:12.510
came there as really
little kids, then had kids,

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.630
and then those kids had kids.

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:16.440
It's permanent.

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.891
And--

00:56:19.891 --> 00:56:22.390
SPEAKER: We have time for one
more question, which I'll ask.

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:23.490
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Please.

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.573
SPEAKER: So there are
obviously many ups and downs

00:56:25.573 --> 00:56:26.840
to being a journalist.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.600
You were once a
young journalist,

00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.910
aspiring journalist.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:32.060
What advice would you have
given your younger self?

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:34.435
What do you know now that you
wish you'd known back then?

00:56:34.435 --> 00:56:37.262
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: God,
that's why I wrote that book.

00:56:37.262 --> 00:56:39.470
And nobody is allowed to
leave here without the book,

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:40.220
because it's free.

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.100
I wish I had balanced
things better.

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:50.060
I wish I had not put so
much pressure on myself

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:53.510
to succeed professionally
that I made bad decisions

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.280
for my personal life.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.870
Because when you're
young, you're torn.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.510
Part of you is just desperate
to prove yourself and show

00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:06.230
that you can be successful
and do something of value.

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:07.730
But another part
of you just wants

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:10.910
to have fun and get
close to people.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.670
And before you have kids,
you have this opportunity

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:16.010
to enjoy the world
with somebody.

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:17.480
And that's a special time.

00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.030
As you go on in life,
it's harder and harder

00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:24.500
to have that opportunity
to just fall in love

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.180
and honor that love.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.609
And so I think as
a young person,

00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:30.650
I was like probably a lot
of people in this room.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:32.240
I was really driven
professionally,

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:35.450
and I put a lot of
pressure on myself.

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:38.720
And I should have just
chilled out and been like,

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:41.420
"it'll work out."

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.230
And I should have honored my
personal side of my life more.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:47.120
Because you don't
get that time back.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.220
You're only like
20 or 25 like once.

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.420
And then it's done.

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:54.370
And so just to
keep that balance.

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.390
But it would have been hard.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:58.010
You know what I mean?

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.720
I had to make a
lot of sacrifices

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:02.330
for my job to be standing
here talking to you guys,

00:58:02.330 --> 00:58:04.670
some of those sacrifices
were probably necessary.

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:10.770
But I think I could have had
a little more perspective.

00:58:10.770 --> 00:58:11.520
And I didn't.

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.675
I was really singularly focused.

00:58:16.374 --> 00:58:18.415
SPEAKER: Well, that's all
we have time for today,

00:58:18.415 --> 00:58:19.956
but thank you so
much for joining us.

00:58:19.956 --> 00:58:21.500
Stick around for a
copy of the book,

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.900
and give him a big
round of applause.

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.350
JEFFREY GETTLEMAN: Thanks, guys.
