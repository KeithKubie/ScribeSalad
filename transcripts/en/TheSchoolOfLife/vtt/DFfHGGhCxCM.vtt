00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
We don't think we hate 
cheap things,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.300
but we frequently behave 
as if we rather do.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.080
Consider the pineapple.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.020
Columbus was the first European to be delighted by its physical grandeur and vibrant sweetness.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.700
He brought some back to Europe,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.080
but pineapples proved extremely difficult to transport and very costly to cultivate.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.480
For a long time, only royalty can  afford to eat them.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.900
Russia's Catherine the Great was a huge fan, as was Charles II of England.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.400
A single fruit in the 17th century sold for today's equivalent of £5000.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.180
The pineapple was so exciting and so loved

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.180
that in 1761, the 4th Earl of Dunmore built a temple on his Scottish estate in its honor,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.600
and Christopher Wren had no hesitation

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.840
in topping the south tower of St. Paul's in London with this evidently divined fruit.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.000
Then, at the very end of the 19th century, two things changed:

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.380
Large commercial plantations of pineapples were established in Hawaii,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.120
and there were huge advances in steam ships technology.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.940
Transport cost plummeted and unwittingly transformed the psychology of pineapple eating.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.360
Today, you can get a pineapple for around £1.50

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.700
It still taste exactly the same,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.120
but now, the pineapple is one of the world's least glamorous fruits.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.920
It's never served smart dinner parties, and it would never be carved on top of a major civic building.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.440
The pineapple itself hasn't changed, only our attitude to it has.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.960
Contemplation the history of the pineapple suggest a curious overlap between love and economics.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.480
When we have to pay a lot for something nice, we appreciate it to the full,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.700
yet, as its price in the market falls, passion has a habit of fading away.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.180
Naturally, if an object  has no merit to begin with, a high-price won't be able to do anything for it.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:57.320
But, if it has a real virtue and yet a low price, then it's in severe danger of falling into neglect.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.900
It's a pattern that we see recurring in a range of areas, for example, with a sight of clouds from above.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.440
In 1927, a hitherto unknown airmail pilot called Charles Lindbergh

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.260
became the first man to complete a solo crossing of the Atlantic in this plane the Spirit of St. Louis.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.620
He was awestruck and felt he was becoming for a time almost god-like.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.780
For most of the 20th century, his experience remained rare and extremely costly.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.620
There was therefore never any danger that the human value of crossing an ocean by air would be overlooked.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.740
But this lasted only until the arrival of the Boeing 747

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.920
and a cheap plane ticket in the summer of 1970.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.340
Now, almost no one looks out of the plane window anymore.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.020
Why then do we associate cheap prices with a lack of value?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.740
Our response seems a hangover from a long pre-industrial past.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.040
For most of human history, there truly was a strong correlation between cost and value.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.860
The higher the price, the better things tended to be,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.720
because it would simply noway both for prices to be low and quality high.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.720
Everything had to be made by hand, by expansively trained artisans

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.340
with raw materials that were immensely difficult to transport.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.140
The expensive sword, jacket, window, or wheelbarrow were simply always the better ones.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.880
This relationship between price and value

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.080
held true in an uninterrupted way until the end of the 18th century,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.740
when, thanks to the industrial revolution, something extremely unusual happened.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.260
Human beings worked out how to make high quality goods at cheap prices

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.160
because of technology and new methods of organizing the labor force.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.900
However, despite the greatness of these efforts,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.700
instead of making wonderful experiences universally available,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.600
industrialization has inadvertently produced a different effect.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.100
It seemed to rob certain experiences of their loveliness, interest, and worth.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.460
It's not, of course, that we refuse to buy inexpensive or cheap things,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.620
it's just that getting excited over cheap things has come to seem a little bizarre.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.560
One is allowed to get very worked up over the eggs of the sturgeon,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.400
£100 for a small pod,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.440
but we have to be very circumscribed by one's enthusiasm for the eggs of a chicken,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.000
12 for £2.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.800
There is an intimidating hierarchy operating in the background

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.180
shaping what we're allowed to be grateful for, and fill that we lack and must have.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.980
The price tells us something very special is going on here,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.240
but it maybe going on in a cheaper thing, too.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.780
How do we reverse this?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.800
The answer lies in a slightly unexpected area:

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.820
the mind of a 4-year-old.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.240
Here he is with the puddle, it started raining an hour ago.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.140
Now, the street is full of puddles, and there could be nothing better in the world,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.840
the riches of the Indies would be nothing next to the pleasures of being able to see the rippling of the water

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.120
created by jumping one's boots.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.760
Eddies and whirlpools, the mind new waves, the oceans beneath one, it's all fascinating.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.840
Children have great advantages.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.860
They don't know what they're supposed to like and they don't understand money

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.680
so price is never a guide of value for them.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.760
They'll spend an hour with 1 button.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.460
One buys them the £49 wooden toy made by Swedish artisans

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.820
and finds that they prefer the cardboard box that it came in.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.380
They prefer the nail and screw section at the DIY shop to the fanciest toy department.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.240
A child might be deeply surprised, even shocked

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.140
to learn that a USB stick can be had for just over £1.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.020
Children would be right if prices were determined by human worth and value.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.220
But they are not, they just reflect what things cost to make.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.500
The pity is therefore, that we do treat them as a guide to what matters,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.620
when this isn't what a financial price should ever be used for.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.960
We can't directly go back to childhood, but we have got people who can help us in this area:

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960
artists.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.280
They are the experts recording and communicating their enthusiasms

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.760
which, like children, can take them in slightly unexpected directions.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.900
The French artist, Paul Cézanne, spent a good deal of the late 19th century

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.980
painting groups of apples in his studio in Provance.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.060
He was thrilled by their texture, shapes, and colors.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.660
He loved the transitions between the yellowy golds and the deep reds across their skins.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.620
Cézanne had all the all-love-and-excitement before the apple

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.360
that aristocrats once had for the pineapple.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.460
Cézanne, in his studio, was generating his own revolution,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.380
not an industrial revolution that would make once costly objects available to everyone,

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.400
but a revolution in appreciation, a far deeper process

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.500
that could get us to notice what we already have to hand.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.380
Instead of reducing prices, he was raising levels of appreciation,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.880
which is a move that's perhaps more precious to us economically

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.040
because it means that we can suddenly get lot more great things for very little money.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.980
We need to rethink our relationship to prices.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.400
We've been looking at prices in a wrong way.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.620
We fetishize them as tokens of intrinsic value.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.240
We've allowed them to set how much excitement we were allowed to have in given areas.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.980
But prices would never meant to be like this.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.160
We're breathing too much life into them,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.720
and therefore darling too many of our responses to the inexpensive world.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.940
We are astonishingly already a good deal richer than we are encouraged to think we are.
