00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:03.439
- [Voiceover] Let F and G
be the functions defined by

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.967
F of X is equal to one plus
X plus E to the X squared

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:10.799
minus two X, and G of
X equal X to the fourth

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.799
minus 6.5X squared plus six X plus two.

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:19.657
Let R and S be the two
regions enclosed by the graphs

00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:23.442
of F and G shown in the figure above.

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:25.938
So here I have the graphs
of the two functions

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:28.759
and they enclose regions R and S.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.245
So the first thing they
want us to figure out

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:35.245
is find the sum of the
areas of region R and S.

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.757
So the sum of those areas,

00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:38.628
you can think about it.

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:41.960
We're going to go from X
equals zero right over here

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.907
to X equals two, so we're
going to take the integral

00:00:45.907 --> 00:00:47.928
from X equals, I'm
going to write this down

00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:52.246
area of R plus S is equal to,

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.557
let me just write that
a little bit neater.

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:59.557
So the area of R plus S
is going to be equal to,

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:04.797
let's see we can take the
integral from X equals zero

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:07.165
to X equals two,

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.418
X equals zero to X equals two,

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:11.147
and what are we going to integrate?

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:13.123
Well we're going to
integrate the difference

00:01:13.123 --> 00:01:14.317
between the two functions

00:01:14.317 --> 00:01:16.116
and really the absolute
value of the difference

00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:17.138
where we want the sums,

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:18.740
we don't want to have negative area here,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.397
we want the sum of the
areas of regions R and S

00:01:22.397 --> 00:01:25.800
and at some point you have
G of X is above F of X

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.994
and at other points F
of X is above G of X,

00:01:27.994 --> 00:01:29.317
but if we take the absolute value,

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:31.523
it doesn't matter which one
we're subtracting from the other

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:33.636
we're just getting the absolute
value of the difference.

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:36.480
So let's take the absolute value of,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.834
the absolute value of F of X minus,

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.735
minus G of X DX.

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:46.441
So that's going to be
the sum of the areas,

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.858
or we could say this is
going to be the integral

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.900
from zero to two of the absolute value

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.900
F of X is one plus X
plus E to the X squared

00:01:56.415 --> 00:02:00.060
minus two X, minus G of X,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.060
so minus X to the fourth,
plus 6.5X squared,

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.454
minus six X minus two.

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:10.308
Do the absolute value.

00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:11.620
DX.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.105
Now this would be pretty hairy to solve

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:14.547
if we did not have access to a calculator

00:02:14.547 --> 00:02:16.790
but lucky for us on
this part of the AP exam

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.054
we can use a graphing calculator,

00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:22.050
so let's do that to evaluate
this definite integral here.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.396
If you're wondering why
I'm seeing minus two

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:25.254
instead of plus two
remember we're substracting,

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:27.008
we're subtracting G of X, we're finding

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:28.377
the difference between them.

00:02:28.377 --> 00:02:32.196
So let's input this
function into my calculator

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:33.288
and I'm going to do it with the same thing

00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:34.589
that I did in part one.

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.830
Where I'm just going to define,

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.409
let me turn it on.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:38.454
All right.

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:41.171
So I'm going to actually clear that out

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:44.410
and I'm going to define this
whole expression as Y one.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.410
So I am going to take the absolute value,

00:02:49.948 --> 00:02:52.689
so let me see where the absolute value

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.868
it's been a little while since
I last used one of these.

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:59.689
So should give me some math,

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.396
math number, oh there you go.

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:04.658
Absolute value, so it's the absolute value

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:09.658
of one plus X, plus 2nd E to the

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.115
and then we have X squared

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:22.115
minus two X and then
close that parenthesis

00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:28.211
and then you have minus
X to the fourth power

00:03:28.772 --> 00:03:33.772
plus 6.5 times X squared minus six times X

00:03:38.373 --> 00:03:41.218
minus two and then we have
to close the parenthesis

00:03:41.218 --> 00:03:42.693
around the absolute value.

00:03:42.693 --> 00:03:44.770
All right, so we inputted Y one

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.257
and so now let's go over here

00:03:46.257 --> 00:03:48.509
and also evaluate this definite integral.

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.214
So we go to math, and then we scroll down

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:56.214
to definite for function integral.

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.996
So click on that and
we're going to use Y one,

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:00.398
so we go to variables,

00:04:00.398 --> 00:04:02.235
we go to the right to go to Y variables,

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.417
which it's a function
variable that we just defined,

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.018
and so we select Y one,

00:04:07.018 --> 00:04:08.401
that's what we just inputted.

00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:11.941
Our variable of integration is X

00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:14.077
and our bounds of integration,

00:04:14.077 --> 00:04:15.633
we'll we're going to go from X equals zero

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:16.817
to X equals two.

00:04:16.817 --> 00:04:19.940
So we go from zero to two

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.038
and then we let the calculator
munch on it a little bit

00:04:24.038 --> 00:04:29.038
and we get, it's taking
some time to calculate,

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:34.417
it's still, it's still munching on it.

00:04:34.417 --> 00:04:39.227
Let's see this is taking
a good bit of time.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.444
There you ago, all right,
so it's approximately 2.00,

00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:46.617
if you want to get a
little bit more precise,

00:04:46.617 --> 00:04:48.126
2.004.

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:53.126
So this is approximately 2.004.
