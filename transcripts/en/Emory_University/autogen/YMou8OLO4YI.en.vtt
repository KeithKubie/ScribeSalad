people of interest who will also begin
to understand that population and as we

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409
to understand that population and as we
 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.249
to understand that population and as we
spread that out then we can help change

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259
spread that out then we can help change
 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.809
spread that out then we can help change
the world which is of course our big

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819
the world which is of course our big
 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:23.960
the world which is of course our big
