Okay. The ranking order for correlation of these graphs,

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.810
would be graph number three is the strongest correlation. Graph

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.160
number one is the next strongest correlation. Graph number four

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.920
has the next strongest correlation And the second graph has

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.870
the weakest correlation. Now think about this with me for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.930
just a second. Think about why this is. What we're

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.060
going to do is measure a couple of points in

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.070
our graph. Take a look at our strongest correlating graph.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.350
You see if we go over to any given point,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.360
we come down at about the same place. On the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.050
horizontal axis, on the x axis. The y axis and

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.480
the x axis values are roughly the same for each point.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.660
They're pretty close together. They're a match. And now notice

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.020
that in our weakest correlated graph, that if we go to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.310
any given point, wow, we're kind of all over the

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.090
place, right? I mean, we have a relatively high height for

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.360
twin two here, but that point goes down to a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.630
relatively low height for twin one. So that wasn't a

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.460
very high match. We do the same thing here. We

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.190
had a lower height for twin two, and a really high

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.209
height for twin one at that point. So these are

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.640
not correlating very well, and this is the graphical representation

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.470
of that. If you have any trouble, you should definitely

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.320
check out the Udacity course on statistics, co-taught by Katie Kormanik.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.190
And also go to the discussion forums for this video and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.620
see if you can get some advice or help from your classmates.
