00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.933
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, oh, it actually sounds like Susan is ready with the next event. And that's

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.270
Depth Perception. Susan, over to you.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.730
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, some of our sensees are off preparing for the next event. Shortly,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.430
they're going to be asked a series of questions to determine their depth

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.665
perception.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.203
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And Susan, can you explain to our viewers at home what you mean by depth

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:19.292
perception? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right.

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:23.805
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Depth perception is our ability to perceive how far away something is from us.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.695
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it's all because we have two eyes, right.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:32.515
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sure, some of our depth perception cues are binocular, meaning two eye cues.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:35.587
The idea here is that each of our eyes takes in the slightly different version

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:40.277
of the world, and our brain puts that information together. However, not all of

00:00:40.277 --> 00:00:43.020
our depth perception cues are binocular.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.985
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sorry, Susan. It looks like the competition is about to start.

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:48.832
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we're going to let our viewers at home participate in this event, too. So,

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:50.800
we'll get back to you with the results in just a minute.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.080
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right, Lauren. So, we're going to show our viewers at home the same

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.137
questions that are being shown to our contestants. So, sit back, enjoy, and see

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.467
how you do on the depth perception event in

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:02.693
[UNKNOWN].
