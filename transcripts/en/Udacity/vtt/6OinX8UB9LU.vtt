00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.939
Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disorder that has a genetic association

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:12.260
with variations in the NOD2 or nod two gene. One mutation in the NOD2

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.910
gene inserts a Cytosine or C at position 3,020 of the coding region as shown

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.254
right here. Before the mutation, the amino acid sequence is Q-A-L-E-R-N,

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:30.660
which would be: glutamine or Gln; alanine or Ala; leucine

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.066
or Leu; glutamate or Glu; arginine or Arg, and asparagine

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:40.950
or Asn. So what will the resulting amino acid sequence be after the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.130
mutation? I want you to write your answer in the text box here. And I want you

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.570
to use the single letter abbreviations for amino

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.350
acids. Obviously if you need to use the genetic

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.370
code please use it. It's embedded on this page

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.820
and you can also find the link to it.
