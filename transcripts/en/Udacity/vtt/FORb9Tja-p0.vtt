00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.460
Let's get some more practice working with data frames. You downloaded

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.830
an R script earlier and saw how we can save our

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.810
work and run an R code from it. For your next

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.010
task, you're going to download an RMD file and run code in

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.720
it. You can download the RMD file from the link in

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.850
the instructor notes. The file will look something like this. Notice

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.260
how this file is slightly different from the file that you

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.210
saw before. An R script can only have R code and comments.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.130
This file, however, the RMD file, allows us to do

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.560
so much more. It's an R Markdown document, or RMD.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.110
Now, you might be wondering what R Markdown is. And

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.350
basically, it's a simple formatting language that let's us author web

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.790
pages. If you want to know all you can do with

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.020
Markdown then go to Help and then go to Markdown Quick

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.210
Reference. This would bring up the documentation for Markdown, and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.080
you can scroll through some of the examples in the formatting.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.660
We've also included a video in the instructor notes that will

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.810
go through Markdown. So far this file only contains text that

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.830
will be formatted using Markdown. Let's add some R code to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.530
this. We can do this by clicking on Chunks and then

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.198
going to Insert Chunk. Now if you're friendly with the keyboard,

00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:10.921
you can use the shortcut Cmd+Option+I. There's many other shortcuts in

00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.475
here and you can see them here in this menu. Here

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:16.284
I've added some code to see what this data set is.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:19.164
This is the cars data set that also comes with R,

00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:23.628
and it contains 50 observations of speeding and stopping distances for

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:26.829
cars in the 1920s. I'm going to add this text as the

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.447
title to this document, so that way it's more descriptive of my

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:32.916
file. I'll also run the Str command on this data frame,

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:35.012
so that way I can see what's inside of it. It looks

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:38.261
like I have two variables, speed and distance, which are measured

00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:41.390
in miles per hour and feet. Not only can we run R

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.310
code and get the output from these files, we can

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.090
also embed images. This plot function comes with a base

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.130
graphics package in R. But don't worry learning more about

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.180
it. We'll be using the ggplot2 package which is

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.220
a powerful graphics language in the coming lessons. When I

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.555
run this code I get a simple plot of speed

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:02.550
versus distance. Now, what's really amazing about this document is

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.470
that we can click the Knit HTML button. This will generate

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.620
a web page that includes both content, as well as the output

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.650
of any embedded R code. This simple button allows us to easily

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.010
share and publish our work. That's enough about RMD files. Let's have

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.310
you work in one now. Download the RMD file if you haven't already,

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.760
and run and write code when you're prompted to do so. At

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.490
the end of the file, you'll come across a question. I want you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.390
to answer that question for this next quiz. And then you can

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.300
continue on with the rest of the lesson. Good luck and have fun.
