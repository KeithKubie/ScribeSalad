00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.260
In this day and age, parallelism has

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.600
become fundamental to computer systems. Any general purpose

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.540
CPU chip, has multiple cores in it.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.700
Every general purpose operating system is designed to

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.180
take advantage of such hardware parallelism. In

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.480
this unit, we will study the basic algorithms

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.800
for synchronization, communication, and scheduling, in a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.230
shared memory multiprocessor. Leading up to the structure

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.020
of the operating system for parallel machines.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.150
We'll start today's lecture with a discussion

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.020
of the model of a parallel machine. A shared memory multi-processor, or a shared

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.920
memory machine we can think of three

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.710
different structures for this shared memory machine.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.460
The first structure is what we call a dance hall architecture and a dance

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.770
hall architecture is one in which you have CPUs on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.050
one side and the memory on the other side of an

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.590
interconnection network and let me say something that is common

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.640
to all the three structures that I'm going to describe to

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.340
you. The common things are that in every one of

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.420
these structures, there's going to be CPUs and there going to be memory,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.820
and there's going to be an interconnection network. And the key

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.980
thing is it's a shared memory machine. What that means is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.550
that the entire address space defined by the memories is

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.930
accessible from any of the CPUs. So that's one common

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.760
thing that you see in all the three styles that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.020
I'm going to talk to you about. And in addition to that,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.310
you'll see that there is a cache that is associated

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.810
with each of these CPUs. So there's a Dance Hall

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.550
Architecture. And the next style is what is called an

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.390
SMP architecture, or a Symmetric multiprocessor. Here what you see is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.370
the interconnection network hat I showed you from the

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.510
dance hall architecture. I simplified it considerably, showing a

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.380
simple bus. A system bus that connects all the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.700
CPU's to talk to the main memory. And and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.620
it is symmetric because the access time from any

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.450
of the CPUs to memory is the same. And

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.780
that's the idea of the system bus that allows

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.480
all of these CPUs to talk to the main memory.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.080
The other thing that you'll notice that I already

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.100
mentioned is that every CPU comes equipped with a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.150
cache and we'll talk more about the shared memory

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.770
machine, the caches in a minute. So the third style

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.670
of architecture is what is called a distributor shared

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.880
memory architecture. So in this distributor shared memory architecture what

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.700
you have, or DSM for short, is that. You

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.720
have memory and a piece of memory that is associated

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.600
with each CPU. At the same time each CPU is able to access all of

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.020
the memories through the interconnection network. It

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.250
is just that the access to memory that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.240
is close to this guy is going to be obviously faster than trying to access

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.930
memory that is farther from here that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.860
has to be accessed from the interconnection network.
