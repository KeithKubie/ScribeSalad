[inaudible]
they're at the door!

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:15.473
[jingling]

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.522
Royal guards!

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.481
Attack!

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.859
[shouting]

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:29.821
[screaming]

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:37.036
Behind you!

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:39.414
[shouting]

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.874
Come on!

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.633
[shouting]

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.217
Shut the door!

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:56.014
Brace the doors!

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.984
[inaudible].

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:10.695
What is it?

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:11.279
Gawain.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.662
Knights of Saint Lazarus,
for your attempt to raise arms

00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:25.376
against King Philip, you are
now declared enemies of France,

00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:30.715
along with everyone you harbor,
including the Knights Templar.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.803
[shouting]

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:40.183
Are those all your weapons?

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.976
We're not accustomed
to spilling blood

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.436
in a house of Christ.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.021
Be grateful we have this many.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.232
We should bring the
fight to them instead

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.067
of waiting for the inevitable.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.194
I count 20 men
along this wall.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.862
That's 50 total.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.531
They'll slaughter us
one by one, with archers

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.075
trained on the door.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:59.410
We'd be fools.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.829
Unless they want us alive.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.207
I'll give my life before
I'll be taken prisoner.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.041
Never again.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.089
I'm sorry, Landry,
for all of this.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:12.966
I never should have
involved the Templars.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.051
We've always
fought side by side.

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.594
Tonight we'll die side by side.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.054
It won't come to that.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.014
You've seen how
many men there are.

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.516
We've no way out.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.811
God will provide
us with a way.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.647
Take cover!

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.774
Let's go!

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:30.483
Stand!

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.067
Quickly!

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.697
[inaudible] windows.

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:36.990
Gabriel!

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.117
God has provided
us with an answer!

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.244
There's too many!

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.413
[shouting]

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.873
Charge!

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.881
[shouting]

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:58.344
[shouting]

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.777
[screaming]

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.245
Gawain!

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.676
[shouting]

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.145
[shouting]

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.255
What is the meaning of this?

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:22.553
What's happened?

00:04:22.553 --> 00:04:23.972
Landry.
