00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:00.970
Let's see.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.790
Sixty percent.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.370
I'm going to write 60.0 just
make it a little easier for me.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.810
Them I'm going to move the decimal
place two to the left.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.030
So now it's point six.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.820
I always like to include a zero before,
so I'm going to call it 0.6.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.510
And you may have included
a zero here as well.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.329
It actually doesn't matter.
