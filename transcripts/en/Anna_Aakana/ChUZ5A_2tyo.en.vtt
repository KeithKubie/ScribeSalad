00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.040
I deeply trust in my intuition.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.400
- You're pregnant.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.960
It's a food baby.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.020
- I also practice manifestation and spell casting.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.020
- Chris Evans, come to me.....

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.700
- And it is literal magic.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.780
For example, last week.
- I've always wanted to work with Calvin Klein,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.050
so I figure, why not take some photos, tag them on the 'gram, let the universe see that I'm here,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.400
I'm queer, and I'm down to work with my favorite under...wear.
- [Yess...]

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.200
- And the next day Calvin Klein reached out.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.860
So thank you to Calvin Klein for sponsoring today's video

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.760
and to the universe for working your magic, per usual.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.720
I'm so excited to say that I speak my truth in my Calvin's.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.320
And in thinking about my truth

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.060
I realized that one thing cats and I do not have in common.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.680
Cats love boxes.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.800
...I don't get it.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.100
- One thing that people love to do is to put you in a box.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.740
I mean, it's what the brain does right? Compartmentalize.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.540
And though it's great for like neurons to categorize and differentiate information,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.000
it is not so great for our artistic lives

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.240
And even if you're not an artist, I encourage you to listen to your gut

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.980
about the kinds of things you want to explore.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.980
- Yeah, you know people joke about underwater basket-weaving, but

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560
it's not a joke to me.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.900
It's never been a joke to me.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.610
- I have a reputation for doing a lot: acting, stand-up, music, writing, directing, illustration, poetry, stop-motion...

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.240
and I was worried that maybe my passion was a little all over the place

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.120
- She said I was a jack of all trades master of none, and it's really bothering me.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.700
Like I'm just always, kind of like, gone after whatever seemed like really fun, you know?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.460
Should I stop doing that? Would I be more successful if I just focused on one thing?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.480
- You do know the full quote, right?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.280
- What?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.120
- Well the full quote is "Jack of all trades, master of none,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.240
often times better than master of one."

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.860
So if you take the full thing in context, it's actually better to be a jack of all trades.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.120
*scoff*

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.680
- ooOh

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.700
- And in stepping back and really thinking about it,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.000
I realize that all of my exploration really boils down to one thing.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.960
Ultimately, I see myself as someone who turns their pain into art,

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.940
and different mediums and platforms not only offer a variety of opportunities to do just that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.440
but by constantly seeking new and challenging ways to express myself,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.420
I feel more like myself.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.840
I have a friend named Katie who inspired me so much in my early 20s.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.420
Katie was always trying something new.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.740
She trained with the circus, then she got her pilot license,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.580
then she was doing burlesque dancing.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.310
She taught herself how to knit,

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.840
dabbled in pottery, and the last time I talked to her

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.720
she was working with charities that helped exotic animals internationally,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.080
so she got to pet tigers.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.640
And though Katie did so many different weird, awesome things

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.080
that seemed super random, in the decade that I've known her,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.619
I have never met anyone who is more authentically themselves,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.600
and I think it's specifically because Katie does not hold back

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.280
with trying different things,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.640
and with every new adventure she has,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.160
the more centered she becomes in who she is.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.660
So don't be afraid to explore your creative impulses,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.580
to listen to your intuition about what excites you,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.100
and to cast a spell every once in a while.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.540
- Chris Evans, hear my call.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.160
Chris Evans, let me pet your dog.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.680
Dodger looks real cute though.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.420
- Thank you so much to Calvin Klein for sponsoring today's video.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.720
I speak my truth in my Calvin's.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.620
I am a jack-of-all-trades.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.880
I wore a bunch of Calvin Klein in today's video

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.620
including Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein underwear.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.260
You can check out those and more styles on calvinklein.com
