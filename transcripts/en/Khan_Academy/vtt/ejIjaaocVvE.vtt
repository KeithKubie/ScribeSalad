00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.120
We're on problem 68.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.990
And they want to know, what
is the average arithmetic

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.890
mean of j and k?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.960
So essentially, if we knew what
they were, you could take

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.630
j plus k, and divide by 2, and
you'd know their average.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.250
What is statement one?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.800
Statement one tells us the
average of j plus 2, and k

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.920
plus 4, is 11.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.170
So this is interesting.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.240
So means that j plus 2, plus
k plus 4, over 2-- I'm just

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.110
averaging the two numbers--
they're telling us that that

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.380
is equal to 11.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.270
And remember, the question
they're asking is the average

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.050
of j and k.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.330
So if we could just figure out
what j plus k, over 2 is equal

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.280
to, we're done.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.230
Or, if we just knew what j
plus k is, we were done.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.790
Maybe we could figure
that out from this.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.470
Let's see if we can simplify.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.300
This simplifies to j plus
k, plus 6, over

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.930
2, is equal to 11.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.790
This simplifies to j plus k,
over 2, plus 3, right?

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.860
So plus 6 over 2.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.630
I'm just taking the
6 over 2 out.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.820
So plus 6 over 2,
is equal to 11.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.480
So then we get j plus k,
over 2 is equal to 8.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.120
And we're done.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.240
The average of j and k is 8.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.740
We're done.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.870
Statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.400
Let's see what statement
number two does for us.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.280
Statement number two says the
average of jk and 14 is 10.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.265
I suspect we're going
to be able to do

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:54.550
the exact same thing.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.220
So the average of j plus k,
plus 14-- so now we're

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.810
averaging three numbers--
is equal to 10.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.810
And here, we should be
able to figure out

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.729
what j plus k is again.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.420
We don't have a convenient 2 in
the denominator anymore, so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.750
let's just solve for j plus k.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.520
So then you get j plus k, plus
14-- multiply both sides by

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.380
3-- is equal to 30.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.540
And then you get j plus
k is equal to what?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.630
Subtract 14 from both sides,
is equal to 16.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.550
And then if you wanted to figure
out the average of the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.640
two, you just divide
both sides by 2.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.850
And you get j plus k over
2 is equal to 8.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.350
So each statement alone
was sufficient

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.670
to solve this problem.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.100
Next problem.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.400
I feel a sneeze coming on.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.850
This is not happening.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.020
All right.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.730
Where was I?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.560
Problem 69.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.670
Let me move the scroll
bar up all the way.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.040
Paula and Sandy were among those
people who sold raffle

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.670
tickets to raise money
for club x.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.180
If Paula and Sandy sold a total
of 100 of the tickets,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.600
how many of the tickets
did Paula sell?

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.910
OK, so essentially they're
telling us Paula plus Sandy

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.620
sold 100 tickets.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.570
And they want us to figure out
how many did Paula sell?

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.250
Where P is the number Paula
sold, and S is the number

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.080
Sandy sold.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.050
Problem number one.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.060
Sandy sold 2/3 as many of the
raffle tickets as Paula did.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.860
So Sandy is equal to
2/3 times Paula.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.270
Well, this alone
is sufficient.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.890
We have one equation of two
unknowns, and now we have

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.990
another equation of the
same two unknowns.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.170
These are both linear
equations.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.920
So we have two equations
of two unknowns.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.990
We can easily now solve
for S and P.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.410
And maybe I'll do it, but you
should just already recognize

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.970
that this is sufficient
if you're on the GMAT.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.510
And we'll solve it, just
to do it after this.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.620
Sandy sold 8% of all
the raffle tickets

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.410
sold for club x.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.950
All right.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.900
Now, this is a little
different.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:14.460
This is Sandy is equal to 8%
of not all the tickets that

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.360
Sandy and Paula sold,
she sold 8% of the

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.740
total that club x sold.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.900
So this is a different number,
because there could have

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.260
been-- I might have been in club
x selling raffle tickets.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.520
So we don't know how
many I sold.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.940
So we don't know what this
total number is.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.590
So there's not much we can do
with it, because there's no

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.810
way for us to figure out
this total number.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.850
So this is not that useful.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.870
So statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.150
And just to prove the point to
you-- we're trying to figure

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.270
out what Paula sold.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.690
So let's just substitute
this back in.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.890
So you have P plus--
for S I'll write

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.530
2/3P-- is equal to 100.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.980
And so this is 5/3P
is equal to 100.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.970
Just added 1 plus 2/3,
or 3/3 plus 2/3.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.590
And then you have P is equal
to 3/5 times 100, which is

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.240
equal to 60.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.250
So that's how many she sold.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.740
So we would definitely be able
figure it out, but this

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.900
would've been a waste of
time if you were taking

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.940
the GMAT for real.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.970
You should have just recognized
two linear

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.110
equations and two unknowns.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.850
I'm done.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.100
Next problem, 70.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.820
Is ax equal to 3 minus bx?

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.780
Who knows?

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.130
[? Problem ?]

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.170
statement number one.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.740
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.250
Statement number one tells
us, x times a, plus

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.090
b is equal to 3.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.410
Well, that's essentially the
same thing as this top

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.110
equation, right?

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.360
Let me show you.

00:05:56.685 --> 00:06:03.160
x times a, that's ax, plus
bx is equal to 3.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.720
And then subtract bx
from both sides.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.650
You get ax is equal to 3 minus
bx, which is exactly what we

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.480
were trying to prove.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.960
So if this is true, then this
is definitely true.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.330
Statement one alone
is sufficient.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:26.020
Statement two tells us, a equals
b, equals 1.5, and x is

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.690
equal to 1.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.400
Well, let's see if
this is true.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.040
So a is-- you have
1.5 times 1.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:39.250
So you have 1.5 is equal to
3, minus 1.5 times 1.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.490
So 3 minus 1.5.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.460
Well, this is true.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.450
1.5 is equal to 3 minus
1.5, is 1.5.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.110
So two alone is also
sufficient.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.210
So the answer is D.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.050
Each statement alone
is sufficient

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.140
to solve this problem.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.140
71.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.390
Let me switch colors.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.510
A number of people each wrote
down one of the first 30

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.100
positive integers.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.700
Were any of the integers written
down by more than one

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.870
of the people?

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.250
All right.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.040
That's interesting.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.290
So are there any repeats?

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.400
A number of people.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.560
So clearly if we had more than
30 people and they all had to

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.720
pick one of the first 30
integers, then you're going to

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.320
have repeats.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.870
But let's see what
they tell us.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.740
The number of people who wrote
down an integer was

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.440
greater than 40.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.690
Well, there you go.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.270
So 40 people each have to pick
a number between-- one of the

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.130
first 30 positive
integers, right?

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.430
So they only have a pool
of 30 to pick from.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.360
So if 40 people have to pick
numbers from a pool of 30

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.320
numbers, there's definitely
going to be repeats, right?

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.100
So even if the first 30 people
all picked different numbers,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.320
which we cannot guarantee by
any means, the next 10 are

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.820
going to have to repeat
with somebody.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.090
Because all of the first 30
would've already been picked.

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.710
And you could very easily
have even more repeats.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:10.050
So statement number one
is very sufficient.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.780
Statement number two.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.360
The number of people who
wrote down an integer

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.660
was less than 70.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.020
Well, that's useless.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.630
I mean, by this statement, maybe
only one person wrote

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.160
down an integer, right?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.290
And if only one person wrote
down an integer, we definitely

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.670
don't have any repeats because
there's no one to repeat with.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.390
So this is a useless
statement.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.110
So statement one alone is
sufficient and statement two

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.140
is useless.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.100
73.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.520
I think there should be a third
option, where you can

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.820
rate the degree of uselessness
of a statement.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.480
Some of them borderline on
almost being useful, some of

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.460
them are ridiculous,
like this one.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.360
OK, 73.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.450
72.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.340
In the figure above, is
CD greater than BC?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.600
So they drew us a number
line, or whatever you

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.630
want to call it.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.195
Some type of a line.

00:09:04.195 --> 00:09:07.050
Let me do another color.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.910
This end we have A.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.530
Then we have B.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.700
Then we have C.

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.500
And then we have D.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.990
In the figure above, is
CD-- so this is CD--

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:25.500
greater than BC?

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.280
So they want to know is this
greater than this?

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.230
So is CD greater than BC?

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.420
All right.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.540
So number one, they tell us
that AD is equal to 20.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.900
So this whole thing
is equal to 20.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.840
So that doesn't help me much.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.540
Statement number one tells
us AD is equal to 20.

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.770
It just tells me the
whole length.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.710
Maybe I can get some
more information.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:53.530
Statement number two.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.220
AB is equal to CD.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.290
So this is interesting.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:09.530
They're telling us that
this is equal to this.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.750
But this still doesn't
help us, right?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.940
I can imagine a situation where
both of these are--

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.810
let's say that both
of these are 5.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.050
That could be 5, that
could be 5.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.100
And then this would
be 10, right?

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.890
5 plus 10, plus 5.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.260
In which case, CD would not
be greater than BC, right?

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.540
So this would be a situation
that meets all of the

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.120
conditions where CD would
not be greater than BC.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.060
But then I can construct one
where it is greater than BC.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:44.290
I can make CD equal to--
what if that was 8?

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.960
And then this one also
has to be 8.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.500
And then we would only
have 4 left.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.430
Where CD is greater than BC.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.720
So in this case, both statements
together are still

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.550
not sufficient.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.530
So the answer is E.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.540
And I've run out of time.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.580
I'll see in the next video.
