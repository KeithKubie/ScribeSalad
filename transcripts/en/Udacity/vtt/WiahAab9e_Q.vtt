Cache and Network rays,
sometimes referred to as fastest,

00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:09.796
request the resource from both
the cache and the network in parallel,

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:13.300
then it responds with
whichever returns first.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.210
Usually this will be the cached
version if there is one.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.480
This strategy will always make a network
request, even if the resource is cached.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.950
But, if or when the network request
completes the cache is updated so

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.020
that future cache reads will
always be more up to date.
