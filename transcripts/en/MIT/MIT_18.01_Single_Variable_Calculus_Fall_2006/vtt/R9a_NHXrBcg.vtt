00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.570
PROFESSOR: Today we're going to
hold off just a little bit

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.250
on boiling water.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.020
And talk about another
application of integrals, and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.030
we'll get to the witches'
cauldron in the middle.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.230
The that I'd like to start with
today is average value.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.620
This is something that I
mentioned a little bit

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.290
earlier, and there was a
misprint on the board, so I

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.980
want to make sure that we have
the definitions straight.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.770
And also the reasoning
straight.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.090
This is one of the most
important applications of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.840
integrals, one of the most
important examples.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.300
If you take the average
of a bunch of numbers,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.420
that looks like this.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.500
And we can view this as
sampling a function.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.570
As we would with
Riemann's sum.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.070
And what I said last week was
that this tends to this

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.960
expression here, which is called
the continuous average.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:43.550
So this guy is the continuous
average.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.270
Or just the average of f.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.490
And I want to explain that, just
to make sure that we're

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.380
all on the same page.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.530
In general, if you have a
function and you want to

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.770
interpret the integral, our
first interpretation was that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.860
it's something like the
area under the curve.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.440
But average value is another
reasonable interpretation.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.450
Namely, if you take equally
spaced points here, starting

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.520
with x0, x1, x2, all the way
up to xn, which is the left

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.320
point b, and then we have values
y1, which = f ( x1),

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:43.040
y2, which = f ( x2), all the way
up to yn, which = f ( xn).

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.190
And again, the spacing here
that we're talking

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.690
about is b - a / n.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.640
So remember that spacing,
that's going to be the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.100
connection that we'll draw.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:08.440
Then the Riemann sum is y1
through yn, the sum of (y1 ...

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.080
yn) delta x.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.680
And that's what tends, as delta
x goes to 0, to the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.400
integral. .

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.300
The only change in point of view
if I want to write this

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.180
limiting property, which is
right above here, the only

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.340
change between here and here
is that I want to divide by

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.850
the length of the
interval. b - a.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.000
So I will divide
by b - a here.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.230
And divide by b - a over here.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.510
And then I'll just check what
this thing actually is.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.560
Delta x / b - a, what
is that factor?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.930
Well, if we look over here to
what delta x is, if you divide

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.040
by b - a, it's 1 / n.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.210
So the factor delta
x / b - a = 1 / n.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.210
That's what I put over here, the
sum of y1 through yn / n.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.860
And as this tends to
0, it's the same

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.760
as n going to infinity.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.610
Those are the same things.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.450
The average value and
the integral are

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.460
very closely related.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.130
There's only this difference
that we're dividing by the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.440
length of the interval.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.810
I want to give an example
which is an incredibly

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.800
simpleminded one, but it'll
come into play later on.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.040
So let's take the example
of a constant.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.730
And this is, I hope, will make
you slightly less confused

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.540
about what I just wrote.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.170
As well as making you think that
this is as simpleminded

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.370
and reasonable as
it should be.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.310
If I check what the average
value of this constant is,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.680
it's given by this relatively
complicated formula here.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.170
That is, I have to integrate
the function c.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.570
Well, it's just the
constant c.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.320
And however you do this, as an
antiderivative I was thinking

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.560
of it as a rectangle, the answer
that you're going to

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.310
get is c here.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:19.490
So work that out.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.730
The answer is c.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.320
And so the fact that the average
of c = c, which had

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.280
better be the case for averages,
explains the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.760
denominator.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.690
Explains the 1 / b - a there.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.190
That's cooked up exactly so that
the average of a constant

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.230
is what it's supposed to be.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.250
Otherwise we have the wrong
normalizing factor.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.450
We've clearly got a piece of
nonsense on our hands.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.580
And incidentally, it also
explains the 1 / n in the very

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.460
first formula that
I wrote down.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.380
The reason why this is called
the average, or one reason why

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.400
it's the right thing, is that if
you took the same constant

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.020
c, for y all the way across
there n times, if you divide

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.930
it by n, you get back c.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.770
That's what we mean by average
value and that's

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:11.370
why the n is there.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.960
So that was an easy example.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.830
Now none of the examples that we
are going to give are going

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.000
to be all that complicated.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.460
But they will get sort of
steadily more sophisticated.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:35.930
The second example is going to
be the average height of a

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:47.860
point on a semicircle.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.800
And maybe I'll draw a picture of
the semicircle first here.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.930
And we'll just make
it the standard

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.840
circle, the unit circle.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.890
So maybe I should have called
it a unit semicircle.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.680
This is the point negative
1, this is the point 1.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.690
And we're picking a point over
here and we're going to take

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.210
the typical, or the average,
height here.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.550
Integrating with
respect to dx.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.770
So sort of continuously
with respect to dx.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.030
Well, what is that?

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.380
Well, according to the rule,
it's 1 / b - a times - sorry,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.470
it's up here in the box.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.080
1 / b - a, the interval from
a to b, f ( x) dx.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.460
That's 1 / + 1 - (- 1).

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:45.240
The integral from - 1 to 1,
square root of 1 - x ^2 dx.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.727
Right, because the height is y
= , this is y = the square

00:07:52.727 --> 00:07:57.260
root of 1 - x^2.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.990
And to evaluate this is not as
difficult as it seems. This is

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.950
1/2 times this quantity
here, which we can

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.940
interpret as an area.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.520
It's the area of
the semicircle.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:20.310
So this is the area of the
semicircle, which we know to

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.730
be half the area
of the circle.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.700
So it's pi / 2.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:35.500
And so the answer, here the
average height, is pi/ 4.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.670
Now, later in the class and
actually not in this unit,

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:40.660
we'll actually be able
to calculate the

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.910
antiderivative of this.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:44.440
So in other words, we'll be
able to calculate this

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.090
analytically.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.980
For right now we just have the
geometric reason why the value

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.190
of this is pi / 2.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.620
And we'll do that in the fourth
unit when we do a lot

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.140
of techniques of integration.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.290
So here's an example.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.770
Turns out, the average height
of this is pi / 4.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.660
Now, the next example that I
want to give introduces a

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.440
little bit of confusion.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.750
And I'm not going to resolve
this confusion completely, but

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:15.870
I'm going to try to get
you used to it.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:22.770
I'm going to take the average
height again.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:33.690
But now, with respect
to arc length.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.250
Which is usually
denoted theta.

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.590
Now, this brings
up an extremely

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.080
important feature of averages.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.120
Which is that you have to
specify the variable with

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.290
respect to which the average
is taking place.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.870
And the answer will
be different

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.620
depending on the variable.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.060
So it's not going
to be the same.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.130
Wow, can't spell the
word length here.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.230
Just like the plural of
witches the last time.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:03.150
We'll work on that.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:10.190
We'll fix all of our,
that's an ancient

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.410
Gaelic word, I think.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.560
Lengh.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.190
So now, let me show you that
it's not quite the same here.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.830
It's especially exaggerated if
maybe I shift this little

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.440
interval dx over to the
right-hand end.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.450
And you can see that the
little portion that

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.930
corresponds to it, which is
the d theta piece, has a

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.130
different length from
the dx piece.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.620
And indeed, as you come down
here, these very short

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.920
portions of dx length
have much longer

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.770
portions of theta length.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:51.760
So that the average that we're
taking when we do it with

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.060
respect to theta, is going to
emphasize the low values more.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.090
They're going to be
more exaggerated.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:02.080
And the average should
be lower than the

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.030
average that we got here.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.880
So we should expect a
different number.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.950
And it's not going to be
pi / 4, it's going to

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:07.850
be something else.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.170
Whatever it is, it should
be smaller than pi / 4.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.200
Now, let's set up
the integral.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.100
The integral follows
the same rule.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.870
It's just 1 over the length
of the interval times the

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.390
integral over the interval
of the function.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.480
That's the integral, but now
where does theta range?

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.430
This time, theta goes
from 0 to pi.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.990
So the integral is
from 0 to pi.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:40.140
And the thing we divide
by is pi.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.710
And the integration requires
us to know the

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.160
formula for the height.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.410
Which is sin theta.

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.680
In terms of theta, of course.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.710
It's the same as square root of
- x^2, but it's expressed

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.360
in terms of theta.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.200
So it's this.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.340
And here's our average.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.210
I'll put this up here.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:09.010
So that's the formula
for the height.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.810
So let's work it out.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.050
This one, we have the advantage
of being able to

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.920
work out because we know the
antiderivative of sin theta.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:25.530
It happens with this factor
of pi, it's - cos theta.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:35.730
And so, that's - 1 / pi ( cos
pi), sorry. (cos pi - cos) 0.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:47.340
Which is - 1 / pi ( -
2), which is 2 / pi.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:54.840
And sure enough, if you check
it, you'll see that 2 / pi &lt;

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:02.250
pi / 4, because pi^2 &gt; 8.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:02.980
Yeah, question.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.700
PROFESSOR: The question is
how do I get sin theta.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:16.080
And the answer is, on this
diagram, if theta is over here

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.090
then this height is this, and
this is the angle theta, then

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.790
the height is the sine.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:26.600
OK.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.320
Another question.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.160
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:41.350
PROFESSOR: The question is,
what is the first one, the

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.490
first one is an average of
height, of a point on a

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:51.310
semicircle and this one
is with respect to x.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.290
So what this reveals is that
it's ambiguous to say what the

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:57.280
average value of something is,
unless you've explained what

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.200
the underlying averaging
variable is.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:08.140
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.950
PROFESSOR: The next question
is how should you interpret

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.860
this value.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.250
That is, what came out
of this calculation?

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:22.560
And the answer is only
sort of embedded in

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.050
this calculation itself.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.980
So here's a way of thinking of
it which is anticipating our

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.730
next subject.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.520
Which is probability.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.950
Which is, suppose you
picked a number at

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.660
random in this interval.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.440
With equal likelihood, one
place and another.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.080
And then you saw what height
was above that.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.970
That would be the interpretation
of this first

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:45.290
average value.

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:47.950
And the second one is, I picked
something at random on

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.110
this circle.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.240
And equally likely, any possible
point on this circle

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.970
according to its length.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.180
And then I ask what the height
of that point is.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:04.670
And those are just
different things.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.460
Another question.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.510
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.340
PROFESSOR: Cos pi, shouldn't
it be 0?

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.830
No. cos of, it's - 1.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.440
Cos pi = - 1.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:25.110
Cosine, sorry.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.240
No, cos 0 = 1. cos pi = - 1.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.540
And so they cancel.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.600
That is, they don't cancel.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.880
It's - 1 - 1, which = - 2.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.120
Key point.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.330
Yeah.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:49.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.260
PROFESSOR: All right,
let me repeat.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:57.620
So the question was to repeat
the reasoning by which I

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.170
guessed in advance that probably
this was going to be

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.910
the relationship between the
average value with respect to

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.130
arc length versus the average
value with respect to this

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.790
horizontal distance.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.110
And it had to do with
the previous way

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.980
this diagram was drawn.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.920
Which is comparing an
interval in dx with

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.800
an interval in theta.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.780
A little section in theta.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.530
And when you're near the top,
they're nearly this same.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.430
That is, it's more
or less balanced.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.340
It's a little curved here,
a little different.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.010
But here it becomes
very exaggerated.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.390
The d theta lengths are much
longer than the dx lengths.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.450
Which means that importance
given by the theta of variable

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.130
to these parts of the
circle is larger,

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.930
relative to these parts.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.830
Whereas if you look at this
section versus this section

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.720
for the dx, they give
equal weights to

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.090
these two equal lengths.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.320
But here, with respect to theta,
this is relatively

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.090
short and this is much larger.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:05.960
So, as I say, the theta
variable's emphasizing the

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.140
lower parts of the
semicircle more.

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.070
That's because this length
is shorter and

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:12.340
this length is longer.

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.130
Whereas these two
are the same.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.110
It's a balancing act of
the relative weights.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.290
I'm going to say that again
in a different way,

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.320
and maybe this will.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:31.810
The lower part is more
important for theta.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:32.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.930
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
but shouldn't it have a bigger

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.920
value because it's
a longer length.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.620
Never with averages.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.540
Whatever the length is,
we're always dividing.

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.760
We're always compensating
by the total.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.410
We have the integral from 0 to
pi, but we're dividing by pi.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.060
Here we had the integral
from - 1 to 1, but

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.760
we're dividing by 2.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.220
So we divide by something
different each time.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.850
And this is very,
very important.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.550
It's that the average of a
constant is that same constant

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.070
regardless of which
one we did.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:00.930
So if it were a constant, we
would always compensate for

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.270
the length.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.780
So the length never matters.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.160
If it's the integral from 0 to
1,000,000, or 100, let's say,

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.330
1/100 cdx, it's just the same.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.160
It's always that, it doesn't
matter how long it is.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.050
Because we compensate.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.730
That's really the difference
between an integral and an

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.750
average, is that we're dividing
by the total.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.560
Now I want to introduce another
notion, which is

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.500
actually what's underlying these
two examples that I just

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.060
wrote down.

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.050
And this is by far the one which
you should emphasize the

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.470
most in your thoughts.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:45.590
Because it is much more
flexible, and is much more

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.770
typical of real life problems.
So the idea of a weighted

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.920
average is the following.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.580
You take the integral, say from
a to b, of some function.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:02.550
But now you multiply
by a weight.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.560
And you have to divide
by the total.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.410
And what's the total
going to be?

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.820
It's the integral from a to b
of this total weighting that

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.190
we have. Now, why is this
the correct notion?

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.420
I'm going to explain it
to you in two ways.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.990
The first is this very
simpleminded thing that I

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:30.480
wrote on the board there,
with the constants.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:38.480
What we want is the average
value of c to be c.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.820
Otherwise this makes no
sense as an average.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.070
Now, let's just look at
this definition here.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.660
And see that that's correct.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.900
If you integrate c, from a to
b, w ( x) dx, and you divide

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:56.030
by the integral from a to b, w (
x) dx, not surprisingly, the

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.020
c factors out.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.010
It's a constant.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.430
So this is c times the integral
a to b, w (x), dx,

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.380
divided by the same thing.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.390
And that's why we picked it.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.170
We picked it so that these
things would cancel.

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:14.660
And this would give c.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.910
So in the previous case, this
property explains the

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.140
denominator.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:29.760
And again over here, it explains
the denominator.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.510
And let me just give you
one more explanation.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:38.340
Which is maybe a real life
pretend real life example.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.060
You have a stock which you
bought for $10 one year.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:46.740
And then six months later you
brought some more for $20.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.360
And then you bought
some more for $30.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:53.810
Now, what's the average
price of your stock?

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:58.370
Well, it depends on how many
shares you bought.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:01.290
If you bought this many shares
the first time, and this many

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.760
shares the second time, and
this many shares the third

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.230
time, this is the total
amount that you spent.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:14.090
And the average price is the
total price divided by the

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.120
total number of shares.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:22.560
And this is the discrete analog
of this continuous

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.070
averaging process here.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.260
The function f now, so I use w
for weight, the function f now

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.150
is the function whose values
are 10, 20 and 30.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.800
And the weightings are the
relative importance of the

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:42.030
different purchases.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:51.600
So again, these wi's
are weights.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.710
There was another question.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.400
Out in the audience,
at some point.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.300
Over here, yes.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:04.520
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.920
PROFESSOR: Very, very
good point.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:15.710
So in this numerator here, the
statement is, in this example,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.020
we factored out c.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.710
But here we cannot factor
out f ( x).

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.450
That's extremely important and
that is the whole point.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.950
So, in other words, the weighted
average is very

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.820
interesting you have to do two
different integrals to figure

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:32.380
it out in general.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.120
When it happens that
this is c, it's an

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.430
extremely boring integral.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.620
Which in fact because, it's an
average, you don't even have

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.930
to calculate at all.

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.490
Factor it out and cancel these
things and never bother to

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.530
calculate these two numbers.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.580
So these massive numbers
just cancel.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.975
So it's a very special property
of a constant, that

00:22:48.975 --> 00:22:55.650
it factors out.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:00.100
That was our first discussion,
and now with this example I'm

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.900
going to go back to the heating
up of the witches'

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.600
cauldron and we'll use average
value to illustrate the

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:19.700
integral that we get in
that context as well.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.910
I remind you, let's see.

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.480
The situation with the witches'
cauldron was this.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:40.260
The first important thing is
that there were, so this is

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.770
the big cauldron here.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:47.210
This is the one whose height
is 1 meter and

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:53.190
whose width is 2 meters.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.540
And it's a parabola of
revolution here.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:06.500
And it had about approximately
1600 liters in it.

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:14.640
And this curve was y = x^2.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.560
And the situation that I
described at the end of last

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:25.210
time was that the initial
temperature was

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.560
T = 0 degrees Celsius.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.320
And the final temperature,
instead of being a constant

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.290
temperature, we were heating
this guy up from the bottom.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:48.340
And it was hotter on the
bottom than on the top.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:54.870
And the final temperature was
given by the formula T = 100 -

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.880
30 times the height y.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:04.090
So at y = 0, at the
bottom, it's 100.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:10.730
And at the top, T
= 70 degrees.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.420
OK, so this is the final
configuration for the

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.020
temperature.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:33.100
And the question was how
much energy do we need.

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.670
So, the first observation here,
and this is the reason

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:42.630
for giving this example, is that
it's important to realize

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:54.700
that you want to use the method
of disks in this case.

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.040
The reason, so it doesn't have
to do with, you shouldn't

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.060
think of the disks first. But
what you should think of is

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.010
the horizontal.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.780
We must use horizontals because
T is constant on

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.840
horizontals.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.740
It's not constant
on verticals.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:16.130
If we set things up with shells,
as we did last time,

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.980
to compute the volume
of this, then T will

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.760
vary along the shell.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.620
And we will still have an
averaging problem, an integral

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.730
problem along the vertical
portion.

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.460
But if we do it this way,
T is constant on

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.770
this whole level here.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.400
And so there's no more
calculus involved in

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.140
calculating what the
contribution is

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:39.840
of any given level.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:49.620
So t is constant
on horizontals.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.750
Actually, in disguise, this
is that same trick

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.370
that we have here.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.680
We can factor constants
out of integrals.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.580
You could view it as an
integral, but the point is

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:03.480
that it's more elementary
than that.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.430
Now I have to set
it up for you.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.230
And in order to do that, I
need to remember what the

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:10.470
equation is.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.960
Which is y = x ^2.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:19.030
And the formula for the total
amount of energy is going to

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:25.000
be volume times the
number of degrees.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.480
That's going to be equal to the
energy that we need here.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.250
And so let's add it up.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:38.540
It's the integral from 0 to 1,
and this is with respect to y.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.300
So the y level goes
from 0 to 1.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:47.310
This top level's y = 1, this
bottom level's y = 0.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:55.260
And the disk that we get, this
is the point (x, y) here, is

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.220
rotated around.

00:27:56.220 --> 00:28:01.230
And its radius is x.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.500
So the thickness is dy,
and the area of

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.480
the disk is pi x^2.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.830
And the thing that we're
averaging is T. Well, we're

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.010
not yet averaging, we're
just integrating it.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:24.170
We're just adding
up the total.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:29.080
Now I'm just going to plug in
the various values for this.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:36.580
And what I'm going to get is
T, again, = 100 - 30y.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.960
And this radius is measured
up to this very end.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.440
So x^2 = y.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.410
So this is pi y dy.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.800
And this is the integral that
we'll be able to evaluate.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.660
Yeah, question.

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.250
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:50.250 --> 00:29:00.070
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:05.710
Well, let's carry this out.

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.160
Let's finish off the
calculation here.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.230
Let's see.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:16.380
This is equal to, what
does it equal to.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.580
Well, I'll put it over here.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:27.780
It's equal to 50 pi y ^2 -
right, because this is 100 pi

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:36.950
y, and then there's a 30, this
is 100 pi y - 30 pi y ^2, and

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.780
I have to take the
antiderivative of that.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:45.450
So I get 50 pi y ^2, and
I get 10 pi y ^3.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:48.120
Evaluate it at 0 and 1.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:57.930
And that is 40 pi.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:05.140
Now, I spent a tremendous
amount of time last time

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.900
focusing on units.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.710
Because I want to tell you
how to get a realistic

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.080
number out of this.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.515
And there's a subtle point here
that I pointed out last

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:18.650
time that had to do with
changing meters to

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:19.160
centimeters.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.570
I claim that I've treated
those correctly.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:28.100
So, what we have here is that
the answer is in degrees, that

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.800
is Celsius, times
cubic meters.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.570
These are the correct units.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:43.760
And now, I can translate this
into Celsius is spelled with a

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.896
C. That's interesting.

00:30:44.896 --> 00:30:46.630
Celsius.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.840
I can translate this into
units that you're more

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.850
familiar with.

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:58.240
So let's try 40 pi deg
* m ^3, and then do

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.710
the conversion factors.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:07.310
First of all there's one calorie
per degree times a

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:08.840
milliliter.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.150
That's one conversion.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.600
And then let's see.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.150
I'm going to have to translate
from centimeters so I have

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:25.110
here (100 cm / m)^ 3.

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:26.290
So these are the two conversion

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.550
factors that I need.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:38.690
And so, I get 40 pi ( 10
^ 6), that's 100^3.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:46.550
And this is in calories.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.470
So how much is this?

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:53.910
Well, it's a little better,
maybe, to do it in 40 pi *

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:59.210
1,000 kilocalories, because
these are the ones that you

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:05.710
actually see on your nutrition
labels of foods.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:12.600
And so this number is
around 125 or so.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.960
Let's see, is that
about right?

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.930
Let's make sure I've got
these numbers right.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:20.550
Yeah, this is about 125.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.780
40 pi.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:32.220
And so one candy bar, this is
a Halloween example, so.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:38.460
One candy bar is about
250 kilocalories.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:44.620
So this is half a candy bar.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:53.130
So the answer to our question
is that it takes 500 candy

00:32:53.130 --> 00:33:02.900
bars to heat up this thing.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.570
OK, so that's our example.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:08.630
Now, yeah.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.160
Question.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.710
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.980
PROFESSOR: What does the
integral give us?

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:22.500
This integral is, the
integral represents

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.470
the following things.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.330
So the question is, what does
this integral give us.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.640
So here's the integral.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:30.640
Here it is, rewritten so that
it can be calculated.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.370
And what this integral
is giving us is

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:34.170
the following thing.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.160
You have to imagine the
following idea.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:39.220
You've got a little chunk
of water in here.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.320
And you're going to raise is
from 0 degrees all the way up

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.840
to whatever the target
temperature is.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.190
And so that little milliliter of
water, if you like, has to

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.900
be raised from 0 to some number
which is a function of

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.730
the height.

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.950
It's something between
70 and 100 degrees.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:04.190
And the one right above it also
has to be raised to a

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.530
temperature, although
a slightly different

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.280
temperature.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.840
And what we're doing with the
integral is we're adding up

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:15.700
all of those degrees and the
calorie represents how much it

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.220
takes, one calorie represents
how much it takes to raise by

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:21.980
1 degree 1 milliliter
of water.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.620
One cubic centimeter of water.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.610
That's the definition
of a calorie.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:32.990
And we're adding it up.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.430
So in other words, each of
these cubes is one thing.

00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.010
And now we have to add it up
over this massive thing, which

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:40.150
is 1600 liters.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.140
And we have a lot of different
little cubes.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.420
And that's what we did.

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.320
When we glommed them
all together.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.800
That's what the integral
is doing for us.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:54.200
Other questions.

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.400
Now I want to connect this
with weighted averages

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.800
before we go on.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.810
Because that was the reason why
I did weighted averages

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:06.330
first. I'm going to compute
also the average final

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:14.810
temperature.

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.120
So, final because this is the
interesting one, the average

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.030
starting temperature's
very boring, it's 0.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:26.180
The average final temperature
is, individually the

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.840
temperatures are different.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:33.110
And the answer here is it's the
integral from 0 to 1 of T

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:38.390
pi y dy divided by the
integral from 0

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:42.040
to 1 of pi y dy.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.540
So this is the total
temperature, weighted

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:48.070
appropriately to the volume of
water that's involved at that

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.880
temperature, divided by the
total volume of water.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.130
And we computed these
two numbers.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:58.350
The number in the numerator
is what we call 40 pi.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.570
And the number in the
denominator, actually this is

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.340
easier than what we did last
time with shells you can just

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.160
look at this and see that it's
the area under a triangle.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.500
It's pi / 2.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.760
And so the answer here
is 80 degrees.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.910
This is the average
temperature.

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.670
Note that this is a
weighted average.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.640
The weighting here is different

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.810
according to the height.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:28.190
The weighting factor is pi y.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.010
That's the weighting factor.

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.270
And that's not surprising.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:35.630
When y is small, there's
less volume down here.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.940
Up above, those are more
important volumes, because

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.040
there's more water up at the top
of the cauldron than there

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.960
is down at the bottom
of the cauldron.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.895
If you compare this to the
ordinary average, if you take

00:36:46.895 --> 00:36:51.230
the maximum temperature plus
the minimum temperature,

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:56.470
divided by 2, that would
be 100 + 70 / 2.

00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:59.830
You would get 85 degrees.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.610
And that's bigger.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:02.440
Why?

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.030
Because the cooler
water is on top.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:08.770
And the actual average, the
correct weighted average, is

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:11.800
lower than this fake average.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.520
Which is not the true average
in this context.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.090
All right so the weighting is
that the thing is getting

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:33.160
fatter near the top.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.980
So now I'm going to do another
example of weighted average.

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:46.020
And this example is also very
much worth your while.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.210
It's the other incredibly
important one in

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.960
interpreting integrals.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.790
And it's a very, very simple
example of a function, f.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:00.150
The weightings will be
different, but the functions,

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:03.320
f, will be of a very
particular kind.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.450
Namely, the function f will
be practically a constant.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:08.480
But not quite.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.340
It's going to be a constant on
one interval, and then 0 on

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:16.950
the rest. So we'll do those
weighted averages now.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:34.900
And this subject is called
probability.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.420
In probability, what we do, so
I'm just going to give some

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.910
examples here.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:54.620
I'm going to pick a point to in
quotation marks at random.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:39:00.900
In the region y &lt;
x &lt; 1 - x ^2.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:05.060
That's this shape here.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.770
Well, let's draw it
right down here.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.310
For now.

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.380
So, somewhere in here.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.310
Some point, (x, y).

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:19.440
And then I need to tell you,
according to what this random

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.330
really means.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:31.780
This is proportional to
area, if you like.

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.990
So area inside of
this section.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.260
And then the question that we're
going to answer right

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:46.620
now is, what is the chance
that, it's usually called

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:56.980
probability, that x &gt; 1/2.

00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:03.620
Let me show you what's
going on here.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:08.780
And this is always the case with
things in probability.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.290
So, first of all, we have
a name for this.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:16.220
This is called P ( x &gt; 1/2).

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.060
And so that's what it's called
in our notation here.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:27.900
And what it is, is the
probability is always equal to

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:32.760
the part / the whole.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:36.930
It's a ratio just like
the one over there.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.720
And which is the part and
which is the whole.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.470
Well, in this picture, the whole
is the whole parabola.

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:48.910
And the part is the
section x &gt; 1/2.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:41:00.460
And it's just the ratio
of those two areas.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.970
Let's write that down.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:09.210
That's the integral from 1/2 to
1 of (1 - x ^2) dx, divided

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:16.000
by the integral from - 1
to 1, (1 - x ^2 ) dx.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.350
And again, the weighting
factor here is 1 - x^2.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:27.570
And to be a little bit more
specific here, the starting

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:33.390
point a = - 1 and the
endpoint b = + 1.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:37.540
So this is P(x &lt; 1/2).

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:42.070
And if you work it out,
it turns out to be

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:47.210
5/18, we won't do it.

00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:47.470
Yeah.

00:41:47.470 --> 00:42:21.130
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.170
PROFESSOR: What we're trying
to do with probability.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.760
So I can't repeat
your question.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.720
But I can try say, because
it was a little bit too

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.580
complicated.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.020
But it was not correct, OK.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.490
What we're taking is,
we have two possible

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:39.940
things that could happen.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.640
Either, let's put it this way.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.910
Let's make it a gamble.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.150
Somebody picks a point
in here at random.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:53.160
And we're trying to figure
out what your

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.750
chances are of winning.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.830
In other words, the chances the
person picks something in

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.670
here versus something
in there.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.570
And the interesting thing
is, so what percent of

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.220
the time do you win.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.600
The answer is it's some
fraction of 1.

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.880
And in order to figure that out,
I have to figure out the

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.900
total area here.

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.210
Versus the total of the entire,
all the way from - 1

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:18.190
to 1, the beginning
to the end.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:22.580
So in the numerator, I put
success, and in the

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.250
denominator I put all
possibilities.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:26.720
So that, right?

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:29.260
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.080
PROFESSOR: And that's the
interpretation of this.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.060
So maybe I didn't understand
your question.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:37.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:40.130
PROFESSOR: Ah, why is 1 - x
^2 the weighting factor.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:44.550
That has to do with how you
compute areas under curves.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:49.040
The curve here is
y = 1 - x ^2.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.810
And so, in order to calculate
how much area is between 1/2

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:52.940
and 1, I have to integrate.

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.440
That's the interpretation
of this.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.450
This is the area under
that curve.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:57.220
This integral.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.200
And the denominator's the area
under the whole thing.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.180
OK, yeah.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.760
Another question.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.060
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.100
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.460
Yikes.

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.690
It was supposed to be the same
question as over here.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:13.030
Thank you.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:18.710
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.420
PROFESSOR: This has something to
do with weighting factors.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.410
Here's the weight factor.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.260
Well, it's the relative
importance from the point of

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:33.160
view of this probability of
these places versus those.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.080
That is, so this is a weighting
factor because it's

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:45.070
telling me that in some sense
this number 5/18, actually

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:48.420
that makes me think that this
number is probably wrong.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.170
Well, I'll let you
calculate it out.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:56.290
It looks like it should be less
than 1/4 here, because

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.290
this is 1/4 of the total
distance and there's a little

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.860
less in here than there
is in the middle.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.270
So in fact it probably should be
less than 1/4, the answer.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:09.190
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.070
PROFESSOR: The equation of
the curve is 1 - x^2.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.740
The reason why it's the
weighting factor is that we're

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.140
interpreting, the question
has to do with the

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.120
area under that curve.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.020
And so, this is showing us how
much is relatively important

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.200
versus how much is not.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.790
This is, these parts are
relatively important, these

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:28.660
parts are less important.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.960
According to area.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.730
Because we've said that
area is the way

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.920
we're making the choice.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:40.400
So I don't have quite enough
time to tell you

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.530
about my next example.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.870
Instead, I'm just going to
tell you what the general

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:46.820
formula is.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.920
And we'll do our example
next time.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.790
I'll tell you what
it's going to be.

00:45:51.790 --> 00:46:04.190
So here's the general formula
for probability here.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:12.120
We're going to imagine that we
have a total range which is

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.470
maybe going from a to b, and
we have some intermediate

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:20.160
values x1 and x2, and then we're
going to try to compute

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:27.390
the probability that some
variable that we picked at

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:31.560
random occurs between
x1 and x2.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:36.490
And by definition, we're saying
that it's an integral.

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:41.720
It's the integral from x1 to x2
of the weight dx, divided

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.710
by the integral all the
way from a to b.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:47.390
Of the weight.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:55.900
So, again, this is the part
divided by the whole.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.890
And the relationship between
this and the weighted average

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:03.460
that we had earlier was that the
function f ( x) is kind of

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.450
a strange function.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.410
It's 0 and 1.

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:10.360
It's just the picture, if you
like, is that you have this

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.860
weighting factor.

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.180
And it's going from a to b.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.990
But then in between there, we
have the part that we're

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.690
interested in.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.130
Which is between x1 and x2.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.910
And it's the ratio of this inner
part to the whole thing

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:34.650
that we're interested in.

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:39.660
Tomorrow I'm going to try to
do a realistic example.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.230
And I'm going to tell
you what it is, but

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.620
we'll take it up tomorrow.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.470
I told you it was going to be
tomorrow, but we still have a

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.270
whole minute, so I'm going to
tell you what the problem is.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:53.660
So this is going to be a target
practice problem.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.610
You have a target here
and you're throwing

00:47:55.610 --> 00:48:00.810
darts at this target.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:05.960
And so you're throwing
darts at this target.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:13.020
And somebody is standing
next to the dartboard.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:15.400
Your little brother is
standing next to

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.160
the dartboard here.

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.440
And the question is, how likely
you are to hit your

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.320
little brother.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.190
So this will, let's see.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:28.500
You'll see whether you
like that or not.

00:48:28.500 --> 00:48:30.000
Actually, I was the
little brother.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.710
So, I don't know which
way you want to go.

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:32.680
We'll go either way.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.240
We'll find out next time.
