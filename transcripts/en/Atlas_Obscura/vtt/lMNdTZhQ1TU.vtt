00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.990
- Olinka, the co-founder, and myself

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.270
were together for five years.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.560
And we decided to break up.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.580
There was one thing that was kind of

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.740
a reminder of our relationship.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.910
Just the mention of, "Who's
gonna take the bunny?"

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.720
it felt really hard.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.930
We thought, wouldn't it be
great if there was a place

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.200
where you could just store it

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.899
and it just stays there and it's safe,

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.300
you know it's safe?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840
But it's just not there
to remind you every day.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.550
To put it simply, Museum
of Broken Relationships

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.760
is a collection of items and stories

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.930
that were donated by people

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.251
after their relationships fell apart.

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:57.350
"I would like to donate
the target that my ex shot

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.070
with an AK-47 when we were together

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.740
at the shooting range in L.A."

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.770
What else do you do when you
come from Denmark to L.A.?

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.780
You know, you go to the shooting range.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.350
We get objects from all over the world

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.620
and we open packages, and,
like, "What's inside?"

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.787
And oftentimes, it's a
really good surprise.

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.600
"In the Zagreb Hospital,
I met a beautiful,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.570
young, and ambitious social worker

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.830
from the Ministry of Defense.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.800
Love was born when she helped
me get certain materials

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.460
which, as a war invalid,
I needed for my below-knee

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.950
prothesis. The prothesis
endured longer than our love.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700
It was made of sturdier material.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.950
The reason we did this
is because when we had,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.860
when we experienced a
problem of what to do

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.890
with this something,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.940
we were sure it already exists,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.910
and we went to Google
it to find the place.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.553
We just found advice
about how to destroy it.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.050
There are really some
that are so striking,

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.680
I mean, a parachute from Finland,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.027
it's a pretty powerful one.

00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:07.730
"I met him on my first parachute jump.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.580
I was really scared, but this handsome man

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.340
who was my tandem jump
instructor, saved me.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.483
We loved to play in the sky,
and we loved each other.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.637
Then he died in a parachute accident."

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.810
That's always a thing
with crowdsourced things:

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.307
You have no idea what you're gonna get.

00:02:26.307 --> 00:02:30.950
"When I moved out across the
country, I took the toaster.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.310
That will show you.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.450
How are you going to toast anything now?"

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.230
Love and breakup, it's such
important part of our lives

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.577
but you don't know anything about it,

00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:44.720
you're just left on your
own to experience it.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.160
And if you have great
parents or great friends

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.710
they will help you out. If not, nothing.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.520
It's really like that famous sentence

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.890
that everybody's happy in the same way,

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.283
and unhappy in their special way.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.443
A mobile phone from Zagreb, Croatia.

00:03:03.577 --> 00:03:06.760
"It was 300 days too long.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.357
He gave me his mobile phone so
I couldn't call him anymore."

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.820
It's a permanent museum.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.070
One of the most visited in Croatia,

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.943
which is for me still funny.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.020
Now we're friends and business partners.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.300
We just changed the relationship from

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.020
one to another, and it can be done.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.970
I mean, we're proof that it can be done.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.630
We still travel a lot,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.070
with visiting exhibitions
all over the world.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.300
And it's really great when you see how

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.330
well people respond.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.030
I mean, that's why we do it, really.
