00:00:08.245 --> 00:00:10.540
-My name is Janet
Rich-Edwards and I

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.160
am one of co-directors
of the science program

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.680
here at the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Studies.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.750
Thank you for coming out
on a gray and drizzly day.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.610
I think you're going
to get a treat.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.900
We have tonight coming from the
Norwegian University of Science

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.700
and Technology in
Trondheim Dr. Linn

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.440
Getz who is the professor
in behavioral sciences

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.430
and medicine there.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.390
The reason we have Linn is
because of a conversation

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.365
she and I had at her house in
Trondheim about a year ago,

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:45.490
which was one of the most
stimulating conversations

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.990
I have had in a long time about
medicine, social medicine,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.870
precision medicine, and
who will get access to it,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.745
and how can it maximize
the health of populations.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.120
And I thought, wow, it would
be great to bring Linn here.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.590
And it was Linn's idea to
bring Bruce along as well,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.400
up from Rockefeller University.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.690
Bruce McEwen, who is somewhat
of a household name around here.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.936
If you think allostatic
load, you think Bruce McEwen.

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:15.490
He is the Alfred
Mirsky Professor

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.700
at the Hatch Laboratory
of Neuroendicronology

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.740
at Rockefeller.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.120
Dr. McEwen discovered
adrenal steroid receptors

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.990
in the hippocampus in
1969 that really opened up

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.620
the gateway for all
sorts of studies

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.680
on circulating stress
hormones, sex hormones,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.460
cognitive function,
mood regulation,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.845
and other central systems
via epigenetic mechanisms.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:41.220
If you don't know
what those are,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.360
I'm sure you will by
the end of the hour.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.890
He's a member of the
MacArthur Foundation research

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.650
network on socioeconomic
status and health.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.250
So really studying the
distribution of health

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.900
and disease in society.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.080
And he is on the
National Scientific

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.130
Council on the
Developing Child, which

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.650
focuses on biological embedding
of early life experiences

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.060
and promoting healthy
brain development.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.762
So I think what we're going
to do is have Linn start out,

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.220
and then Bruce, and then Linn
will finish us up at the end.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.060
So Lynn, why don't
you come on up.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.680
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.000
-Thank you Janet.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.050
I'm so proud to be here.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.900
This is quite a place for me.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.620
And I'm a little nervous.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.790
If you hear it, it's correct.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.530
Here is the slide
I prepared for us

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.220
before I came, because I didn't
know you had such a good slide.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.430
And here you can see the
whole spectrum of the topic

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.150
from thinking at the left, to
multi-billion data measurements

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.940
to the right hand side,
and everything between.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.000
Thank you so much for making
it possible to get here

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.380
and also for having the
opportunity to meet Bruce.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.840
We have been communicating by
e-mail and Skype since 2009.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.040
And now finally we met
yesterday in person,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.790
and it has been already a treat
and it hasn't stopped yet.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.960
I come from Trondheim.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.550
It's a university city
in the middle of Norway.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.340
And sometimes it feels
like in the middle nowhere.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.200
[LAUGHTER] Here we go.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.420
I used to be a
general practitioner.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.670
That's a family physician.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.410
I used to travel in
the north of Norway

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.380
with a boat going to visit
people in the islands.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.240
I met lots of regular people.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.980
I've also worked a
lot in psychiatry,

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.560
which I did in Iceland.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.740
And now I'm back at the
university in Trondheim.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.060
And Norway, as
you may know, it's

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.080
a social democratic
welfare state.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.010
It's not a socialist
country even

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.381
though I think the
Americans don't really

00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:47.380
make a difference there.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.710
We do.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.520
And we also have, for
practical purposes,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.350
we do have equal
access to health care.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.930
It's not perfect at all times.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.000
But we do have it and it works.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.370
And I know that's different
from what you have here.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.670
This is my city Trondheim.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.980
It was founded in
997 by a Viking King.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.400
And through the
Middle Ages it was

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.300
famous as a site of pilgrimage.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.760
People actually
walked through Europe

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.459
to get to this site of
healing and salvation.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.980
It's the church above
St. Oluf's the saint.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.230
And now we have a
St. Oluf's Hospital.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.500
That's the new site where
people seek healing.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.570
And the Faculty of Medicine.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.710
And our little general practice,
or family medicine research

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.810
unit, is actually located
exactly at the outskirts

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.770
as you can see.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.210
A little inside, a little
outside of mainstream medicine.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.200
And this is my office.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.470
And I have a view from my window
and I see some things there

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.300
which I would like
to share with you.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.760
Of course medicine
has lots of successes,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.790
but it's not why I
stand here today.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.900
I don't want to debate that.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.920
But there are also some areas
of remarkable stagnation.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.950
For instance, an epidemic of
so-called medically unexplained

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.750
symptoms, or MUS, or even MUPS,
when it's physical symptoms.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.540
My tentative diagnosis
of that epidemic

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.130
is that there is too much
doing and too little thinking

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.745
in medicine.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.370
If you want to study medicine
in Norway you Google around

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.890
and you can see what
medicine looks like.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.740
And at our university
this is the first sentence

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.580
describing the curriculum.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.180
"To become a physician, you need
to know the body's machinery

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.060
right down to the
smallest cell."

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.110
And I think some of
the thinking problems

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.370
are actually rooted here, the
body machinery, that metaphor.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.310
It can bring you to success, but
it can also bring you astray.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.110
We did have a
success recently when

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.370
we got our faculty-- I had
nothing to do with that--

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.210
the Nobel Prize for medicine
and physiology in 2014.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.890
It doesn't often go to Norway.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.190
It quite often goes to
Harvard or Rockefeller.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.790
But we got it for
the brains GPS,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.800
the metaphor of the neurons
that make you orient yourself

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.050
in space.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.490
What is even more
interesting from my window

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.740
is to see the
groundbreaking evidence

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.090
of the interrelatedness of
human biology and biography.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.680
And whilst we are getting ever
more knowledge about this,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.110
and insight, and it pours
out, the machine metaphor,

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.320
it is starting to rust.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.590
But I cannot hear anything
but the engines still roar out

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.280
there.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.170
We are doing so much of
the old fashioned stuff.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.450
And I wonder when are we going
to start turning this huge tank

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.010
ship to another direction.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.500
And whilst all of
this is happening

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.750
there is a persistent
tension and suspicion

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.700
between the humanistic and
the techno-scientific camps

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.790
in medicine.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.980
But what is happening
is that the word person

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.177
is coming up in both those
camps somehow independently

00:06:59.177 --> 00:06:59.760
of each other.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.100
The word person is a
buzz word and cells.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:05.270
Here you have the
humanistic version

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.510
exemplified by the European
Society for Person Centered

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.960
Health Care,
established in 2014.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.980
And you can see here it says
it's a humanistic project.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.670
And it's symbolized
by the human hand.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.790
And I have for myself
added the thinker,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:28.044
just to make sure that this is
a critically thinking movement.

00:07:28.044 --> 00:07:29.960
But then on the other
side, in the other camp,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.030
you have something called,
for instance, the Personalized

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.490
Medicine Coalition.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.350
And that is quite another
story, with other metaphors.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.570
Here you have the high
tech metaphor going.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.560
And this has several names.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.040
Personalized medicine
is where it started.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.380
And that is what people
want to call it in Norway.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.880
They don't want to
skip the word person.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.320
But in the United States
and with President Obama

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.120
you are a little clever,
I think because you

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.070
choose the word
precision medicine, which

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.444
is much closer to
what it's all about.

00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:05.110
It doesn't have much
to do with persons.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.100
That's my whole point.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.280
Sometimes it's
called P4 medicine.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.070
I don't want to go
into exactly what all

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.360
those P's stands for,
personalized, participatory,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.620
and all this.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.010
Systems medicine is another
name for something very similar.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.460
And the whole point, we
are dealing with billions

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.800
of data points or big data.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.850
As you can see from
this avatar figure

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.260
that I stole from the
internet somewhere.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.559
Now my big question that I
really play with these days,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:37.330
is how might this renaissance
of the person concept

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.880
affect clinical
medicine in general.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.140
And particularly family
medicine or primary health care

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.370
at the very front line where
normal suffering people

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.592
meet the health care system.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.050
And of course I'm thinking from
a Nordic perspective, where

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:53.950
we try to have
equal access and we

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.000
have to think about
sustainability and cost,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.290
because we don't want
to leave anybody behind.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.410
If medicine is flying
decently high today.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.010
We do many good things.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.710
I wonder how it's going
to be 20 years from now.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.660
And I have two scenarios,
the best case scenario

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.350
and the worst case scenario.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.970
The best case scenario looks
like this the flying eagle.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.420
I think we have fantastic
opportunities now

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.610
with this new knowledge that
Bruce will share some of it

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:24.550
with you.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.880
But we also have a potential
worst case scenario.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.450
We can get trapped in
this new knowledge.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.830
And we can lose sight
of where we're actually

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.720
going, because
high tech makes it

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.100
possible to monitor
everything known to man

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.480
and a little more than that.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.940
So a couple of years
ago Bruce invited

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:44.910
me to come in and
co-author a paper

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.030
that he was working with
called "Lifetime experiences,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.760
the brain and
personalized medicine--

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.830
An integrative perspective."

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.800
And it's quite a mixture of
his world and my world as a GP,

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.600
or family physician.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.450
And it's part of the
project that we are playing

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.530
with on Skype and email.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.590
So I think I will stop now and
leave the next minutes for you

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:09.090
Bruce.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.400
And you take us into your world.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.050
And I hope that this
audience will appreciate

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.990
as much as I have done, all
the knowledge that you are so

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.910
generously sharing with
people who don't know much

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.660
about the brain.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.850
-Thank you.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.230
-So there you go.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.320
-Thank you.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.170
Thank you very much Linn.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.970
It's such a wonderful pleasure
to finally meet you in person

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.230
and have this opportunity.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.960
This is really a
highlight for me.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.470
And so yes, I'm
going to tell you

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:47.820
a little bit about
my journey into this.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.820
Of course, I'm at the
Rockefeller University.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.900
I've been there since
1966 on the faculty.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.320
I was a student there.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.070
I will tell you more about it.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:02.030
Now Rockefeller has no
departments, only laboratories.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.890
And so it's been easier
for me and others

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.580
to do research across
biomedical disciplines.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.830
And in my case expanding out to
include the social sciences as

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.090
well.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.980
My own progression was to be
a student of Vincent Allfrey

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.000
and Alfred Mirksy, who were
actually one of the first

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.620
to discover that
histones are modified

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.130
to regulate gene expressions.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.530
I've known about this
thing we call epigenetics,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:38.970
even though it didn't have
that term, since the 1960s.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.250
And then I went to Sweden.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.400
I had a two year
post-doctoral fellow

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.170
in the laboratory of a man
named Holger Hyden in Goteborg.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.950
And I discovered
the hippocampus.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.940
I didn't know much
about brain anatomy,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.335
but it was a structure
that was easy to find.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.560
When I came to
Rockefeller, and then went

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.450
to the laboratory
of Neil Miller,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.680
who was a pioneer in what is
called behavioral medicine.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.820
He was certainly
interested in stress.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.120
We serendipitously discovered
that it was the hippocampus

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.270
and not the hypothalamus
that had receptors

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.930
is for stress hormones
for adrenal steroids.

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.940
And that's what started my
progression, almost inexorable

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.390
progression towards what
we're talking about today.

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:26.610
I was lucky enough to
meet the late Elliot

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:33.380
Stellar, a physiological
psychologist who introduced me

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.130
to interdisciplinary research
and got me into the MacArthur

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.940
Foundation Network, the
Health and Behavior Network,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:45.260
the Successful Aging one
I didn't work in exactly,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.560
but my colleague Teresa
Seaman started there--

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.860
and then the Network
on Socioeconomic Status

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.540
and Health, and now the
National Scientific Council

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.460
on the Developing Child.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:04.090
So somehow the idea that
the brain as we will see

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:08.270
is the central organ
of stress and responds

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.280
to epigenetic signals.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:15.590
This I got off the internet,
since people hardly

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:19.290
understand what it means, this
is not genetics, epigenetics.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.070
Well, as you probably
know, it refers

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.030
to above the genome,
things currently

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.450
that regulate gene
expression, and development,

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.790
and throughout the life course
without actually changing

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.280
the DNA sequence.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.150
Now originally, when
a man named Wattington

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.570
used the term
epigenetics it referred

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.110
to the emergence of
characteristics from,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.500
say compare legged frogs
egg and human fertilized

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.520
egg that look very similar.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.990
Well, the characteristics of the
species and even the individual

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.500
begin to appear.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.190
And you couldn't have predicted
them from the previous stage.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.270
So that was the original term.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.540
Now epigenetics refers
to a whole series

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:06.830
of changes, the methylation
of cytosine bases on DNA,

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.500
which is in many cases
a reversible process.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.430
The histones, which allow the
winding, unwinding, and winding

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.850
of the DNA, so it can either
be read and transcribed

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.680
or repressed and
not transcribed.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.880
And there are other
mechanisms that are emerging.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.170
So what is ironic is that it
wasn't too many years ago when

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.850
the people who sequenced
the human genome said,

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.490
now we know everything.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:37.780
And there are still people who
operate only in terms of genes.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.720
A recent paper in
Nature Biotechnology

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.790
didn't mention the
environment once

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.830
in talking about
gene interactions.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.700
But we know that environment
is hugely important.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.710
And of course, the other message
from the inexorable progression

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.190
of development is that we
can't turn back the clock.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.820
We have to talk about resilience
and redirection and not

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.150
reversal.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:09.340
So neuroendocrinology,
as I've practiced it,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.800
involves the idea that hormones
affect all brain functions

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.470
and not just the
steroid hormones,

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.050
the metabolic hormones as
well, that experiences affect

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.900
the brain and the body
through these mechanisms,

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.660
and that behavior
changes the brain.

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:29.100
And one story in this whole
idea of integrative medicine,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.900
there's a program at Cornell
Medical School next door

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:36.660
to Rockefeller, headed by a
woman named Mary Charleston.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.130
And I was invited to give
the integrative medicine

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.430
grand rounds in the Department
of Medicine several years ago.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.550
And after the talk I went
to, as the speakers do,

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.270
to morning report, and
there were two residents

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.370
who were presenting
a case of a woman who

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.750
came in with an acute autoimmune
and inflammatory disorder.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.800
And they proceeded to
talk about the drugs, that

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.290
by and large did not work
very well for her condition.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:06.310
And finally I stuck
out my hand and I said,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.450
so what was her condition
when she came in?

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.780
Well, she had just learned that
her son had Hodgkin's disease.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.990
They may or may not have
sent her to a social worker

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:19.700
to help with the
problem, but they

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.680
didn't mention this
as a primary factor

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.850
and present it as it was
a factor in how they then

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.220
went about treating her.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.940
And this just indicates
the siloization

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.850
and the lack of regard
for this lived experience

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:42.610
that Linn introduced us to
and we'll talk about further.

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.580
So this is the diagram from
this New England Journal

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.020
article in 1998 talking about
the central role of the brain.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.820
And I want to take
you through some steps

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.440
in explaining this diagram.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.770
First, the concept that
we call allostatic load.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.990
The idea that allostasis
is the active process

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.339
of putting out cortisol
and other mediators that

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:08.920
help us adapt.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.790
And that's the purpose
of these mediators,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.430
it's not damage, but adaptation.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.109
But when there's
too much stress,

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:22.349
and when these responses
are dysregulated

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:27.700
then a allostatic load, or wear
and tear on the body and brain

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.420
can develop.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.630
So, for example, cortisol,
when it's put out acutely

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:36.850
it actually enhances
immune function

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.850
and promotes energy
replenishment, certain kinds

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.500
of memory that keep
us away from danger

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.580
if we remember where danger
lay, promoting more efficient

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.130
cardiovascular function.

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.540
But chronically we
know that it suppresses

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.220
inflammation, suppresses
immune function,

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.200
can promote bone mineral
loss and muscle wasting,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.190
and contribute to the
metabolic syndrome.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.470
So we talk about an
inverted U. And you

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.690
will see inverted U shape
dose response curve again

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.700
in the talk.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.390
Now cortisol is not
the only mediator.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.210
It works together with the
parasympathetic and sympathetic

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.970
pro and anti-inflammatory
cytokines,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.180
the other adrenal steroid
DHEA, a little bit

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.290
of oxidative stress, which is
important for cell functioning,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.910
and it simultaneously
affects multiple systems

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.330
of the body, related to the
things you see on the slide.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:40.710
And as a result of the fact
that these mediators interact

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:44.700
with each other and influence
each other's activity,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.300
it's non-linear, and,
as I said, biphasic.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.910
And it can be the
dysregulation that

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.830
can lead to allostatic
load can be related

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.930
to an unhealthy lifestyle
including poor sleep,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.720
but exposure also
to toxic chemicals,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.520
and these feed into this
network of allostasis.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.030
For example, elevating
inflammation,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.310
which then leads to an elevation
of cortisol, which then

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.790
can have adverse
consequences if both stay

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.860
elevated for long
periods of time.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.800
And so these dysregulation,
the allostatic load,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.460
is connected to disorders
in various systems and parts

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.450
of the body, from
mental health disorders

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:33.040
to immunologic disorders,
to cardiovascular disorders,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.720
and metabolic disorders.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.550
And we know and
you'll hear much more

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:42.020
from Linn about
co-morbidity's of diseases.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.120
So I've already
mentioned lifestyle

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.590
and being stressed out.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.740
Our health behaviors, whether
we lose sleep at night,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.830
eat too many of the wrong
things, drink too much alcohol,

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.440
smoke, and so forth, or neglect
our regular moderate exercise,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.220
these things also play into
this network of allostasis

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.500
and can contribute
to allostatic load.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.180
We have of course different
kinds of stressors, trauma

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.260
and abuse, major
life events, but also

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.300
the daily environmental
stressors of our daily lives

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.520
at work, at home, in
our neighborhoods,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.910
and watching television
in the evening

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.270
and seeing what's
happening in the world.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:30.490
And if we talk about stressors,
and this is terminology

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.790
that's come out of the
National Scientific

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.750
Council of the
Developing Child, we

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:38.620
can talk about positive
stress, like giving a talk,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.930
taking a challenge, and
having a positive outcome.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.690
And to do that you have to
have a good sense of yourself.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.960
A good mastery and
sense of control

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.280
to make the right choices,
to take the right risks.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.070
There's tolerable stress,
where something bad happens,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.610
a major life event.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.490
You have the good
internal resources

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.050
and you have good material
and social support.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:02.800
And you can weather the storm.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.460
There may be some allostatic
load that results,

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.010
but it can be attenuated.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.610
And then you have
toxic stress, which

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:13.410
involves a lack of
sense of control,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.860
possibly because of poor
social and emotional support,

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.280
but also perhaps because of
compromised brain architecture

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.210
because of early
life experiences,

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.130
and we'll come to that shortly.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.690
So the brain is indeed the
primary target of stress.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.100
And this has been
work that we have done

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:38.020
and are doing ongoing
in the laboratory.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.640
And I'll tell you just a
very little bit about it,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.520
involving three different brain
structures, the hippocampus,

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.240
where we first discover
these preceptors.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.730
And we know the hippocampus
is important for contextual,

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:53.580
and episodic, and
spatial memory,

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:57.860
but also it should be on this
slide for emotional regulation

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.560
and mood regulation.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.400
The amygdala is involved
in fear, and anxiety,

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.640
and aggression.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.880
It also turns on the autonomic
and hormonal stress response

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.970
just as the hippocampus
helps to shut it off.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.380
The prefrontal cortex is
important for decision making,

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.920
for working memory,
and for all manner

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.870
of self-regulatory behaviors.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.520
And it has downstream
influences on the amygdala

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.380
to keep it from
overreacting and interacts

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.680
with all of these
other brain structures.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.810
And it helps to shut off the
autonomic and hormonal stress

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.870
response.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.500
So if anything happens
to the architecture

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.590
of these individual
brain areas it's

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.300
going to affect the balance of
how they relate to one another.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.360
And that's what
we'll talk about,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.560
because one of the discoveries
growing over the last 30

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.880
or so years is that
even in adults as well

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.440
as the developing brain neurons
are capable of what we call

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:10.960
remodeling, that dendrites
can grow or shrink dependent

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.400
with experience.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.210
That in the middle
synapses, these

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:20.080
are excitatory synapses
on what are called spines,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.900
that there's a certain
turnover of some

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.030
of them, at least
every day, mediated

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:31.160
by the circadian cycle, which
helps you in motor learning.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:37.720
And cortisol is very
important in those changes.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.230
And that there is a certain
amount of neurogenesis

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.320
that actually occurs in
the dentate gyrus region

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.110
of the hippocampal formation.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.410
This was a revelation some
decades ago, some of which

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.900
occurred in my
laboratory, and also

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.810
previously in the laboratory
for Fernando Nottebohm

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.820
at Rockefeller.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.130
Elizabeth Gould, who is now
a professor at Princeton,

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:04.120
was the one who really
rediscovered neurogenesis

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.030
in the hippocampus.

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:07.420
And now it's a big
deal in relation

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.620
to lots of things going on in
understanding brain adaptation.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.880
So we come back to our inverted
u-shaped dose response curve.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.600
And talking only about,
just for the moment,

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.250
about cortisol and these
excitatory amino acid

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.100
transmitters that
are so important

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:30.050
for cognitive function, turning
on an acute stress response,

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.080
it actually helps
enhances excitability,

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.660
improves memory functions
as I said before.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.050
But then if there is a
more intense acute stress

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:42.030
it can actually have
the opposite effect.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.680
So we see the first
manifestation of the inverted

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:49.360
U, Impair excitability,
and impair memory,

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.760
and we know the expression
stress makes you stupid.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:58.330
Then if we have repeated stress,
as I've already been saying,

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.110
you have what we call
adaptive plasticity,

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.460
the suppression of
neurogenesis and causing

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.440
remodeling or
shrinkage of dendrites,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:13.000
or in some parts of the brain
actually the opposite, growth.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.130
And I'll tell you about
that in a few moments.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:23.710
Then with a severe crisis such
as a seizure, stroke, or a head

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.610
trauma the same players,
glucocorticoids and excitatory

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.140
amino acids actually cause the
permanent irreversible damage

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.850
in these conditions.

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.980
And so again the extreme
version of the inverted U,

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:43.030
brain aging over activity
of the glutamatergic system

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.690
and of the glucocorticoid
system contributes

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.450
to the speed of brain
aging and may even

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.820
play into the acceleration
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:57.330
But then finally we come
to the loss of resilience.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:01.250
We know that after stress
these changes in the brain

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:06.090
architecture, which are
adaptive, if the stress is

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.120
over they should adjust.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.140
It's not turning back
the clock, but adjusting

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.500
so they'll go back to more or
less the way they were before.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.070
But when that doesn't
happen one may

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.790
have an anxiety disorder, or
depression, something that's

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.640
inappropriate for
the circumstances

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.050
and we have to intervene
with some external means,

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:30.090
with a drug, or with behavioral
interventions, or both.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.360
Now a lot of this work that's
derived from animal models

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.400
has been extended
to the human brain

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.090
by people doing structural
and functional imaging.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.560
We know the hippocampus
gets smaller

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.790
in prolonged major depression.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.200
It also gets smaller in type-2
diabetes, which is often

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.110
associated with depression.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.660
It's smaller in post-traumatic
stress disorder,

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:59.020
maybe as a precondition for the
disorder, and also as a result.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.200
It is smaller and
Cushing's disease.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.000
But there the good
news is if you

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.130
correct the hypercorticism the
hippocampus can recover over

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.740
six months to a year.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.250
And both the mood regulation,
the volume change,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.030
the cognitive dysfunction can
be at least partially reversed.

00:27:17.030 --> 00:27:19.690
But you don't need
to have a disease,

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.570
because we know
there is a smaller

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:25.330
hippocampus with
prolonged chronic stress,

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:29.470
with chronic lag,
and lack of exercise,

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.910
and also with chronic
inflammation, which

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.880
is a condition of many of the
so-called non-communicable

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.980
diseases of modern life.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.450
The good news is
that regular exercise

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.080
increases hippocampal volume.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.310
Intense learning does the same.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.230
And antidepressants do the same.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.640
And one of the most effective
antidepressants is exercise.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:57.750
An example of this from studies
of people in their 60s and 70s

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.930
who were largely couch
potatoes until they

00:27:59.930 --> 00:28:01.650
were encouraged to
get off their duffs

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:06.410
and walk an hour a day five
out of seven days a week.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.510
You can see on the
top the enlargement

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:12.000
of the hippocampus in six months
to a year, with improvements

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.800
in memory, and also changes in
the prefrontal cortex and blood

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.370
flow which made them more
efficient in decision

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.310
making and working memory.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:25.280
So even as one ages these
changes are still possible

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.470
and that encourages
then to believe

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.570
that we can change the brain
with behavioral interventions

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:32.660
and not just with drugs.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.990
Metabolic hormones
also affect the brain.

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.360
They enter the brain and
they have very positive

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.730
important effects.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.400
For example, IGF-1
from the liver

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.450
actually goes into the
brain when we exercise.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:51.240
And if you block the IGF-1
with antibodies exercise

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.320
does not stimulate neurogenesis.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.840
So here's another example of
a peripheral acting hormone

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.240
that is essential
for a brain function.

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:05.740
Now, apologies for the
black, but on the left you

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.570
see that in the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex stress

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.700
causes dendrites to shrink.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:20.370
And there is some resilience
possible in the healthy brain.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:21.800
It also happens
in a place called

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.810
the medial amygdala, which is
important for social behavior.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.820
But in the amygdala, especially
in the basolateral amygdala,

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.570
which is important for
anxiety, these dendrites expand

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.280
and the animal becomes more
anxious, more vigilant,

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.840
because the orbital frontal
cortex, which is involved

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.510
in vigilance also expands.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.942
So here you have the
unbalanced brain architecture,

00:29:44.942 --> 00:29:46.400
which is very
appropriate if you're

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.420
in a dangerous situation.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.920
And so not only in
adulthood, but also kids

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.170
who have been
abused early in life

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.910
have a persistent
condition like this

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.350
where they are
much more vigilant

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:01.090
and their amygdala is much
more active as a result

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.992
of these early experiences.

00:30:02.992 --> 00:30:05.800
We'll come back to
that very shortly.

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.600
So in adults the amygdala
is overactive in anxiety

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.120
and depression.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.974
And effective treatment has
been done at Mass General

00:30:17.974 --> 00:30:22.490
by Britta Holzel and Sara
Lazar of chronic anxiety

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.560
can actually reduce the
volume of the amygdala.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.230
And overactive amygdala and
under-active prefrontal cortex

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.980
is associated with early signs
of cardiovascular disease.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.820
And most interestingly if
you elevate glucocorticoids

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.010
at the right time, at the time
of trauma or right afterwards,

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.670
it actually reduces
PTSD symptoms.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.360
So here glucocorticoids
have a protective role.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.192
And that's very
important to emphasize,

00:30:48.192 --> 00:30:49.400
because they're not bad guys.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.410
They're there to do good.

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.690
In the prefrontal
cortex I was involved

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.890
in a study on medical
students during the course

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.410
of their studies, where
there were differing levels

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.070
of perceived stress.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.950
The ones who were the
most stressed out actually

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.980
had an impaired circuitry
in their prefrontal cortex

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.330
and did worse on tests
of cognitive flexibility

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.340
than those who had
less perceived stress.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.830
The good news is when they
had a month off for vacation

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.540
all these changes
reversed themselves.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.600
They came back to normal.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.550
So the young brain is
flexible in that way.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.210
But studies that we've
done with John Morrison

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.030
on the prefrontal
cortex in animals

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.610
show that as the
animal gets older

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.690
it can show stress
responses, but it's

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:44.990
less resilient in recovering
unless we maybe help it out.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.290
It's also affected by
circadian disruption.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:54.470
And so of course, again,
maybe that can be treated.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:58.050
So the final part is
really this whole question

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:01.760
of individual differences,
the effects of our gene

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.180
by environment,
epigenetic interactions,

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:07.350
experiences that happen
throughout the life course,

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.360
especially early in life.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.320
And this concept of
long term influences

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.380
has been referred to as
biological embedding.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.610
There are variations
on genes that

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.100
are referred to as context
sensitive alleles, sometimes

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.710
as orchid alleles,
because they can

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.290
for greater sensitivity
to either bad things

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.040
or good things.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.620
Whereas the dandelions
are tougher and don't show

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.700
as much response.

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.210
And of course these
epigenetic modifications,

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:39.530
which are not confined
to early development,

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.640
this is a description
of all the things

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.510
that are happening
to brain plasticity

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.860
throughout the life course.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.760
But they are particularly
potent early in life.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.950
So for example,
studies of maternal

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:55.490
care currently by Michael
Meaney and colleagues.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:58.480
Before that by Seymour
Levine and Victor Denenberg

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.930
showed that if mothers
nurture their pups

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:07.100
intensely they become more
laid back, less anxious,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:11.000
and you can actually
cross foster pups

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.670
from a not so good mother
to a better mother,

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:16.440
and transfer behaviorally
these characteristics.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.640
So the offspring, in
the case of the females,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.170
become better
mothers so to speak.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.380
And overall they
show less anxiety.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:30.130
And others have shown that
animals that are less anxious

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.800
actually may live-- it's rats--
as much as 200 days longer

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.690
on the average.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.550
So somehow this
gets under the skin

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.780
and can affect
the aging process.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.520
Studies in our laboratory are
looking at early life stress,

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.630
where you disrupt the nest
so that the mother is not

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:52.930
taking care of her
pups adequately,

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.290
actually result
in the hippocampus

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:58.280
at least in the red
on the left when

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.660
you challenge these animals
with an acute stress the gene

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.620
expression is less
able to respond.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.310
So there are less possibilities
to respond in an animal

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:10.139
that's received early life
stress than an animal that

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:10.900
hasn't.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.050
And we're trying to
figure out what that means

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.969
in terms of later adaptation.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.860
For example, treatment
resistance to depression

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.480
seems to be related in humans
to our early life, abuse,

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.300
and neglect.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.900
So there are
developmental issues

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.530
for kids, which I'm
sure you are aware of.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.020
Poverty and low
socioeconomic status

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.960
coupled with the
lack of stimulation

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.909
by the parent of--
verbally-- of the child

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:44.120
can lead to reduced
vocabulary and also changes

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.030
in learning ability.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.290
There's a famous book
by Hart and Risley

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.670
called Meaningful Differences,
which follows this.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:52.880
And now one of the
practices is to encourage

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.469
parents to verbally
stimulate their kids.

00:34:55.469 --> 00:34:57.830
And they're even
devices to help kids

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.290
improve their
verbal communication

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.480
and improve the
kid's a vocabulary.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.990
Chaos in the home in
poverty and because

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:14.360
of disruption of the family
can impair the development

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.180
of the prefrontal cortex.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.990
So there's less self regulation.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.440
It can lead to obesity, and
elevated blood pressure,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.790
and cardiovascular reactivity
relatively early in life,

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.120
increased levels of
inflammatory tone

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:32.570
as indicated by
poor dental health.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.870
And all of these
then are also, as I

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.030
said, because of the prefrontal
cortex, related to impaired

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:46.380
brain architecture and more
greater sensitivity to toxic

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:47.320
stress.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.110
And then the adverse childhood
experiences studies of Felitta,

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.760
and Anda, and others actually
emphasize abuse and neglect

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.870
increasing not only mental
health disorders, but also

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.410
physical disorders,
cardiovascular disease,

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.640
diabetes, and so forth.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.640
So just very quickly to
summarize some of the things

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:12.440
we know about early life
adversity and poverty.

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.550
It results in a smaller
hippocampus, low self-esteem,

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.630
and a greater risk
as a result for PTSD.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.690
The amygdala is more
reactive, as I said, because

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:27.360
of these early
experiences, more vigilant,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.700
and more likely then to
develop anxiety and depressive

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.760
disorders.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.980
The prefrontal cortex
is more affected

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.080
so it is less able to help the
person self regulate, so there

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:41.650
is greater vulnerability
for substance abuse

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:46.700
for mood disorders, lesser
ability to plan and execute

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:52.250
the kind of life that one
needs in this modern society.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.300
So what can one do about it?

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:58.260
Obviously prevention is
the most important thing.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:04.110
The Nurse Family Partnership is
an example of an intervention

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:10.810
that helps parents have better
relationships with their kids

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:15.640
and improves, as demonstrated
over 20 years of observation,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.950
does improve childhood outcomes.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:24.190
But as I've also said when
bad things have happened

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.940
there are things that
are possible illustrating

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.094
that we can change the
brain with experience.

00:37:29.094 --> 00:37:30.510
One of them I've
already mentioned

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.400
is regular physical activity.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.660
I've also mentioned the
mindfulness-based stress

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.600
reduction.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.540
If you reduce
anxiety effectively,

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.390
you can decrease
amygdala volume.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:45.940
And this may be anxiety that's
a result of some early life

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.010
condition.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:51.440
And finally the most important
thing of course for anybody

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.870
is finding meaning
and purpose in life.

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.750
And social support and
integration are very important.

00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:01.820
And programs like the Experience
Corps getting, in this case

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:05.160
elderly volunteers
involved in taking

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.390
care of elementary school
kids in the classroom.

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.050
The health of the
volunteers is better

00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:13.930
because there have increased
physical activity, increased

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.460
social interactions, and
they're doing something

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.730
that has meaning and purpose.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.780
And there are studies by
Barbara Fredrickson among others

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.240
showing that eudaimonia
or meaning and purpose

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.660
actually can reduce the overall
inflammatory tone in the body.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:36.630
So the wisdom of the body, which
is a term that originated here

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.360
in Harvard, is
really something that

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.130
tells us, let's pay
attention to our bodies

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.400
and don't let our lifestyle
push us over the edge.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.710
And we know that
our modern lifestyle

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:52.440
can work against
what is sensible

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.840
and produce allostatic load.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.840
So with that I'm going
to turn it back to Linn.

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:06.740
-So from the
Rockefeller perspective

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.270
to the clinical
perspective, here

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.570
is a family physician
encountering a lady.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.540
And here is Helena.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:17.770
She's 54 years old and she
is married with two children.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.040
She has low education and
her new general practitioner,

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.610
a family physician, finds a
lot of long standing problems

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.770
in her medical record, typical
chronic complex diseases,

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.180
hypertension, diabetes type 2,
overweight, hypothyroidosis,

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.850
chronic widespread pain,
that's one of the medically

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:39.120
unexplained problems.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.900
She has recurrent
airway infections

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.810
and is bordering on
chronic pulmonary disease,

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:47.530
irritable bowel syndrome,
depression with anxiety,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:49.556
and probably she osteoporosis.

00:39:49.556 --> 00:39:50.930
She hasn't been
measured, but she

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.890
has had a fracture that
shouldn't really have happened

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.430
at the kind of accident.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:00.020
And she takes from seven to
10 prescription drugs daily,

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.650
depending on what
she and her physician

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:06.230
are trying out to work
on her pain problem.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:10.300
And she still smokes
despite advice.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.810
And then the medical students
are told by me and others

00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.200
to encounter patients from a
biopsychosocial perspective.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.320
And it's really a question
what is in there package.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.970
The perspective of
a biomedicine today

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.890
is what we have decided
to call silo medicine.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.210
It's a nasty word.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.760
We didn't invent it ourselves.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.860
We found it first time in JAMA,
the Journal of the American

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.910
Medical Association.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.410
But we adopted it immediately.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.740
The kind of the list of the
problems that Helena has

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.820
can be compared to silos.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:47.310
Each of the silos
has its own life

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:51.760
in a sense culminating in
clinical guidelines for each

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.890
of these diseases.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:56.940
And each disease is taken
as something separate.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:00.010
The problem is that this
fragmenting approach

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.980
doesn't really work
very well in practice.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.280
Family physicians complain
about guideline overflow.

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.210
A typical guideline for
like diabetes type 2

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:16.940
coming out in Norway now is 250
pages, for one single problem.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.540
And the idea that one size
fits all, when to treat,

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.400
how to treat, et cetera.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.750
And the worst part
of it is actually

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:28.520
the kind of uncoordinated poly
pharmacy that it leads to.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.690
Because if you treat
each of the diseases

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:33.940
with the drugs pertaining
to the disease,

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:37.240
and the patient has four or
five diseases at the same time,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.060
it can become quite toxic.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:43.300
And it is a terrible truth
that death from side effects

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.750
and toxic interaction
between drugs

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.270
is actually on the
top 10 list of courses

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.790
of death in the Western world.

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.240
I shall not tell you where
on this ranking you find it

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.350
but it's quite high and
definitely on the top 10 list.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:02.220
The strange thing is that
people with multimorbity,

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.470
that is people like Helena
with several chronic diseases

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.660
at the same time,
they have existed

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:11.130
I think as long as
humankind has existed.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:15.030
But it has taken such a long
time for advanced medicine

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.130
to start really
investigating the issue.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:22.010
Here you can see two
major publications

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.330
from the European
side of the Atlantic.

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.500
The British Medical
Journal had a cover page

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:30.230
and The Lancet had a
fantastic paper in 2012.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:33.030
I will get back to that
about the epidemiology

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.150
on multimorbidity.

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.200
And here you can
see an editorial

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.200
asking us to rise to the
challenge of multimorbitiy.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.830
What are we actually looking at?

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:47.880
What is the problem when so
many diseases tend to cluster

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:50.430
in one and the same person?

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.440
Is it just by accident?

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.380
What is going on?

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.280
We have to take a closer look.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.740
And then what we already know
and we don't need any more

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:01.940
research actually
to prove this is

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.010
that there is a very
strong social gradient

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.040
in multimorbidity.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.860
This is the Scottish
paper from The Lancet.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.740
And you can see here
that at all ages

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:17.000
if you compare the richest
strata of the population,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.630
that's the black line, with the
most deprived people you can

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.020
see that at least in the
younger and middle aged

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:28.100
populations there is
a major difference.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:31.700
It will actually be a question
of doubling the prevalence

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.580
if you are deprived.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:37.376
So there is something associated
with social realities here.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.910
In a sense we have
enough knowledge

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.850
about co and multimorbidity
in the world.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.570
But in order to make a
difference where you live,

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.290
you have to make
some local research

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:53.270
as well to have something
to throw to the politicians.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.660
So we have made some
local research and Bruce

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.940
as you can see from that
author list has been

00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.980
so kind to help us with it.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.140
We have a population study
called HUNTS study in Norway.

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.110
It's one of the
biggest in the world.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:12.290
This particular paper is based
on about 48,000 participants

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:17.330
in this affluent
relatively homogeneous

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:19.180
Norwegian population.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.900
And you have a list of
self-reported diseases

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.620
to the left.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.730
And I am not going into
the methodological pros

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:28.482
and cons of this approach.

00:44:28.482 --> 00:44:29.940
But you can see a
list of diseases.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:40.520
If you look at this column
or the horizontal bar

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:43.840
you can see the number of people
with that particular disease.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:50.420
And if the person has only that
disease he or she will be blue.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.590
If another disease on the list
is present it will be red.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:56.710
If two or more diseases are
present it will be green.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:00.940
And if three or more it
will be a violet color.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:04.430
And as you can see it's
far more common to have

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.800
two or three diseases
than only the one disease.

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.600
Some multimorbidity is the
rule and not the exception.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:15.830
And this has not been
accounted for in medicine

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:20.010
and this is really serious from
a primary care perspective.

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:23.120
And if you try to find out
what diseases are combined

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.520
with what diseases
you can just as well

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.730
look at the starry night.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:29.580
It's very hard actually to
figure out the constellations,

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.400
even though you
know they're there.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.350
This is our PhD Candidate
Margaret from Iceland

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.370
who has chosen this metaphor.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.820
So the question is what
is going on actually?

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:42.170
And I will go back
to the year where

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.900
I think most of the knowledge
that we are building on

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.290
in Trondheim came out.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.240
Of course this has long
roots and this is not

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:51.020
where it started.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.920
But here comes some very
important publications,

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.190
at least from my perspective.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.280
The Adverse Childhood
Experience study

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.640
from the Californian group
mentioned by Bruce came out.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.230
And from this moment on we know
that there is a dose response

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:11.320
relationship between adversity
in childhood and adult

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.690
disease and multimorbidity.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:17.700
And this has been shown in
other studies as well later.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.370
My previous mentor
Anna Luise Kirkengen

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:24.610
who is a Norwegian German
professor in general practice,

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:26.930
she defended her
thesis the same year

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.580
based on qualitative
in-depth interviews

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.500
with people who had suffered
childhood sexual abuse.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:34.520
Its a fantastic book.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:38.990
It was released a few years
later in Kluwer Academic Press.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.550
And it tells how
people with abuse

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:48.920
experience complex and
unexplainable to medicine

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.880
kinds of health problems,
as well as the health

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:56.720
problems that medicine knows
and thinks it can explain.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.130
And the third thing
that happened in 1998

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.320
was actually that first
Bruce McEwen published

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.320
the allostatic load
paper in New England

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.540
that you started out with.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:10.010
And from my perspective,
these three very different

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.190
approaches, the clinical
epidemiological study

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.170
from California, the
in-depth interview study

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:21.220
from this Norwegian population
by Kirkengen, and Bruce McEwen,

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.840
it's my golden triangle.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.110
It's rare.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:27.740
Within these limits I can
see so much happening now

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:30.230
and I am wondering what is
the best word to connect

00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:33.870
and I think the best
word is embodiment.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:36.740
And that is a word I have
not at all invented myself,

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.710
because that word has
actually been invented here

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:41.610
at Harvard, Nancy Krieger.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:45.060
I have never met her, but
this is a fantastic paper.

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:48.140
And I want to read to you
the sentences that are here

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:51.810
because if there is anything
that rings true to the family

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:57.760
physician in the front line
it is this insight that Nancy

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.560
Krieger presents.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.550
I don't know how she
could do it, because it's

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.890
so beautiful written.

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:06.420
And she says the following,
"Recognizing that we as humans

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.320
are simultaneously social
beings and biological organisms,

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.440
the notion of embodiment
advances three critical

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.900
claims-- Bodies tell stories
about and cannot be studied

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.690
divorced from the
conditions of our existence.

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:24.680
Bodies tell stories that
often, but not always,

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.510
much peoples stated accounts.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.790
And bodice tell stories that
people cannot or will not tell

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:33.150
either because they
are unable, forbidden,

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.330
or choose not to tell."

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.330
This is the clinical
manifestation

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:42.960
of difficult lives and
adverse experiences.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.440
And I think this is something
we have to bring into medicine.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.600
I'm struggling to teach my
medical students this and also

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.940
their postgraduate
GPs in our area,

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.880
because if we start really
understanding this and talking

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.710
to people along
these lines medicine

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:03.610
will become so much more
effective in the front line.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.110
Stories.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.000
I was collecting
evidence for a long time

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.420
mainly in my evening time.

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.400
And I finally got
around, together

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.530
with my mentor Ana
Luise and a professor

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.380
in immunology and
microbiology Alling Ulvestad

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.550
to write a paper,
originally in Norwegian,

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.000
but it is also translated.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.990
And we chose the title, "The
Human Biology-- Saturated

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:32.270
With Experience."

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.820
And I think it was
such a hard job

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.280
to collect all this
evidence and put it together

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.290
in a theoretically
sound manner and I

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:43.080
had to fight with the
journal to have it accepted

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.180
as an original piece of work.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.280
Because if you are
researching evidence

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.940
that somebody else has collected
that is just something,

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.380
it doesn't really count.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.810
But I think we have so
much primary research,

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:58.300
we have to look at it
and put it together.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.580
We can't have everybody
collect more original data.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.080
We have to look at the data
that is already out there.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.750
And there's so
much going on now.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:12.000
It is a fantastic time to
be part of this evolution.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.780
We have another little study
from this HUNT population where

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.530
we were able to
introduce one question

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:22.170
about subjective
experiences of childhood.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.930
And we have been
looking at how this is

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:26.880
associated with multimorbidity.

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.740
And we have had the idea
that allostatic load is

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:33.380
the underlying mediator
between experiences

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.370
of childhood and adult disease.

00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:39.430
And as you can see here
again Bruce has helped us.

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:43.900
In this video you can
see a lot of diseases,

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.550
the same self-reported
diseases again,

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:49.120
in a somewhat different list.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.060
And we have the prevalence
of each of these diseases

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.410
along the x-axis.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.430
And then we have the different
colors here representing

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:01.950
different levels of
childhood experience,

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:05.670
from very good, which is
dark blue, to very difficult,

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.700
which is the red color.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.300
And what you can see for
almost all diseases, not

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.210
all of them, not cancer
and not hypertension

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:15.910
for some strange reasons,
but for all the others

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:19.820
there is this dose response
relationship, which shows you

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.150
that a difficult childhood
just subjectively

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:28.890
reported in one question is a
predictor of a much higher risk

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.840
of disease than otherwise.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.029
And I use the
thyroid as an example

00:51:33.029 --> 00:51:34.570
because I don't
think people are used

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:36.660
to thinking about
thyroid disease

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.390
as typically related
to your childhood.

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:42.190
But there is something about
it as Bruce was mentioning

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:46.570
in his case, the woman with
the immunological disease,

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:50.080
the immune system is part
of this whole adaptation.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.690
So what I have prepared when
I teach my students and also

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:56.780
actually people with
much less education

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.040
I have stolen this
figure from Bruce.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.760
He knows it and he
has accepted it.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:06.870
And I am asking permission
to talk about allostatic load

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:10.670
as a balance between
drains and gains.

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:14.460
The path of genetic part, the
stress, the detrimental things

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:17.500
are on the left hand side,
d the life sustaining

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:21.480
and resilience things are
on the right hand side.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.240
And since we are living in a
dualistic medical world I am

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.930
dividing the medical literature
into mental and physical

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:32.450
because I cannot make up
for that even though we

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:33.580
shouldn't think that way.

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.670
We have to work
with what we have.

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:38.470
And then I add all
the world literature.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.500
And it won't get
worse than this.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.030
But here you have like
a two times two table.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:47.170
And you can see that
you can somehow sort out

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.490
lots of the evidence that's
out there because there are

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.170
many individual
papers investigating,

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.940
for instance, overwhelming
responsibilities.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:57.330
We are at the top left.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:01.870
That's my name for
having a spouse who

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:04.200
gets Alzheimer's
disease and you care

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:07.100
for the person for many,
many years with love,

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:09.460
but it's also a
draining experience.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:13.050
Or you have a chronically
disabled child.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.570
You want to do the
job, but it's tough.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:18.970
And I call this
overwhelming responsibility.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:22.420
And we know it has an
impact on telomere function,

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.600
on allostatic load, et cetera.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.710
And you can read
the world literature

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:29.380
and put the pixels
into this picture.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:32.330
We know that injustice
is bad for people.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:34.420
The Whitehall study has
shown that people who

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.520
experience subjective
unfairness,

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:41.500
they feel maltreated
and they get

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.760
more disease, and more
cardiovascular disease

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:44.900
than others.

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.160
And you have the physical
things that are well known

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.930
and then you have the
more gaining sides,

00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:54.450
on the right hand side and
you find exercise and all

00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:56.240
this sleep and all this.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.860
And I think this is an
opening for discussing

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:03.090
in the clinical situation with
patients where can we start.

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:04.870
It's not obvious
that you should start

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:06.880
attacking smoking in
somebody who has not

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:08.150
been able to stop before.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.850
You could mention it, but
perhaps you could rather just

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:15.020
talk about meaningful
activities or how is it

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.670
to carry this responsibility.

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.970
The whole point is
that I suspect very m

00:54:21.970 --> 00:54:24.010
and I think I'm not
alone, that when

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:26.940
the drains are much
heavier than the gains that

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:31.180
is where you start fueling
up under multimorbidity.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.780
So instead of looking at disease
from a pure silo perspective.

00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:39.010
We could perhaps use
the volcano metaphor.

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.270
And I'm talking about risk.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.020
Of course you can
become multimorbidity

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.840
without having any adverse
experiences in life.

00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.320
I'm talking about
added risk here.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.600
And the idea is that
allostatic overload

00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:53.830
is a common denominator that can
fuel up under so many diseases.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.480
Once you get one
you have increased

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.590
risk of several diseases.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.090
Bruce I think you
took part in writing

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:03.360
about the biology
of disadvantage.

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.720
That's your term or
your milieu has that.

00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.280
Michael Marmot speaks about
the causes of the causes.

00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:13.270
And Paul Farmer
here from Harvard

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:15.790
speaks about
pathologies of power.

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.290
I'm not sure if
he's really speaking

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:19.330
about allostatic
overload, but it must

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:21.360
be part of the same picture.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.590
So we have some very
good terms that we

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:28.770
can use to try to mediate
and express this insight.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:33.260
And now comes the clue
to the whole thing.

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.870
You didn't say much
about it Bruce,

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:38.580
but in theory this can all
be measured and monitored.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.380
And that is exactly the ambition
of personalized medicine

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.330
now, to monitor
what's happening.

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.140
To be able to predict and
perhaps prevent things

00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.390
from going bad.

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:51.840
And as I told you, I can see
a best case and worst case

00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.560
scenario now from this idea
that we understand so much

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.200
of the mechanisms.

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:00.300
And if you look at
this paper from 2011

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.870
this is about systems
personalized medicine.

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:08.780
It is written by 64 system
biologists and one GP, who

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.060
actually was president
of the world association

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:13.940
at the time for
general practitioners.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:16.450
And here is the idea
that the vision now

00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:21.200
is to be let each patient be
surrounded by a virtual cloud

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.800
of billions of data points.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.840
And it's going to be unbiased
by classification systems.

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.770
And we will have new biomarkers.

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:31.440
These people have understood
that multimorbidity

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.520
is an artifact to a certain
extent of the way we

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:35.520
think about disease.

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.930
There is something
going on much deeper.

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:41.140
So the point is they
have really understood

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.460
many of the flaws of modern
medical thinking, which

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:45.200
is a good thing.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.120
The question is only can we only
solve it by measuring things

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.100
or can we actually find out
without all those measurements.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.690
The iPOP is the integrated
personalized omics profiling.

00:56:56.690 --> 00:57:00.050
And here you have a billion
data points at several levels

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:03.340
from the genome, via
the epigenetic markers,

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.880
the metelome, and
you go all the way

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.560
to the metabolic
various components

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.920
that you can measure
in the person's blood.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.580
And you do this over a lifetime.

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:19.060
You start before the child is
born perhaps with the mother

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.550
and you go through like every
three months or something

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:24.520
and you monitor the iPOP.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.260
And we are actually arriving
at this very soon now

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.910
because we have all
this technology.

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:32.180
We can measure, we can
combine then big data.

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:36.210
Google has already established
its baseline study.

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:40.250
Apple has this kit and they
remind us that our iPhones,

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.990
they are actually
powerful medical tools.

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:44.975
So we are going into
an era now where

00:57:44.975 --> 00:57:46.990
we can measure and
monitor ourselves

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:49.380
to an increasing extent.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:54.190
And here is the point where
I think Greek mythology can

00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:55.640
come to our help.

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.900
Are we going in the
right direction?

00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:00.100
What questions
should we raise now?

00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.340
Is if the narciss-ome
that is being invented?

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:08.490
Is there a risk that we can
drown like the poor Narcissus?

00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:12.650
We can just become so infatuated
by our own mirror image

00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:16.100
that the molecular me will
be just what we can see,

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.060
and we can forget all around us.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.940
We can forget about education,
about equality, about justice.

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:23.830
We can just take
care of ourselves

00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:27.080
and monitor ourselves.

00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.060
A PhD student of
ours, Henrik Vogt,

00:58:30.060 --> 00:58:32.860
has written a fantastic
paper that recently came out

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.670
about the idea that
now we are supposed

00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:37.230
to quantify our health.

00:58:37.230 --> 00:58:38.970
We're not only going
to measure ourselves

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:42.570
when we feel bad or sick but
we should quantify and monitor

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:46.000
our health according
to systems medicine.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.900
And here is another
paper by the same guy

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.580
where we put the ultimate
question to the test.

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.410
"Getting personal--
can systems medicine

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:57.260
integrate scientific and
humanistic conceptions

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.670
of the patient?"

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:02.070
Can we by measuring
everything get to the point

00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:05.070
where we don't need to
speak to people anymore.

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:08.560
And the conclusion is ultimately
systems medicine may also

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.650
have to recognize that
to faithfully model

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.340
a human being it's necessary
to be a human being.

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:19.320
It took us 10 pages to
get to that conclusion.

00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.280
And you might laugh,
but actually there

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.340
are people who are really
selling this idea that this

00:59:24.340 --> 00:59:27.020
is all you need.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.790
And then a bit of
Greek history again.

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:36.730
The Oracle of Apollo, the temple
of healing also in old Greece,

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:40.670
it had this inscription
at the door, know thyself.

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:42.190
I can't say it in Greek.

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:44.320
It's something like
[SPEAKING GREEK].

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:46.660
I don't know how they spoke.

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.220
Anyway, it was know thyself.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.430
And as our PhD student
has pointed out

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:53.620
that is something different
from knowing thy selfie.

00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.220
And that is actually
the end of the talk.

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.250
There is a lot that we
haven't spoken about,

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.810
especially the nature
of these measurements.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.720
I can just promise
they are there.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.220
And the question
is how are we going

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.750
to handle this fantastic
insight, the political nature

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:12.320
of medicine.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:17.030
We know about the pathologies
of power, the disadvantages,

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.086
and all this.

01:00:18.086 --> 01:00:19.460
Are we going to
measure ourselves

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.900
out of it or are we going to
act on a more political level.

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.310
That's the main question.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:26.630
And here are the
acknowledgments coming.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.430
Thank you.
