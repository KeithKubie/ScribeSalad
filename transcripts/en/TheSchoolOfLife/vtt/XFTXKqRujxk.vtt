00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.020
Anxiety attacks are sometimes interpreted,
by society at large but also by their confused,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.509
guilty or shamed sufferers, as an illness
close to madness: the result of a mysterious

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.140
chemically-based flaw in the brain that severs
us from reality and normalcy. The suggested

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.140
treatment is therefore medical, involving
forceful attempts to dampen and anaesthetise

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.099
parts of the misfiring mind.

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.329
Yet such an interpretation - however kind
in its intentions - depends on the assumption:

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.660
that the normal response to the conditions
of existence should be calm.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.021
But why should it be, given the obvious insanity
of the world?

00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:49.789
The root cause of an anxiety attack is unusual
sensitivity to a madness in the world most

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.879
people dampen out.

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.030
Of course, once you think about it, it’s
entirely understandable one might have an

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.269
anxiety attack at a party, when talking to
a colleague or on a crowded train. There is

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.810
genuine terror beneath the surface of such
things.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.390
In her great novel Middlemarch, the 19th century
English writer George Eliot, a deeply self-aware

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.420
but also painfully self-conscious and anxious
figure, reflected on what it would be like

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.009
if we were truly sensitive, open to the world
and felt the implications of everything

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.170
“If we had a keen vision and feeling of
all ordinary human life, it would be like

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.740
hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s
heart beat, and we should die of that roar

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.810
which lies on the other side of silence. As
it is, the quickest of us walk about well

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.649
wadded with stupidity.”

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.409
It is, as Eliot recognises, both a privilege
and a profound nightmare to hear that grass

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.969
growing and that squirrel’s heart beating
- and, also, by extension to feel everything

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.610
deeply. We might well, as she sometimes did,
long for a little more ‘well-wadded stupidity’

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.280
to block it all out.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.090
Nevertheless, Eliot’s lines offer us a way
to reinterpret our anxiety with greater dignity

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.710
and benevolence. It emerges from a dose of
clarity that is (currently) too powerful for

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.170
us to cope with - but isn’t for that matter
wrong. We panic because we rightly feel how

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.320
thin the veneer of civilisation is, how mysterious
other people are, how improbable it is that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.250
we exist at all, how everything that seems
to matter now will eventually be annihilated,

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.510
how random many of the turnings of our lives
are, how prey we are to accident.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.050
Anxiety is simply insight that we haven’t
yet found a productive use for, that hasn’t

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.950
yet made its way into art or philosophy. It’s
a mad world that insists that the anxious

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.000
are the crazy ones.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.810
We are in such a hurry to see anxiety as a
sickness, we fail to notice its health and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.630
wisdom. It is a legitimate, constant response
to the oddity of going to parties, riding

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.150
public transport or more widely, of being
alive.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.840
We should never exacerbate our suffering by
trying to push our disquiet aggressively away.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.250
Our lack of calm isn’t deplorable or a sign
of weakness. It is simply the justifiable

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.400
expression of our mysterious participation
in a disordered, uncertain world.
