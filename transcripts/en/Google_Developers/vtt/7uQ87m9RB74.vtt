WESLEY CHUN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.572
This is Wesley Chun, engineer
and Developer Advocate.

00:00:04.572 --> 00:00:06.030
Here at Google, we
strongly believe

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.570
in giving users impactful
and delightful experiences

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.740
when using our tools.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.140
Well, we want you to do the
same for your customers.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.030
Today's episode is
all about good times

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.864
and how you, with
not much effort,

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:17.780
can enhance the experience
you give your users

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.580
by marking up the email
you're already sending them.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.640
But before we talk shop,
let's think about some

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.170
of those experiences.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.130
Going out to eat is something
that everyone favors.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.190
Enjoying a night out with
friends or that special someone

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.590
shouldn't be stressful.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.900
Technology should help
enhance this experience,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.120
making things easier
and more convenient.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.150
If you're a restaurateur, or
a dining reservation service,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.530
you want your information
available at your customers'

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.330
fingertips, meaning
what you don't

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.590
want is for them to
be hopping into a cab,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.660
fumbling for the email
app on their phones

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.960
and having to search for
your message that confirms

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.260
a reservation time
and your address.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.870
Similarly, let's say
you're an online retailer.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.590
When customers buy
something from you,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.550
they care where their stuff is.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.310
Their anxiety can only be
reconciled with the "order

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.640
confirmed" and the "order
has shipped" messages

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.660
that you send them.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.550
And if you include
the tracking number,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.050
you're further building up
their anticipation to "the day."

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.860
But if your message is drowned
out by all the other email

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.590
they get, the alternative
is, that precious gift

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.050
you bought for your
mom may get all wet.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.910
Well, how would that happen?

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.250
Sadly, the traditional
inbox is one-dimensional and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.270
disorganized.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.130
Important and less
important messages

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.200
are mixed together,
causing your notifications

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.930
to get lost in the shuffle
and users frustrated.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.490
Take a look at the inbox here.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.020
How long does it take you to
find the important messages

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.650
indicating that your
order has shipped

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.590
and your dining reservation
versus everything else?

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.330
Well, the answer is too long.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.430
The real problem is that there's
no relationship between email

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.000
messages, important
or otherwise.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.560
So this led the Gmail team to
rethink email and create Inbox,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.790
which has a goal to fix
this problem by highlighting

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.620
the key elements
in your messages,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.050
placing them front and
center with beautiful images,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.450
engaging users in an immersive
and joyful experience.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.880
Here in Inbox you see both
the dining reservation

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.630
and my online purchase together.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.960
Beyond Inbox, you'll
find that markup also

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.789
elevates key information
to other Google services.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.289
Look!

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.390
That dinner reservation
is on my Google Calendar

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.560
so I don't forget.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.320
On the day of, a Google Now card
can show me the when and where.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.320
Finally, how about being able
to ask for all my purchases

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.930
while using Google Search?

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.750
Well, these are just some ideas
of how to take good experiences

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.540
and making them great.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.460
But how can you give this
experience to your users?

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.070
Surprisingly, the answer
is easier than you think.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.880
All you have to do is add
markup to your email messages

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.950
and Google takes
care of the rest.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.750
Markup, like what you see here,
enables Inbox and other Google

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.920
services to highlight
the important information

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.410
from your messages
to your users so they

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.760
get exactly what they
need at a glance.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.430
I mean, you're already
sending email to users, right?

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.510
You don't need to redo
how you send them.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.412
You're just adding a little
bit more to the email body.

00:02:55.412 --> 00:02:57.120
Let's put it this
way-- your messages are

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.770
the dessert that
you've already made.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.480
All you need to do
is add the markup,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.740
which are like
toppings, such as nuts,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.949
or sprinkles if you're
allergic to nuts.

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:06.740
In other words, it
doesn't take much effort

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.520
to add markup to your messages.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.150
By the way, did you know that
by enhancing your messages

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.020
with markup, users are
more likely to engage?

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.770
Well, with some of
our partners, they

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.770
noticed an increase
of up to 30%.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.800
Inbox supports two types of
markup-- microdata, which

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.960
you can see here is
XML flavored, and JSON

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.930
for Linking Data,
JSON-LD for short.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.150
Both formats rely on schema.org
for a single standard shared

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.700
vocabulary.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.630
Getting started is even easier.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.260
The first link you
see here takes you

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.240
to the markup documentation
while the next one

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.290
goes through developer tools
to help you create, add,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.960
and validate your markup.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.800
Finally, you can catch more
videos in this and other series

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.440
with the links
down at the bottom.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.000
If you need help, search
our Google Schemas tag

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.210
on Stack Overflow.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.950
Well, we love great
experiences, right?

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.470
As a retailer, restaurateur,
transportation service,

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.610
or any modern business,
you can enhance

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.350
what you give your
customers by adding

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.870
just a little bit of markup
to the messages you're already

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.030
sending to them.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.765
Then tools like Inbox by
Gmail, Google Now, Search,

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:12.810
and Calendar will
play their roles

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.990
at delivering that
enhanced experience,

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.300
highlighting what
matters most to users.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.620
Just think-- the better
the experience you provide,

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.450
the more they'll come back to
you and not your competitors.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.630
Well, I look forward to
seeing some awesome email

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.080
messages from you soon.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.840
This is Wesley Chun from Google,
and thanks for tuning in.
