00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.860
We tend to be told in algebra
class that if we have a line,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.640
our line will have a
constant rate of change of y

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.551
with respect to x.

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:11.050
Or another way of
thinking about it,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.680
that our line will have
a constant inclination,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.920
or that our line will
have a constant slope.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.190
And our slope is literally
defined as your change

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.650
in y-- this triangle is
the Greek letter delta.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.580
It's a shorthand
for "change in."

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.960
It means change in y--
delta y means change in y--

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.640
over change in x.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.500
And if you're dealing with
a line, this right over here

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.630
is constant for a line.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.270
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.270
to actually prove that
using similar triangles

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.420
from geometry.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.850
So let's think about
2 sets of 2 points.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.290
So let's say that's
a point there.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.980
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.930
Let me start at this point.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.160
And let me end up at that point.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.560
So what is our change in
x between these 2 points?

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.860
So this point's x value
is right over here.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.020
This point's x value
is right over here.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.090
So our change in x is going
to be that right over there.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.590
And what's our change in y?

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.930
Well, this point's y
value is right over here.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.730
This point's y value's
right over here.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.220
So this height or this
height is our change in y.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.650
So that is our change in y.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.590
Now, let's look
at 2 other points.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.379
Let's say I have this point
and this point right over here.

00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:41.670
And let's do the same exercise.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280
What's the change in x?

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.050
Well, let's see.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.414
If we're going-- this
point's x value's here.

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:48.580
This point's x value's here.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.390
So if we start here
and we go this far,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.030
this would be the change
in x between this point

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.280
and this point.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.696
And this is going
to be the change--

00:01:59.696 --> 00:02:01.320
let me do that in
the same green color.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.653
So this is going to be the
change in x between those two

00:02:03.653 --> 00:02:04.210
points.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.770
And our change in y, well,
this y value is here.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.340
This y value's up here.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.306
So our change in y is going
to be that right over here.

00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:14.680
So what I need to
show-- I'm just

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.980
picking 2 arbitrary points.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.210
I need to show that the
ratio of this change in y

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.930
to this change of
x is going to be

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.120
the same as the ratio
of this change in y

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.330
to this change of x.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.620
Or the ratio of this purple
side to this green side

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.350
is going to be the
same as the ratio

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.180
of this purple side
to this green side.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.370
Remember, I'm just picking 2
sets of arbitrary points here.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.620
And the way that I will show
it is through similarity.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.080
If I can show that this triangle
is similar to this triangle,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.010
then we are all set up.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.310
And just as a reminder
of what similarity is,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.060
2 triangles are similar--
and there's multiple ways

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.030
of thinking about
it-- if and only

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.450
if all corresponding--
or I should say,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.285
all three angles are the
same, or are congruent.

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:02.570
And let me be careful here.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.710
They don't have to be
the same exact angle.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.490
The corresponding angles
have to be the same.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.590
So corresponding--
I always misspell

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.040
it-- angles are
going to be equal.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.810
Or we could say
they are congruent.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.520
So for example, if I have
this triangle right over here.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.600
And this is 30, this
is 60, and this is 90.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.694
And then I have this
triangle right over here.

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:42.610
I'll try to draw it--
so I have this triangle,

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.760
where this is 30 degrees,
this is 60 degrees,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.336
and this is 90 degrees.

00:03:47.336 --> 00:03:49.210
Even though their side
lengths are different,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.890
these are going to
be similar triangles.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.098
They're essentially scaled
up versions of each other.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.590
All the corresponding
angles-- 60 corresponds

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.000
to this 60, 30
corresponds to this 30,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.580
and 90 corresponds to this 1.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.744
So these 2 triangles
are similar.

00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:03.410
And what's neat about
similar triangles,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.020
if you can establish that
2 triangles are similar,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.811
then the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:08.810
is going to be the same.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.260
So if these 2 are
similar, then the ratio

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.280
of this side to
this side is going

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.829
to be the same as
the ratio of-- let

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.592
me do that pink color--
this side to this side.

00:04:25.592 --> 00:04:27.050
And so you can see
why that will be

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.974
useful in proving that the
slope is constant here,

00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:31.390
because all we
have to do is look.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.140
If these 2 triangles
are similar,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.270
then the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.970
is always going to be the same.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.040
We've picked 2 arbitrary
sets of points.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.470
Then this would be true,
really, for any 2 arbitrary set

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.553
of points across the line.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.320
It would be true
for the entire line.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.530
So let's try to
prove similarity.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.530
So the first thing we
know is that both of these

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.530
are right triangles.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.880
These green lines are
perfectly horizontal.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.980
These purple lines
are perfectly vertical

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.160
because the green
lines literally

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.720
go in the horizontal direction.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.750
The purple lines go in
the vertical direction.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.180
So let me make sure
that we mark that.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.040
So we know that these
are both right angles.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.510
So we have 1 corresponding
angle that is congruent.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.382
Now we have to show
that the other ones are.

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:11.840
And we can show
that the other ones

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.810
are using our knowledge
of parallel lines

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.320
and transversals.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.190
Let's look at these
2 green lines.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.280
So I'll continue them.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.680
These are line segments,
but if we view them as lines

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.310
and we just continue
them, on and on and on.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.510
So let me do that,
just like here.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.530
So this line is clearly
parallel to that 1.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.860
They essentially are
perfectly horizontal.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.910
And now you can view our
orange line as a transversal.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.870
And if you view it
as a transversal,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.620
then you know that this angle
corresponds to this angle.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.310
And we know from transversals
of parallel lines

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.150
that corresponding
angles are congruent.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.810
So this angle is going to
be congruent to that angle

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.200
right over there.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.400
Now, we make a very similar
argument for this angle,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.470
but now we use the
2 vertical lines.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.340
We know that this segment, we
could continue it as a line.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.740
So we could continue it,
if we wanted, as a line,

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.067
so just like that,
a vertical line.

00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:06.150
And we could continue this
one as a vertical line.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.720
We know that these
are both vertical.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.386
They're just measuring--
they're exactly

00:06:09.386 --> 00:06:11.870
in the y direction,
the vertical direction.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:17.110
So this line is parallel to
this line right over here.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.040
Once again, our orange line
is a transversal of it.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.215
And this angle corresponds to
this angle right over here.

00:06:27.215 --> 00:06:28.090
And there we have it.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.840
They're congruent.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.490
Corresponding angles of the
transversal of 2 parallel lines

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.150
are congruent.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.914
We learned that
in geometry class.

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:34.830
And there you have it.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.520
All of the
corresponding-- this angle

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.970
is congruent to this angle.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.620
This angle is congruent
to that angle.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.590
And then both of
these are 90 degrees.

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.365
So both of these are
similar triangles.

00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:47.200
Just let me write
that down so we

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.170
know that these are
both similar triangles.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.110
And now we can use the
common ratio of both sides.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:01.620
So for example, if we
called this side length a.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.870
And we said that this
side has length b.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.430
And we said this
side has length c.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.600
And this side has length d.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.330
We know for a fact
that the ratio,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.130
because these are
similar triangles,

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:19.450
between corresponding
sides, the ratio of a to b

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.470
is going to be equal
to the ratio of c to d.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.290
And that ratio is
literally the definition

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.150
of slope, your change in
y over your change in x.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.120
And this is constant
because any right triangles

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.050
that you generate
between these two points,

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.436
we've just shown that they
are going to be similar.

00:07:43.436 --> 00:07:45.060
And if they are
similar, then the ratio

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.730
of the length of
this vertical line

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.300
segment to this horizontal
line segment is constant.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.100
That is the definition of slope.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.870
So the slope is
constant for a line.
