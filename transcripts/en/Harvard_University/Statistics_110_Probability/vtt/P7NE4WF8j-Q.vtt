00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:06.030
SPEAKER: So at the end of last time,
we were doing this matching problem,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:06.960
De Montmort.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.809
And then I wanted to say a little
bit more about that problem,

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.100
because it was a little rushed
at the end of last time.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.570
So let's finish talking about that.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.000
That was an example of
inclusion-exclusion.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.190
And then, for the rest of today,
I want to introduce independents.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.370
We've already been talking
informally about independence.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.520
When we say things are independent,
what does that really mean.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.130
And then the big main
topic for this entire week

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.500
is conditional probability
and conditioning.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.360
So that will be the rest of today.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.800
First, let me just quickly remind
you of this De Montmort problem,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:49.650
a matching problem
continued from last time.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.350
Because I had to explain it
a little too fast last time.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.525
And there were a couple
more comments about this.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:59.149
This is the most famous example
of an inclusion-exclusion.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.690
If you read the strategic
practice, and if you go to section,

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.319
you'll be seeing lots more
examples of inclusion, exclusion.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.121
But this is probably the most
famous one, and it's a nice one.

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.120
So I'm not going to write
the whole thing again.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.571
But I'll just remind you of our notation
from last time in case you forgot.

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:15.570
It's hard to remember
notation over the weekend,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.480
so I'll just remind you briefly.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.340
We had we have a deck of n cards.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.974
The cards are labeled 1 through n.

00:01:21.974 --> 00:01:25.140
And you're just playing this game, where
you're just flipping cards over one

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.639
by one.

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.720
And you say, 1, 2, 3, whatever.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.350
And you win, if in fact at some
point, the card that you name

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.964
is the card that appears.

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:33.630
That's the game.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.270
You want to know what's the
probability that you win that game.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.285
So I define Aj to be the event
that the jth card matches.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:51.067
In other words, the jth card in the
deck is labeled with the number j on it.

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.400
And we were trying to find
the probability of the union.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.880
And I want to explain this a slightly
different way and then make a couple

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.590
more comments about it.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.580
So so what we're
interested in is the union.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.540
And you can think about how to do
this directly, but it's pretty hard.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.090
And inclusion-exclusion is
the easiest way to do this.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.240
So if you remember your
inclusion-exclusion,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.007
it says that this
probability of the union

00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:25.590
is going to be something that
looks like-- first, you're going

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.470
to add up the individual probabilities.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.428
Then you're going to
subtract the probabilities

00:02:29.428 --> 00:02:31.370
of different intersections.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.960
And then you're going to
add triple intersections.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.000
And you're going to subtract, and
add, and keep going like that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.580
So in order to compute what we need
for inclusion-exclusion, basically what

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.530
we need is the probability of A1
intersect A2, intersect blah, blah,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.620
blah, intersect Ak.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.970
This is a handy trick.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.710
This is like really, really simple,
and yet students, for some reason,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.810
don't like doing this.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.000
I highly recommend-- what did I do here?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.990
I picked the first k of
them for concreteness.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.880
Well, what makes this problem
doable, without spending weeks on it,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.050
is the symmetry of the problem.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.000
So I could have written A7, and A9, and
whatever subset of k of them I wanted.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.750
But for concreteness, I'm
just picking the first k.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.709
By symmetry, it wouldn't change.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.750
We could start introducing some doubt--
if we wanted to be really formal,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.551
I could start writing like A
sub j sub 1, A sub j sub 2.

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:36.300
And you'd get all these
double subscripts,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.070
and then people start to get confused.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.370
But by symmetry, it's the same
as just writing this one down.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.250
So it really helps to make it concrete.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.510
Now, this is just n minus k
factorial over n factorial.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.130
That's immediate from the naive
definition of probability.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.830
Because we're assuming that
all orders of the deck of cards

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.670
are equally likely.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.810
That's the denominator.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.190
And the numerator, what this says,
is that card one is labeled 1,

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.560
card two is labeled 2, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.960
Card k is labeled k.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.140
So that means the rest of the n
minus k cards could be in any order,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.440
but the first k are constrained.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.010
So so that's immediate
from the naive definition.

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.570
So that's what we did last time.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.700
And then I'm going explain it
in a slightly different way now.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.620
I just noticed that there are--

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.400
how many of these terms are there?

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.920
Well, if you look back at
your inclusion-exclusion,

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.950
we don't just do this for
1 through k, obviously.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.260
We do this for all subsets of size k.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.220
So we're going to have n choose
k terms that look like this.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.770
And n choose k, remember, is
n factorial over n minus k

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.740
factorial k factorial, such terms.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.040
And they're all the same
by symmetry, so symmetry

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.316
is the key to this problem,
plus inclusion-exclusion.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.990
And now that this makes it easier to
see than what I wrote last time-- easier

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.510
to see why it's going to cancel
into something very nice.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.586
Because we have n minus k
factorial over n factorial.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:16.460
We have n factorial over
n minus k factorial.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.210
It cancels.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.890
The only thing that's left
is the 1 over k factorial.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.810
So now by inclusion-exclusion,
it's immediate

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:34.040
that the probability of the union
equals 1 minus 1 over 2 factorial

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.620
plus 1 over 3 factorial minus
dot dot dot plus negative 1.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.370
And then if you look at the last--
the last term of inclusion-exclusion

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.030
had a negative 1 to the n plus 1.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.102
And I think I forgot
the plus one last time,

00:05:47.102 --> 00:05:49.310
because I was writing in a
hurry at the end of class.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.770
So you may want to fix your notes.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.490
There's a plus 1 there.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.880
That's the last term.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.290
And let's just do a quick sanity check.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.710
Does this 1 over n factorial make sense?

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.100
Well, this 1 over n
factorial term is saying,

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.980
the cards are perfectly
ordered 1 through n.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.960
This is the case where
all of them match.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.190
Well, there's only one way that could
happen, that the cards are 1 through n.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.550
So this term should make
sense So that's what we did.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.210
And then suppose we
wanted the probability--

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.240
often the problem is
phrased the other way,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.650
as what's the probability
that there are no matches.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:31.570
So, of course, that's just going
to be 1 minus this no match equals.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.510
And just for practice, let's
write that in set theory notation.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.120
Remember from your math review, if
you take the complement of a union,

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.290
it's the intersection
of the complements.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.810
So the complement of that is the
intersection of Aj complement,

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.760
and that's just 1 minus this.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.040
So I'm just going to write 1 minus
1 plus 1 over 2 factorial minus 1

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.120
over 3 factorial plus
dot, dot, dot plus--

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.230
now it's negative 1 to the
n, because the signs flip.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.120
All right, so this is the exact answer
for the probability of no match.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.200
Now, this thing looks
pretty complicated.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.065
So what if we wanted
an approximate answer?

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.360
Then you have to recognize
the pattern here.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.820
Whenever you see something that
looks like factorials in the bottom,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.130
that should be making you
think of various Taylor series.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.160
And the two Taylor series that we
need over and over again in this class

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.912
are the geometric series and the
Taylor series for e to the x.

00:07:36.912 --> 00:07:38.620
So when you see
something like this, this

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.950
should immediately remind you of
the Taylor series for e to the x.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.220
Of course, we could put a 1 in
factorial here and a 0 factorial

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.860
there without changing anything.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:53.120
That's exactly the Taylor series for e
to the x evaluated at x equals minus 1.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:01.580
So this is approximately 1
over e, which is about 0.37.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.250
And most people find this
result pretty surprising.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.980
Because first of all,
where did the e come from?

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.650
It seems like you have
a pretty discrete--

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.300
e is making you think of logarithms and
maybe some calculus continuous stuff.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.100
But it just seems like
a discrete problem,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.480
just like arranging
these cards randomly.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.680
What does a deck of cards
have to do with the number e?

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.840
The other thing that's
surprising about it--

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.670
well, actually, I haven't done
a survey of this, not formally.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.679
It would be interesting to
see what people's intuition is

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.159
if you let n goes to infinity.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.200
I'm pretty sure most people
who haven't seen this

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.650
would guess that the probability
of no match either goes to zero,

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.630
or it goes to one.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.530
And it depends whether you're
a pessimist or an optimist.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:54.230
Because if n is getting very
large, you have a billion cards.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:59.960
Now each one of those cards is extremely
unlikely to be in its position,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.300
but you have so many chances.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.450
So who's winning that
competition between the fact

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.460
that it's so unlikely for each
one but you have so many of them?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.030
Somehow those two competing
forces reduce to one over e.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.150
And we're going to see the number
one over e a lot in this class.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.230
Sometimes I like to say that if you
have no idea whatsoever on a problem

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.420
and you had to guess, you
should guess 1 over e.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.989
You don't have a good
chance of getting it right,

00:09:28.989 --> 00:09:30.780
and you're supposed to
justify your answer.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.030
But probably 1 over e is going to give
you a better chance than anything else.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.170
So this is exact.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.880
As n goes to infinity, it
will converge to 1 over e.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.670
But even if n is 10, 10
factorial is over 3 million.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:48.270
It's a huge number.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:55.310
So even if n is 10, I this number is
correct to within something like 2

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.930
out of 100 million accuracy, something
on the order of 10 to the minus eighth.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.030
The difference between
this and this event is 10,

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.670
so it converges to 1
over e extremely fast.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.400
So that's just an illustration.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.560
I like this problem because, well,
it's cute, it illustrates 1 over e,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.320
it illustrates inclusion-exclusion,
it illustrates the symmetry,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.528
and those are all things
we're going to see a lot of.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.450
So that's that problem.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.350
So now I say we define independence.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.020
And it's very easy to define.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.100
It's not so easy to understand
fully the definition.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.810
So the definition is very, very simple.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.910
So we already have some
intuition about what does

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.440
it mean to have independent events.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.280
That is one of them gives you no
information about the other one,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.660
basically.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.460
But that definition is too
vague to actually verify

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.780
are these events independent or not.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:04.470
So if we have two events, A and B,
we say that they're independent--

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.710
we're assuming that
we have a sample space

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.860
and a probability function
P that we're working with.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.640
So it's within the
context of one experiment

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.630
and one probability, P, that satisfies
the axioms we've been talking about.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:25.650
They're independent
if-- and the definition

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:35.090
is just that the probability of A
intersect B equals p of A p of B.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.430
So that's pretty intuitive.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.490
It just says, what's the
probability that both A and B occur?

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.490
Well, the probability that A occurs
times the probability that B occurs.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.281
So they have nothing
to do with each other.

00:11:44.281 --> 00:11:49.220
It's independent, so we just multiply.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.500
That's the definition.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.930
Well, we'll see some
equivalent forms of it later.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.180
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.420
I want to contrast this with disjoint.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:06.370
Because that's a common mistake, and
that's a terrible, disastrous blunder.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.800
This is a completely
different from disjointness.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:21.670
If I say that A and B are disjoint, that
means that if A occurred then B cannot

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.560
possibly occur.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.570
That's opposite to independence.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.180
Independence says, if
we know that A occurs,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.140
it tells us nothing whatsoever
about whether B occurs.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.812
Disjointness says, if A
occur, then B can't occur.

00:12:34.812 --> 00:12:36.520
So they're completely
different concepts.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.395
But for some reason,
they get confused a lot.

00:12:38.395 --> 00:12:41.140
So that's why I was mentioning that.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.300
That's for two events.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.620
Let's just define what
happens with more than two.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.375
If we have events A,B,C--

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.730
this is the definition of what
does it mean for three events

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.690
to be independent.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.989
Well, first of all, we want any
two of them to be independent.

00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:04.280
It would be weird to say that
all three are independent

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.572
but A and B are not independent.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:15.450
So we have P of A, B. And
by the way, sometimes it's

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.600
fun to write commas
instead of intersections,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.950
and that doesn't cause any
problems unless we start bringing

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.736
in unions and things like that.

00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:26.610
So sometimes I'll write
probability of A and.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.910
Because I'm interpreting
intersection as and, so sometimes

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.227
I'll just write it as a comma.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.060
Mathematically, this
means the intersection,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.140
but intuitively it means what's the
probability that both A and B occur.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.530
So this says A and B are independent.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.340
And, of course, we want A
and C to be independent.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.860
And, of course, we want B
and C to be independent.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.190
And then the question
is, is that enough?

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.220
If we just had these equations, we'd
say that that's pairwise independent.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.310
That is, we have three events,
and if we take any two of them,

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.450
they're independent.

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.590
And the question is
whether that's enough?

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.710
And the answer is no.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.450
We also need one more equation.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:24.030
P of A,B,C equals P of A P of B P of C.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.550
So a slogan that some people sometimes
say is, independence means multiply.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.640
That's a little too vague though,
because it depends what you're doing.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.030
But if you have independent
events, and you and you

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.940
want the probability of all of them
happening, then you just multiply.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.370
So clearly, we want this to be true.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.610
Now there's a question of do these
pairwise ones imply this one?

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.000
And the answer is that
it doesn't in general.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.470
So there are some examples of things
like this in the strategic practice.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.840
And I would suggest that,
first, I think it's just

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.150
good practice with
the definitions to try

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.354
to construct your own counter example.

00:14:59.354 --> 00:15:02.520
And if you get stuck, you can look at
the solution in the strategic practice

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.180
too.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.450
And I might come back to this later.

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:07.770
But it would be better
to think about it first,

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.660
and I want to get to conditioning.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.940
But in general, we can't get
rid of any of these conditions.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.570
And you also can't say that
this one will imply these ones.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.800
So we just need pairwise independence,
and we need all three of them at once.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.120
So that's just the definition.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:32.490
Similarly, for events A1 up to An--

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.780
so if we have n events--

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.780
I'm not going to write
down all the equations,

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.430
because it's completely analogous.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:42.090
Once you understand the case with
three of them, you could do n of them.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.980
But we would say, well,
first of all, any two

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.670
of these have to be independent, and any
three of them have to be independent,

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:48.700
and any four of them.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.699
So no matter how many of them you
take, when you do something like this,

00:15:51.699 --> 00:15:52.730
it's just the product.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.080
So that looks pretty unwieldy.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.820
We have lots of different equations.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.420
So later we'll see other ways
to think about independence.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.270
But just the basic rule
is, independent means

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:10.660
multiply when we're trying to find
the probability of an intersection.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.470
So that should be true no matter
how many of the events we take.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.701
We could take any subset of these.

00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:16.200
Yes?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.030
AUDIENCE: Can you show
them the other way?

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.279
SPEAKER: What's the other way?

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:22.860
AUDIENCE: So if you
multiply [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:26.650
SPEAKER: So the question is, whether
this holds the other way too.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.190
Yeah, we're using--

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.920
And this is just a slogan.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.430
This is not a math statement.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.450
But this slogan is just
paraphrasing the definition.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:39.220
It's saying, if all these
multiplication rules hold,

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.850
that's the definition of independence.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.750
So it's true both ways.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:49.290
So we'll see other ways to
think about independence later.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.030
But for now, that's just the definition.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.980
And hopefully it makes some sense.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.930
You can also think about
the naive definition.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.330
Think about the naive
definition of probability

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.839
and your naive intuition
of independence.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:07.490
Put those together and see
whether it's consistent with this.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.569
And I think it will be.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.374
But if not, let me know.

00:17:10.374 --> 00:17:12.040
But just for now, that's the definition.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.160
But I think you should think about it.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:22.750
So I want to do one example,
one more famous example,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:29.110
and then we'll do
conditional probability.

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.410
So this is another famous problem.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.670
I think it's from
1693, very old problem.

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:50.100
This was called the Newton-Pepys
problem, and I think it's from 1693.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.040
Samuel Pepys was this famous
diarist, who you might

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.200
have heard about in a history course.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:00.180
Well, anyway, he wanted to know the
answer to a problem involving gambling,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.200
involving dice.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.540
I wrote down some numbers here.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.650
He wanted to know the answer,
and he couldn't solve it.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:11.700
So he wrote to Isaac Newton, and
Newton solved the problem for him.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.635
So I wanted to talk a little
bit about that problem.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.510
So here's my problem.

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.740
We have fair dice, just
usual six-sided dice.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.500
So the sides are numbered 1
through 6, all equally likely.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.860
And the question is, which
of these is most likely

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.430
of these three possibilities?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:44.580
The first possibility--
let's call this event A--

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:48.195
A is the event of getting at
least one six with six dice.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.880
So you roll six dice.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:58.750
And the question is, will at least
one of the six dice have a six on it?

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:06.100
So at least one six with six dice,
that's the first possibility.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.460
The second possibility
is at least two sixes--

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:19.430
I won't write the at least again--
at least two sixes with 12 dice.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.260
And the third possibility,
you might guess,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:29.800
is at least three sixes with 18 dice.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.270
So you roll 18 dice.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.480
And you want to know, are
there at least three sixes?

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.440
So in 1693, this was a hard problem.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.940
And this guy wanted to know the
answer, so he wrote to Newton.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:48.670
And Pepys had a strong belief about
which one of these was the most likely,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.320
but he didn't know any of the
math to be able to back that up.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.010
And I'm curious what your intuition is.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.820
If you had to guess A, B, or
C, which is the most likely?

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.350
How many of you would guess A?

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.470
OK.

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.980
How many of you would guess B?

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:08.620
OK.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.200
How many of you would guess C?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.610
so I think C--

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:13.910
definitely, B did not win.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.550
So I think C beats out A
according to that informal poll.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:25.900
Now, C, this is what
Pepys strongly believed.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.450
And he was asking
Newton, is that correct?

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.240
Can we back that up?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:36.850
And the answer is A.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.419
Now, it's not at all obvious though.

00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:42.960
That's why he had to write to Newton.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.410
And what actually happened
is, Newton wrote back a letter

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.320
deriving it and showing
that A was the largest.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.060
And apparently, Pepys
had some other bet,

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.750
based on this, that he reneged on
when he found out that he was wrong.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:20:59.590
So now let's solve the problem.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.540
So let's just find--

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.860
at this point, this should be a
pretty easy calculation for us,

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.820
so it shouldn't take too long.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.620
Let's find the probability of A. Well,
this is similar to other problems

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.460
we've done.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.090
You can use the naive
definition, because all six

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.770
outcomes are equally likely.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.420
But let's do it using
independence instead.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:29.260
Implicitly, I'm assuming that the
rolls of the dice are independent.

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.290
In this case, either you roll
one dice six times independently,

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.580
or you have six independent dice.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.690
So we're assuming we don't
have some weird situation where

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.306
we have six dice that are magnetically
joined together so that they're all

00:21:42.306 --> 00:21:43.430
going to land the same way.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:46.540
So the six dice are independent
of each other intuitively.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.846
But that intuition corresponds
to that definition there.

00:21:49.846 --> 00:21:51.220
So I'm going to use independence.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.560
You could also use the naive definition,
and you'll get the same thing.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:02.770
Now as far as our strategy, when we
see a probability of at least one,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.410
whenever you see at least one, that
should make you think of a union.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.235
And when you see a union, one
approaches inclusion-exclusion.

00:22:09.235 --> 00:22:13.280
But like I said last time, I try
to find simpler ways when possible.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.350
So the first thing I think when I
see at least one is, it's a union.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.600
But if I do the complement,
it will be the intersection.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.539
And in this case, we're taking an
intersection of independent stuff.

00:22:23.539 --> 00:22:24.830
So that means we just multiply.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.330
So that's going to be the most
straightforward way to do it.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.970
So I'm going to do 1 minus,
because I'm doing the complement.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:36.730
It's 1 minus the probability that
all of the dice are non-sixes.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.590
Now for each individual die, there's
a 5/6 chance that it's not a six.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.260
Independence says we
can just multiply those.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.990
So it's 1 minus 5/6 to the
6, which agrees with what

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:48.506
we get from the naive definition.

00:22:48.506 --> 00:22:50.380
Because in the naive
definition, we would say

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.840
there are 6 to the 6 possible outcomes.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.620
And each die has five possibilities
if we're excluding sixes.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.820
So that should be basically immediate.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:11.220
And now let's do P of B. And by the way,
I computed the number, and it's 0.665.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:17.870
So it's about a 2/3 chance of
having at least one six if you

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:23.927
roll six dice, which might not be
what most people would guess if they

00:23:23.927 --> 00:23:25.510
had to guess what this probability is.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.140
But that's an easy calculation.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.670
Now lets do P of B.
Again, at least two sixes,

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.070
that means that the number of sixes
could be anything from 2 to 12.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.290
That seems a little unwieldy.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.550
So let's do the complement.

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.301
So we're going to do 1 minus--

00:23:40.301 --> 00:23:43.610
So we're going to do 1 minus
the probability of no sixes

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.937
and then minus the
probability of exactly one 6.

00:23:46.937 --> 00:23:48.020
That's going to be easier.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.180
So to do no sixes is very easy.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.150
That's just 5/6 to the 12th.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.110
That's just saying all
all the dice are non-sixes

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:01.070
minus the probability of exactly one.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.420
And here, we have to think a little bit
more, but hopefully not too much more.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.580
We want exactly one 6
and exactly 11 non-sixes.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.230
So let's think of a
specific way to do that.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:19.550
A specific way would be, suppose that
we labeled the dice 1 through 12.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:24.770
So one way to have one six would
be if die number one has a 6,

00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:30.170
and the other 11 dice are non-sixes.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.400
But that was just one possibility.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.140
The six could have been
any of the 12 dice,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.070
so we just have to multiply this by 12.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:44.400
And this works out, if you compute
this with a calculator, this is 0.619.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:51.560
So this is a bit less
likely, 5% less likely.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:25:00.110
Lastly, let let's do P of C.
Again I'm going to do 1 minus.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.030
And this time, just
to save some writing,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.040
I'm going to write this as a sum.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:13.430
So I'm going to subtract
off the possibilities where

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:18.450
there are zero, exactly zero,
exactly one, or exactly two sixes.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.450
So we're just going to
subtract off those cases.

00:25:23.396 --> 00:25:26.270
So now here I want to know, if I
have 18 dice, what's the probability

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:28.640
that exactly k of them are sixes?

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.155
So if we draw a little picture, we're
going to number the dice 1 through 18.

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.110
So I won't draw all 18 of them.

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:41.910
Here's the first two and the eighteenth.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.020
And it's pretty easy to draw dice.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.810
Just draw squares.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.860
Now, one possible case,
for example, of k is 2.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.890
And I want the probability
of exactly two sixes.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.790
One possibility would be to
have sixes here and here.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.430
And everywhere else--

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.960
I don't know how to write non-six, but
everywhere else, other than these two,

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.160
is not a six.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.980
That would be one way.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.526
But it didn't have to be die
number one and number two.

00:26:12.526 --> 00:26:13.900
It could have been any of the 18.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.830
Choose two.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.439
So choose any two
positions to put the sixes.

00:26:18.439 --> 00:26:20.230
And then put the
non-sixes everywhere else.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.490
That's what we're doing.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.460
Therefore, we can then
immediately write down, this

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.880
is just going to be 18 choose k.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.210
We're very familiar
with 18 choose k by now.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.740
It's the number of ways to
choose where the sixes are.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.590
And then for the sixes,
it's 1/6 to the k.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.010
And then for the non-sixes
it's 5/6 to the 18 minus k.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.650
This thing that I just wrote down
is called a binomial probability,

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:50.760
and we're going to be
seeing a lot of these later.

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.189
And I know some of you
have seen binomials before.

00:26:53.189 --> 00:26:54.980
But it doesn't matter
at all whether you've

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.810
seen the binomial before in this class.

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.750
What matters is that you
understand where this comes from,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:01.312
not that you memorized it.

00:27:01.312 --> 00:27:03.270
And so whether you've
seen the binomial or not,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:06.220
this should be something that--
just from understanding the concept,

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.720
this should be something that
you can just write down fairly

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.980
easily without memorizing it.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.820
But we are going to see expressions
that look like this a lot in this class.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.430
So that's just introducing it.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:28.220
And if you compute this one
numerically, it's 0.597.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:38.850
So that means A is the most likely,
and c is actually the least likely.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:40.350
So that's the answer.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:45.140
And so what happened was that Newton
basically did the same calculation

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.490
and sent it back.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:49.357
This was in the very, very
early days of probability.

00:27:49.357 --> 00:27:52.190
So there are a couple of things I
find interesting about this, aside

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.010
from the fact that it's just
good practice with writing

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:56.420
these things down.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:03.370
First of all, at the time, 1693, if you
wanted to solve a problem like this,

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.940
you had to go to a
genius, like Isaac Newton.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.812
Whereas now, all you have
to do is take STAT 110.

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:09.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.630
So we've come a long way since 1693.

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.860
That's nice.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.080
The other interesting
aspect to this problem

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.490
is that Newton did the
calculation correctly,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:24.140
but he actually gave an intuitive
argument which is wrong.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.350
And I'm not going to take the time to
go through his wrong intuitive argument

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.962
because it's confusing and wrong.

00:28:29.962 --> 00:28:31.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.140
But Newton got the intuition wrong.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.090
He got the calculation right.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.400
And there's an interesting way--

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.240
if you try to read his
intuition, it's very confusing.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.699
I mean, I actually read the
original a couple of years ago.

00:28:43.699 --> 00:28:45.781
And I was trying to
understand what he was saying.

00:28:45.781 --> 00:28:47.485
It's just this very confusing intuition.

00:28:47.485 --> 00:28:49.610
I mean, I like the fact
that he did the calculation

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:54.860
and was trying to provide intuition,
but the intuition was very confusing.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:29:00.320
So at first, I couldn't tell is
this intuition correct or incorrect.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.090
And then another
statistician, Steve Stigler,

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.350
had a very beautiful argument
showing that Newton's intuition had

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.390
to be wrong, even if you
couldn't understand it.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:17.600
The reason that Stigler gave was that,
if you look at Newton's argument,

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.690
whether you understand it or
not, nothing in that argument

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:24.110
depends on the fact
that the dice are fair.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:28.940
So if you changed the probabilities
for the six sides of the dice,

00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:33.020
Newton's argument would still claim
that this one is the most likely.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.110
But if you change this--

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:38.900
you can easily do a similar calculation
where the probabilities are not equally

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.970
likely for the six sides of the dice.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.240
You can play around with it.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:46.310
And if you want, you can make C the
most likely when it's not a fair dice.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.950
But Newton's argument
would not reflect that.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:50.750
So therefore it couldn't be correct.

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:55.980
That is, Newton's argument is invariant
if you change the probabilities,

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.410
but this result is not.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.540
So anyway, even Newton didn't
find probability that intuitive.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.750
But he was able to do the
calculation correctly.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.920
And now all of you can
do that easily too.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.060
So that's just another
famous gambling problem.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.720
So now the topic for the rest of
today, and the rest of this week,

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.500
is conditional probability.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.620
And I have a lot to say about
conditional probability.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:34.840
We're going to use this
concept over, and over,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.490
and over again for the whole semester.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:41.120
And hopefully you'll continue to
use it even after the class is over.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:50.960
The question that we're
trying to address is--

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.870
we have all these probabilities.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.900
but in practice, you live
each day of your life.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:01.490
And, hopefully, you learn
new things every day.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:04.100
Hopefully, you learn
new things every day.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.900
Now, I said on the
very first day of class

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.050
that statistics is the
study of uncertainty.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:14.810
So unless you're completely,
extremely dogmatic,

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:21.680
and you're 100% sure of
everything, unless that's the case,

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.930
you have uncertainty
about a lot of things.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.160
But you keep learning every day.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.970
At least, that's what
I consider the ideal.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.126
You have an open mind.

00:31:31.126 --> 00:31:33.500
You have some beliefs, but
you have a lot of uncertainty.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.400
You learn new things every day.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.310
So that's a very, very
generic situation.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.990
The question is, how should
you update your uncertainty,

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.470
and update your probabilities,
based on new evidence?

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:45.920
That's the question.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.180
So you can see why that's a central
question in science, and in philosophy,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.700
and just in thinking.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.140
Just how do you update your beliefs?

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:05.820
So how should you
update your probability,

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:14.370
slash beliefs, slash uncertainty
when you receive new evidence?

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.910
If you're doing science
and you do an experiment,

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.560
then you'll learn something.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.810
If you're investigating a crime you
find clues and things like that.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:32.400
You have to update your
uncertainties based on new evidence.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.530
And it's generally a sequential process.

00:32:37.530 --> 00:32:39.810
Because you may have
some probabilities today,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.110
and you learn things later today,
and you update your probabilities.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.350
And then you'll learn more stuff
tomorrow, and you update again.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:49.502
So your old probabilities
get updated to new ones.

00:32:49.502 --> 00:32:51.210
But then the new one
becomes the old one.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:51.930
You update that.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.240
And you keep updating
and updating, hopefully,

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.980
in a coherent, consistent,
logical manner.

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.320
So we're going to develop the
mathematical and statistical ideas

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.700
of how do you do that.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.250
So you can see, this is a very
deep, very broad question.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:13.280
And, in fact, I like to say that
conditioning is the soul of statistics.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:20.080
So possibly that says more about
me than it says about conditioning.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.930
But I don't really know
how to quote myself.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:28.040
But anyway, I'm going to quote myself.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:31.600
That is a good motivating
principle for this course.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.690
Everything relates to conditioning
in one way or another.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.010
So now I've set this up as
something very important.

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:41.740
And let's say, OK,
what's the definition?

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.390
How do we do math?

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:44.990
This sounds philosophical.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:46.490
It's like the philosophy of science.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:51.420
Philosophy of science is
all based on conditioning.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.480
But how do we do math, not philosophy?

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:59.850
Well, we want to write down, what's
the probability of A given B.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:01.830
So this is the notation we use.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:04.720
We have we have one event
given another event.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:08.820
So we pronounce-- we just
draw a vertical stroke

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:10.540
and pronounce that as given.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:16.590
So this is the probability that
A occurs given that B occurs.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:21.780
So our interpretation is that we--

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.280
initially, we had some probability,
P of A, for A occurring.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.120
Initially, we don't know whether
B is going to occur or not.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:37.110
Then suppose that we observe that,
oh, B actually did indeed occur.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.790
Now if A and B are independent,
then that's going to be irrelevant.

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:45.730
But if A and B are not independent,
then that's valuable information.

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.830
And the question is, how do we
update our probability for A?

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:54.960
And the definition is that this
is just the probability of A and B

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.210
divided by the probability
of B, as long as P of B

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:03.540
is greater than 0, since we
don't want to divide by 0.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.880
So that's a very simple
looking definition.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.030
It's just this over this.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:16.660
And it sounds like this very
complicated, general, deep, subject,

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:20.850
but all it reduces to is just
a fraction, this over this.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.880
And we're going to prove
some theorems today.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:26.080
We're going to prove,
actually, many theorems today.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:32.470
But each theorem is so easy, that it may
not seem like how can this be useful?

00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:34.300
But then we're going
to be seeing examples

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.160
over and over again for the rest of the
semester why this is a useful concept.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:43.090
So just to quickly give you some
intuition for this definition,

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.940
I'll explain this in two ways.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.150
I'll call it intuition
1 and intuition 2.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.580
Here's intuition 1.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.124
Just like, why define it this way?

00:35:53.124 --> 00:35:54.790
Because we already have some intuition--

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.070
I already told you the
intuition of what this means.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:01.690
It's the probability of A given B.
So you could say it's a definition,

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:04.120
but I want this definition
to actually correspond

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:08.690
to what we might intuitively think is
a reasonable way to do conditioning.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.080
So intuition 1 I call pebble world.

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:23.940
And for that, we just need to draw a
sample space, S. S is our sample space.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:27.920
Now, we've moved beyond the
naive definition of probability.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.490
So we no longer assume that all
outcomes are equally likely.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:35.420
But let's assume that there are a
finitely many possible outcomes.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.090
Each one is represented by a pebble.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.340
So I'm going to explain
what this picture means.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.370
So just for the sake of
example, I drew nine pebbles.

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:56.900
Nine pebbles, and the
constraint on the pebbles

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.182
is that the total mass equals 1.

00:37:00.182 --> 00:37:03.080
Each pebble has a
certain weight or mass.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.929
The assumption is that
the total mass is 1.

00:37:04.929 --> 00:37:06.470
But that's not much of an assumption.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.770
Because we can always define the units
of mass so that the total is one.

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:15.160
But anyway, we're assuming that we are
using units where the total mass is 1.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.850
That's all we have.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:18.300
This is a sample space.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.470
So if you were paying attention
when we talked about sample spaces,

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.680
that's all possible
outcomes of our experiment.

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.580
So in this example, there
are nine possible outcomes.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.539
And each one, it might
be that they're all 1/9,

00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:32.246
or they might be
different probabilities.

00:37:32.246 --> 00:37:34.790
That is, some of the pebbles
are more massive than others.

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.660
That's the setup.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:44.360
Now, we've talked about the
correspondence between probabilities,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.190
between events and subsets.

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:48.170
So an event is just a subset.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:52.670
So, for example, let's
suppose that this is event B.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.670
So I'll just circle these four pebbles.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.360
Because an event is a subset.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.960
Therefore an event is a set of pebbles.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.760
So suppose that's B, and we want to
do P of A given B. And think about,

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.690
what does that mean?

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:15.050
Well, what that means is, first
of all, the interpretation

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.460
is that we learned that B occurred.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:20.510
Therefore, all the
pebbles that are outside

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.420
of B, that's the other five
of them, are now irrelevant.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.740
Because they didn't occur.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.350
We know that one of these ones occurred.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:33.890
So all we have to do
is get rid of pebbles

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:38.340
that are not in B, in other
words, pebbles in B compliment.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.500
And anything in B complement
is now completely irrelevant.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:44.720
We are restricting to the part
of the space that did occur,

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.540
and we don't care about the part
of the space that didn't occur.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.130
So we just erased these five pebbles.

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:55.600
And I could erase them, but then
you wouldn't see them anymore.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.960
I'll put X's.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.600
You know that they were
there, but now they're gone.

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.300
Now we just have these four pebbles.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:04.166
That's our world.

00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:06.290
We're thinking of the sample
space is the universe,

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:10.700
but our universe got restricted
to B. That's what we're doing.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.199
Now this is our new universe right here.

00:39:14.199 --> 00:39:17.240
We're just going to do the usual laws
of probability, everything the same

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.755
as before.

00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:24.310
And if we want the probability
of A, maybe A looked like this.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.290
If this was A, just for example,
three of the pebbles in A

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.600
were outside of B. Those
are just irrelevant now.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.930
The only part that matters is the
part that's A. That's what this is.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:38.440
A intersects B. That's the pebbles--
in this example there was only one,

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.140
but I could have circled this one too.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:44.414
In this example, there's only
one pebble that's in A and B.

00:39:44.414 --> 00:39:45.580
And we're working with that.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:48.530
The only question is, why
do we divide by P of B?

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:53.890
And the reason is an obvious
technical difficulty.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.259
I said, get rid of these
pebbles that are not in B,

00:39:57.259 --> 00:39:59.050
and then just do what
we were doing before.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.190
The only problem is,
when we got rid of those,

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.850
now these ones don't have total mass 1.

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.760
So all we all we do is renormalize.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.130
Renormalizing is just a
fancy word saying, multiply

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:16.712
by a constant so that the
new total mass equals 1.

00:40:16.712 --> 00:40:19.950
And you can check for yourself,
just with easy algebra,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.710
that this is the correct normalization.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:26.030
That if you divide by P of B, you are
going to make the total mass 1 again.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:29.840
The reason is just that, if we let
A equal B, that's P of B over P of B

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.340
equals 1.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.820
So renormalize to make
total mass 1 again.

00:40:36.417 --> 00:40:37.000
And that's it.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.690
That's the end.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:40.620
So this seems like an
intuitive thing to do.

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.690
We get rid of the part of the
space that was irrelevant,

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.872
and then restrict to that part,
and we need it to add up to 1.

00:40:46.872 --> 00:40:47.830
That's all we're doing.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.121
That's what that definition is.

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:53.580
I promised you two intuitions.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.320
Some people don't like pebble world.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.180
It may have seemed abstract at first.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:03.030
But I promise you that the more you
think about it, the more helpful

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:07.140
it will be, until you finally
feel that it makes sense to you.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.730
But it's also helpful to have another
intuition, so here's intuition 2.

00:41:17.164 --> 00:41:20.080
There are different perspectives on
what does probability really mean.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.100
This is one perspective.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.290
Here's another perspective
that I call intuition 2.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.370
Rather than pebble world, let's
do what I call frequentist world.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.830
In pebble world, we just
do the experiment once,

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.770
and we play around with the
pebbles, and we see what

00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:48.960
is the rational probabilities to use.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.920
In frequentist world, we don't
just do the experiment once.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.160
We repeat the experiment
over and over again.

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.470
I'll just say, many times.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.920
One philosophical objection
to this is, how many is many?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.180
Is it infinitely many?

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.160
Is it a million times?

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.930
And is it really possible?

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:13.800
It gets into all that, is it possible
to step into the same river twice?

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.980
Remember, that ancient Greek asked
that, because you've changed it

00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:18.470
after the first time you step in.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.910
So can you do the same
experiment over and over again?

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:24.810
That's a deep philosophical question,
but let's just assume you can.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.020
You can do the same experiment
over and over again.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.900
And here here's what we do.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.550
Assuming that we can, indeed, repeat
exactly the same experiment over

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:38.170
and over again, then one interpretation
of probability is long-run frequency.

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:40.750
And that's a pretty intuitive--

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:49.170
if you flipped a coin 1,000 times,
and 612 of them were heads, then

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.990
you might say, OK, that probability
is about 612 over 1,000.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:56.100
So you're interpreting probability
as, in the long-run, what

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.430
fraction of the time does the event
occur if you repeat the experiment over

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:01.270
and over again.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:09.570
So now all we need to do is make
a list of all the repetitions.

00:43:09.570 --> 00:43:15.380
So you do the experiment.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.440
I don't actually know--

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.606
I mean, it depends on what
the actual experiment is.

00:43:18.606 --> 00:43:20.650
What do the results of
the experiment look like?

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:23.380
Well, let's suppose we're just
generating some binary data.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.841
I'm just making up some numbers here.

00:43:25.841 --> 00:43:27.840
I'm just pretending it's
binary for some reason.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.670
It doesn't actually matter.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:34.231
0 0 1 1, it's just whatever, 1 1 1.

00:43:34.231 --> 00:43:35.730
We're repeating over and over again.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:38.610
We're generating lots of data.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:46.260
Now what we do is circle the
repetitions where B occurred.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.560
And I haven't defined what
B is, but I am just drawing

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.970
a picture for illustrative purposes.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.830
So I suppose that if this was the
outcome, then, in fact, B occurred.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:04.010
So this one, B did not occur,
this one B did occur, and so on.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.030
So you're just repeating
many, many times.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:08.880
Only select the ones where B occurred.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:19.170
Now among those, just the circled ones,
what fraction of time did A also occur?

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:26.250
So that should be a pretty
intuitive way to think of it.

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:34.910
Because we're just thinking,
well, given that B occurred,

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.300
then we should restrict our attention
to just the circled experiments

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.720
where B occurred, because
we're given that B occurred.

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.630
Among those, what fraction
of time did A occur?

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.630
If you think about this
intuition a little more,

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:51.410
you can also see why
this corresponds to this.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:55.460
So now, let's get some theorems.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.840
We only have five minutes left, but
the theorems are extremely easy.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.700
So we're OK.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:21.670
So theorem 1, suppose that we wanted
to find the probability of A and B,

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:24.590
how would we go about that?

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:29.150
Well, basically I would take
this equation, and I want this,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:36.422
so I would multiply both sides
by P of B. So that's theorem 1.

00:45:36.422 --> 00:45:40.099
The probability of A
intersect B equals--

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:41.390
let's see if I get this right--

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:45.260
P of A given B times
P of B. I'll write it

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.580
the other way, P of B times P of A
given B, using the commutative property

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.060
of multiplication.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.280
So that's true.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.120
We just proved it.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.620
Let's actually prove another theorem.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:03.490
Just to save some writing, I'm
going to prove it in the same line.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:06.540
We could have instead
used P of B given A here.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.400
And to do that, you'll
just swap the A and the B.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.330
But A intersect B is the
same thing as B intersect A.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.370
So I've just swapped the A's and B's.

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:19.840
So if we did it that way, we
would get P of A times P of B

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:25.510
given A. It's the same thing.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:28.510
I just swapped A and
B. So therefore, we've

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:32.770
just derived two theorems
in less than a minute

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:35.320
about how to get the
probability of an intersection.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.490
Question?

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:38.100
Stretching.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.770
Don't worry, we only have five
minutes left, then you can take a nap.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:46.320
So that's good.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.834
Notice, by the way, that if
A and B are independent--

00:46:49.834 --> 00:46:52.250
remember the definition of
independent from earlier today?

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:56.340
That that would have just said here,
P of B times P of A. So independent

00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.060
is the case where P of A given B is
P of A. That says intuitively-- that

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.240
says conditioning on B does nothing.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.060
Well, we're on a roll here.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.600
So let's do some more theorems.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:12.850
Theorem 2-- let me just generalize
this to n of them, A1 through An.

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:15.600
So I want to know, what's the
probability that all of these events

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.280
occur?

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.376
Well, just applying
this multiple times--

00:47:19.376 --> 00:47:22.250
formally, you can use induction,
but I'm just using this repeatedly--

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.270
we're just going to get P of A1.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.390
And then we're going
to do P of A2 given A1.

00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.040
And then we're going to do
P of A3 given A1 and A2.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:40.030
And we're going to keep going like
that, An given all the previous ones.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:47.170
And actually, this is not just one
theorem, but n factorial theorems.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.202
So we are extremely efficient today.

00:47:49.202 --> 00:47:50.558
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.558 --> 00:47:54.220
It's n factorial, because I
could have started with A7,

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.625
and then done A4 given A7,
and kept going like that.

00:47:57.625 --> 00:47:59.500
As long as you're adding
a new one each time,

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.850
conditional on all the previous ones.

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:02.875
So, hopefully, you all
see the pattern here.

00:48:02.875 --> 00:48:05.507
There are n factorial ways to do it.

00:48:05.507 --> 00:48:07.840
I mean, I'm kidding about the
n factorial-- but I'm not.

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.950
I mean, first of all, it's true.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.860
And secondly, for some problems,
if you try to do it in one order,

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.850
it's going to be really hard.

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.430
And if you try a different
permutation, it'll be really easy.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:18.430
So it is useful to think about
these different orderings.

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:23.170
Now, last theorem for today, theorem 3.

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:34.660
I would like to relate P of
A given B to P of B given A.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.770
So I'm going to go back up here,
and I'm going to say, let's see,

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.670
I want P of A given B in terms of P
of B given A. So I'm going to divide

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:54.010
both sides by P of B. P of A given
B equals P of B given A P of A

00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.466
over P of B.

00:48:57.466 --> 00:48:58.660
I just proved it.

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:02.900
I just divided both sides
by P of B, end of proof.

00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.280
This theorem is called Bayes' rule.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.930
And it was discovered in
1760-something by Bayes,

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:16.270
who was a Presbyterian minister, who
was doing probability on the side.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:18.760
So the proof is completely obvious.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.910
I just divided by P of B. The
implications are extremely deep.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.470
There's a whole field of
statistics, Bayesian Statistics.

00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:30.910
Controversies have raged for centuries
just about this kind of thing.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:32.630
As I wrote it here,
it's uncontroversial.

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:36.190
But the question of how to use it and
how to think about it is very deep.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.830
So this is one of the most useful
theorems you will ever see.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:41.310
And yet, it's just easy algebra.

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:43.080
All right, so that's all for today.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.710
I'll see you on Wednesday.
