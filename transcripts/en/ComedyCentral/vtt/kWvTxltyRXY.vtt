-(cheering and applause)
-Welcome back!

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:09.308
Now, a writer famously said

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:12.979
a woman needs a room of
one's own to tell her stories.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.647
It was either
novelist Virginia Woolf

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.582
or<i> Law &amp; Order's</i> Dick Wolf.
I don't remember.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.718
But, uh, either way,
<i>Nightly Show's</i> own Holly Walker

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.054
took it to mean she needed her
own segment to talk about women

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.555
and stuff. So here it is.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.524

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.830
Hi.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:33.499
Welcome to my lady time.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:36.569
It's a special time,
usually once a month.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.704
Sometimes more often.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:42.241
And sometimes
when I'm wearing white pants.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:44.243
Tonight I'm in the tub.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.180
Why? To talk about something
that's even dirtier

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.482
than me. New Jersey.

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:52.351
REPORTER:<i> New Jersey Democratic
 assemblyman Tim Eustace wants</i>

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:55.621
<i> to add menstrual cramps to
 the list of ailments approved</i>

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.323

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.628

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.667
Wow.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.404
Looks like those marijuana
restrictions are really...

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:13.539
cramping their style.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:17.543
♪ Yeah... ♪

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.079
Ah.
(chuckles)

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:23.583
Ladies, we all know
why it'd be great

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.452
to hotbox our hot box
once a month.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.588
But play the clip anyway.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.591 line:0%

uh,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.263 line:0%
this would be a-a less harmful,

<i> less addictive drug.</i>

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:41.701
That's right.
Some of us are taking opioids

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.637
and painkillers every month.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639
I know what you're saying.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:49.308
What are we, NFL players?

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.277

00:01:52.678 --> 00:01:54.113
(cheering and applause)

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:57.116
Mmm. Mmm, that's good.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.252
It is a little crazy.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.587
Especially because in 2014,

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.525
opioid overdoses
caused more than 14,000 deaths.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:08.027
The only women left living large
from that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.963
are the CEOS
of big pharma companies.

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:12.698
Oh, wait.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:16.235
Big pharma doesn't have
female CEOs.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.771
(sighs)

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:20.173
Damn.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:24.177
Another joke foiled
by systemic sexism.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.511
(cheering and applause)

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.513
Mmm.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.849
Mmm, that's good.

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:32.718
Mmm...

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.121
So why do lawmakers have a...

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.524
have to write a special
exemption for menstrual cramps?

00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:41.294
It all comes down to one narc.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.496
<i> Governor Christie
 has long opposed the use</i>

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.097
<i> of medical marijuana.</i>

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.301
That's right. Governor Christie
hates medical marijuana

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.304
almost as much as
he hates governing New Jersey.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:53.273
(cheering and applause)

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:58.711
Oh, this?
(chuckles)

00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:01.314
The trick is to stay ahead
of the pain.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.983
Cut it off
before it gets too bad.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.484
(chuckles)

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.019
Bye-bye, cramps.

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:10.022
Hello, blackouts.
(chuckles)

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.024
Mmm.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:15.027
(chuckles)

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.632
So if you are in pain,
how can you get pot right now?

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:22.635
<i> Right now in the state,

 condition with chronic pain.</i>

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:28.474
Excuse me?

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:32.612
What's more chronic than a pain
that comes every (bleep) month?

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:35.582
-(cheering and applause)
-Ugh!

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:45.291
But Chris Christie would rather
I take traditional medicine.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:46.826
(chuckles)
Don't worry,

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.761
I'm not operating
heavy machinery.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:50.429
For another hour.

00:03:50.462 --> 00:03:52.698

00:03:52.731 --> 00:03:54.567

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:01.907
the best part about...
the best part about this

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.178
