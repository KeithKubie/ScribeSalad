00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.405
MIRA GRANT: So hello.

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:06.550
I'm Mira Grant.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.210
That's Mira Grant's
mom in the back,

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.590
pretending she's not here
with all of us weirdos.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.390
And I am here today
because I was asked to be,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.980
which is a great reason to
be at the Google campus.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.590
So I'm going to be
reading to you today

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.860
from "When Will You Rise," which
is a short hardcover I put out

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.130
a couple years ago.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.260
Because its got some pieces
in it that are actually

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.066
a good length to read and don't
leave you going wait, what?

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.690
The last timed reading
I did, I stopped

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.500
in the middle of a word.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.965
To be fair, it was
a very long word

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:38.610
that I didn't want
to pronounce anyway.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.860
But it was still
sort of a jarring

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.187
for the people involved.

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:43.770
After the reading,
we're going to have

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.070
a brief Q&amp;A. I know some
of you all have books.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.730
I have a pen.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.010
I am happy to scribble
on your books.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.300
I'm actually happy to scribble
on just about anything.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.480
If you really work the Q&amp;A, we
might engage the whiteboard.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.330
So think of questions
that will require

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.840
diagramming sentences
or explaining

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.950
how the R0 works and
we will go there.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.960
So this is "Apocalypse
Scenario, #683, The Box."

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.700
"Andy, where's the beer?"

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.940
"Look in the crisper."

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.590
Ryan paused before
asking the obvious.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.660
"Why is the beer
in the crisper?"

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.450
"Because grain's a vegetable."
said Elsa, sensibly enough,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.470
as she dumps tortilla chips
into a yellow plastic bowl.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.634
"That means beer
is good for you."

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:26.300
"I don't even know
what to say to that,"

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.950
said Ryan, before digging a beer
out from under a wilted head

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.010
of lettuce.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.310
"Is Mike coming?"

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.090
"Mike's coming, Cole isn't."

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.950
Andy picked up the
tray of sandwiches,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.480
pausing to kiss
Elsa on the cheek

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.220
before exiting the kitchen.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.290
The tray of sandwiches
was placed ceremonious

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.180
on the dining room table,
next to a veggie platter,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.890
a bowl of salsa, and a second
bowl filled with peanut M&amp;Ms.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.290
He glanced back, as Ryan
followed him to the table,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.800
adding, "Before you
ask," Sandi's coming.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.410
"She just had to stop and
pick up some root beer."

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.420
"Right."

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.750
Ryan sat in his usual
chair, cracking open

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.530
his first beer of the evening.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.290
He'd stop after the third,
when Sandi's nagging became

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.060
too much for him to handle.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.910
None of this was a
mystery to anyone.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.990
And that was how all
of them liked it.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.139
Playing the Apocalypse
Game for 15 years

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.610
had transformed predictability
into one of the weekly game

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.430
night's greatest attractions.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.952
Spend some time
with your friends,

00:02:15.952 --> 00:02:17.910
play a board game you
didn't really care about,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.060
and plot the
downfall of mankind.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.610
Pure bliss.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.525
Cole's absence was
the only black spot

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:26.650
on what was otherwise shaping
up to be a perfect evening.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.220
She'd been more and more
scarce over the past few years,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.980
as for job, which she
never described in detail,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.170
been willing to say
nothing beyond "I work

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.420
for the government" and "I
still use my medical degree,"--

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.790
kept her away from home
more and more often.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.670
Even saying that much made
her visibly uncomfortable,

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.040
until they all stopped asking.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.840
Still, Cole missing
the Apocalypse Game

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.300
was a new phenomenon-- new
enough to be unnerving.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.480
Out of all the players, she'd
always been the most reliable.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.290
"Remember the time Cole
had pneumonia," asked Ryan?

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.500
She missed two
sessions in a row.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.820
"And then she showed up for the
third session in her bathrobe."

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.100
Andy laughed.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.660
"Mike was so
disappointed when he

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.310
realized she had her
clothes on underneath it."

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.780
"Those were the days."

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.240
Ryan took a long swig from
his beer, amusement fading.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.920
"This is the third session.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.090
She's never missed three."

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.180
"There's a first
time for everything."

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.850
"I'm worried about
her," said Elsa,

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.390
emerging from the kitchen
with the bowl of chips.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.090
"She's been working too much.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.730
She needs the Apocalypse Game
to take her mind off things."

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.814
Ryan snorted.

00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:33.480
"I'm going to give
you a second to think

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.180
about what you just said."

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.460
"I stand by it.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.770
Cole started the game.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.450
She should be able to
find the time to play."

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.600
"I'm sure she'll be back as
soon as she can," said Andy.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.980
"I hope so."

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.270
Elsa sighed.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.780
"Maybe Mike can tell us more."

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.300
"Maybe," Andy agreed dolefully.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.954
Silence descended.

00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:55.370
Their little social group was
just like a thousand others,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.726
all over the world, at
least superficially.

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:59.350
A bunch of old friends
getting together

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.040
to play games and
talk until well

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.490
after any sensible
person's bed time.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.010
They met in high school, a
bunch of strange, smart kids,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.510
living on the fringes
of teenage society.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.180
They clustered together
in self-defense,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.866
as much as anything else.

00:04:11.866 --> 00:04:13.490
It wasn't until midway
through freshman

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.620
year that they all started
to actually like each other.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.560
The first Apocalypse Game
was practically an accident.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.579
They've been lazing
around Cole's house, bored

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.760
and restless and looking
for something to do.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.770
They tried everything
from poker to Candy Land,

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.290
until Cole made her
characteristically mild

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.720
suggestion.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.920
"Why don't we figure out
how to destroy the world?"

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.250
The first scenario
was Cole's, of course.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.750
It involved a chemical spill
wiping out the world's plankton

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.520
supply.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.640
Without plankton, the small fish
died; without the small fish,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.800
the big fish died;
without the big fish,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.450
everything else in the
ocean followed suit.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.146
It was an ineffective,
inelegant apocalypse.

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:51.270
And after they'd spent the
whole night debating it,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.110
Ryan said he could do better.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.720
Elsa dared him to prove it.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.300
A week later he did.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.440
Sandi took the week after
that, and so on, and so on.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.620
High school ended.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.960
College began.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.730
Dan and Tony moved away.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.410
Elsa and Andy got married.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.250
Cole and Mike didn't, although
they may as well have.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.600
And always, always
there was the game.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.200
Maybe it was a
strange way to spend

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.320
15 years of Friday nights.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.820
At the end of the day,
none of them really cared.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.450
The five players
took their seats

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.350
around the dining room table.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.480
The chair next to Mike
remained conspicuously empty.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.260
None of them could avoid
glancing at it at least once.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.170
Cole's absence was palpable.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.660
And it couldn't be ignored, no
matter how hard everyone tried.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.590
She should've been there.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.540
Mike cleared his throat.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.690
"I, uh, brought something.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.880
Well, Cole sent something."

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.964
"Beyond her love, her
regrets, and a promise

00:05:44.964 --> 00:05:46.880
that she'll do her best
to make it next week,"

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.562
asked Sandi, reaching
for her second root beer.

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:51.020
"If you run out,
we're not stopping

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.230
so you can go for
more," said Andy.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.640
Sandi shot him a
glare. "I know that."

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.580
Elsa raised a hand, stopping
the familiar argument

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.220
before it could begin.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.050
"What did she send?"

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.960
"Well, Sandi was
right about Cole

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.920
sending her love
and her regrets.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.520
She also sent this."

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.550
Mike pulled a digital
recorder from his pocket

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.910
and set it down on the
table, between the tortilla

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.610
chips and the veggie platter.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.010
"Tonight's supposed to
be her turn, right?"

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.340
"Right," said Ryan dubiously.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.880
"So what?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.338
She's going to
present her scenario

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.950
and record our discussion?"

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.610
"No.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.490
Cole's presenting
her own scenario.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.330
I'm here to play the game."

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.040
Mike pressed the Play button.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.540
The recorder beeped once before
Cole's sweet, always slightly

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.430
distracted voice came
through the speaker,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.020
just as clear as if she'd
actually been there.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.110
"Hi guys.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.110
I'm sorry I couldn't be
there in person tonight.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.100
But I had things I
needed to take care of.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.430
This is a scenario I've
been working on for a while,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.550
and I think it's pretty solid.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.970
"There will be beeps every
few minutes, like this one"--

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.780
the recorder beeped again-- "to
signal that it's time to pause

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.900
for discussion
before you continue.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.070
I think I've predicted
all your responses.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.100
You could still surprise me."

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.500
There was a third beep.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.160
Mike leaned forward and
paused the recording.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.790
"Well, is everybody
cool with this?"

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.830
"It's weird," said Ryan.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.300
"Weird is good."

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.160
Sandi giggled nervously.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.270
"I guess it's OK.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.630
I didn't want to skip
her turn anyway."

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.090
"Andy, Elsa?"

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.200
"I'm cool with it, sure.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.710
But do you know what's on
the recording?" asked Andy?

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.390
"Not to be a stickler,
but scenarios

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.579
aren't supposed to be
shared before the game."

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:25.120
"She recorded the
whole thing at work

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.245
and gave it to me before
she left for the airport,"

00:07:27.245 --> 00:07:28.080
said Mike.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.160
"I'm not a cheater.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.310
I didn't listen."

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.840
"Then I'm cool with it
too," said Elsa firmly.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.400
"Play the scenario."

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.750
Mike pressed the button.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.660
"If you're listening
to this, that

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.170
means you've decided
to let me take my turn.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.130
Thank you.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.750
I really appreciate it.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.030
Anyway, this is
Apocalypse Scenario #683.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.490
I've never been good with names.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.070
I'm more interested
in the science.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.260
So I call this
scenario, The Box."

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.490
"Sounds promising," said Sandi,
and took a swig of root beer.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.370
Ryan motioned for
her to be quiet.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.290
She stuck her tongue out at him.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.500
Cole's voice
continued, implacably.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.260
"First, establishment
of the scenario.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.470
The Box is based around a
man-made bacterial pandemic.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.054
At the time the scenario
begins, the bacteria in question

00:08:12.054 --> 00:08:14.220
have already been released
into the human population

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:17.190
at several geographically
distinct locations.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.110
All the locations
were in North America.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.190
But they all included
a very high probability

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.980
of intercontinental
transmission within 24 hours,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.800
as in Andy's Ticket
to Die apocalypse."

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.262
"Cute," said Andy.

00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:29.970
"The bacterial strain
you're dealing with

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.930
was designed by a young
researcher employed

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.130
by the bioterrorism division of
the United States government.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.340
It was originally commissioned
under the auspices

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.520
of counterterrorism."

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.289
Cole's voiced turned
briefly bitter,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.540
causing Andy and Elsa to
exchange worried glances.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.720
Bitterness wasn't native
to Cole's state of being.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.260
"The people in charge
lied about it, of course.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.320
That is vital to
understanding the scenario.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.650
It begins with the assumption
that if you reported

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.231
the scenario to the
government, they believe you.

00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.730
Because the government
is the reason

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.500
the situation exists
in the first place."

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.730
The recorder beeped.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.410
Mike hit the Pause button.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.730
"There's our set-up."

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.950
"It's pretty simplistic,
especially for Cole,"

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:09.960
said Ryan.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.170
"Somebody drops a test tube.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.878
Somebody else tells
the people in charge.

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:15.440
And everything gets mopped
up, with minimal loss of life.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.970
The world doesn't end."

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.470
"Nobody dropped a
test tube," said Elsa.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.650
"She said it was released
into the human population

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.130
in 'several geographically
diverse locations,' and implied

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.690
that they were chosen to create
the widest possible infection

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.410
pattern.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.730
This thing was
intentionally released."

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.440
"The government angle still
makes it simple," said Andy.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.670
Sandi shrugged.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.300
"So it will be a
short apocalypse.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.570
Go ahead and press Play, Mike.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.410
I want to hear what comes next."

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.710
Mike nodded and
pressed the button.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.780
The bitterness was gone, when
Cole resumed her explanation.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.520
Instead, she sounded cheerful,
if a little over tired.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.250
"Second, elaboration
of the scenario.

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.160
You're looking at a
bacterial infection based

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.790
on the combination of whooping
cough and tuberculosis,

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.980
just like Ryan's
No Air apocalypse.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.690
Only this time, the
bacteria has been

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.050
tailored for
antibiotic resistance.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.730
"The first generation has
an artificially long latency

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.120
built in, to allow
for extensive spread.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.070
Once the first
generation of bacteria

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.000
have incubated to
maturity in human lungs,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.405
the latency will be halved,
until the final projected

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:16.780
generation, where it will
default to the standard latency

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.420
period for whooping cough.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.540
Symptoms include coughing,
runny nose, headache,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.998
difficulty breathing, muscular
spasms, secondary pneumonia,

00:10:22.998 --> 00:10:24.800
and, of course, death.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.530
Fatality estimates
place the death toll

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.920
at approximately 91% of
the infected population.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.870
It's impossible to accurately
project susceptibility.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.760
The projections indicate that
as much as 80% of the human race

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.610
could be infected by the
end of the second latency."

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:39.270
Beep.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.750
Pause.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.250
"OK.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.570
That's charming."

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:44.200
Sandi wrinkled her nose.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.320
"Has Cole off her
meds or something?

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.420
She's not normally this
nasty with her scenarios."

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.360
Mike didn't say anything.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.360
He reached almost
mechanically for the chips,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.130
scooping up a handful.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.691
His eyes look haunted.

00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:58.440
Something about that
look frightened Andy,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.270
in ways he wasn't sure
he could put into words.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.970
Something was wrong.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.835
"Mike," he said, "you OK, buddy?

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:07.640
Is Cole OK?"

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.520
"She's been working
a lot lately."

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.300
Mike forced a laugh.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.390
"She's just
stressed, that's all.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.716
Let's keep going."

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:16.590
He hit the button before
anyone could object.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.550
And Cole spoke again.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.970
"Three-- three,
explanation of apocalypse

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.450
stemming from scenario.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.700
Buckle up, guys.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.870
Here's where the
real game starts.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.340
"See, this researcher, she was
recruited right out of college.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.910
Her scholarship
to medical school,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.930
wasn't a scholarship,
not really;

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:37.100
it was a government loan.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.930
They'd pay for
everything and she'd

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.950
go to work for them
when she graduated.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.160
They wanted her that much,
because she was that good."

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.860
Something like pride
crept into Cole's voice.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.420
"They knew she'd be able
to change the world."

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.800
Elsa's hand clamped down on
Andy's elbow, squeezing hard.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.950
None of them said anything.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.370
"For a while, she was
happy with the deal.

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.050
She thought she was protecting
the world against the bad guys.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.840
That she could stave
off the apocalypse

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.400
she'd been worrying about
since she was in high school.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.590
She tore viruses and bacteria
apart and recombined in ways

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.290
no one else has ever
been able to accomplish.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.110
"She read.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.470
She researched.

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.980
She was going to
change the world.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:16.476
Only it turned out she had.

00:12:16.476 --> 00:12:18.850
Because she started hearing
about this outbreak in Korea,

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.370
that perfectly mirrored
one of her projects,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.232
one of her defensive projects.

00:12:24.232 --> 00:12:25.690
People were dying
of something that

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.990
sounded a lot like her enhanced
strain of bubonic plague.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.150
"She went to her superiors
and asked them-- asked them

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.040
if they were going to send help.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.040
And they told her to go back to
her lab and get back to work."

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.670
"I saw that on the
news," whispered Elsa.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.880
So many people died."

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.260
Cole continued.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.277
"She got scared
then, our researcher.

00:12:45.277 --> 00:12:47.360
And she started really
looking at the things she'd

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.880
been working on, the things that
were supposed to help people.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.110
Only they weren't
helping people at all.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.270
They were hurting them.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.380
And everyone said
that was OK because we

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.427
weren't the only ones.

00:12:57.427 --> 00:12:59.260
"Every government in
the world was doing it.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.730
And that made it OK.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:01.970
That made it necessary.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.980
Because if we didn't build
it, someone else would."

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.390
She stopped, seeming to
her place for a moment,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.230
before repeating,
"Someone else would.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.650
It wasn't something she could
stop by walking away, you know.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.380
It was going to happen.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.080
We'd made it inevitable.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.939
She'd made it inevitable.

00:13:19.939 --> 00:13:21.480
"So maybe the best
thing she could do

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.950
was stop it all before
it got even worse.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.190
Stop it the only
way she knew how.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.260
Stop the whole damn
arms race for awhile

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.490
and give everyone a
chance to breathe.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.330
For certain values
of every one, anyway.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.350
Because if she didn't--

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:38.820
"Things had been getting
worse for a long time.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.165
Everybody knows that.

00:13:40.165 --> 00:13:42.160
If humanity isn't
stopped, they're

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.950
going to kill the planet,
not just themselves.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.920
Someone had to do something.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.120
She was just the one watching
when the time finally came."

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.700
Beep.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.660
Pause.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.620
"This is sick," said
Sandi, glaring at Mike.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.030
"Why is she doing this?

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.910
There's not even
anything to discuss.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.554
It's just sick, Mike."

00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:03.720
Elsa worried her lip between
her teeth for a moment,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.960
before saying, "Cole never
told us who she worked for."

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.510
"No."

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.130
Mike's voice was bleak.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.670
"She wasn't allowed to.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.140
They made her sign
a lot of papers."

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.080
"A lot of papers in exchange
for what?" asked Andy.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.570
"Medical school."

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.810
Mike pressed the button.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.010
"The release happened
six days ago.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.820
The infection has a
latency of 23 days.

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.990
Additional releases
are ongoing because--"

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:32.990
Cole stopped again,
before starting back up,

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:35.530
sounding more and more
like a broken marionette.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.164
She was running down.

00:14:37.164 --> 00:14:39.330
"Because the government
funded the original project,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.870
they might be able
to find a vaccine

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.700
if they start
looking immediately.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.910
It wouldn't be hard to
type the bacterial strain.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.790
And there are only a few
researchers working with it.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.592
They don't know about all
the modifications that I--

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:53.910
that she-- that were made.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.370
"They'd need to
start right away.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.230
But there's a catch."

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.974
"Isn't there
always?" asked Mike.

00:15:00.974 --> 00:15:02.640
"The researcher who
created the disease,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.710
she's listening in on
all the big channels

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.430
and a lot of the small ones.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.460
She has people feeding
her information.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.280
People who have really good
reason to be loyal to her.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.890
People who see the
same solution she does.

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:17.110
"And if she hears a whisper
from any government, anywhere,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.270
that links this pandemic
to her research,

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.080
she'll release the second
project she worked on,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.530
the bad one."

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.200
"This isn't the bad one?"

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.270
Ryan sounded incredulous.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.090
"I mean, come on, Cole."

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.030
"Here's where things
get dicey, guys.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.840
See, the second virus
isn't bacterial.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.910
It's an actual virus based on
a hemorrhagic out of Africa,

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.490
called Lassa fever.

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.670
It's got a long latency
and a high mortality.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.750
And that's without clever
virologists playing

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.210
with the way it works.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.104
"And this one hasn't
got a vaccine.

00:15:46.104 --> 00:15:48.020
Although it does have a
nasty little interlock

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.189
with the vaccine for
the bacterial strain.

00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:52.480
If you would have been immune
to the original pandemic,

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.810
either naturally or
due to immunization,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.640
you'll get the second
virus and you'll die."

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.130
Cole sighed deeply.

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:00.560
"I'm sorry about that."

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.690
"Is she crazy?" demanded Sandi?

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.010
"I don't know," said Ryan.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:06.670
Cole's laughter
startled them all.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:08.195
Even Mike, who
jumped in his chair

00:16:08.195 --> 00:16:10.620
and nearly knocked
over Sandi's root beer.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.930
It was a brittle, jagged
sound, like broken glass.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:14.430
"OK.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.930
OK.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.440
I give, you guys," she said.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.300
"This 'oh, I have a friend,'
shit is so high school,

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.080
isn't it?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.320
I built the virus.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.450
I built them both.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:23.680
"The scenario is still valid.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.760
The releases started last
week, Manhattan, San Francisco,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.320
and best of all, Disney World.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.620
I put it in misters, just like
Elsa's Black Fungus apocalypse.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:33.610
"Thanks for that, Elsa.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.220
It works great."

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.290
Elsa looked ill.

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.110
Cole kept talking.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.630
"I love you guys.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.570
You're the best
friends I've ever had.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.670
I mean you may be the only
friends I've ever had,

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.680
the only real ones anyway.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.000
That's why I'm leaving
this up to you.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.070
"I vaccinated you all against
the first disease months ago.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.600
You're probably the safest
people on the planet.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.340
Yes, even you Sandi.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.510
I know you slept with Mike.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.620
But I don't really care
about that anymore.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.820
It's too trivial a concern."

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:02.490
Sandi and Mike
exchanged a glance.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:03.940
Her eyes wide and horrified.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.630
His, merely resigned.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.510
Cole kept talking.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.900
"You're all going to live
through what comes next.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.290
It won't be fun.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.540
But you'll live.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.369
"I knew you wouldn't
want to do it alone.

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.319
You're always more
social than I was.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.839
So I've arranged to have a box
couriered to Elsa and Andy's

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.359
place tonight, during the game.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:24.040
"Inside, you'll find 10 doses
of vaccine for each of you.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.079
Use them however you want.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.950
Save your family, or your
friends, or your doctor.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.420
It's up to you.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.250
"You can even give
them to the government.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.560
And if you do, I'll die
with you because I'm

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.640
immune to the first
pandemic, just like you are."

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.720
Cole's voice turned wistful.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.135
"I wish I could have given
you the scenario in person.

00:17:42.135 --> 00:17:45.080
I think it's the best one
I've ever put together.

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.570
I really wanted to.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.850
But in the end, I
couldn't risk it.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.577
I love you all, you all so much.

00:17:51.577 --> 00:17:53.410
"I hope you'll find the
answer that's right.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.170
Because to be honest, I can't.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.120
All I can do is end
the world and let

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.920
you decide how much
of it survives.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.500
This is Cole Evans signing out."

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.850
A pause.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:06.560
And then in a
whisper they all had

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.860
to strain hear, "Forgive me."

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.990
The recorder beeped
one more time.

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.680
Silence fell.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.620
Ryan was the first to react.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.870
He laughed nervously.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:17.931
"OK wow.

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:19.930
That's the best mind fuck
we've had in a while."

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.840
He points to Cole.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.780
"I don't think she was
kidding," said Elsa.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.130
"We haven't answered the
scenario yet guys," said Mike.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:29.820
"Do we call the
government and die or do

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.611
we condemn millions of
people because we're

00:18:31.611 --> 00:18:33.560
too chicken to pick up a phone?"

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.540
"Dude, did you really sleep
with Sandi?" asked Ryan.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.160
Mike didn't answer.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.770
"Won't calling the government
mean killing even more people,"

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.740
asked Andy.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.180
She said the second
virus was worse."

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.100
"We don't know if
that," said Mike.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.180
"Maybe there's only one virus."

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.840
"Because Cole was always an
underachiever." said Ryan.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.120
"If she says there's a
second virus in the scenario,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.190
there's a second
virus in the scenario.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.850
I'm just not buying the
idea that it's real life."

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.220
"Are you willing to
risk it?" asked Elsa.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.590
"We're not risking
anything," snapped Sandi.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.270
"It's a game.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.290
It's a stupid game.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:07.960
And that's all its ever been and
that's also we're going to be.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.760
"Stop taking this so seriously.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.280
Cole is just messing with us.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.740
That's all."

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.000
The doorbell rang.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.670
Silence fell again, thick and
heavy as a curtain going down.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:20.970
Elsa looked around the group,
meeting everyone's eyes

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.220
in turn.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.600
Then she slowly pushed the
chair back from the table,

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.130
stood, and walked
to answer the door.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.460
She was halfway across the
room when the person outside

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.270
began to cough.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.460
So that is The Box.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.320
I did that to my
friends for a year.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.290
Like I'd literally go,
if you have no reason

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.440
to believe I didn't just wipe
out mankind, what would you do?

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.125
I'm a great friend.

00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:48.250
My friend Sean, said he
would go out in the street,

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.820
vaccinate first 10 strangers
he saw, and then eat a bullet.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.320
Because.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:54.110
If I actually done this,
he had failed somehow

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.530
to stop me before I
could get that far.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.780
And I went, that's
the best response.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.141
So does anybody
have any questions?

00:20:02.141 --> 00:20:02.640
OK.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.260
So everybody's freaking
out about Ebola.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.480
Ebola.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.620
Ebola is nasty.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.620
We do not like Ebola.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.590
It's very tragic that it's
killing a lot of people.

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.006
And it's really too bad that
we don't have a good vaccine.

00:20:15.006 --> 00:20:19.890
But the problem with the Ebola
is that it has a very low R0.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:22.480
Now, the R0 is how many
people you can conceivably

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.910
pass the virus along to before
you die a horrible death

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.820
or are somehow no longer
infectious, but still alive.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.020
If you manage the
second, congratulations.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.440
The R0 of Ebola,
on average, is two.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.470
So you can pass it
to two more people.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.920
And that's with an
absolutely idealized chain

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.000
of transmission.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.310
So you managed to bleed,
spit, cry, or piss

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:45.500
on two other people
before you're just dead.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.750
This is why I usually tell
folks that are not actually

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.041
medical professionals, that
if you want to avoid Ebola,

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.300
just don't lick people.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.360
The flu, on the
other hand-- and this

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.630
is why we're all getting
our flu shots this year,

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.430
unless we have a good
medical reason not to.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.652
Any guesses on
the R0 of the flu?

00:21:02.652 --> 00:21:03.475
AUDIENCE: 500.

00:21:03.475 --> 00:21:04.100
MIRA GRANT: No.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.240
Not quite that good.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.510
But it has an
estimated R0 of 10.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.430
So every case of the flu
is good for a minimum

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.620
of 10 additional cases.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.320
And what's really
great about the flu is

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.220
that it is, unlike Ebola,
which is purely body fluid

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.770
transmissible,
fomite transmissible.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.340
Fomites mean that
anything that's

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.880
been touched by our initial
carrier, anything at all,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.240
is now also infectious and
can add to that R0 of 10.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.760
So we've got 10 from the
people you breathe on

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.090
and then an additional three
from stuff you touched.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:37.251
Yeah.

00:21:37.251 --> 00:21:39.470
So get your flu shots.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:42.950
10,000 Americans will die of
the flu this year, 10,000.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:44.950
That's actually not a
good reason to be smiling.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:47.690
I just always am when I'm
talking about the flu.

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.850
It's like a nervous tic.

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:50.820
So that's R0.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.760
The R0 is great.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.890
The R0 is the reason
that sexually transmitted

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.190
diseases are
sexually transmitted

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.975
and not caught in other ways.

00:21:57.975 --> 00:21:59.349
They usually have a very low R0.

00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:01.640
AUDIENCE: So you wrote that
song about the Black Death,

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.960
like 10 years ago.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.280
And just recently, I
started seeing articles

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.046
that are vindicating what you
were espousing in that song.

00:22:08.046 --> 00:22:09.170
How do you feel about that?

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.040
MIRA GRANT: I feel
real good because I

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.559
had a-- the song
she's referring to,

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:13.850
the song about the Black Death.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.240
It's actually called
the "Black Death."

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.420
And it is roughly eight minute
long, schoolhouse, rock-style

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.370
song, explaining why
the causative agent

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.350
for the Black Death
in Europe was probably

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:28.190
not yersinia pestis, or the
bubonic plague bacterium,

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.430
as most people believed.

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.699
But was, instead, an
unidentified hemorrhagic fever,

00:22:31.699 --> 00:22:33.990
that had traveled up the Nile
River to the Middle East,

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.750
and then made the jump
to Messina, Italy.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.240
But I literally took
all of the science

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.150
on the side of the
hemorrhagic fever theory,

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.550
or rather about
80% of the science

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.360
on the hemorrhagic fever
theory, and boiled it down

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.260
into cheerful rhyming verses.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:49.060
Like, well, we
blamed it on the rats

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.420
and we blamed it on the fleas.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:53.300
We were ignoring crucial facts
about the speed of the disease.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.990
And I think it's time
we call for a more

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:55.866
thorough inquisition.

00:22:55.866 --> 00:22:57.906
Because it's clear that
the Black Death possessed

00:22:57.906 --> 00:22:59.349
a droplet-based transmission.

00:22:59.349 --> 00:23:01.265
Now, a droplet-based
transition means I sneeze

00:23:01.265 --> 00:23:02.190
and then you die.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:03.680
It's a fairly common vector.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.450
And we think that's largely
why the quarantine developed

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.320
to protect us from
diseases and to help

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.980
to keep your family from
dying of my sneezes.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.124
So it's eight minutes of that.

00:23:13.124 --> 00:23:15.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.680
And it goes into a lot of very
strong evidentiary support

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.400
for the hemorrhagic
fever theory.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.400
The main reason I think
we should be considering

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.280
this information isn't because
we're somehow magically going

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.889
to bring back the thousands
of people if we say,

00:23:29.889 --> 00:23:31.180
oh, it's wasn't bubonic plague.

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.750
You can get out
of your grave now.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.580
But because when we take
this stuff just as a given,

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.500
when we say, oh, it absolutely
was this bacteria that we

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.480
can easily cure today, we become
a lot less respectful of things

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.170
like plague pits, that
are still all over Europe.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.640
Some of which are in good
permafrost conditions

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:53.600
for the preservation of
virological sustainability.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.250
You crack one of those puppies
open, we could all die.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:00.660
There was a study published,
I think, four years ago now,

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.510
where this one German consortium
said, yes, absolute proof.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.960
We did a core sample
in a known plague pit.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.310
And we found yersinia
pestis bacterium.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.770
So everyone who says that
it's not yersinia pestis

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.527
is wrong and can go home.

00:24:13.527 --> 00:24:15.610
And by the way, it's totally
OK for the people who

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:17.460
funded the study to
dig up the plague pits

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.310
and run a high-speed rail right
through the middle of them.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.690
We all live in California.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.700
If you've lived in California
for more than eight months,

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.890
you have been exposed to the
yersinia pestis bacteria.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:31.970
You probably have it in
the pulp of your teeth.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.330
Because that's one of the
places that it builds up.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.280
So if I were to yank a molar
from every person in this room,

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.940
before Google security
arrested me for assault,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.410
I could test them and find
proof that yersinia pestis was

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.840
endemic on the Google campus.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.570
And thus, clearly, that is what
had killed you all, and not

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:52.000
the crazy woman with the pliers.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.840
So there's very strong
evidence for hemorrhagic fever.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.900
There's very little
evidence for bubonic plague.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.860
There's actually more evidence
on the hemorrhagic fever

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.620
side of things, which is kind
of fascinating when you really

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:04.970
start digging into it.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.830
But everyone accepts that
it was bubonic plague.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:08.380
Why?

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.820
Because their third grade
history teacher told them

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.930
it was bubonic plague.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.990
And that is very sloppy
thinking scientifically.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.881
Now, as she mentioned
here, in the front row,

00:25:18.881 --> 00:25:20.380
in the last problem
couple of years,

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.690
as more people started
really looking at this

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.390
because somebody finally
realized, wait, plague pit?

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:31.660
Let's not dig that up.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.640
Hey.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.550
So they started
really looking at it

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.670
and realizing that there's
some strong evidence

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.710
to support the idea that
this was a novel virus.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.210
And not only that, but
it was a novel virus

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.720
we have not encountered
again, as yet.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.840
Which is part of what is
driving up the interest,

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.710
as more and more
novel viruses are

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.255
emerging from their
natural habitats

00:25:53.255 --> 00:25:55.370
and interacting with humanity.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.000
If we assume that the
Black Death was something

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.640
that made the transition from
the Middle East, to Europe--

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.250
and we have a very strong
chain to prove that-- we have

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.760
the landing and departure
records for the ship

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.030
that is widely accepted
as the first point

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.110
of entry for the Black
Death into Europe.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:19.230
And it sailed out of
Jerusalem, into Messina, Italy.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.730
Yes.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.000
We've got great support.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.730
That could come back.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.382
It could come to visit us again.

00:26:25.382 --> 00:26:27.340
And we would be looking
at a hemorrhagic fever,

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.340
with a fatality rate
of approximately 97%,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:36.131
an R0 of an estimated 15 to
25, and a latency period of 31

00:26:36.131 --> 00:26:36.630
days.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.690
Yay.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.820
So I'm very excited that
all this is coming up.

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.610
It's great.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:44.960
I love the Black Dance song.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.190
I have a huge amount
of affection for it

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.200
because that song is the
reason the CDC started

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.741
talking to me at
all when I was doing

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.080
the research my
first zombie novel.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.110
I called and said hi.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.294
My name is Seanan McGuire.

00:26:56.294 --> 00:26:57.710
Because that is
my real name and I

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.950
had not become Mira Grant yet.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.450
Hi.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.220
My name is Seanan McGuire.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.690
And I want to write
a book about zombies.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.800
And do you have any
researchers that

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.799
would be willing to talk
about diseases with me?

00:27:05.799 --> 00:27:08.010
And they were like, no.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.560
This is the CDC.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.110
We don't get-- Oh.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:13.050
OK.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.926
Well, anybody says that
they might be willing to,

00:27:15.926 --> 00:27:17.300
can I leave an
email address just

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.810
in case someone's like bored?

00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:19.610
Oh, fine.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.234
We'll take your info
if you'll go away.

00:27:21.234 --> 00:27:24.290
And so I start spelling my name
and the lady goes wait, wait.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.798
That's how you pronounce that?

00:27:26.798 --> 00:27:27.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.590
Are you the Black Death girl?

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.130
I'm like, what?

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:35.060
And she says, did you write
a song about the Black Death?

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.337
Yes.

00:27:36.337 --> 00:27:37.670
I'm going to put you on speaker.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:38.590
Prove it.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.100
So I had to say the
entire Black Death

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.790
song for the secretarial
pool at the CDC.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.600
And then magically,
eight doctors

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.240
were happy to talk to me.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.930
So a great deal of
affection for that song.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:55.270
AUDIENCE: How did you
get into diseases?

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.920
MIRA GRANT: Well, I caught some.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.350
And that was pretty neat.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.460
I have OCD.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.670
So I have some of the issues
that people with OCD have.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:09.110
And I realized, when
I was in high school,

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.764
that I was verging on
becoming a germaphobe.

00:28:11.764 --> 00:28:13.180
That I was starting
to get really,

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.950
really twitchy and upset
when anyone was sick,

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.579
with anything, anywhere near me.

00:28:18.579 --> 00:28:20.120
And at that point,
I kind of sat down

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.750
and went, OK, this is nascent.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.834
This is becoming an obsession.

00:28:24.834 --> 00:28:26.750
We can either have it
be the kind of obsession

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.090
where I wind up
living in a bubble

00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:31.030
or we can have it become
the kind of obsession

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.130
where I think that jamming my
hand into a bucket of maggots

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.040
is fun.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.160
Bubble?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.870
Maggots?

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.370
Bubble?

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.550
I like maggots.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.992
Bubble?

00:28:43.992 --> 00:28:45.600
Oh, let's go over there.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.162
So I started reading
up on diseases

00:28:47.162 --> 00:28:48.870
and learning everything
I could because I

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.840
wanted to shift to
burgeoning obsession

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.170
over to understanding.

00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:55.377
Basically, if I knew
enough about them,

00:28:55.377 --> 00:28:56.710
I would still be afraid of them.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.660
But it would be a
respectful fear, rather than

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.640
in irrational fear.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.890
And I was lucky in that
I did it at the time.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:04.860
I knew several
folks that did, not

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.240
who were in a couple
of counseling circles

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.350
with me, in group therapy,
who can't touch things now.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.830
Like they can't pee in public.

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:15.980
They can't share food because
they've gotten so frightened.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.310
Whereas I'm like,
nah, I know the odds.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.210
It's all good.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.830
Let's get tapeworms.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:22.035
It's a party.

00:29:22.035 --> 00:29:23.160
So I started studying them.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.960
I kind of thought about
going to medical school

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.751
for a little while.

00:29:25.751 --> 00:29:27.760
But the money just
wasn't there, sadly.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.350
If it had been, I think I'd be
working for EIS by this point

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.510
and having a lovely time,
going off into the jungle,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.362
and kicking things to see
if they're full of Ebola.

00:29:36.362 --> 00:29:38.320
We still don't know where
the Ebola comes from.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.580
So that is an ongoing
party that just is rolling.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.770
It eats up EIS operatives
like nobody's business.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.260
But viruses and diseases and
parasites are just fascinating.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.770
Like they're older than we are.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.800
Some of them are so old
that they are actually

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.490
a part of our DNA.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.790
If you hear people talk
about junk DNA, the things

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.170
that our bodies intentionally
manufacture in our little DNA

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.060
factories, and then carry
around, that don't do anything,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.890
some of them are viruses that
are older than the human race.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.200
That we've just kind of
programed in there and now

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.171
carry around with us.

00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:10.920
We don't know why.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.330
We don't know what
they're doing.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.092
We don't know what
they might do some day.

00:30:15.092 --> 00:30:16.800
There's always the
possibility that we're

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:19.040
going to have a genetic
therapy or we're

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.770
going to modify
something in such a way

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.960
that it unlocks one
of these protoviruses

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.670
and we all turn
into snake people.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.700
We don't know.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.310
It's the best thing.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.970
It's like hacking
the human genome.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:30.630
And I love it.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.140
It makes me so happy.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.140
And it makes it really hard
to have dinner with me,

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.040
really, really hard.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.230
AUDIENCE: Back to the CDC.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:41.730
I was curious what kind
of zombie questions

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:42.840
you had for them?

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.364
And were they really helpful?

00:30:44.364 --> 00:30:46.030
MIRA GRANT: They were
extremely helpful.

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:48.180
I wanted to put
together a virus that

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.880
could actually make "zombies."

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.870
They're not zombies in
the narrow sense, where

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.420
they died and then resurrected.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:57.470
Because, frankly,
that doesn't work.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.450
You can write horror
or fantasy about those.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.910
But you can't really
do science fiction

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.493
unless they're being controlled
by nanobots or something other

00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:06.020
than the body itself.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.280
And I wanted to do
science fiction.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.970
So it's like, OK.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.447
If I gave them all rabies,
would they be zombies?

00:31:12.447 --> 00:31:14.280
And the CDC is like,
let's talk about people

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.860
that actually have rabies.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:16.810
Oh.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:20.700
Well, what if I gave them
rabies mixed with the bird flu?

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.760
No.

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.782
Well, I heard about
violent behavior

00:31:23.782 --> 00:31:25.990
from people that have been
infected with Lassa fever.

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:26.990
What if I gave-- no.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.780
What if I modified
Marburg and combined it

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.775
with the virility
of a rhinovirus

00:31:34.775 --> 00:31:37.090
and caused it become
completely airborne,

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:39.260
and gave it the entire
population at once,

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.640
and caused massive viral
amplification in anything

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.010
of over 40 pounds?

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.160
Don't do that.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.612
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:48.612 --> 00:31:50.320
Which really was one
of the best moments.

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:54.815
Was just having the doctor I was
talking to, go don't do that.

00:31:54.815 --> 00:31:56.891
Like that's a bad plan
that you have there.

00:31:56.891 --> 00:31:58.390
So that's how I got
my zombie virus.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.280
They were very helpful.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.160
I wound up writing
a lot about the CDC.

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.340
And they enjoyed the things
I wrote about them very much.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.820
They're like, we never get to
play that role in the story.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:11.980
Go team, us.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.330
We're evil.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:14.606
So it was fun.

00:32:14.606 --> 00:32:15.730
They're really nice people.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:17.854
If you ever have the chance
to tour a CDC facility,

00:32:17.854 --> 00:32:19.660
I highly recommend it.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.857
It is, in some ways, weirdly
like going to Google.

00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:23.440
There's big signs
everywhere that say,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.398
no one that doesn't work
here, past this point.

00:32:25.398 --> 00:32:28.239
But on the other side of
that point,m is Marburg.

00:32:28.239 --> 00:32:30.780
So I'm assuming that every room
in this building that I'm not

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.040
allowed to go in, is
full of deadly viruses.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.644
It makes me feel
very at home here.

00:32:35.644 --> 00:32:37.810
AUDIENCE: Seanan, I can
only assume that someone who

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.040
writes as much about
apocalypses as you do,

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.197
has a post-apocalypse plan.

00:32:42.197 --> 00:32:43.530
Would you like to share with us?

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.515
MIRA GRANT: No.

00:32:44.515 --> 00:32:46.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.780
The first rule of
post-apocalyptic survival

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.580
is don't talk about where you're
going to be post-apocalypse

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.512
because then people
will show up.

00:32:53.512 --> 00:32:56.184
I was watching the
science fiction channel.

00:32:56.184 --> 00:32:57.600
I spent the day
after Thanksgiving

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.540
watching all of the
terrible movies on my DVR.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.340
It was amazing.

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.460
Like 13 hours of bad B movies
taped off the science fiction

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.250
channel.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.035
And one of them was
called "Mutant World."

00:33:10.035 --> 00:33:11.180
And it was terrible.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:11.930
It was so bad.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:13.105
It made no sense at all.

00:33:13.105 --> 00:33:15.880
It's like what-- no.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.220
Mutation doesn't like that.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.440
But one of the things I thought
was-- there are frequently

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:26.510
moments of startling realism in
science fiction channel movies.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.615
Like it'll be 98%
random bullshit.

00:33:29.615 --> 00:33:31.490
And then there's 2%,
where you're like, yeah,

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.270
that is exactly
what would happen.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.550
So we opened the movie
with a planet-buster comet

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.490
heading toward the East Coast.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.300
And this family of
survivalists, that

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.339
are part of a survivalist
organization, that

00:33:42.339 --> 00:33:43.880
have been prepping
for something like

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.660
this for the last 20
years, scrambling.

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.650
Going, OK, everybody.

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.670
Go, go, go.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:50.700
Head for the silo.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.850
Stop at the depot.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:52.680
Pick up your part.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.396
Bring everyone.

00:33:53.396 --> 00:33:54.520
They're writing checklists.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.190
They're getting everyone inside.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.880
Now, these are people, who,
it is made very clear, in just

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.000
the five minutes
that we see, everyone

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.540
has been making fun
of for 20 years.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.090
Oh, they're the
crazy survivalists.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:11.340
The fiance of the girl in the
group refuses to go with her.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.520
Because it's just your
dad, doing another drill.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.810
And this is more crazy
survivalist bullshit.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.090
And then, as they are getting
the last of their people

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.780
into their silo and
getting ready to lock down,

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.429
it becomes impossible
to hide the fact

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.908
that the comet is
coming anymore.

00:34:24.908 --> 00:34:26.449
I appreciate the
accelerated timeline

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:27.679
because this movie was
not about the comet.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:28.440
It's about the aftereffects.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.250
We learn all this
in five minutes.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:31.350
The comet is coming.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.500
The president has admitted
the comet is coming.

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.053
And is saying, ah, go to your
basement, you'll be fine.

00:34:36.053 --> 00:34:39.239
And everyone who lives in
the city around the silo, who

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:43.080
knows about the crazy
survivalists, comes running.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.350
They get a Black Friday
level rush on their silo

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:49.980
from people going, I
want to get inside.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.449
I want to be where
the safety is.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.370
I want to be where the food is.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.060
Now, the survivalists
have very carefully

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.570
constructed this silo.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.840
They're figuring its got to
hold them for the next 20 years.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.150
So there's only so much food.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.940
There's only so much water.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.210
And it's a beautiful
grasshopper and the ants moment,

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.810
where the survivalists,
on the one hand,

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.410
are being horrible people.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.210
They start gunning
down people that

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.730
are getting too
close to their silo.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.146
Who won't turn back when they're
told, no, you have to go.

00:35:18.146 --> 00:35:19.124
There is not room.

00:35:19.124 --> 00:35:20.290
There are not the resources.

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:21.980
You have to go home.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:24.770
But the survivalists have also
dedicated the last 20 years

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.930
of their life to surviving
a moment like this one.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.290
So who is actually
in the wrong here?

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.550
The survivalists, who
are shooting people.

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.700
They are committing murder.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.230
But they are
defending themselves

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.940
and they are preserving their
families and their future.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.460
Or the people who
spent the last 20

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.120
years going, ha, ha,
crazy survivalists?

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.630
I'm not going to help you.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:48.900
I'm not going to
give you money to buy

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.900
a place in your structure.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.820
I'm not going to
volunteer some of my time

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.055
to have my kids considered.

00:35:54.055 --> 00:35:55.680
I'm just going to
laugh at you and then

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.930
expect you to help me
when the comet is coming.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.570
So the first rule of a
good survival plan is

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.120
don't tell anyone you're
not bringing with you,

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.410
about your good survival plan.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.860
Because, unfortunately,
everyone has someone else

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.610
they want to keep.

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.594
When I was presented
to the story I read,

00:36:10.594 --> 00:36:12.510
I really did do that to
my friends for a year.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.879
For a year I'd be
like, OK, imagine

00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:17.920
you have no reason to
doubt that I could do this.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.560
What would you do?

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.050
And you'd always
get someone that

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:24.100
argued about the number
of doses of vaccine.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:25.720
You can't just give me 10.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.335
You can't.

00:36:26.335 --> 00:36:28.460
I don't mind that you're
wiping out the human race.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.900
But you have to save
these 30 people that

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.150
are super-important to me.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.190
And I'm like that is
the kind of thinking

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.340
that leads to saving
the entire human race.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.792
That's not my goal here.

00:36:39.792 --> 00:36:41.250
When the comet is
coming, you can't

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.550
save the entire human race.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:43.850
I wish you could.

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:45.480
But that's what a comet's for.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.830
Now, you all live in California.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.070
California is the land
of big earthquakes.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.320
We don't have them very often.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.200
But right now,
we're having a lot

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.020
of rain, which we're
not used to anymore.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.050
And that is leading to
power outages and mud

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.150
slides and other problems.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.190
So when you get home, as you're
thinking about that comet,

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:05.000
think about updating
your earthquake kit.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.020
Get some bottled water in there.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.780
Make sure that you've
got some dry food.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.070
If you're someone that
really requires medication--

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.690
you're on
antidepressants, you need

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.500
a certain painkiller, whatever--
remember that you can usually

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.190
get an extra month from
your pharmacist, just once,

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.731
to put in your kit.

00:37:21.731 --> 00:37:22.980
Those will be good for a year.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.880
At the end of the year,
when they're 11 months old,

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.005
take them out and use them.

00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:27.680
And put your new
refill in there.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.420
So you always have a one-month
supply of whatever pills

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.240
you need to be alive and
healthy and happy in your kit.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.170
So if there is a disruption that
causes us not to have access

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.322
to primary services for
a month, you'll be OK.

00:37:40.322 --> 00:37:41.530
So it's harder for diabetics.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.740
And I apologize.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:47.140
But if it's antidepressants,
you can manage it.

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.640
Yay.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.660
I'm the most cheerful author
you'll ever have talk here.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:54.140
Everybody is going to die.

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.690
My poor mom gets deride
back to Concord with me.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:57.960
I'm all amped up now.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.450
Whoo, death of mankind.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:00.950
Hi.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:03.241
You want me to tell you about
the new book, "Symbiont."

00:38:03.241 --> 00:38:05.610
The new book is the
sequel to the last book,

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:06.960
which was called "Parasite."

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.230
And it's about genetically
engineered tapeworms.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.350
And I had a tapeworm for
a year, to do research.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.600
I went to the Minnesota
Museum of Parasitology.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.180
And they gave it
to me in a pill.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.600
His name was Timmy.

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.310
And you have never seen
a horror like the look

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.040
on the face of your
dining companion

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.090
when you say oh, no, I
get to use the royal "we."

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.940
That is book two of a trilogy.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.669
So the first book
was "Parasite,"

00:38:31.669 --> 00:38:32.710
which came out last year.

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:35.510
It's available in both
hardcover and now in paperback.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.290
This is "Symbiont,"
which just came out.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.940
The Tuesday before Thanksgiving,
my bioengineered tapeworm book

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.220
comes out.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.930
That's some planning, Orbit.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:45.330
Yay.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.740
And then, next year about
this time, the third book,

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:49.060
"Chimera," will come out.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.170
And that is it.

00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:50.670
We're done.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:51.240
We're closed.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.920
I finished book three
and turned it in.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.370
What's awful is I did initially
sell this is as a duology.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:57.620
So halfway through "Symbiont."

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.120
I'm calling my agent and
going, we have a problem.

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.590
What's the problem?

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.120
Remember how I said I
could write a duality?

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.190
Yes.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.292
It out I was wrong.

00:39:09.292 --> 00:39:11.090
Ha, ha.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.630
Please contact
Orbit and ask them

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.610
if they'll let me
publish a third book.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.450
What if they say no?

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:20.410
Then we publish second
book with no ending.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.300
Yay.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.260
But fortunately, they agreed
to let me have a third book.

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.780
I really like them.

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:28.080
I am very excited by tapeworms.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.490
I find the hygiene hypothesis
extremely compelling.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.580
The hygiene hypothesis
holds that the reason

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.360
for the rise in allergies
and autoimmune disorders

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.980
among the population is because
for literally millennia,

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.690
humans lived alongside with,
and affected by, parasites.

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:46.840
Almost everyone would
have a parasitic infection

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.170
at some point in their
lives, possibly more.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.590
Sometimes they'd just have
systemic parasitic infections

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:52.950
for their entire lives.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.890
And they didn't have
very many allergies.

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.360
And they didn't have very
many autoimmune disorders.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:03.470
These are all relatively recent
developments as far as "human"

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.480
goes.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.430
What the hygiene
hypothesis holds

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:11.150
is that our immune systems
evolved to be hypervigilant,

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:13.360
so that they could fight
against those parasites

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.120
and keep them from killing us.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.070
So an immune system, in
the absence of a parasite,

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:21.020
is sort of like a five-year-old
boy with a baseball bat,

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.270
standing in a room
full of breakable shit.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:24.960
Now, maybe your
five-year-old boy

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.390
will become content just
balancing the bat on his hand

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:28.860
and going whee.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.800
But most five-year-old boys
are going to start going, huh.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.800
OK.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.300
And I will say that during the
year that I have my tapeworm,

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.980
I fewer colds and my allergic
reactions were less severe.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.490
There is human testing
going on right now,

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:43.120
with controlled
hookworm infections,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.400
to treat celiac and
Crohn's disease.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.500
AUDIENCE: You talk about
this tapeworm, Timmy--

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.650
MIRA GRANT: Timmy.

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:50.790
AUDIENCE: --in the past tense.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.950
MIRA GRANT: Timmy is
no longer with us.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.310
I miss him dearly.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.400
But it's all right
because his ghost still

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.510
haunts my digestive tract,
sapping nutrients from my soul,

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.055
instead of from my body.

00:41:01.055 --> 00:41:01.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.250
It took rather more
courses of antiparasitics

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.880
than planned to
get rid of Timmy.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.505
So there were a couple
Facebook updates

00:41:07.505 --> 00:41:09.546
that only made sense to
a small number of people.

00:41:09.546 --> 00:41:10.850
It was like yeah, Timmy's back.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:12.110
And they were all going
not, that's not yay.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.920
That is the opposite of yay.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.060
My best friend spent like a year
making me wear gloves or wash

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.870
my hands before I
touched anything.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.020
I would wash my hands,
walk out of the bathroom.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.070
And she'd be like no,
go wash your hands.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.320
They're still wet and smell
like-- go wash your hands.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.490
OK.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.020
But Timmy is no longer with us.

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.910
Because this is being
recorded for posterity,

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.260
please don't ask about the
process of getting rid of Timmy

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.950
because you probably
don't want to know.

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.770
And I'm pretty sure no one else
in this room wants to know.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:38.800
I wish I didn't know.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.050
But I'm going to have to
know for the rest of my life.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.820
So no.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.830
Yes, mom.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.040
Mom has her hand up.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.470
Mom would like the microphone.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:50.250
AUDIENCE: Like roundworm is
passed from person to person.

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.100
If you touch someone-- if you
touched the roundworm, how

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:53.800
do you get--?

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.010
MIRA GRANT: Well, roundworm
is not actually parasite.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:42:00.710
Roundworm is a fungus that
just grow-- seriously.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:03.580
Roundworm is a fungus
that grows in this shape.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.689
That's why you can get rid
of it with a topical cream.

00:42:09.689 --> 00:42:10.980
AUDIENCE: Or fingernail polish.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.850
MIRA GRANT: Or
fingernail polish.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:17.390
So there are a lot of fun
ways to get parasites.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.640
The most common fun way
of getting a parasite

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:25.590
is what we call fecal/oral.

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.980
Guess what he's eating?

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.030
Stuff.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.680
And the fun thing about
fecal/oral transmission

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.420
is-- did you know
that every time you

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.560
flush your toilet without
putting the lid down,

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.900
its sends aerosolized toilet
water through the bathroom.

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:42.430
So if your toothbrush is
too close to the toilet,

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:46.163
you're brushing your teeth
with feces every time.

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:48.330
Yay.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.724
Everybody get a
toothbrush cover.

00:42:50.724 --> 00:42:51.610
Yay.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.740
And put the freaking lid down.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.000
Yay.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.500
It's not just a girl thing.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.197
It's "I don't want
your cholera" thing.

00:43:00.197 --> 00:43:02.030
There are lots of ways
of getting parasites.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.600
The most common
parasite in the world

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.960
is, unfortunately, malaria.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.910
Which is not a thing the
hygiene hypothesis supports

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:11.090
because the malaria
parasite kills you.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.940
And that is so small
that most people catch it

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:14.740
from mosquitoes.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.640
So a mosquito bite passes
the malaria parasite along.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.950
And it lives in your body
and everything gets awful.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.690
We treat malaria as a
disease because it is.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:24.670
Disease is a very
catch-all word.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.930
But it is a parasitic infection.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:32.890
Tapeworms are generally gotten
by eating undercooked meat

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:35.930
or by fecal/oral transmission.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:39.040
If you touch the
dirt in your garden,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.820
and a coyote has peed
there or pooped there,

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:45.320
and then you touch your mouth,
you can get coyote tapeworms.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.530
Every species on Earth
has different tapeworms.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.810
And they all prioritize
a different part

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:52.450
of the body to hang out in.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:55.640
So like pig tapeworms,
which are trichinosis-- it's

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.870
most common kind in humans
right now-- pig tapeworms are

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.600
bad because pigs are
so similar to humans,

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.960
that pig tapeworms are
like, hey, I can live here.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.210
And they have a little party.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.100
And sometimes they get bored
and they migrate to your brain.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.660
And that's not fun for
anybody, not even the tapeworm.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.910
Because once it's in
there, it can't figure out

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:13.534
how to get out.

00:44:13.534 --> 00:44:16.487
It's like, fuck.

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.820
It's like going onto the
Google campus for the tapeworm.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.860
It's never getting out.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.240
It is stuck.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.060
It cannot find visitor parking.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.410
It cannot leave.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:26.970
And it's going to get arrested.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:28.310
It's terrible.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.862
Coyote tapeworms, on the
other hand, infect your eye.

00:44:31.862 --> 00:44:33.320
And once they are
there, they start

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.800
chewing holes in your retinas.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:38.400
Now, you know what
doesn't grow back?

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.350
Your retinas.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:43.340
So you will actually go blind
if you get a coyote tapeworm.

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:45.380
Raccoon tapeworms
go for the liver.

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.700
Goat tapeworms are a lot
like the pig tapeworm

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.790
in that they parasitize
your digestive system.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.680
But goats are enough
different from humans

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.050
that the goat tapeworm
is like-- whaa--

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.340
I'm just going to hang on
here and drink some blood.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.256
And hope my mom comes
to pick me up soon.

00:45:01.256 --> 00:45:02.306
This sucks.

00:45:02.306 --> 00:45:03.930
AUDIENCE: Wasn't
Timmy a goat tapeworm?

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.490
MIRA GRANT: Timmy
was a goat tapeworm.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:07.698
I did not want a tapeworm
that was hugely comfortable

00:45:07.698 --> 00:45:08.210
in my body.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.040
I wanted my tapeworm
to understand

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.970
that it was a temporary
tenant and was being evicted.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:15.320
Fish tapeworms, their
entire reproductive cycle

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.080
is disrupted by being
in the human body.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.260
They don't know what to do.

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.870
So they will actually reproduce
at such a prodigious rate

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:22.470
that they clog up your stomach.

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.900
And you can't actually
eat or drink anymore.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.510
You can die of dehydration
because of the number of fish

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:28.629
tapeworms in your stomach.

00:45:28.629 --> 00:45:30.920
This is not as good of a
weight loss plan as it sounds.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.574
Tapeworms are great.

00:45:34.574 --> 00:45:35.865
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] terrible.

00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:36.290
MIRA GRANT: Oh, yes.

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.530
But you'll lose a lot of
weight before the doctor has

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.840
to go in and remove
the giant worm, Bezoar,

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.404
from your stomach.

00:45:42.404 --> 00:45:44.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:52.170
Now, you really know that
if you ask a question,

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.310
I say horrible things.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.600
Come on.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.970
I am morally obligated by
the length of the drive

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.704
to continue talking for at
least another nine minutes.

00:45:59.704 --> 00:46:01.620
Technically, we have an
hour and nine minutes.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:02.960
But you all are more
interested in laughing

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.251
at me than asking me questions.

00:46:04.251 --> 00:46:07.109
So that's probably
not going to happen.

00:46:07.109 --> 00:46:07.650
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.590
So what's better
than taxoplasmosis?

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:13.620
MIRA GRANT: Not
having toxoplasmosis.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:14.830
AUDIENCE: Come on.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.910
Is there anything
that affects humans

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.601
in a more interesting
way than that?

00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:21.100
MIRA GRANT: So toxoplasmosis,
which is a parasitic infection

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.760
that you get from
your cat, is great.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.360
Because what toxo wants
us to be in a cat.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:30.320
But a lot of parasites
are kind of like humans.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.840
We grow up in our
parents' houses.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.160
Then we go off to college.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.354
Then we get an apartment.

00:46:36.354 --> 00:46:37.520
We don't like the apartment.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.550
So we move back into
our parents houses.

00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.150
So that's kind of primary
host is the parents' house.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.320
Well, the
toxoplasmosis, it really

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.510
wants to live in the cat.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:51.120
But the eggs and the tiny toxo
get passed out of the cat,

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.689
through feces and urine,
and wind up in the cat box.

00:46:53.689 --> 00:46:54.980
Well, they don't like it there.

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.400
It's kind of terrible there.

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.944
So they wait for rats and
mice to come into the cat box,

00:46:58.944 --> 00:47:01.110
looking for things to eat,
or just kind of scuttling

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.490
over waste, as happens.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:05.400
And then, hey, I live in
a shitty apartment now.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.220
Its name is Mickey.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.950
And once they're
living in Mickey Mouse,

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.530
the toxo goes into
the mouse's brain

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.790
and rewires it to take
away the fear of cats.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.262
So mice, rats, squirrels,
anything small,

00:47:18.262 --> 00:47:19.720
that would normally
smell cat urine

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.390
and be like nope,
nope, nope, nope,

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:25.150
it rewires their brains so
that they're like, oh, cat pee.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.150
I want to see if I can
find the source of that.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:29.580
And they go looking for cats.

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.760
And then they're like hi.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:33.680
And the cat is like, OK,
schlomp, and eats them.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.710
And the toxo gets to move
back into its parents' house.

00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:40.120
This is a great loop if you
happen to be toxoplasmosis.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.980
However, because
humans keep cats,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:46.380
we have a lot of cat pee
and cat poo in our homes.

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.290
And we wind up
interacting with it.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:51.140
And people can be infected
with toxoplasmosis.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.820
They found that women
with toxoplasmosis

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.300
become more outgoing, more
promiscuous, and more likely

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.990
to wrap their car around a tree.

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:02.900
Men with toxoplasmosis actually
become less contentious,

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.960
more social, more mild,
and a little bit worse

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.397
at "World of Warcraft."

00:48:08.397 --> 00:48:10.230
Like they've genuinely
found that for women,

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.320
it decreases driving
skill and for men it

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:13.560
decreases reaction time.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.350
So you're worse at twitch games.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.620
And where we're worse
at getting home alive.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.540
Now, since we do not
have cats large enough

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:26.380
to eat people anymore--
yet-- for toxoplasmosis,

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.760
humans are a dead end.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.699
Toxo does not want to be in us.

00:48:29.699 --> 00:48:30.740
Because it can't get out.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.190
It can't get back to
its parents' house.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:37.400
Unfortunately, it's very hard to
test for toxoplasmosis in cats.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:41.760
And toxo can be extremely,
extremely dangerous.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.030
Most cases, in adult
humans, in folks

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.500
that not immunocompromised,
will be symptomless,

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:48.665
other than the small
personality changes.

00:48:48.665 --> 00:48:51.040
Which, let's face it, if you
have enough cats that you've

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.860
come into contact with
that much cat pee,

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.600
no one's going to notice.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.600
But it can cause blindness.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.540
It can cause serious, serious
danger to unborn children.

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.120
So pregnant women, or
women who are attempting

00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:07.720
to become pregnant, should
not clean their own cat boxes.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.230
Not being the United
States government,

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:13.095
I will not say women who could
potentially become pregnant,

00:49:13.095 --> 00:49:14.220
should not clean cat boxes.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.630
But if you decided, hey,
I want to have a baby,

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.040
make your boyfriend
clean the cat box.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.310
That's what he's for.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:24.750
Or, in my case,
anyone that's not me.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.340
So toxoplasmosis is great.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:30.020
We actually don't have anything
that modifies human behavior as

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.619
severely as toxoplasmosis.

00:49:31.619 --> 00:49:33.160
There are a couple
of other parasites

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:35.660
and fungi that mess with other
members of the animal kingdom

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.430
that much.

00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:38.540
The cordyceps fungus
is very big right now.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.910
Everybody loves codyceps.

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.110
Whoo, cordyceps.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:42.910
But it only reprograms ants.

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.590
There's a really great parasitic
barnacle that attacks crabs.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.640
And it is a castrator.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.190
It's a chemical
castration process.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.790
So it gets onto male crabs.

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.469
It cuts off their little
crabby testosterone equivalent.

00:49:54.469 --> 00:49:55.760
It's not actually testosterone.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.551
I don't remember what
it is because I'm not

00:49:57.551 --> 00:49:58.600
a crab scientist.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.430
And then it slowly
rewires the crab

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.500
to think that it's a girl crab.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.200
And then once the crab has
decided that it's a girl crab,

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.099
the barnacle starts exploding
in the crab baby place.

00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:11.140
And then the crab will
spend the rest of its life

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:13.800
nurturing and caring for this
barnacle, that has literally

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.950
devoured its sexual organs and
taken it out of the gene pool.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:18.600
So that's super-fun.

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.650
That is not something that
goes for humans-- yet.

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.980
Science is a miracle.

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:24.742
Yay.

00:50:24.742 --> 00:50:26.700
AUDIENCE: I like hearing
about all this disease

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:29.770
season and natural
biology kind of stuff.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:32.497
And do you have some favorite
books you could recommend?

00:50:32.497 --> 00:50:34.080
MIRA GRANT: I highly
recommend reading

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:35.871
the "Return of the
Black Death, the World's

00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:38.260
Greatest Serial Killer,"
which is actually

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.910
a book about the hemorrhagic
fever theory of the Black

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:41.410
Death.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.920
It includes the primary
epidemiological evidence.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.564
And it's considered
a pop science

00:50:46.564 --> 00:50:47.980
book, which doesn't
mean it's bad.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.090
It means that it's
written to be accessible.

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.470
So it does not assume that
you have a medical degree,

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:54.804
going in.

00:50:54.804 --> 00:50:57.220
I actually do recommend the
"Hot Zone" by Richard Preston.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.800
It's very dated now.

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.490
But it includes some
really good links

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.700
to primary and
secondary sources.

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.570
And it'll give you
a grounding in why

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.580
Ebola is terrifying,
but difficult to catch.

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.480
And not worth worrying
about more than the flu.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:13.390
For parasites, take a
look at "Parasite Rex,"

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:15.300
which-- oh, you've
read "Parasite Rex."

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:16.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:18.176
MIRA GRANT: Excellent.

00:51:18.176 --> 00:51:19.050
That is a good thing.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.580
Have you read "Ghost Maps?"

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.861
MIRA GRANT: "Ghost
Maps" is the story

00:51:22.861 --> 00:51:24.880
of John Snow and the
downstream pump handle

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.616
and the birth of modern
epidemiology, which is great.

00:51:28.616 --> 00:51:29.490
AUDIENCE: Ghost what?

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:30.802
MIRA GRANT: "Ghost Maps."

00:51:30.802 --> 00:51:31.427
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:31.427 --> 00:51:32.220
Oh, yeah.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.970
MIRA GRANT: Also take a look
at the "Barbary Plague,"

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.136
which is the true story of
the bubonic plague in San

00:51:36.136 --> 00:51:38.860
Francisco at the turn
of the 19th century

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.580
and why anyone who tells you
that San Francisco is not

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.760
a city built on
racism is an idiot.

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:47.124
We literally built a
fence around Chinatown

00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:49.540
because people had decided
that all the bubonic plague was

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.900
coming out of Chinatown.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.240
And the only reason
it was not burnt down

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.870
with all of its residents inside
is because someone pointed out,

00:51:56.870 --> 00:52:00.290
at the last City Council meeting
before we lit the matches,

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:03.360
this might be bad for tourism.

00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:06.010
Like they were literally going
to burn the Chinese residents

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.880
of San Francisco to
death, alive, because

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.360
of the bubonic plague.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.610
Yay, racists.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:14.420
So that's a super-fun book.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.080
I love it a lot.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.330
"Virus X" is good.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.940
And then there's-- I think
it's called "Virus Detectives,"

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:23.860
is the title.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:27.820
The true story of the EIF, the
Epidemic Intelligence Service,

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.780
which is the virus-- oh, yeah,
virus detectives at the CDC.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.010
They are subbranch of
the CDC, whose job it

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.300
is to walk into the worst places
is in the world with a stick,

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.620
and go, let's see
if this kills us?

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.660
Nope.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.670
Nope.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.830
Get a bigger stick.

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:46.500
They're great.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:47.480
I love the EIS.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.724
They are fantastic,
fantastic people.

00:52:49.724 --> 00:52:50.265
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:50.265 --> 00:52:52.630
So on Tumblr, Sarah
Rees Brennan recently

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:54.550
had a post about that
killing characters

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:57.190
off, which you commented
on, and threatened

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:58.190
to collaborate with her.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:59.969
Which, sign me up
for preorders now.

00:52:59.969 --> 00:53:02.010
But I'd love to hear you
talk about-- she started

00:53:02.010 --> 00:53:04.680
to talk about-- this character,
I put him in there to get

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.560
killed off for
reasons X, Y, and Z.

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:06.693
MIRA GRANT: Yeah.

00:53:06.693 --> 00:53:07.360
I tried that.

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.680
I tried that once.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.060
I had this character who was
completely intended to die.

00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.660
Like their whole
purpose was to die.

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:14.743
Every one talked about how
they were going to die.

00:53:14.743 --> 00:53:16.290
They didn't die.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:17.600
Their best friend dies.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.960
I was a little startled by that.

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.440
I'm like wait,
what just happened?

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.227
My subconscious lies to me
a lot, like a lot, a lot.

00:53:24.227 --> 00:53:26.060
Because it's the only
way that I will embark

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.110
on these 10-book series
without going nope,

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.590
I've got too much TV to watch.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:32.861
So I will frequently
find myself getting to,

00:53:32.861 --> 00:53:34.860
like, I'm 2/3 of the way
through with this book.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:35.610
It's great.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:38.070
I'm going to be
with the duo-- ah,

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.945
the ending is still
like 180,000 words away.

00:53:41.945 --> 00:53:46.200
Has this been a
trilogy all along?

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.110
Because I don't let myself
understand the scope

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:50.822
of what I'm embarking on.

00:53:50.822 --> 00:53:52.530
There's at least one
character whose life

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.720
was saved by a coin flip, which
means that another character's

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.134
life was ended by
the-- no, there's two.

00:53:58.134 --> 00:54:00.550
There's two characters in the
same series, where I'm like.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:04.280
I could kill person A, or I
could kill person B, A or B,

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.000
A or-- I'm going to flip a coin.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.790
Sorry.

00:54:08.790 --> 00:54:11.070
Which is interesting
because the coin really

00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:13.260
likes killing white dudes.

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.354
I appreciate that.

00:54:14.354 --> 00:54:15.770
I literally had a
position where I

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:19.942
had a Chinese American and
a Russian Jewish American.

00:54:19.942 --> 00:54:20.900
And I flipped the coin.

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:22.274
It was like kill
the Russian guy.

00:54:22.274 --> 00:54:24.584
Oh, sorry, Dave.

00:54:24.584 --> 00:54:26.500
The person I named him
after was very put out.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:30.450
So I'm not I'm not as
foreshadowy as Sarah.

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:32.910
But Sarah Rees
Brennan, who is lovely.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.280
She's absolutely splendid.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:37.280
She's this tall.

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.770
I'm only exaggerating a little.

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.410
She's actually 6 foot.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:42.040
She is enormous.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.700
And she is proportionate,

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.200
So she looks like you
have just taken someone

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.780
and sized them up on
the Sims height scaler.

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.870
Everything has gone.

00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:51.510
She's not a tall, thin person.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:52.444
And she's Irish.

00:54:52.444 --> 00:54:54.610
And she has one lazy eye,
that sort of wanders about

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:56.314
and looks at other things.

00:54:56.314 --> 00:54:57.730
It's not actually
looking at them.

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.170
But she'll tell you it is
because she's horrible person.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.794
And when she's having
a bad day, she'll

00:55:01.794 --> 00:55:03.240
get on the--
schlomp-- I need you

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.550
to read me Veronica
Mars porn over Skype.

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:06.610
I'm like, OK.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:07.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:10.765
I can do-- you have come upon
a coping mechanism I can meet.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.770
It's like having your
very own evil leprechaun.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:18.560
And she is absolutely splendid.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.494
I love Sarah to death.

00:55:19.494 --> 00:55:21.410
And she's one of the
most bloody-minded people

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:22.610
I know that is not me.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.460
We get along fabulously.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.793
She's one of my favorite humans.

00:55:25.793 --> 00:55:26.820
She's also a YA author.

00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:28.990
So she gets a lot
of crap for stuff

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:32.470
that I get no crap for at
all, which frustrates us both.

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:33.480
Not because I want crap.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.190
But because no one deserves
crap for things like,

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.070
I freely admit that
I wrote fan fiction

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.035
because I'm trying to
be aspirational for all

00:55:40.035 --> 00:55:41.830
of the young women of the
world that might someday

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.380
want to become
professional authors.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:48.860
I get people going, wow,
Mira Grant like fan fic.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:51.070
And she gets people
going, plagiaristic slut.

00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:54.110
And I'm like, how, wait-- no.

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:54.810
Sarah, come on.

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.640
We're going to leave now.

00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:57.950
And she actually joins in.

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.120
When I say for science,
she'll be like yes.

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.680
Let's eat all of these
pies for science.

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:05.140
So we ate a lot of pie.

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.770
And Sarah is splendid.

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:08.592
If you like YA fiction
at all, or if you

00:56:08.592 --> 00:56:10.550
have someone in your life
who likes YA fiction,

00:56:10.550 --> 00:56:13.670
I really recommend her
Lynburn Legacy books,

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.450
which are the story
of a girl named

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:19.140
Cami and her imaginary
friend, who is not imaginary,

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.340
but is very, very hot.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.450
And Sarah had written
the first of those

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:25.170
before we actually
became friends.

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:28.580
Which is why I will give
her endless oceans of shit

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.470
for the fact that there is
a rhyme about the Lynburns

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:33.640
in the Lynburn Legacy
that does not scan.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.740
I'm like, no, no, honey.

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:39.340
No, no, no, no.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.730
Your poetry has to scan.

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.270
That's what poetry is for.

00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:45.930
Apple red, corn of gold,
and not everyone gets old.

00:56:45.930 --> 00:56:47.730
Like no, no.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:48.620
No, no.

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:50.420
We can fix this.

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.429
If you had just time traveled
six months into the future,

00:56:53.429 --> 00:56:55.220
it would have been like
we are friends now.

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:56.990
I would have fixed it for you.

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:59.410
So I get to fix these
things for her from now on.

00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.420
Sarah is splendid.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:02.550
Sarah is best.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:05.790
AUDIENCE: I know that
your oeuvre is broad.

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:10.480
But I want to ask you-- I
think of you most strongly

00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.185
in the Newsflesh--

00:57:12.185 --> 00:57:13.310
MIRA GRANT: Many people do.

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:14.210
AUDIENCE: --trilogy.

00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:19.290
And I want to ask, of the
embarrassment of riches

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:26.530
of zombie media and literature
available, what do you like?

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.550
MIRA GRANT: Well, the problem
is in my reading tastes,

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.440
I am just as dichotomist.

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.200
Because I really love the
literary equivalent of the bad

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.550
B horror .

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:40.090
Like if you completely
commit to what you're doing,

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:41.600
I am with you.

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.590
I will follow you into
that dark, terrible place

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:45.931
of terrible, dark darkness.

00:57:45.931 --> 00:57:48.430
But I'm like, oh, you're doing
something interesting and new

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:49.660
and I've never seen this.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.080
Let's follow you into
the intellectual fields

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:54.479
of halcyon flowers,
which is bad.

00:57:54.479 --> 00:57:56.520
I highly recommend the
"Raising of Stony Mayhall"

00:57:56.520 --> 00:58:00.150
by Daryl Gregory, which
is essentially the zombie

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.689
Jesus book.

00:58:00.689 --> 00:58:01.980
And it's a beautifully written.

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.380
It's absolutely ingenious.

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.200
I do like Jonathan Mabery.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.910
He was a very, very sweet man.

00:58:08.910 --> 00:58:12.020
And he has his "Dead of
Night," "Fall of Night,"

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.630
x of Night books.

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:17.290
Jonathan is a really nice
guy, who puts up with the fact

00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:19.216
that I know that his
virology is crap.

00:58:19.216 --> 00:58:21.840
And I give him crap for his crap
virology every time I see him.

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.440
He's like yes, yes dear.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.810
Not all of us review.

00:58:25.810 --> 00:58:27.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.752
I think that's meant
to be a compliment.

00:58:29.752 --> 00:58:31.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:32.250
It's not.

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.510
But we can take it.

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:36.230
I hate mentioning
it in this context

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:38.479
because it kind of gives
away some of what it's about.

00:58:38.479 --> 00:58:40.550
But the single best
book I read in 2014

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:43.940
was the "Girl With All
the Gifts," by M.K. Carey.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:45.540
It is only out in
hardcover right now.

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:46.960
Though it is also an ebook.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.500
If you see it in
a bookstore, it's

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.240
a very yellow-orange cover,
with just the silhouette

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.050
of a girl like this, against it.

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:54.310
And it's genius.

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:55.850
It's so good.

00:58:55.850 --> 00:59:00.120
And I wish I wasn't telling
you as much about it

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.860
as the context of the
statement tells you.

00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.360
But is so worth reading.

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.070
It is so worth your time.

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:13.020
And it is a beautiful example of
how gender equality in science

00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.994
fiction doesn't have to
be a thing you work for.

00:59:15.994 --> 00:59:18.410
One of my favorite movies of
last five years was "Wreck-It

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:21.000
Ralph," which, if you
look at "Wreck-It Ralph,"

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.500
they completely, effortlessly,
without any visible strain,

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.980
any compromisation of the
story, any unnecessary romance,

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:35.380
set up a thing where your
protagonist and your secondary

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.580
protagonist, who I can't
pronounce right now--

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.780
you have two men and two women.

00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:45.960
In the antagonist camp,
you have a man and a woman.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.554
And there's no effort.

00:59:47.554 --> 00:59:49.470
There's no point where
you feel like, oh, they

00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:51.630
made Taffyta a girl because
they wanted to have balance.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:52.130
No.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:54.080
They just made a
female character,

00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.660
who was an absolute bitch.

00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:56.650
And it's lovely.

00:59:56.650 --> 00:59:58.654
And it's beautifully done.

00:59:58.654 --> 01:00:00.070
And the "Girl With
All the Gifts,"

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:01.465
manages a very similar balance.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:03.090
Where you're reading
through and going,

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:04.880
there is no character
who is in here

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.710
to be the dude, the
chick, the-- this.

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:11.410
They are just people who are
stuck in this bad situation

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:14.200
and trying to survive
this bad situation.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.440
And it's beautiful.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.950
This is absolutely lovely.

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:20.600
And then David Wellington, who
did Monster Island trilogy--

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.349
he did "Monster Island,"
"Monster Nation,"

01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:25.480
"Monster World"-- has
a new book coming out.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.150
Which I just blurbed for him
and I'm very excited about.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:34.320
And it is called--
I don't remember

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.820
what it's called,
which is terrible.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.710
Because it has no cover.

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:38.370
And the covers are
what I always remember.

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.453
But it's David Wellington.

01:00:39.453 --> 01:00:41.650
And he is great.

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:44.300
So I see people looking
at watches and such.

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.800
So I assume you
have work to get to.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:48.250
Do we have any other questions
before I sign books and we

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.650
all-- oh, yes, we have
one other question.

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:55.520
AUDIENCE: So where did you
get the Mira Grant name from?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.980
MIRA GRANT: It's
kind of fun there.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.580
It is a combination of factors.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.650
I wrote down every last
name I could come up

01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:06.310
with that had one or more
references to classic horror

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:08.460
and science fiction movies.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.720
And it was purely movies.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.557
I stuck with those.

01:01:10.557 --> 01:01:12.390
And then I wrote out a
bunch of first names.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:13.561
And take them to my editor.

01:01:13.561 --> 01:01:15.060
Because my editor
had said he really

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.935
wanted me to have a
pseudonym for these books

01:01:16.935 --> 01:01:18.780
for very valid reasons.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.840
And said I want to
be Samantha Grant.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.180
And he said, OK, the
dot.com is unavailable.

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:30.910
Can we get the dot.com The
dot.com for Samantha Grant

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:34.380
is being camped by a soccer mom,
who has not updated since 1994,

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.590
and would not give
me her domain.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:40.620
I don't mind you having
the domain of your name.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.929
But maybe update it.

01:01:41.929 --> 01:01:43.720
And when you're coming
up with a pseudonym,

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.780
it turns out that being
able to get the dot.com

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.280
is a hugely important factor.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.250
So we went down the first
name list and we hit on Mira.

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:55.940
I have not had anybody
find both of the directions

01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:00.850
that they came from, for
which I am sad, so sad.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:05.380
People will sometimes hit on one
or the other, but never both.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.390
So sad.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.010
But, also, Mira Grant is
great because my last name--

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.010
my real last name is
McGuire, which when I sign,

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:15.950
is a great big M and a C and
a great big G and a squiggle.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:18.410
Mira Grant is just a great
big M, a dot, a great big G,

01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:19.560
and then a squiggle.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.070
So it made my signature
much easier to come up with.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.900
So thank you for having me.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.350
[APPLAUSE]
