Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lash fromW and y. S. E n n p. R. Three two one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. And lately we at radio lab have become a bit robot obsessed and we met a guy. All right. My name is Latif Nasser, he's a Grad student in the history of science department at Harvard. And he got us thinking about really old robots like hundreds of years old. And I, for example, I've heard rumors whispered by store, mostly a about a pooping duck approve. Oh, so the pooping duck is really famous. Actually the duck wasn't really eating and pooping. They had like a store of like pre pre pooped duck poop. I don't know what it was. Look like duck poop maybe. And you would feed this robot duck and then watch it actually pool. I mean, all you see is you see sort of this in and this out and people believed it.

Speaker 1:          00:57          People thought this was a, this was a pooping duck. Um, and so we talked about a bunch of these ancient robots and most of them were kind of funny. But then he told us about one in particular that was actually, it was kind of haunting. Yes. Not poopy at all. So the year is a 1562 this is 450 years ago, not so long after Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella, and as a new king of Spain. Phillip. Phillip. Yeah. And he has a son, the 17 year old crown prince. His name is Don Carlos. And one day he's in the royal lodgings. I was walking down a flight of stairs. He trips, he falls, he bashes his head against a door near the bottom of the stairs. This is the crown prince, you say the crown prince of Spain. So this is a national clam, but it is a national calamity because he's the heir apparent.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Right. So, so, well at first it doesn't look like it's such a bad injury. He's still conscious, but then his head starts to swell to this kind of crazy size. He becomes delirious and feverish. He's struck blind. Oh. And so at this point the, the king comes right? This is King Philip the second. So he is at this time, he is the most powerful man in the world, right? So he basically controls the, all of the Americas. He controls much of Europe. The Philippines is named after him. He was tight with the pope at this time. The pope and the king were kind of like, you know, BFF. So, so the whole Spanish court is going nuts. Um, across the country. People are uh, seeing this, reading this as a kind of sign that uh, that God's very angry. Right. And so they're, they're fasting.

Speaker 1:          02:33          They're doing these kinds of uh, prayer precessions things like this. And according to a lot, if the king calls all the best doctors in Europe to come to Spain to help his son and these doctors are trying everything. They are drilling a hole in his skull to relieve the pressures, relieve the pressure. They are bleeding him and blistering him. And they are purging him to the extent that he has like 20 bowel movements within just like a certain hours. They're like smearing all over the wound. They're, they're smearing like Turpentine and honey and Pudong Carlos, even after all of this, um, they sort of look at each other. They, they look at him and it's kind of like, this is, he's going to die. It's so he's dying. Yeah. He's basically on his death.

Speaker 2:          03:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:26          so at this point, according to lot of the king goes to the son, Legend goes that he kneels beside his son at his son's death bed and he makes a pact with God. The pact is, if you help me, if you heal my son, if you do this miracle for me, I'll do a miracle for you. Wow. Let's, that's uh, it's quite a hubris stick of a, of a human being to say to God, Oh, a little Tulsa. Remember the, he's the, he, the most powerful men in the world at this. He is a god among men. Really? Yeah. You bristly or not? This is, this is what he says. Yeah. Okay. All of a sudden his son just gets better. Really within a week. He can see again within a month. He, he, it's as if he didn't

Speaker 3:          04:15          volatile.

Speaker 1:          04:17          He just pops right back up.

Speaker 3:          04:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:20          And King Philip must have thought, well my God, this is exactly is my God. It's probably exactly what he called and when his son can finally speak, he says to him, Dad, you know, the weirdest thing happened when I was out. I had this dream. Oh, that's a great story. This is Elizabeth King. I'm an artist and a professor in the Sculpture Department at Virginia Commonwealth University. She's actually the one that hooked a lot. Tough on the story. Yup. In any case, the dream, there are documents of Don Carlo next morning saying that he had had a dream, this vision that better there a figure in a, in a Franciscan habit, shaved head sharpen, knows this marvelous monk entered his room and approached his deathbed holding across and basically told him, you're going to be fine. And that's quite well documented. Apparently there was a witness in the room, in the sick room with him that night, overheard the prince talking to a ghost, sort of mumbling things in his delirium.

Speaker 1:          05:20          So Don Carlos has this stream. Suddenly he's fine in the natural question that people are asking is who is this monk? Yeah, yeah. I mean is it just a generic Mongo? Is it somebody specific? Some Messenger from God and from his description, physical description and the shaved head. The point he knows the monks habit piercing eyes, even though kind of cross, he was using kind of everybody in town, the king, everyone was like, oh yeah, like we know exactly who this guy is. Can only really be one guy kind of local fryer who died a hundred years before named a Diego de Alcala, Diego de Alcala.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Who is he? He is a local holy figure who was corpse was associated with a number of documented miracles. In fact, this guy was so holy in this town, actually not just in the town. You want to know something? There's a bit of trivia ever heard of San Diego, California you mean? Yeah, as in the Padres. What does he have to, is this the same guy? Same guys, but he was the patron saint of the people who found it. San Diego is holy, so holy in this town. Then people believed his corpse is 100 year dead corpse, had healing powers. And some people, they're different stories. But some people say that even they, uh, these, that unbeknownst to Don Carlos, that night that he had the dream, the priesthood and the king himself according to some stories went and they got this corpse out of the church, out of the crypt.

Speaker 1:          06:53          They carried it through the streets. They brought it to the bedroom. They literally put it, they sort of snuck it in bed with a don Carlos. And that's how you healed. They didn't stick him in bed with this bone. Right. They just say they brought him into the room. There's different reports. There's a picture of him in this engraving. Oh. Um, and if you can, you probably can't see it, but look at this picture right here. She had a, uh, a copy of a 16th, see roughly of 16th century woodcut showing you this scene where you could kind of see, oh wait, so he's in bed. The two men in bed together or about to be, well, they couldn't be, you know, they could be just laying him down. Okay. Caught in the middle. Meanwhile, back to our story, you got Philip the second who has asked God for a miracle. God came through through this monk and now fill out the second is like, oh, I got to deliver King Philip the second. Oh, he's got a miracle. Yes he does. And he's, he's acutely aware of this. So basically what he does is he enlists this really renowned clockmaker a clockmaker. Yup. Named one Nelo Tory Yana one Nelo two Riano. Yeah. A huge band, upbeat ox of a man described as always being filthy and blustery and model a lot of fun to beat.

Speaker 4:          08:20          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:20          But a great, great clockmaker. Certainly among the best in Spain, maybe the entire holy Roman empire. So the king goes to this guy and he says, look, I want you to make a mechanical version of Diego de Alcala. What? A mechanical version of this 100 year dead holy priest. Yes. Like a mechanical monk. A robotic Ponderay. Yeah. Which, and this I did not expect, still exist now the monk bodies in the Smithsonian. Perfect working order. No Way. I swear, I swear that since 1977 no. Yeah. The first time I saw this speaker, I was drawn to it and then repel. That's Carlene Stephens. She is a curator at the Smithsonian in DC. About a week after I left the fund I spoke, we ended up in DC meeting with her and she showed us. Oh Wow. Wow. The monk who lives in a little glass case, what we have here is an automaton over 400 years old.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Um, so the first, is this the first robot that we know of? No, no, no, no. Idiot. The ancient Greeks had things that could be considered robots. Okay. Back to our story, 450 some odd years ago. Our clockmaker, what's his name? Tory Yanno Dariano. He goes into his shop and he does whatever he does next one gear to another, to another for hours, weeks, months. No idea how long it takes and I don't think anybody does, but emerges one day into the bright sunshine with luck. What did you call it? A robotic Ponderay. Yeah. It's a 15 inch high figure made of wood and iron has the sort of habit, has it, the sandals, has the rosary, has the cross and poking out at the top of the habit is a little bald, hairless head with that sharp nose, like a, like a razor. And the rather ferocious, I like intense or like a like doing business.

Speaker 1:          10:26          Ferocious like I'm focused, I'm focused like maybe I'm only 15 inches tall but I am focused on something much bigger than you. You human. So did you like turn it on or push something? Yeah, that, why would I get on a train and go for three hours? Just look at it. Obvious question. Okay. Do you wouldn't mind? Sure. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Do it. So Carlene takes us out into the hall, we sit down on the floor, she gives lot tiff a little brass key. He sticks it into the secret slot in the, amongst the side, I think it goes counterclockwise. You went can, you would tend to want to do it this way and lots of winds up the monk turning it counter clockwise and it's surprisingly sort of taught how much should I turn. And so if you sort of wind up this sort of secret spring, I think there's a stop and it'll, okay. All right. I'm going, I'm going put it on the ground, right. All right. You let them go. Give them a place. Walk very slowly.

Speaker 5:          11:26          One foot after the other coming out from under the Catholic. In fact, there's actually a little wheel under there, but yet you see the teeth coming out. The head is turning from right to left. The eyes are rolling in the head and mouth is opening and closing is if it's sort of monitoring like a prayer, the arms are in motion. One arm is raising and lowering cross. The other arm is beating the chest. Wow. A symbolic gesture. Who? Catholic that is called the mayor. Kulpa after three or four steps in the arm holding the cross though something new, it moves to different new directions to bring the cross to the mouth. And the figure kisses. The clock. It's bodily. Like mesmerizing. Yeah. Yeah. The next thing is doing is it's turning and moving in a different direction and then walking its paces and kissing across as we watched it turn once, then twice, then three times, four times. Let it go back to where it started. So if you imagine a table with a number of people sitting around it, probably it's going to sort of at one point or another head for you and then turn away and head for someone else and then turn away.

Speaker 1:          12:45          Why would the king of Spain who could have, you know, I don't know, built a church or, or taking a crusade to Jerusalem or done something, you know, he could've done anything. Why did he decide to commemorate his son's revival by making a little automatic doll? Like what was that for? Yeah, lots of, what was he thinking? Yeah, it's a, it's a good quote. That's the $64,000 question. It's a great question. It's a really good question. The truth is there's really no way to know for sure. As a historian, I gotta, I gotta rely on the documentation and this not a whole lot of that in this case, but one interpretation certainly could be that, you know, the king had this amazing, miraculous thing happened to his son and now we had a way of sharing that with his subjects because he's got this device where it's a, it's an illusion, like the machinery of it.

Speaker 1:          13:31          It's completely hidden. There's no visible man that's, yeah. That's one of the craziest parts that it's all sort of hidden underneath the, the robe. So when he put it down on a table or in a court yard, people would have seen it move on its own. They would have been amazed as we were, and he could have said, look, here is the miracle. Look what God did for our country. God likes Spaniards. Yeah. Look at what God did for Spain, which would have been a useful thing for a king to be able to say, right? Yeah. That's, so that's one possibility. The other is it just on a more utilitarian level? This was a machine that was built to pray and this was a period when you could by prayer repetition. So if you had the money, you could get someone to pray for you while you go do something else.

Speaker 1:          14:14          Oh, that's, you're cool. You're covered, you're covered. And if you think about it from Phillip's perspective, he needed to say thank you to God. And here he had this thing that if he wound up was an automated thank you machine. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Can we thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Or it could be, I love you, I love you. I love love. It could also be, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It could be please, please, please, please, please. But if you need, but if you think about it more expansively says lot of like, what did it mean at that time to be a catholic? Like what did it really mean? Well then this robot was maybe the Catholic you could ever hope to be. What counted his prayer was, was, was quite specific in the sense that if you say the right things and, and do the right actions in the right order, in the right time and in the right place, Sorta, that's prayer.

Speaker 1:          15:07          That's when God notice it. So it's about method, it's about method, it's about, and maybe this monk he says was like method embody. That's a good one. I mean, why not, right? It is in fact perfect. It repeats itself over and over and over and it replicates the idea. So it's basically what it is is a little, a little teaching object. Like this is what you're aiming for. Here's how you do it. Like this is it, this is the perfect prayer. It's a perfect prayer. This is doing it the perfect way every time. And I, because I'm, I'm just this, you know, lowly, imperfect human. Um, I'm not, I can only aspire to this perfect piety that you're making this up or do you think that this might, the monk might've actually been seen this way. It could be true. I don't think it's so crazy, especially if you think about what was happening at that moment and this is counter-reformation Spain, right?

Speaker 1:          16:00          Not so long after Luther, you know, is nailing his theses on the wall and there's this big debate raging about how actually do you get closer to God and you'll have the kind of protesters with with Luther who are saying it's not about you know works. It's not about saying something this many times. It's about whether you feel it and then you have the kind of Catholic argument, which is to say you do these rituals because these are the rituals and these are the way you get. This is the way you get close to God. This is the way you pray.

Speaker 5:          16:26          You pray like this thing Josh, like this thing. If you're a Catholic Kenyan, if God's a Catholic, you better hope he is and if you're filled the second you look at the sky and you say, God,

Speaker 1:          16:43          you and me are square special. Thanks to a lot of Nasser. Yes. Latte. Yeah. Graduate Student at Harvard History of Science Department and to Sarah [inaudible] production help on this story. Thanks. Also to the amazing Elizabeth King, Carlene Stephens at the Smithsonian end to David Todd. David actually, um, is himself an expert. Clockmaker he constructed a, a replica of the monk, which is actually what we heard because at the monk itself is very old and you don't want to be winding that thing. But big thanks to David Todd, we couldn't have done this piece without him. And actually he and Elizabeth King will be publishing a book soon, which is called a machine, a ghost, and a prayer. The story of a 16th century mechanical monk. And thanks. Lastly to Stephen Vitiello, who recorded clock sounds in David Todd's workshop, which we used in the piece. Huh? I'm exhausted from this thing.

Speaker 6:          17:46          I see so much gratitude. And of course, thank you. Really? Yes. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
