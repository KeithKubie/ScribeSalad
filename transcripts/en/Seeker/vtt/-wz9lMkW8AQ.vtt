This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the all-new G Flex 2, from LG.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:04.980
Life’s Good

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.010
Water repellent metals?

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:08.860
Yup, that’s a thing now.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.690
Hi gang, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.390
We’ve all seen corroded metals, whether
it’s the wall of an abandoned building or

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.110
an old pipe that’s sprung a leak.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.060
Metals corrode because we use them in environments
where they are chemically unstable; only copper

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.960
and the precious metals like gold, silver,
and platinum, exist in nature in their metallic

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960
state.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410
More common metals like iron are processed
from minerals and unstable, particularly in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.820
the presence of water.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.430
Preventing corrosion usually means adding
a chemical coating to a metal’s surface,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.430
making it hydrophobic.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.360
At CES 2015, Belgium-based Europlasma, a global
leader in low pressure plasma technology,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.550
showcased its nanocoating technology for the
electronics industry.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.969
The Nanofics coating makes any electronics
highly water and oil repellant.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.490
The problem with any kind of hydrophobic coatings
that they can wear off.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.680
But we might not need these kinds of chemical
coatings much longer.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.010
Two scientists from the University of Rochester
recently led a team that developed a laser-patterning

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.590
technique that makes metal hydrophobic without
the need for any kind of coating.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.299
They’ve also used the same technique to
make metals absorbent, metals that can pull

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.569
water along uphill on a surface.

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:14.359
It all comes down to the pattern lasered onto
the metal.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.170
By creating an intricate pattern of micro-
and nanoscale structures on the metal’s

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.889
surface using ultra-short powerful bursts,
structures that become an intrinsic part of

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.399
the metal, giving it completely new qualities.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.079
This process can make an ordinary metal a
multifunctional surface that repels water

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.459
and absorbs light.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.310
This process makes the surface so resistant
to water that droplets actually bounce along

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.310
the surface.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.990
It’s actually more slippery than teflon!

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.590
A drop of water would roll off this lasered
metal if you tilt it to just 5 degrees.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.659
This kind of resurfacing could have widespread
applications.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.819
Metal surfaced in this way could prevent rust
and corrosion and simplify issues of anti-icing.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.579
In developing countries, super hydrophobic
materials could make rainwater collection

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.919
far more efficient and create toilet facilities
that are far more sanitary.

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:57.200
In parts of the world lacking clean water
and healthcare, these would be significant

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200
applications.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.439
But we’re unfortunately a ways from that
happening.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.639
It currently takes an hour to pattern a 1
inch by 1 inch metal.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:07.240
The process will need to develop before it
can be applied to large structures like toilet

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
facilities.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.450
Still, it’s pretty exciting.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.450
What do you guys think?

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.170
How cool is it that we can change the surface
properties of a metal with lasers!?

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.040
