DIANE SOLINGER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:02.970
I'm Diane Solinger.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.761
I'm the Manager of the
Googler's Give team.

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:07.480
We're the team in Google
in People Operations

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.800
that helps Googlers volunteer
and give to charitable causes

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.140
and impact issues
that they care about,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.890
whether it's in their back
yard, around the world.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.460
And today is World Food Day.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.810
It's a day that is focused,
obviously, on food,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.280
but it's really focused in a lot
of ways on the absence of food.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.560
And that's why today is
also launching our team,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.430
Googlers Give and the
[INAUDIBLE] food team

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.650
are launching the
Hunger Relief campaign.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.400
This campaign is
in its third year.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.660
We're pretty excited to work
in partnership with our food

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.950
team that is all
about food, to try

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.850
to help people that
don't have food,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.530
and particular focus
on children who

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.582
are on the brink of starvation.

00:00:52.582 --> 00:00:55.110
Today it's talking
a little bit more

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.764
about the global picture of
hunger and hunger relief,

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:01.930
but also about what's
happening in our own community

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.870
here in the Bay area where
Google is headquartered.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.290
We're really fortunate
to have representatives

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.500
from Stop Hunger Now, which has
been a great partner for Google

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.252
and Googlers.

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:14.460
Many Googlers have been
volunteering with Stop Hunger

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.310
Now over the course
of the past two years.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.300
And we've been
volunteering to pack food,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.000
like this, which we'll
show you later, and send

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.370
to schools and
children, particularly

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.350
around the world who are really
not getting the nutrition

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.540
that they need.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.200
Their model is unique,
and Rod will tell us

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.640
a little bit about that.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.430
We also have the Second Harvest
Food Bank with us today,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.100
which has been a
partner of Google

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.757
for a very, very long time.

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:43.090
Many of you know Alan Eustace,
our Senior Vice President

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.790
of Knowledge.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.620
He works very closely,
annually, with the food bank

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.100
to do a very fun extravaganza
at Costco in Mountain View.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.870
And that event just keeps
getting bigger and bigger.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.709
And what we've seen not just
with the Second Harvest Food

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.500
Bank, but with food
banks around the world,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.916
Googlers are getting
more involved

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:02.750
in trying to help their local
communities with food security

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.250
issues for people
in their hometowns.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.930
So we're going to start with a
bit of an overview, World Food

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.900
Day, what's the
landscape out there

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.710
and what is the face of hunger,
and it looks very different

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.800
depending on where
you live in the world.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.840
If you are in
Nicaragua, which we'll

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.240
hear from Eddy and Jennifer
about their experiences

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.580
in Nicaragua, it's going to
look very different to maybe

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.815
what it looks like
here in East Palo

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.030
Alto or the East
side of San Jose.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.690
But hunger is real.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.730
There are over
800 million people

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.830
in the world that don't
get enough to eat.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.540
And yet, we know there's
enough food for everybody.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.470
We're just not
getting it to people.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.990
You think of climate
change and how

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.910
that's affecting the ability for
people to grow crops in the way

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.760
that they used to.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.718
And we were just talking
about even the drought

00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:52.710
here in California.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.190
We've got to think
about how we farm

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.710
and what our natural
resources are going to be like

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.470
as climate change affects that.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.730
So what does that mean
to the small farmer who

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.690
is reliant on just
rainfall and doesn't

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.380
have the systems in place
to get water to their farms?

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.250
And how does that
trickle down, literally,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.130
to their families
and their children?

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.370
And then what does
that mean systemically

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.830
for kids that don't have
nutrition, whether it's

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.500
in a local school or in
Nicaragua and can't learn?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.420
What happens then?

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.060
So food is the basic need--
food, water, shelter.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.500
Think about the basic thing
that people need, we need food.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.930
And not enough people
are getting the food

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.630
that we actually currently have,
and then in the future what

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.480
is that going to look like
when climate change affects us,

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.880
or other instances that
we can't even predict.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.750
But food is a basic
need, and that's

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.250
what World Food Day is about.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250
That's what the Hunger
Relief Campaign is about.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.000
And that's what these two
great organizations are about.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.260
So I'm going to kick it
over to Rod Brooks who's

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.080
the CEO of Stop Hunger Now.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.100
It's based in North
Carolina, but the history

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.584
of this organization
is pretty fascinating.

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:02.000
And as you'll notice with both
these organizations, Second

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.030
Harvest and Stop Hunger
Now, there's a plate

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.540
and there's some utensils
around both of their logos.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.280
So it's [INAUDIBLE] let's
get that food in you.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.710
But the history of Stop Hunger
Now is really interesting

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.010
because food banking
was a part of it.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.899
But then where you've
evolved, and just

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:19.769
give us the high level
scope of the view

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.410
that you have with
your organization

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.419
on the hunger issue.

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.210
ROD BROOKS: I will.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.047
Well, thank you, Diane,
really, for inviting

00:04:25.047 --> 00:04:27.130
us to be a part of this
event, and for kicking off

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.000
this hunger campaign that
you're initiating today.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.370
As we get started here, I
want to invite everyone just

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.910
to let you know that we will
be entertaining your questions.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.160
So we have some things
to share with you today,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.284
but really we're hoping
this can be a conversation.

00:04:40.284 --> 00:04:41.650
We invite your questions.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.750
So be thinking
about what you might

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.570
ask at the end of
our presentation.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.737
But I wanted to start to
just first by giving you

00:04:50.737 --> 00:04:52.820
some more information sort
of from the global view

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.430
about world hunger.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.020
Diane just shared some
information with you.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.630
Right now there are, in
fact, 805 million people

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.080
around the world who
are malnourished,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.420
who suffer from hunger
on a daily basis.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.360
That's one in every nine of us.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.530
Now, think about it.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.440
If one in nine of
us in this room

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.630
were malnourished, didn't
have the food they need,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.690
would there be any
other priority?

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.065
Would there be
any other priority

00:05:19.065 --> 00:05:22.840
than making sure that
those individuals had food.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.645
That's a question we
have to ask ourselves.

00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:28.480
Of the 805 million
that suffer from hunger

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.840
every single day,
about 25,000 a day

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.380
die from hunger and
hunger-related causes.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.970
That number is astounding to me.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.559
Particularly, as you
mentioned, Diane,

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.100
when there's enough
food in the world

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.850
to feed every single person.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.890
40% of those suffering
from hunger are children.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.760
Why is it that children
have to die every single day

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.510
from the lack of
food when there's

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.260
enough food to feed everyone.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.590
That is really why we're having
this conversation here today.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.530
As we think about
those numbers, it's

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.020
easy to get depressed
or a little more

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.460
than challenged, frankly,
overwhelmed sometimes.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.397
But there's actually some good
news to share around these,

00:06:10.397 --> 00:06:11.980
and that is in the
progress that we're

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:13.840
making towards ending hunger.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.370
So the United Nations
just recently announced

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.542
its annual Hunger State
of Food Insecurity Report,

00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:21.250
and there's good news,
actually, to share

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.840
in the progress we're making
towards ending hunger.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.730
What that report showed
was that that 805 million

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.670
who suffer from hunger
today is actually

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.730
100 million people less
than the number that

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.150
suffered from
hunger 10 years ago.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.280
So in one decade we've
reduced the number

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.550
of malnourished people in the
world by 100 million people.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.070
If you go back further than
that, we've actually since 1992

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.670
we've reduced the number
of malnourished people

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.420
by more than 200 million people.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.210
That's remarkable.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.616
Especially when you think
about the population growth

00:06:54.616 --> 00:06:55.990
that we've seen
during that time.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.930
So when you look at the
prevalence of hunger

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.210
around the world, you actually
see that in 1992 there

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.200
were just under
19% of the world's

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.800
population were malnourished.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.530
Because of the advances, the
progress that we've seen,

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.890
that percentage is just
over 11% now, 11.3%.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.640
That's remarkable
progress, and truly it's

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.310
something to give us hope.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.140
We have 63 countries
that have actually

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.760
met the first Millennium
development goal.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.390
That was to cut hunger
in half by the year 2015.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.300
63 countries that have
already made that happen.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.160
That gives us hope, in fact,
that we can do that worldwide.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.910
We can meet that first
Millennium development goal

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.020
worldwide by 2015.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.635
We have the
opportunity to do that.

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:44.110
That goal is within reach.

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:48.110
It will take some extra work,
because we're reducing hunger

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.672
at the rate of about half a
percentage point per year.

00:07:51.672 --> 00:07:53.630
So we need to step up
our efforts a little bit,

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.560
but that goal is very
much within reach.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.824
So there's good news,
but while there's

00:07:58.824 --> 00:08:00.240
good news in the
progress, we need

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.340
to understand what's
making that possible,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.200
and we need to not lose
focus because hunger

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.690
is a very local issue.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:10.190
And I think you'll hear
that today, that hunger is

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.740
a very local issue,
and in some cases,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.590
the numbers aren't
getting better.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.596
So we need to learn from
what we've done well

00:08:16.596 --> 00:08:17.970
in the successes
that we've seen,

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.090
but we have to keep that at
focus and that commitment

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.850
to actually ending
hunger in our lifetime.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:28.510
So I will just share briefly
what Stop Hunger Now is doing.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.950
In fact, our roots do come
from domestic hunger relief.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.480
Our Founder Ray
Buchanan helped found

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.039
the Society of St. Andrew, which
was one of the original meal

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:40.140
gleaning organizations.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:44.800
But in 1998, his focus
turned international

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.350
as he realized the need to
address international hunger

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.130
relief.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.540
Initially our focus
was on crisis response.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.180
But very quickly you
learn that the disasters

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.140
that we read about-- the
earthquakes, the tsunamis,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.300
the famine brought about
by war, et cetera-- that's

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.840
only a small portion
of the hunger that

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.673
exists in the world.

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:04.210
In fact, the real
need is to address

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.370
the chronic malnutrition
that exists.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:12.180
And so what Stop Hunger
Now began doing around 2005

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.440
was working to address
chronic malnutrition.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.150
And we learned that one
of the most effective ways

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.930
to address chronic malnutrition
in developing countries

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.430
is school feeding programs.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.910
So we initiated a
meal packaging program

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.800
where volunteers, like the many
Googlers who have participated

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.220
with us, they come together
and package these high protein

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.210
dehydrated meals.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:37.700
These meals have rice,
soy, dehydrated vegetables,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.654
and a specially formulated
vitamin formulation

00:09:41.654 --> 00:09:43.570
that is designed for
malnourished individuals,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.278
to give them the
micronutrients that they

00:09:45.278 --> 00:09:47.730
need to overcome the
effects of hunger.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.120
So volunteers come together
and package these meals.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.860
Then we provide
them to partners--

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.980
we work with partners in
more than 40 countries now.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.750
And to date, we're serving
about 400,000 people a day

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.217
using our meals.

00:10:04.217 --> 00:10:05.800
DIANE SOLINGER: The
distribution model

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.490
of the schools I think
is really, really

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.786
a special thing that you
guys do extraordinarily well.

00:10:11.786 --> 00:10:13.410
ROD BROOKS: Well,
and that's the issue.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.826
There are many ways that these
meals could be distributed.

00:10:15.826 --> 00:10:18.030
What we're trying to do
is to really leverage

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.880
the distribution that
we have, to provide

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.077
not only an immediate impact,
but really a long term impact.

00:10:23.077 --> 00:10:24.410
Now, let me say more about that.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.618
So of course, when you start
a school feeding program

00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:29.490
you're providing
the immediate immed

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.850
that children need, to learn.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.350
You'll hear in a moment how
it's really impossible to learn.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.810
You can't think, concentrate,
on an empty belly.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:41.260
But also what we find is when we
start a school feeding program,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.950
those meals act is a
tremendous incentive

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.570
for parents to send their
children to school, knowing

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.070
that they'll get a hot meal.

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.240
What does that do, as school
enrollment rates increase

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.090
dramatically--
sometimes we've seen

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.550
double, triple, quadruple or
more-- literacy rates increase.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.110
Vocational training
opportunities are present.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.856
Through that education,
children have hope.

00:11:03.856 --> 00:11:05.480
And it's through that
education that we

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.940
can begin to break the
cycle of poverty that

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.664
so often keeps
hunger in existence.

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:11.830
DIANE SOLINGER: Let's take
that a little bit further

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.670
because we have Eddy here, and
Eddy is from an organization

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.360
called ORPHANetwork
in Nicaragua that

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.650
is a distribution partner
of Stop Hunger Now.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.570
And we were talking just
a couple minutes ago,

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:26.090
Eddy, that I found
Nicaragua is excited

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.530
that they're having five years
of education as the average.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.370
And trying to get to
six years of education

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.560
for the average citizen
in their country.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.930
So does a food program
through schools

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.497
help people think that OK,
we can stay in school longer.

00:11:42.497 --> 00:11:44.580
Is it going to help meet
that goal of getting kids

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.660
to have six years of
education, of formal education?

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:48.410
EDDY MORALES: Yes.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.090
That's right.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.870
Thank you for inviting
us, also, from Nicaragua.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:53.820
It's so good to be
here and to share

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.260
what we're doing in Nicaragua
and how things are changing.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.240
So for Jennifer,
Leyla and myself,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.905
it's so exciting to be here.

00:12:00.905 --> 00:12:01.720
And yes.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.240
And then personally
work with them

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.220
with a school feeding program.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.910
I remember when I started, we
were feeding 56,000 children,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:13.550
and grow the program up to one
million children every day.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.550
DIANE SOLINGER:
That's incredible.

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.050
Wow.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.950
EDDY MORALES: And the big thing
there was more than growing

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.680
the number is creating
hope for these children,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.610
creating opportunities
for these children

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.587
for a way of broken
cycles of poverty,

00:12:26.587 --> 00:12:28.045
knowing the life
of these children.

00:12:28.045 --> 00:12:31.862
And yes, when the parents know
that there is no foot home,

00:12:31.862 --> 00:12:33.570
but at the school
there is food, and then

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.770
teachers can take
advantage of that,

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.400
know to then work
with the children

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.660
in the field of
education, that's amazing.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.475
And that is happening
in Nicaragua.

00:12:41.475 --> 00:12:45.790
And today we are serving
with our partners.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.760
We are serving 18,000
children in Nicaragua.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.790
And one of the big indicators
that we're working on

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.530
is education.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.240
So we really want our
kids to go to school.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.500
It's more than the meal.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.870
The meal is a way of probably
bringing hope and telling them

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.770
yes, it's possible.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.320
Yes, we can make it happen.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.590
Yes, we're going to feed you.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.900
There will be a meal, but what
we want you to go to school.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.390
Because at the end of the
day, what is going to make

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.480
a difference in their life
is not the meal itself,

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.830
but including education to that.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.670
And actually, that's our story.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.470
Leyla, myself, and
me, that's our story.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.100
Education is what change
our life, what took us out

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.110
of poverty.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.730
DIANE SOLINGER: Before we go
to Jennifer who has that story,

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.850
how did you guys find
each other as partners?

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:33.680
ROD BROOKS: Well--

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.600
DIANE SOLINGER: Do you Google?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.490
Did you Google it?

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.700
ROD BROOKS: So we
initiated our program

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.070
and we had been working
with a number of partners

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.090
around the world
providing crisis response,

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.410
and then as we initiated
the meal packaging program,

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.530
we found that certain partners
who were receiving meals

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.790
from us would refer
other partners.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.280
Once the meals get out
there, people find you.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.210
And I think that was the
case with ORPHANetwork.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.870
It was, in fact, one
of our staff members

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.800
had traveled to Nicaragua
through her church.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.950
And it was through
Chessney Barrick,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.417
who had a direct experience
with ORPHANetwork,

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:13.500
who said, you know, this
is a group that we really

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.550
ought to try to help.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.800
She was so moved by the work
that Eddy and ORPHANetwork

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.631
was doing.

00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:20.130
And I just have to
brag, by the way.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.600
When we talk about
ending hunger,

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.060
we're really serious about that.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:29.044
And I think ORPHANetwork is
one of the best examples where,

00:14:29.044 --> 00:14:30.460
as Eddy mentioned,
they're feeding

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.530
18,000 children every day.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.220
Well, in four years, the rate of
malnutrition among those 18,000

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.660
children has dropped from 27%
to 12%-- more than cut in half.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.140
And that is remarkable.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.030
EDDY MORALES: And
that's the work

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:48.750
the churches and partners
and friends and doctors

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.480
and everyone is
doing in Nicaragua.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.900
We are so focused on result.

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.430
It's sort of
result-based management.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.210
So we said, man, by
feeding the children

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.001
only we are not going
to make a difference.

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.030
So what if we can work
on some indicators

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.560
and work towards those.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.490
So one of our indicator
three years ago

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.477
was to wipe out malnutrition.

00:15:09.477 --> 00:15:11.060
And that's what we're
working towards.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.780
The idea is wipe
out malnutrition.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.570
We always say every
community we put one step in,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.880
we want to wipe out
malnutrition while we're

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.860
sending the kids
to school, also.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:20.840
DIANE SOLINGER: That's
kind of step one.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.631
EDDY MORALES: Yeah.

00:15:21.631 --> 00:15:25.520
So the numbers, as Rod said,
number has gone from 26%,

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.000
actually, to 12%.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.210
This year we're going to end,
or we're working really hard

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.850
to end this year with 8%.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.990
And in some communities
it's already

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.846
down to 3%, 2%, and yes.

00:15:36.846 --> 00:15:38.470
DIANE SOLINGER: And
are you distributed

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.820
throughout the country
or are you focused

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.736
strictly in Nicaragua?

00:15:40.736 --> 00:15:47.130
EDDY MORALES: No, we are in
almost 14 states or departments

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.380
out of 18, roughly.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.171
And the idea is to
reach the country, also.

00:15:51.171 --> 00:15:52.510
DIANE SOLINGER: That's amazing.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.850
So Jennifer, you've
been a recipient

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.727
of Stop Hunger Now
and ORPHANetwork.

00:15:57.727 --> 00:15:59.560
Tell us about your
story, because now you're

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.470
in university.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:01.950
JENNIFER: Yes, I'm a sophomore.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:02.290
DIANE SOLINGER: Perfect.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.581
JENNIFER: Actually, I would
have five years in college,

00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:06.600
so I guess I'll
be a senior twice.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:14.390
Anyway, I'm 18 years old, and
I was raised in an orphanage.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:19.080
My mom-- well, my father left
us when I was three years old,

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.880
and my mom didn't have enough
money to make ends meet.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.740
So I just learned that
phrase, "ends meet."

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.680
I like it.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.760
So she put us in the
orphanage because-- me,

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.530
and my brother-- my oldest
brother-- and of course,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:34.460
I was destroyed at first.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.720
I just couldn't understand
why I was in there.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.000
I mean why?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.110
And at first, I got sick.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.980
Seeing as I was sick,
I wouldn't eat--

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.790
not that the food was bad,
just that I was so depressed.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.360
My only consolation
was my brother.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.330
I just didn't know why
she was leaving us there.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.560
But then, through time, I got to
understand why was the reason.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.760
And I got to love the place
because through time, I

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.349
thought of the place as my home.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.369
It's just that it was a
huge home with 80 kids that

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:14.150
were like my
brother and sisters,

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.300
and my caregivers
were my parents.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:22.980
So I got to know that it was in
God's plan for me to be there.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.200
And to be here with you now,
to be sharing this testimony

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.860
with you, because it
was awesome, seriously.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:38.550
My childhood was as, I
think all the same as you.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:39.700
I got to play a lot.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.230
I always have tons of energy.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.330
And I went to school.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.060
I had good grades, because
I had good caregivers that

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.270
were always helping me and
were always encouraging me.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.610
And because they bet on me.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:56.660
And when somebody
bet on you, you're

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.390
like how can you
disappoint that person?

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:01.870
And it's the same
with all of you.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.710
You have bet on us,
because you're working,

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.160
you are helping us, you're
willing to do something for us.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.590
Like hunger, the Stop
Hunger Now and ORPHANetwork,

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.150
they bet on us.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.530
And that's encouraging,
because you say,

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.330
wow, these people
are not my parents,

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.510
that didn't know
anything about me

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.870
went I arrive at the orphanage.

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.970
They welcome me.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.180
They hug me, they kiss me.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.870
They treat me as
their own child.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.980
And when you see
all that, you want

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.400
to do that, you want
to be part of that.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.380
You want to be
someone like Eddy.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.750
I still think that I want
to take your position.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.025
I want to continue
that legacy, you know.

00:18:44.025 --> 00:18:47.560
I want to keep working
with child-- I love childs.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.950
Although sometimes
they drive me crazy.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:53.440
I just love to be
with childs and youth,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.490
and to be able to be there
for them as all of you

00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:59.710
have been there for me.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:04.580
Because I think of all
of you as my family.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.320
When I arrived at
the orphanage, I

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.340
was like only my brother--
brother come here, please.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.260
Be with me.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.770
But then I have
now many friends.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.860
I mean tons of friends in there.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.300
And it was great
to experience that.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.830
It was great to have home
and roof, food to eat.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:29.750
Because when you don't have
food, and you go to school,

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.830
you're like going on empty
stomach, you can't think,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.950
you can't reason.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.819
You probably have bad
grades because you

00:19:38.819 --> 00:19:40.360
don't have something
in your stomach.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.080
And it's, oh, my
gosh, I'm so hungry.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.740
You cannot think
about anything else.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.210
But I was glad I had food.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.400
I remember I was telling
someone yesterday

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:56.480
that one time, when I was
maybe 10 or 11, the caregivers

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.980
were going to fast.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.670
And I said, OK, I
want to do that, too.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.650
And they say, OK, do
know what is that?

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.350
I was like, no.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.070
And then they explain
what in was to me.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:08.280
I say, OK, wait.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.180
We pray to God.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.320
We don't eat all
day until dinner.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.990
I say, OK, I'm going to do that.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:14.390
I have a reason to do it.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:18.955
But after school, I
came to the orphanage

00:20:18.955 --> 00:20:22.325
and I was crying and crying,
and my brother came to me.

00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:23.860
He was like, what's the matter?

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.990
What's up?

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:28.220
I was like, I'm
so hungry, I said.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.050
And he say, well, go eat.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:30.720
I said I can't.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.320
I'm fasting.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.630
And he said, don't be crazy.

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.300
God will understand you.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.370
He knows what you need.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:40.660
I was like, wow.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.560
I mean any other
person could say, well,

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.960
I don't have nowhere
to go to eat.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.780
But I did.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.930
I knew that I could
go to the kitchen

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.000
and ask the cookers to
give me something to eat.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.940
I was like, wow, this is great.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.430
I felt very lucky to be there.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.230
DIANE SOLINGER: Just like we
were all saying, it's step one.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.280
JENNIFER: Exactly.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.571
DIANE SOLINGER: Making sure
that there's food security.

00:21:04.571 --> 00:21:08.550
And for us who pack these
wonderful packages of food

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.350
and ship them off to we don't
know where sometimes, it's

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.330
really nice to see that it
gets from you to you to you,

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.640
and now you're thinking
about-- as I said earlier,

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.410
paying it forward.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:21.035
You're going to go
back and try to help

00:21:21.035 --> 00:21:23.050
and I think that's
a wonderful circle.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.120
Thank you.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:28.545
And food security,
that term, it's

00:21:28.545 --> 00:21:30.420
an issue here in the Bay area.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.890
It's an issue in
the developed world.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.810
And we talk about children
going to school hungry

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.130
here in the Bay area, and that's
just not acceptable anywhere.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.020
So Kathy, tell us about
Second Harvest Mission.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.464
What you do for the
counties that you support,

00:21:45.464 --> 00:21:47.630
and overall food banking,
if people don't understand

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.179
even the concept of that maybe.

00:21:49.179 --> 00:21:50.220
KATHY JACKSON: OK, great.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.220
Well, I want you guys to
know that the only reason I'm

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.810
wearing logo-wear instead
of my Buster Posey Jersey

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.230
is because I knew I was
going to be on camera,

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.400
and I didn't want to
preserve for the ages.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.090
But I would like to
talk about three things.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:11.470
I'd like to talk a little bit
about the business of hunger.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.000
I want to talk a little bit
about what hunger looks like

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.340
here in Silicon Valley.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.090
And I want to talk a
little bit about what

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.796
Second Harvest is
doing about it, OK?

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:21.410
DIANE SOLINGER: Sounds good.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.830
KATHY JACKSON: So why
would I use a weird phrase

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.490
like the business of hunger?

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.640
The reason I refer
to it that way

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.250
is that we're all about data
at Second Harvest Food Bank.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.010
We're focused on data.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.600
We're focused on metrics.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.590
We're focused on efficiency.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.650
I came to this work after
20 years in for-profit,

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:45.650
and I don't know any other way
to run a business, honestly.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.920
So when we start looking at our
two counties, and we serve--

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.350
we're the only food bank in
Santa Clara and San Mateo

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.010
county.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.890
Food banking is not
a competitive sport.

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:56.150
We're not competing
with anybody.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.280
But when we start looking at
where the pockets of hunger

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.880
are, we start with income.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.570
And the State of California
says that a family of four

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:10.580
needs $82,000 here
to make ends meet.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.050
84% of our clients are
getting by on a household

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.290
income of $20,000 or less.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.800
So try to imagine living on
something like $15,000 here.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.480
I mean it blows
your mind, really.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.680
I don't know how people do it.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:27.650
But we start, we map where
the pockets of low income are.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.760
And then we overlay on that.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.480
We overlay all of
our 330 partners,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.540
and 770 different food
distribution points.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.640
We overlay on that our
particularly strong partners

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.980
who could grow and
help us do more.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.870
And we overlay on that
food stamp penetration

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.070
rates, because the more
people utilize food stamps who

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.660
actually qualify
for that program,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.830
it will leverage our resources.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.360
And what happens is
then you find gaps.

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.530
You find areas
that are saturated

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.320
in terms of a lot
of food coming in,

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.900
even if there's a lot of need.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.620
And we use that
analysis to figure out

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.940
where we're going to go,
where we need more services,

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:10.720
how we maximize our
ROI, how we drive

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.637
impact on this critical problem.

00:24:12.637 --> 00:24:15.220
DIANE SOLINGER: Similar to the
whole thing, even that mapping,

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.400
there's food, it's just
maybe in the wrong places.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.710
KATHY JACKSON: Exactly.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:19.610
Exactly.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.300
So what does hunger
look like here?

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.260
I suspect you guys see
faces of hunger every day,

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.050
but you probably don't know
it because it looks different

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.850
here.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.530
Second Harvest Food
Bank provides food

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:36.550
to a quarter of a million
people every month.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:40.500
That's one in 10 people
in these two counties

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.700
get some of their food
from the food bank.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.100
So they're cafeteria workers.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:47.940
They may be preschool teachers.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.830
They may be somebody who waits
on you in a hardware store.

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:54.430
If you know an adult that's
trying to live on minimum wage,

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.330
even minimum wage in Mountain
View, which might go to $15,

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.450
that's only a little
over $30,000 a year.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.080
You cannot make ends meet here.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.170
I heard such a strange
story the other day,

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:09.900
and I loved it
because it emphasized

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.160
the nuance of hunger.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:16.770
It's a mom, a single
mom with three kids,

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.120
and she works part-time
at an hourly job.

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.380
But her eldest son
had to go to work

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.670
to make ends meet
for the family.

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:26.120
He was in high school.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.700
Now, the good news
is he graduated.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.050
I mean that's a
fantastic outcome.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.550
And bear in mind,
he was not working

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.720
so he'd have money to go
to the movies and stuff

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.428
with his friends.

00:25:35.428 --> 00:25:39.050
He was working to contribute
to the household income.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.720
But he couldn't go to his
high school graduation.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.920
Well, why not?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.130
Because he was afraid
to ask for the time off.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.660
He doesn't have FTO.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.420
He doesn't have benefits.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.980
And that money was too
critical to his family.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.360
And the mom when she was
telling the story, cried.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.860
And she said, I'm a
failure as a parent.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:01.640
I mean I'm so proud
of my son, but what

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.500
should have been one of
the best days of his life

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:08.860
was not because I can't
provide for my family.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.630
That's what hunger looks
like here in the Bay area.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.390
And the coping strategies that
people use, they're amazing,

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.170
and actually, quite creative.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.730
They eat a lot of soup.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:22.750
They water down their milk.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.540
They eat food past
its expiration date.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.000
If they're parents,
they probably

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.410
skip meals so that
their kids don't

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.700
have to go to school hungry.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.040
Almost half the people
we serve tell us

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.160
they've traded off
educational expenses

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.010
to be able to afford food.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.120
That might mean they
didn't have a backpack,

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:44.570
they didn't have basic
stuff that their kid

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.930
needed for school.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.450
It might mean they had to defer
college or take fewer courses

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:52.520
because they couldn't afford it.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.990
So what are we doing about it?

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.020
Unfortunately, we have
to be a big business.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:05.640
We provide the equivalent of
a million meals every week

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.410
to people in Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.270
We've got to be vast, we've
got to be incredibly efficient,

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.930
and squeeze every dollar
as hard as we can.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.110
But what we're realizing
is that if we really

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.247
want to move the
needle on local hunger,

00:27:20.247 --> 00:27:22.080
we've got to go
neighborhood by neighborhood

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.240
and block by block.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.510
And we work with 330
other non-profits

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:31.880
to try to do that, to
really have an impact.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.617
We have a lot of
strategies around schools.

00:27:34.617 --> 00:27:35.950
And I'll tell you another story.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.630
Three weeks ago, we got
a call from a principal

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.255
at Fair Oaks Elementary School.

00:27:40.255 --> 00:27:41.502
It's in Redwood City.

00:27:41.502 --> 00:27:43.960
I think you guys are going to
be pretty big in Redwood City

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960
soon.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.060
He called in panic mode.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.000
He said, I have never
seen poverty like this.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.420
I was sent here to improve
educational outcomes.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.930
I've got to get these kids fed.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:58.840
There is no way
I can do anything

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.260
until we address that
fundamental need.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.450
So it's so similar to
your experience overseas.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.250
And yet, this is Silicon Valley.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:07.460
How could this be?

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.960
So of course, we're
addressing that.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.650
And we can talk later
about other strategies

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:12.690
with other schools.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.630
It's not just public schools.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.500
We're supporting Rocketship.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.400
We're supporting
all kinds of schools

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:18.630
throughout the Bay area--

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:19.280
DIANE SOLINGER: Charter school.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.446
KATHY JACKSON: --a charter
school in different ways.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.500
We also don't look much
like a traditional food bank

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.270
at Second Harvest.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.740
We're not about food
past its expiry date.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.530
We're not about dented
cans of SpaghettiOs.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.960
More than half of the
food we distribute

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.980
is fresh fruits vegetables.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:43.380
We distribute milk, and eggs,
and chicken, and peanut butter,

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.720
and rice, and beans.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.730
And we do it in a dignified way.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:49.350
So I guess at the
end of the day,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:52.240
I would say about
hunger here locally,

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.050
it's not a supply chain problem.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:56.390
Even though we're
efficiency obsessed,

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:58.500
that is not what
local hunger is.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.650
Local hunger is personal.

00:29:00.650 --> 00:29:04.520
Local hunger is really scary for
the people who experience it.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.560
Local hunger was
the little boy who,

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.410
when his teacher said, "What's
your favorite food for dinner,"

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.890
said, "Dinner?

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.890
Is that the meal that some
families eat in the evening?

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.480
My family doesn't
eat that meal."

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.990
You guys, hunger is solvable.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.100
Hunger is solvable here.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.550
And we really appreciate
our partnership with Google

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:30.090
to ensure that anyone who
needs a meal can get one.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.420
DIANE SOLINGER: Thanks, Kathy.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.270
And Suzanne, so you've
been listening to this

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:37.410
and getting more
involved as a Googler

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.430
and joining the board of the
Second Harvest Food Bank.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.250
I'd love to learn
more about your path

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.382
to finding Second Harvest and
why you got so passionate--

00:29:47.382 --> 00:29:49.590
obviously, when you listen
to Kathy, you're like, OK,

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.920
we're all in, right?

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.024
SUZANNE: Absolutely.

00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:54.190
DIANE SOLINGER: It's certainly
a compelling mission.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:58.000
We know-- I keep saying,
it's just a basic need.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.750
We need to make sure
that people can eat.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.850
But for you, you took a big
step in joining the board,

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.590
so tell us about that
and why you chose?

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.170
SUZANNE: Absolutely.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.150
So as Kathy said,
the face of hunger

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.480
looks somewhat different here.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.905
So my personal experience--
or my experience with hunger

00:30:16.905 --> 00:30:18.800
has been very personal.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.810
When I was little
girl, my father

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.430
owned a construction
company, and my mom

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.200
helped out with that company.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.300
My brother passed away
very unexpectedly,

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.400
and my father was devastated.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.830
He became addicted to drugs,
and we lost our company,

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.110
we lost our home,
we lost everything.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.960
So my mother-- it was no
longer safe for us to stay.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.400
So my mother moved
us to a shelter.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.350
And that was my first
experience with food,

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:56.400
or I guess food scarcity.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.360
I absolutely hated it.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.270
It was really scary.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.220
I missed my clothes,
and my toys,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:05.860
and my house, and
my friends, and not

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.940
being able to decide what
snack you wanted to eat,

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.320
and it was really foreign.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.100
From there, my mom tried to
get a job and she couldn't.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.320
So she took night classes
to learn shorthand

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.710
to become a secretary.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.440
And during that time,
we had no income.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.160
So we received food stamps, we
received actual bags of food.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.610
And very similarly, as much
as I was thankful for it,

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:39.190
I really hated that our
money looked different

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.820
from other people's money.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.770
I became very, very
good at mental math,

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:48.410
because it was incredibly
embarrassing to stand

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:52.980
in line at the grocery store
and put item by item back.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.610
And it was really hard to
watch my mom get so upset when

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.330
we had to do that.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.610
And so we're really
lucky, right?

00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:04.970
I mean obviously I'm
sitting here at Google.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.010
My mom was eventually
able to get a job.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.040
She worked for all of my years
growing up, two or three jobs,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.460
so that I could really
focus on my education, which

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:17.010
is what got me here.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:21.200
But it's never something
that really leaves you.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.690
I mean it probably was three
years ago where I finally

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:27.980
stopped sorting my items in my
cart at Target, like the ones

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.900
I had to buy and the ones
I maybe wanted to get.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.450
And so I think the
metric that-- being

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.320
at Google and data
driven-- the metric that

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.070
has been so powerful
for me is one

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:45.490
in three children in
the Bay area is hungry.

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.450
And I don't know about you
guys, but my biggest problem

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.350
every day is walking
past the micro kitchen

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.910
and not grabbing
something to eat.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:58.100
And so knowing that
statistic, and being

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.760
in the most innovative,
the wealthiest community

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.995
in, if not the
country, the world.

00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:07.370
We have to be able
to solve this.

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.090
This is unacceptable that one in
three children in our community

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:11.020
are hungry.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.050
And so I got to
know Second Harvest,

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:17.030
actually, our team
volunteered there, and sort of

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.415
gave me a chance to see how
crazily efficient they are.

00:33:20.415 --> 00:33:22.002
I highly recommend that.

00:33:22.002 --> 00:33:23.210
It was our favorite off-site.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.490
We go back over and over again.

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:27.920
And also, just
really meeting Kathy

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.190
and meeting the organization,
they're such thought leaders.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:36.300
Kathy basically won the sort
of CEO of food banks nationwide

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.580
of the year.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.880
And you can tell from
her stories she really

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.450
delivers on that.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:46.420
I think the thing that has been
most inspiring to me is really,

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.550
this is solvable,
particularly given

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:51.720
the resources that we
have as a community.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.490
And so we have an opportunity
to come together and be

00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.905
the model for all of these
other communities in the nation

00:33:58.905 --> 00:34:03.040
and worldwide, and say we're
not OK with this anymore.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.840
We are going to fix it.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:09.710
And so as Diane mentioned,
the Costco extravaganza

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.420
is coming up soon.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.960
It's really fun.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.020
It's really great.

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.889
Volunteer with your
teams at Second Harvest.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.650
There's so many ways
to get involved.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:24.230
But I think we can all agree
that no one in our community

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:25.980
deserves to go
hungry, particularly

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.289
when we are so blessed.

00:34:27.289 --> 00:34:29.330
DIANE SOLINGER: When we
think about what Googlers

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.270
have to offer, we
have our time, we have

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.277
our financial resources,
we have our skills,

00:34:34.277 --> 00:34:35.110
we have our talents.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.474
So when you think about
some of the big ideas

00:34:38.474 --> 00:34:40.790
that maybe your organizations
want to address,

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.370
let's kind of take it up to
what could Googler's skills do

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.290
to come in and help
make you more efficient,

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:50.270
get to that nobody's
hungry metric

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.670
that we're trying to get to.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:54.429
Any ideas on how
Googlers can help,

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:57.470
besides opening their
wallets, which they do.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.330
ROD BROOKS: Which we're
very grateful for.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:03.910
So one of the
things that to which

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:07.786
we can attribute that, the
reduction in global hunger,

00:35:07.786 --> 00:35:09.410
is that many countries
around the world

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.440
have actually made
this a priority.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.340
So in Brazil they've set
a goal of zero hunger.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.250
And there's the Union
of African States

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.180
have actually set a goal
of ending hunger by 2025.

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.700
That type of commitment
doesn't come about

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.826
without awareness of the
issue and an insistence

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.200
that we really
treat it that way.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.630
That we make it a priority.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.920
And I'm sure Kathy can
speak that in this country

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.030
we've actually been recently
threatened with severe sort

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:42.350
of rips in the safety net that
we have, even in this country.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.640
And in many countries, the
safety nets don't even exist.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.520
So the very first
thing I would say

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.890
is that Googlers can
become aware and involved

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.200
in this issue.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.210
It takes real advocacy
to make this a priority.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.334
And so that's what I would say
is a very, very real first step

00:36:00.334 --> 00:36:01.750
and something that
is very needed.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:03.458
DIANE SOLINGER: Let
me interject on that,

00:36:03.458 --> 00:36:05.040
because right now
the UN is looking

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.690
at the next set of
sustainable development goals

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.160
that will be developed and
announced next September, 2015.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.290
And we all have an
opportunity as individuals

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.120
to go and vote as to what we
think those things should be.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.380
So you can go to myworld.com
or .org-- I don't remember,

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.110
one of the two-- myworld,
and you can vote.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.590
And if you think eradicating
hunger should be something

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:29.290
that we focus on,
put your vote in.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:32.060
And that's one way to help
influence where the UN goes,

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.941
which actually helps
governments take a stand

00:36:34.941 --> 00:36:37.190
and say, OK, this is something
that we're going to do.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.507
ROD BROOKS: Absolutely.

00:36:38.507 --> 00:36:41.090
Beyond that, and something that
Eddy and I were talking about,

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.060
so Stop Hunger Now
has, as I described,

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.890
traditionally been focused
on first, crisis relief,

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:48.760
but then focusing on
transformational development.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.220
A third area where we
want to be able to do more

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:53.720
is in sustainable
community development,

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.250
and that is really
working towards improving

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.420
not just the lives, but the
livelihoods of individuals.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.260
And we have been
talking about ways

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.170
that we engage so many people
like Googlers in the meal

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.840
packaging program, we can
surely leverage those folks'

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:12.900
skills and interests,
and really partnering

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.370
with groups like
ORPHANetwork to create

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:17.770
lasting change in
their communities.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.290
And so along with
the opportunity

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.980
to package meals with us in six
different meal packaging events

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.230
that we have coming up, which
are actually on your flyer,

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.010
there's also, we're presenting
the opportunity for you

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.495
to become personally engaged
with some of our partners

00:37:32.495 --> 00:37:35.120
like ORPHANetwork, there's some
other groups that we work with,

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.810
Salesian missions
around the world.

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:39.880
And our goal,
frankly, is to match

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.690
those resourced and skilled
individuals with really

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.260
passionate visionary
partners that

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.020
are working in country who have
a tremendous vision for what

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.760
they want to accomplish
on the ground.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.460
And through really putting
those groups together, allowing

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.887
you to take the
journey together.

00:37:57.887 --> 00:37:59.470
And Eddy, welcome
any ideas that you'd

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.080
like to share about,
because you have

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.420
ideas about how to improve.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.211
EDDY MORALES: Yeah.

00:38:03.211 --> 00:38:05.270
I mean there is a lot,
a lot of opportunities,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.500
I would say, in Nicaragua
when we understand

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:14.230
40% of extreme poverty, 33%
of malnourished children

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.570
in Nicaragua, there is
a lot of opportunities.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.630
It's interesting
when you understand

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.050
that everything
starts with a meal.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.390
Everything starts here,
what you're doing.

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:27.390
So as Rod said, we
are so thankful.

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:29.730
And understanding
that around a meal,

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:31.870
then, we can add education.

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.770
We can wipe out children
having-- girls having baby.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.020
In Nicaragua, 28% of the
girls have their first baby

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.780
before 15.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.620
Now, that's a big
issue in Nicaragua

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.755
that we have to tackle.

00:38:42.755 --> 00:38:43.030
DIANE SOLINGER: Sure.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:44.530
Takes them out of
school completely.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.446
EDDY MORALES: Exactly.

00:38:45.446 --> 00:38:48.992
And then education, as Rod
said, working really hard

00:38:48.992 --> 00:38:50.450
for sixth grade,
and we are saying,

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.670
no, we want to go
beyond sixth grade.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.210
And then children malnourished.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.400
I mean all of
these issues are, I

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.040
would say, just brings great
opportunity to us and to you

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.050
to come and to serve.

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.080
To serve working with teachers,
working with the children,

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:09.400
working in the communities
where we can just go and take

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.440
on a community and
transform that community.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.540
That's possible.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.290
As an orphanage, we are
working really, really hard

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.780
to do that, to change a life.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.890
It's not feeding.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.260
It's changing a life.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:24.251
No, it's producing more J.Los,
it's producing more Leylas,

00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:24.750
where--

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.291
DIANE SOLINGER: Did
he call you J-Lo?

00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.660
JENNIFER: Yeah.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.310
EDDY MORALES:
Jennifer Lopez, yeah.

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:34.810
So it's ending that.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.312
And sometime it's even just
sitting with the community

00:39:37.312 --> 00:39:38.270
and dreaming with them.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.680
I was sharing with Rod,
I sat with 12 pastors

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.710
and said, let's talk
about your community.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.680
Let's talk about assets
in your community.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.900
Probably there is something
that we can take advantage of.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.500
Just put some ideas into
that, ideas that you can bring

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:55.300
and put ideas into that,
and transform the community.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.070
There was a pastor, for
example, who said, oh yeah,

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.000
I think my community
needs a library.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.060
We don't have a
bookstore-- library,

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.390
bookstore-- I think
I can do that.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.300
I don't need
ORPHANetworks to do that.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:11.230
Just by sitting and
brainstorming with him.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.620
Seven days after I
went to his community,

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:18.320
he had boxes of books, and he
said, I'm going to set this up.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.470
The children of this
community, my children,

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.686
they will have
books, and their life

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:24.060
is going to be
totally different.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.930
It's about changing a life.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.670
And that's what, as
I heard you speaking,

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.300
I mean it's not about the food.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.260
It's about changing their life.

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.930
And it's interesting,
also, for me,

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.580
personally-- when J.Lo
takes over my job,

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.880
it's going to be awesome.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.770
But for me, personally,
it's coming from that world

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.580
that she was sharing about.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.460
I mean I was
laughing and thinking

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.490
I went to school hungry.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.890
I'm one of nine brothers in
the poorest area of Nicaragua.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:52.390
Grow up.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.580
Many times I went to
school without breakfast.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:57.109
Many times I came back from
school and mom would say,

00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.900
I don't have lunch.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.810
Your dad is still
out there fishing,

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.240
and I don't have anything.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.340
But Mom was tough.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:04.950
I usually say Mom was Hitler.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.420
But that was needed
at that time.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.680
She was like, I don't have food!

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.670
But you have to study.

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:13.490
And remember, A isn't good.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.780
A+ is acceptable.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.800
But she understood education.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.660
She understood life skills.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.000
She understood we
really need to work hard

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.250
in order to get out of poverty.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:31.350
I remember going to the
convenience store and saying,

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:34.520
can you put that bread
in a plastic bag for me?

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.810
And someone would
say oh, this guy-- I

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:38.220
mean he's terrific in hygiene.

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:40.720
No, I wasn't looking for--
I was looking for my school

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.510
backpack was that plastic bag.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.330
And understanding
that and see how

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.370
because someone was willing
to step up and help me,

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.240
because someone was
willing to say yes, I

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:54.430
want to make a difference in
someone's life-- oh, Eddy--

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.020
and how my life
changed from there,

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.680
I mean I just can't stop
giving back to others.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.090
I just understand food
is the opportunity.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:06.010
Just the beginning point of
change in so many people's

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.630
lives, just as so many
people did it for me

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:11.040
and took me out of
extreme poverty.

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.610
And I'm not poor anymore today.

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.380
And I will never.

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:14.880
My life is changed.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.950
My child life will
be totally different.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.170
But someone was willing to
step up and say yes, I'm

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.790
going to make a
difference in Eddy's life.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.120
Now, you can be
that person to make

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.835
a difference in
someone else's life.

00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:27.460
That's what we're
teaching our children

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.500
in our six orphanages,
350 children.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.270
Our seventh goal is
go and find J.Lo two.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.280
Go and find J.Lo three.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.391
Go and find J.Lo four.

00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:38.140
They're out there.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.050
They're waiting for you, and
go and make a difference.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:40.940
DIANE SOLINGER:
Leyla's right here.

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.564
She's J.Lo too.

00:42:41.564 --> 00:42:44.000
EDDY MORALES: Leyla.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.040
DIANE SOLINGER: So Kathy,
data-driven systems,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.977
efficiencies, all those things--
that's just Google, right?

00:42:49.977 --> 00:42:50.810
KATHY JACKSON: Yeah.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.690
DIANE SOLINGER: So
how can Googlers

00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:54.330
get more involved
with the food bank?

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:55.560
KATHY JACKSON: Well,
it's one of the reasons

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.830
that we're so excited that
Suzanne is on the board

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:02.720
because she can play this
fantastic translational role.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:05.660
Because she already
speaks-- I don't know,

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.780
what do you call it?

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.500
Googlese or whatever.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.100
She knows what you guys do and
can break it down and put it

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.470
into simple words
of one syllable

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.790
that we at the food bank
can actually understand.

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:19.630
But she's now achieving
a different language

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.280
which is food bankese.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.130
And I think she's going to
be really helpful in terms

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:29.750
of finding ways, identifying
things where your expertise is

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:33.270
right in the center
of the bullseye.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.590
We have barely scratched
the surface, you guys,

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:39.800
in terms of figuring out
how to use technology

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:45.940
to remove barriers that exist
for people to find food.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.570
And as several folks have
said, there is enough food.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:53.600
My god, here in America,
we waste 40% of the food.

00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.150
So talk about it's in the
wrong place, my goodness.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:00.430
If we could capture
a fraction of that

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.940
and connect it with
the people who need it,

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.150
there's some
technology in there.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.100
There are apps in
there that could

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.440
be incredibly helpful to us.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.900
I don't know what they are,
but I know that they're there,

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.260
and it would be so
fun and so exciting.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.610
And I will share,
we're in the process

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.610
of doing a pilot with a
little tiny middle school.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:26.220
We're interviewing--
it's only 120 families.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.900
We're interviewing, doing deep
interviews with 60, at least,

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.340
of those families.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.460
And one of the things
that we learned is that--

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.510
and these are truly
the working poor.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:39.670
Every single household
has someone working,

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.120
but they can't make ends meet.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.320
North of 90% of those
people have not cell phones,

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.080
smartphones.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.680
OK, now I start to get very
excited in thinking about ways

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:00.730
we could use technology
to connect people

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.970
with the nutritious food that
they so desperately need.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.554
So I'm really
hopeful-- Suzanne, you

00:45:05.554 --> 00:45:07.220
didn't know I was
going to say all this.

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:10.285
But Suzanne is going
to-- you should see her

00:45:10.285 --> 00:45:11.160
in our board meeting.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.160
She's like "There's
an app for that.

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.790
We could do something
about that."

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.790
DIANE SOLINGER: Those are
skilled-based projects

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.310
that we'd like to source and
get input from organizations,

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:25.680
both you and other
organizations that how can

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.360
we leverage Googler skills.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.130
But we need that
internal champion.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.960
And I know both of
you, with Suzanne

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.920
and with a couple of
folks here who are really

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.014
involved with Stop
Hunger Now, I think

00:45:36.014 --> 00:45:37.430
it's the internal
champion to help

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:38.750
rally the troops around that.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:44.469
So we have some great first date
opportunities in volunteering.

00:45:44.469 --> 00:45:46.760
Coming up, we have food
packing events with Stop Hunger

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.490
Now all over the place.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.640
EDDY MORALES: And I was just
thinking that someone just

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.990
donated a computer lab to us.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.460
One of our orphanage
with 25 computer.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.190
It's probably the best
computer lab in Nicaragua.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.189
Someone donated
from Virginia Beach.

00:46:03.189 --> 00:46:05.480
So I mean we're here thinking
what can we do with this.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.510
One thing we know we want to
do, take advantage of this

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:10.620
and improve the education
of our children.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.340
You can come and look at it
and tell us how to improve.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.620
How to take advantage
of these 25 computer.

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.964
From Virginia Beach someone
is even sitting and looking

00:46:18.964 --> 00:46:20.380
at the children
learning computer.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.430
DIANE SOLINGER: That's awesome.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.555
EDDY MORALES: It's awesome.

00:46:22.555 --> 00:46:25.080
So you can come and see
and just help us just

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.370
improving our education, the
education for our children,

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.260
how they can learn
online, how they

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:33.107
can learn English to make a
difference in their lives.

00:46:33.107 --> 00:46:33.940
Knowing all of this.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:34.680
So that's great.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.262
I mean you can come
with me next Sunday

00:46:37.262 --> 00:46:38.650
to see the computer lab and--

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:40.812
DIANE SOLINGER: Got a trip
planned for everybody.

00:46:40.812 --> 00:46:41.660
It's awesome.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:43.120
But yeah, think about those.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.530
The first date opportunities
are coming up with the food

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:48.340
packing events for Stop Hunger
Now with the extravaganza here

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.090
in Mountain View that
Alan will be hosting

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:51.640
probably the first
week of December.

00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.680
Also, we're organizing for
Googlers on the Quad campus

00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.280
in Mountain View, an off-site
packing event at the food bank.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.740
So I think those are great
first date opportunities.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.530
If you go to the go link for
the Hunger Relief Campaign,

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.080
it's Go Give For Hunger.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.370
You'll scroll down and
there are local volunteering

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:15.359
opportunities already there
with many organizations

00:47:15.359 --> 00:47:16.150
in our communities.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.010
Many of them are distribution
partners of Second Harvest Food

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.925
Bank, like the Sunnyvale
Community Services and Mountain

00:47:21.925 --> 00:47:23.626
View CSA.

00:47:23.626 --> 00:47:26.250
But think about what you can do
for that, maybe that first date

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:26.800
experience.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.980
And then when you're there,
open up your mind a little bit

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.910
and think hmm,
maybe this could be

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.630
run a little bit
differently, or maybe

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.555
if I got a group of
Googlers together

00:47:35.555 --> 00:47:37.571
and we've got expertise
in this, that,

00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:39.320
that we could maybe
help this organization

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.550
in a different way, a
little bit more deeply.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:44.770
Don't have to necessarily
join the board like Suzanna

00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.670
did, which is awesome
and we love that, too,

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.880
but think about what you
can do as a small group.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.630
We also have a program
called Google Reach

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.440
Local which is
running this week.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.830
We have a variety of
hunger-related and poverty

00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:59.060
alleviation organizations
here in the Bay area,

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:01.240
and that's a week-long
program with cohorts

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.510
of Googlers going in and doing
pro bono consulting, really

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.110
on systems and
operational efficiencies,

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.600
organizational development
for the organizations.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.870
So those opportunities
will come up too,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:14.452
and you can apply for
those when those pop up.

00:48:14.452 --> 00:48:16.160
But think about not
just that first date,

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.680
but what you can do.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.190
Another thing, since we're
going to need to wrap-up

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.670
is that you can donate.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:26.060
So the Go Give For
Hunger link will take you

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:29.430
the global campaign that the
[INAUDIBLE] team is really

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.080
behind, which is focused
on action against hunger.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.600
Really getting kids off
the brink of starvation

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.980
and getting them to a more
stable place in their life

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.313
where they can maybe take
advantage of a Stop Hunger Now

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:43.300
program, or working more
with their local food banks.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.730
But this is really on
the edge of starvation.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:48.870
And then at the back
of the room here, we

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.890
have an opportunity for you
to donate to Stop Hunger Now

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.470
and to Second Harvest Food Bank.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.820
Actually, right now across the
US and soon across the world,

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.230
people are having
opportunity to put forth

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:03.960
their favorite organizations
for the G-Gift campaign, which

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.450
will be the first
week of December.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.019
So if you're
passionate about hunger

00:49:07.019 --> 00:49:09.185
and you want to put forth
one of these organizations

00:49:09.185 --> 00:49:11.729
or a hunger-related organization
that you care about,

00:49:11.729 --> 00:49:13.520
as an organization
you'd like to help raise

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.860
money for during G-Give,
you can do that now.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:20.930
So there's lots ways to
help, and we hope you will.

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:23.070
And hope you keep the
conversation going forward

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:25.280
about what we can
do as a company,

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.600
as individuals, as a group
of Googlers to get to zero.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.390
Nobody should have
to worry about food.

00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:35.620
We should make that a
good goal for our company

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.850
and for ourselves.

00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:38.049
Thanks, everybody.

00:49:38.049 --> 00:49:39.090
KATHY JACKSON: Thank you.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:40.440
DIANE SOLINGER: Thank you all.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.490
[APPLAUSE]
