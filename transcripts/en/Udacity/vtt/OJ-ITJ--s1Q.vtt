While in development,

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.300
Service Workers can be a bit of
a pain to work with it first.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.490
So let me show you a few tips and
tricks.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.120
Generally, I work in
an incognito window.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.939
That way, I can be sure that each
time I close and reopen the window,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:20.093
the Service Worker and anything stored
in the cache has been blown away and

00:00:20.093 --> 00:00:21.368
I'm starting fresh.

00:00:21.368 --> 00:00:27.297
Chrome://serviceworker-internals is
a super helpful tool.

00:00:27.297 --> 00:00:31.715
It'll show you all of the installed
Service Workers, their state,

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.930
allow you to update them or
get rid of them.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.330
The open DevTools window and pause
JavaScript execution on Service Worker

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.390
start up for debugging is helpful if
you need to debug the install event or,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.000
code that's run when
the Service Worker first wakes up.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.820
But be careful with it,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.460
if you have multiple sites with
Service Workers installed it'll open for

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.670
every site, which can be a pain
when you're debugging one site.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.620
When you open a page
that has a Service Worker

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.720
the browser spins up
that Service Worker.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.070
Then if you open another page that falls
within the scope of that Service Worker,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.710
the browser doesn't spin up another
Service Worker it uses the same one.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.130
That means if you have multiple tabs or

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.640
windows open there's
only one Service Worker.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.630
But what happens when you
update the Service Worker?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.010
The new Service Worker sits idle waiting

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.330
until all of the windows that used
the previous Service Worker have closed.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.790
Check out the skip waiting and
client's claim for a way to avoid this.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.430
In addition to the Service Workers
internal page,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.640
you can also use the Resources tab

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.900
in the Chrome DevTools to see what's
going on with your Service Worker.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.310
It also gives you access to the cache.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.610
So you can verify everything
was cached properly.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.860
Finally, if you didn't use
an incognito window and

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.135
you want to get rid of everything,
you can use,

00:01:56.135 --> 00:02:01.960
chrome//settings/cookies and
remove everything there.
