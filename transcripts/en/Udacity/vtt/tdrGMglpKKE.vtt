00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.670
This simplifies to x squared- 4.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.050
This one is kind of tricky because now
we're subtracting some of the terms and

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.080
adding some of the terms.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.010
Especially if you're going to be
rearranging terms before combining them,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.490
it might be helpful to think of this
kind of problem as adding positive and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.290
negative terms.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.220
So we can rewrite the expression as x

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.400
squared + 3x + negative
9 + negative 3x + 5.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.380
Now this will be a little
easier to rearrange.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.490
We can see that 3x and

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.640
negative 3x are like terms, and
they can be written next to each other.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.730
And negative 9 and
5 are also like terms.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.620
So they can be written
next to each other too.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.520
And then x squared can just stay as it
is because it doesn't have any other

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.210
like terms.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.075
And what we're left with is 3x +
negative 3x + negative 9 + 5 + x

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:54.800
squared.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.470
Combining 3x and negative 3x, we get 0x.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640
And then 0 times anything is 0.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.970
So really, that's just 0.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.584
And then combining negative 9 and
5, we get negative 4.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.920
Keep our addition sign, and then bring
down the x squared because that doesn't

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.000
have anything to combine with.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.558
We shouldn't include a 0, and so

00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:23.775
we should rewrite this as
negative 4 + x squared.

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:28.395
Or it can be written as X squared- 4
if we don't want a negative in front.

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:31.225
Note that in a simplified
expression we don't include zeros

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:34.915
whether we're adding a zero, subtracting
a zero or multiplying by zero.
