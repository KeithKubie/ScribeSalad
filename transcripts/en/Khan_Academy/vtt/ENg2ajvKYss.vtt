00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.930
Problem 47.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.059
Which graph represents
the system of

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.990
equations shown below?

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.480
So each of these equations
represents a line.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.210
So this is going to be a line,
well, both of them have

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.890
y-intercepts of plus 3.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.580
And this line has a
slope of minus 1.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.990
So let's see.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.620
We need a downward sloping
thing that intersects at

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.350
positive 3.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.890
Actually, they're both going
to intersect at positive 3.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.900
So choice A, neither of them.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.940
Both of their y-intercepts
are minus 3.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.520
We need to see a plus 3 here.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.400
So it's not choice A.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.040
In choice C, one of the lines
intersects at positive 3, but

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.540
the other line intersects
at minus 3.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.990
And they also have the same
slope, and these guys

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.530
obviously don't have
the same slope.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.410
So it's not going
to be choice C.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.250
Choice B.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.230
So I have two lines.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.140
Both of them have a
y-intercept of 3.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.760
This looks good so far.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.290
Both of them have y-intercepts
of 3.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.400
And then I have one line that
has a positive slope of 1.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.600
For every 1 I go over,
I go up 1.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.250
And I have one that has
a negative slope of 1.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.360
When I move over
1, I go down 1.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.840
This line right here is y is
equal to x, because I have a

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.630
slope of 1.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.560
1x plus 3.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.470
3 is its y-intercept.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.630
And this line right here
is y is equal to-- its

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.830
slope is minus 1.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460
You move to the right
1, you go down 1.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
So minus 1x, or minus x, and
its y-intercept is plus 3.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.525
So our answer is B.

00:01:34.525 --> 00:01:40.290
These are the two equations
that we have up there.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.100
You can't see it yet.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.890
That we have right here.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.520
Our answer is B.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.670
And D, both of these guys have
the same slope, so you can't

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.070
have-- clearly it doesn't
apply to the two

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.780
equations up there.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.540
And they also have two different
y-intercepts, so

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.425
it's definitely not choice D.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.640
Problem 48.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.500
Yoshi has exactly $1 in
dimes, which is $0.10,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.110
and nickels, $0.05.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.800
If Yoshi has twice as many dimes
as nickels, how many

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.570
nickels does she have?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.660
So she has $1.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:25.240
So let n equal the number of
nickels, and let d is equal to

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.295
the number of the dimes.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.560
So it says Yoshi has twice
as many dimes as nickels.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.800
So the dimes are twice as many
as the number of nickels.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.560
That's what this tells us.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120
Yoshi has twice as many
dimes as nickels.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.980
That translates into the dimes
are 2 times the nickels.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.790
And then we also know
that she has $1.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.140
So how do you get $1?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.630
Well, it's $0.10, so 0.1 times
the number of dimes.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.190
Plus 0.05 times the number of
nickels is equal to $1.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.100
Or maybe just so we can avoid
decimals, I could rewrite this

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.075
statement right here,
exactly $1.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:17.710
Instead of writing in dollars,
I could write in cents.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.780
I could write 10 cents times
each dime, plus 5 cents times

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.580
each nickel is equal
to 100 cents.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.100
So if you compare this equation
and this equation, I

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.310
just multiplied both
sides by 100.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.010
Here I'm dealing with cents--
$1 is 100 cents.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.430
Here I'm dealing with dollars.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.140
A dime is 1/10 of a dollar.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.950
A dime is 10 cents.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.930
This one right here is probably
a little bit easier

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.180
to deal with.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.890
So what are they asking?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.760
How many nickels
does she have?

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.570
So we want to solve for n, we
want to solve for nickels.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.680
We have this piece of
information right here.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.980
The dimes are equal to 2 times
the number of nickels.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.290
And we have this right here.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.985
So what we can do is
substitute for d.

00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:04.320
We can replace this d, and we
know that d is equal to 2n.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.840
So we could put 2n in
the place of that.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.040
So let me write it over here.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.990
So I have 10d plus 5n
is equal to 100.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.730
10 cents times my number of
dimes plus 5 cents times my

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.779
number of nickels is
equal to 100 cents.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:21.959
And then my dimes
is equal to 2n.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.560
So 10 times 2n plus 5n
is equal to 100.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.660
10 times 2n is just 20n, plus
5n, is equal to 100.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.820
And then we get 25n
is equal to 100.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.270
Divide both sides of this
equation by 25, and you get n

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.410
is equal to 100 divided
by 25 is 4.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.270
Yoshi has 4 nickels.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.550
And if you want to know
how many dimes, you

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.030
multiply it by 2.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.350
She has 8 dimes.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.420
So she has $0.80 in dimes
and she has $0.20 in

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.210
nickels, 4 times 5.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.040
Problem 49.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.400
What are all the possible values
of x such that 10 times

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.250
the absolute value of
x is equal to 2.5?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.480
So we can simplify this.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.085
So we have 10 times the
absolute value of

00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:19.050
x is equal to 2.5.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.490
Or if we divide both sides of
this equation by 10, we get--

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.940
let me do it in blue.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.940
We get the absolute value of
x is equal to-- what's 2.5

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.390
divided by 10?

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.410
You might be able to just
do it in your head.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.580
You say, oh, you know, there's
4 quarters in $1, or

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.480
25 times 4 is 100.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.460
But this is 25 divided by 10.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.800
You multiply 2.5 times 4,
you're going to get 10.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.920
So you can say this is 1/4.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.470
If that wasn't obvious
to you, you could

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.500
actually do the division.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.220
You can divide 10 into 2.5.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.160
Maybe throw some 0's there.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.220
Put the decimal there.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.570
10 goes into 2 zero times.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.180
0 times 10 is 0.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.150
Bring down the 2.

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.310
2 minus 0 is 2.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.790
Bring down the 5.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.990
10 goes into 25 how
many times?

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:20.670
10 goes into 25 two times.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.920
2 times 10 is 20.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.830
25 minus 20 is 5.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.510
Bring down another 0.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.300
10 goes into 50 exactly
five times.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.820
5 times 10 is 50.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.030
Subtract, you get 0.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.180
So 10 goes into 2.5, 0.25
times, which is the

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.430
same thing as 1/4.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.460
The absolute value of
x is equal to 0.25.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.970
Now that tells us that x, what
are the two values for x? x

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.820
could definitely be equal to
0.25, because the absolute

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.890
value of 0.25 is 0.25.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.630
Or what other number,
when I take its

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.400
absolute value, is 0.25?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.440
Well, it could be minus 0.25.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.490
I take the absolute value of
minus 0.25, I also get 0.25.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.400
So my two choices are 0.25 or
minus 0.25, and that is choice

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.770
A right there.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.680
And when we did this division,
I did it kind of a

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.780
long and slow way.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.320
And if you didn't recognize
this as 1/4.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.710
The other way to say it is when
you divide by 10, that's

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.600
equivalent to moving your
decimal 1 slot to the left.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.610
So you could have just said, oh,
2.5 divided by 10 is equal

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.220
to-- let's just move the decimal
over to the left-- is

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.160
equal to 0.25.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.200
All of those would have been
equivalent ways of doing it.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.740
Problem 50.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.810
Which of the following is
equivalent to 1 minus 2x is

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.830
greater than 3 times
x minus 2?

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.640
So let's solve this.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.180
So we have 1 minus 2x
is greater than 3

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.370
times x minus 2.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.850
Or we get 1 minus 2x is
greater than-- let's

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.160
distribute our 3-- 3x minus 6.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.690
3 times minus 2 is minus 6.

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.880
Now we can subtract
1 from both sides.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.006
So we have a minus 1 plus
here, and we're going to

00:08:09.006 --> 00:08:11.370
subtract a 1 from that side.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.230
The whole reason why I'm doing
that is to cancel out that 1

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.790
right there.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.080
So this side, those cancel out,
so I'm just left with

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.250
minus 2x is greater than
3x, and then minus 6

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.050
minus 1 is minus 7.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.050
And now here's the vaguely
tricky part.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.400
No, actually, we're not at the
vaguely tricky part yet.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.150
Let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.730
So we have minus 3x on
that side, and then

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.250
minus 3x on that side.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.409
And the whole reason why
I'm doing that is to

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:43.809
cancel out this 3x.

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:46.460
So that these two guys
obviously cancel out.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.450
Now minus 3x plus minus 2x,
which is minus 5x, is greater

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.420
than minus 7.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.340
And now here's the vaguely
tricky part.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.700
We want to divide both
sides by minus 5.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.790
But when you have an inequality,
and you're

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.360
dividing or multiplying both
sides by a negative number,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.000
you need to switch
the inequality.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.510
So if we divide both sides by
minus 5, so I could multiply

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.210
by a fraction, minus
1/5 times minus 5x.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.840
And then I'm going to have a
minus 7 times minus 1/5.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.690
I'm going to switch
the inequality.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.910
So it goes from greater
than to less than.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.180
And the whole reason why it's
switched is because I'm

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.040
multiplying both sides, or
depending on how you do it,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.580
dividing both sides by
a negative number.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:40.010
So then this becomes-- I picked
minus 1/5 so this

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.830
cancels out.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.590
So this just becomes x is less
than, and then minus 7 times

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.630
minus 1/5, the negatives cancel
out, or a negative

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.410
times a negative
is a positive.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.120
So you're left with 7/5.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.400
So x is less than 7/5.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.240
And it shows you that maybe you
don't want to go work out

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:00.910
the whole problem.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.990
Because right here, they didn't
expect me to figure out

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.140
the whole problem, so I just
wasted a little bit

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.470
of both of our time.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.930
They just wanted us to go a
couple of steps into it.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:09.960
So what did they just do?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.100
Well, they just wanted that
first step, where I

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.100
distributed the 3.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.410
3x minus 6.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.550
So that's all they did here.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.430
Because they didn't change the
left-hand side anywhere, they

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.280
didn't change the inequality
anywhere.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.070
So all I have to do is pick
choice C right there.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.270
But hopefully you learned
a little bit about

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.900
inequalities as well.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.040
I hate to waste your time like
that, but this was actually a

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.160
fairly straightforward
problem.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.700
But actually, the very
first step we did

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.690
got us to the answer.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.490
So that teaches us both a
lesson: look at the choices

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.020
before you proceed
with the problem.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.580
51.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.380
Which equation represents the
line on the graph below?

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.170
So we can look at this, we can
just kind of eyeball it.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.760
But sometime it's hard
to eyeball it.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.520
So what we want to do is look
for some point, my first

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.190
intuition is to say, OK, y
is equal to mx plus b.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.860
Let's look for the y-intercept
and the slope.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.280
But here the y-intercept,
it's not completely

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.240
obvious where it is.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.210
Although it looks like
it's at 1.5.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.660
And we can actually verify that
it's at 1.5, because its

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.300
slope, you can see right here.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.660
If we start at 1, and if we
go 2 to the right, we go

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.460
down by exactly 1.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:32.770
So its slope, m, is equal to
change in y over change in x.

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.480
When your change in x is
positive 2, your change in y

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.420
is minus 1.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.530
So your slope is minus 1/2.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:46.350
So if you go back 1, you're
going to go up 1/2.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.200
Just like that.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.410
So our y-intercept is 1.5.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.200
It's right there.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.350
It's equal to 1.5.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.780
Just like that.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.900
I can verify that
from the slope.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.390
If I start at 2, and I go 1 to
the right, that means I'm

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.170
going to go 1/2 down.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.640
Because my slope is minus 1/2.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.370
So we go 1/2 down, and that'll
get me to 1.5.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:15.435
So the equation of this line is
y is equal to minus 1/2 x,

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:19.290
that's my slope, plus 1.5.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:21.870
And that doesn't look like any
of these choices here, so we

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.890
need to simplify this
a little bit.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.920
Well, the first thing we might
want to do is multiply both

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.600
sides of this equation by 2.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.370
So you get 2y is equal to 2
times minus 1/2 x, is just

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.310
minus x, and then 2
times 1.5 is 3.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.530
Plus 3.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:41.660
And then if we add x to both
sides of this equation, and

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.440
I'm doing that to get rid of
this minus x on the right-hand

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:50.900
side, we get x plus
2y is equal to 3.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.660
And that is choice A right
there, which was completely

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.890
equivalent to what
we did up here.
