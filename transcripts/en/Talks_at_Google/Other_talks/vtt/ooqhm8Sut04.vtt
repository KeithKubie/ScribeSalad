SAL YANEZ: Hi, Kellee.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.630
First of all, thank you very
much for being here with us.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.770
I think your story is
very inspirational.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.440
And now with Hispanic
Heritage Month,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.540
it's very useful to hear
about your experience.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.510
So why don't we start with
listening about your story.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.730
How did this girl who
was born in Venezuela

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.740
grow up to be president and
co-founder of thatgamecompany,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.740
have your own games, changed
all these paradigms about how

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.130
the video game industry
thinks about games,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.320
potentially putting a
little bit of art in it,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.470
and how you ended up here?

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.360
Can you walk us
through your story?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.560
And what was the key
inspiration that you had?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.230
How were you thinking about when
you did different maneuvers?

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.600
Especially being at
USC, doing an MFA,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.370
and then coming back into
the video game industry.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.970
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah, I'll try
and do the highlights, maybe.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.100
I'm sure we'll dig
into points of it.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.880
So my father, first, is Cuban.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.800
He left it with his family
in 1960, as many did.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.790
And while he was in the
United States, met my mother.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.680
They were in Virginia.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.530
He worked in
software engineering

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.660
and also did a lot of management
in the business side of it.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.630
And so he would often work
with the Latin American arms

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.830
of various software and
technology companies.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.730
And that's how my family ended
up in Venezuela for a few years

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.170
during which I was born.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.720
We then, shortly thereafter,
came back to Virginia.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.030
I grew up in Richmond,
Virginia, and didn't

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.154
know any other Latinas.

00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:52.070
I was trying to think.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.110
I don't know that there were
any other Latinas at my school.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.420
I definitely grew up
in a pretty traditional

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.400
suburban American
neighborhood, right

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.940
in the middle between the
city of Richmond and the farms

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.080
outside.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.690
And not a lot of people leave
Virginia to go to college,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.980
but for some reason,
I had it in my mind

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.380
that I was going to leave
as soon as I graduated

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.520
from high school.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.754
And I really focused
on going to New York.

00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:29.920
That's where I wanted to go.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.010
And so while I was
in high school--

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.700
I had been developing
my whole life--

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.070
but really gravitated
towards the arts

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.359
and all mediums of art.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.900
But in high school, I think it
started really focusing around

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.150
performing arts.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.500
And so I applied to the
New York University Tisch

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.450
School of the Arts
for theater, and that

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.090
was my ticket out of Virginia.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.380
And looking back, I
think some of that

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.920
had to do with just
being an outsider

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.011
from the very beginning.

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:03.510
My husband and I
talk a lot about it

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.860
because he's from Toronto,
and loves Toronto,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.780
and grew up there, and
feels a lot affinity there.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.570
And how is it that you
grow up in a place,

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.650
and yet, you don't feel like
you're really from there.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.990
So then in New York,
I really started

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.830
gravitating towards
original works, which

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.890
more and more
started incorporating

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.430
interactive media and digital
media into the performances.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.740
And so I would become
the de facto person

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.700
in charge of that stuff
because I was in the arts,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.947
but then I also was very
comfortable with computers

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:42.530
because we always
had one at my house,

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.988
and my dad worked
in that business.

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:47.730
And it was something
that was never taboo

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.380
or that I was discouraged from.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.500
So a couple years after
graduating from NYU,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.440
I decided to, oh, maybe
I'll focus on that,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.770
really become specialized
in interactive media

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.807
and performance.

00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:04.640
And that's what brought
me to the University

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.400
of Southern California and
their MFA in interactive media

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.396
program.

00:04:09.396 --> 00:04:11.580
So this other throughline
through all that

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.210
is video games and
playing video games.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.899
But it's like another place
for outsiders, I guess,

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:25.180
and also a space in which--
all through college,

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.330
I was in college right at
the height of "GoldenEye."

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.780
That's what you did with people.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.580
But that was one of the first
times, also, it was all guys,

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.370
and none of my
girlfriends did it.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.320
And that was really
interesting and weird,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.960
and that continued after school.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.160
So it was something
that I enjoyed.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.690
It was part of my life.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.400
But never thought about
who made a video game,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.730
or how they went about it,
or that it was something

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.870
that I would do.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.040
And then my first
year at USC, I had

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.780
this course in the
history of play,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.880
taught by Tracy Fullerton,
who now chairs the program.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.680
And it looked at the
history of game design

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.510
not only within the context
of digital video games

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.630
but throughout human history,
and the role of play and game

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.590
design in culture.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:26.180
And I think that really opened
my eyes up to game design

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.865
as a medium through which
you would communicate.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.850
That, coupled within the
school's general philosophy

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.890
of rapid iteration
and prototyping,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.890
The program is housed within
the School of Cinematic Arts,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.750
so it really took this
storytelling focus on it.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.530
I'm sorry.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.080
I feel like this
keeps dangling off.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.090
Is it OK?

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.100
You can hear OK, right?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.049
OK.

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:54.549
Sorry.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.290
So yeah, thinking about it
as a communicative medium.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.490
And instead of starting with
this bullet point list of we're

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.690
making this kind of
game, we're going

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.340
to make an RPG, that means
it has this kind of mechanic,

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.090
and it's going to be
set in this world,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.990
and our twist is you're a
girl, or whatever that is,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.650
it was really
starting with, what's

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.100
a story that you want to tell?

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.140
And now let's use this
process of rapid iteration

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.690
and prototyping to discover
game mechanics that elicit that.

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:34.130
And yeah, so I just started
dedicating everything to that.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.150
I realize it was the medium I
had been looking for all along.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:44.510
It was really a combination
of those interests in science

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.620
and technology as well as
the arts and communication,

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.660
and also anthropology
and psychology.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.540
And the people in it were and
are of that like-mindedness.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.590
So for the first time, when
I went to my first Game

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.120
Developers Conference
that same year,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.850
it was like a one-two
punch in getting me

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.070
on board with game design.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.390
So having my eyes open to
game design as a medium,

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.360
and then going to the
Game Developers Conference

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.420
and feeling like I was
a part of this tribe,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.779
that these were my people.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.570
And that really energized
me, and so I just

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.690
started trying to work on as
many game projects as possible.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.610
And that's what led
me to collaborating

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.930
with my fellow student
Jenova Chen on a student

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.510
project called "Cloud."

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.244
OK, is this good?

00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:40.910
SAL YANEZ: Yeah.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.285
KELLEE SANTIAGO:
We're getting up

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:47.350
to-- OK, not too much,
not too little, hopefully.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:52.930
So "Cloud," it's funny to think
about now because, for us, it

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.820
was really an
experiment in thinking,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:01.890
could we take this philosophy
of our program, this viewpoint

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:05.040
of, really, games
as storytelling,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.930
use that to communicate a
story that was not typically

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.320
told in commercially
accepted video games,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.370
but make something that would
appeal to an equally, if not

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.060
broader, audience?

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.010
The idea being that we were
growing up and maturing,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.980
and there weren't games
there for us anymore.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:33.179
That games with deep story
also required so much time

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.580
that we didn't have.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.120
And the converse of that was
really casual, shallow games.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.280
And so could we create games
that both deeply resonated

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.080
with people, but also
recognized constraints

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.030
around time and money?

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:57.100
And "Cloud" was
this game in which

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.470
you played as a boy who
was trapped in the hospital

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.500
and daydreamed he could
fly through the clouds.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.580
And the idea was to
elicit this feeling

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.270
like you were a kid daydreaming
and looking at the sky.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:15.880
And I think there was
another school that

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.190
had this story of how their
game for another festival

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.235
had been downloaded 1,000
times or something like that.

00:09:24.235 --> 00:09:25.860
And we were like,
oh, we could do that.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.170
Because you really
just put them online,

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.890
and people downloaded them
to judge them for festivals.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.740
Or probably not.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.024
Usually, we would send CD-ROMs.

00:09:35.024 --> 00:09:35.940
That's how you did it.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.020
But we made the website, so if
someone happens to check it out

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.644
at one of these festivals, they
can then go play it themselves.

00:09:45.644 --> 00:09:47.180
That would be awesome.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.560
And then within three months,
we had over 300,000 downloads

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.010
from all over the world.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:59.180
It was extremely
organic, extremely viral.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.860
And it made us feel like we
were really on to something.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.990
This was something
that people wanted.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:13.090
So "Cloud" was created
under this grant

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.610
that EA had provided the school.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.220
And so as part of
that grant project,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.520
we were to pitch
to EA as though we

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.350
were going to make "Cloud"
into a full console title.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.030
But as a result
of this exercise,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.860
Jenova and I had
this full pitch deck

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.110
about what it would look
like if we created a company,

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:38.480
and we had done all
this thinking about it.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.400
And we got a lot of
feedback from EA.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.580
That was extremely useful.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.910
And one of the points
of feedback that we got

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.020
was, hey, there's this new thing
called digital distribution.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.920
And those games can be smaller.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.010
You don't have to make these
multimillion dollar projects

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.170
anymore.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.310
And that will be a
barrier for you guys

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.230
because you don't have any
experience in the industry.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.310
So maybe if you
scaled this down,

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.860
think about making
a small version that

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.600
could be digitally distributed
at a smaller price point, that

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.420
would be more acceptable.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.930
And that's what we did.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.220
And then sure enough, Sony
was really into that idea

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.640
because, unbeknownst to
the world at that point,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.990
they were planning on
PlayStation Network

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.600
the next year.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.740
And they also had an idea about
using digital distribution

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.180
to create high quality unique
content that wouldn't get made

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.520
otherwise, and to take
advantage of these smaller price

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:44.000
points and a willingness to have
shorter experiences than you

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.030
would when you buy a
$50, $60 disk title.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.780
So we joined forces with
them in a three-game deal

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.510
to develop three titles
for PlayStation Network.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:57.660
And we did "Flow,"
"Flower," and then "Journey"

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:02.560
was our last one, under this
umbrella of thatgamecompany.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.200
The mission of
thatgamecompany was

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.820
to create experiences
that would push

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.260
the boundaries of video games
as a communicative medium.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.680
So every game that we did,
we started with a point of,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.640
first of all, what's
something that hasn't

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.980
been done in games before?

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.730
But also, what are we motivated
to talk about and say?

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.890
And then going on a long
journey ourselves to figure out,

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:33.350
OK, what's the game that
really captures that feeling?

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.780
And one of the things I'm
probably the most proud

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.410
of with all three games
is I think no matter

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:43.810
when it is I'm looking at them,
and if I look at any of them

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.400
today, they're all
still super weird to me,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.240
in a way that I can't believe
we got away with making

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.520
that on a major console.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.830
And that then lots of people
played it and were really

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.620
into those titles.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.020
I'm very proud that we
took that opportunity

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.630
that we had to go out on a limb
and that we just really did

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.490
that.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.040
And we kind of said, well,
whether it's successful or not,

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.060
we're at least going
to really try this out.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.764
And I feel like we did
that on every project.

00:13:21.764 --> 00:13:23.140
SAL YANEZ: Wow.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.410
That's extremely interesting.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.970
Thanks for sharing
your story, by the way.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:26.886
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah.

00:13:26.886 --> 00:13:29.260
SAL YANEZ: And I think what
stands out the most to me

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.510
is how you were talking about
you got to this place thanks

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.200
to a perfect combination
of several factors.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.190
You had passion for media.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.210
You had a hobby for video games.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.560
You had the family influence
for systems and computers.

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:50.120
You had the school influence
with historic gaming.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.730
And then you started going
and pivoting from this place

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.470
where you felt like a
stranger to this place

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.690
where you felt
like you belonged.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:00.460
And you started
finding this community,

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.490
and that became very
powerful for you.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.670
And I think that working
with that community

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.150
allowed you to explore
outside your comfort zone

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.360
and start thinking
about video games

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.740
as art, as communicating a
story line through video games.

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.410
And I think that's
really powerful.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.500
And it comes thanks
to all that background

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.620
that allowed you to go out
there and explore that.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.010
Can you tell us how
that specific mindset

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.130
started of video games as art?

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:31.080
Because many people
here, we don't generally

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.960
think of video games as art.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.390
Once you start
understanding why, then it

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.410
starts making sense.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:41.610
Can you walk us through why
you consider video games art?

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.780
And how did you
start with this idea?

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.040
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.470
Well, fundamentally,
it comes down

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.673
to-- did you play video games
when you were growing up?

00:14:53.673 --> 00:14:54.360
SAL YANEZ: Yeah.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.443
KELLEE SANTIAGO: What was
a game that you really--

00:14:56.443 --> 00:14:58.894
SAL YANEZ: Well, I
played "GoldenEye,"

00:14:58.894 --> 00:15:01.550
"Mario Kart," "Smash Brothers."

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.358
So I'm not a big gamer, but
I did spend a few hundred

00:15:05.358 --> 00:15:07.170
hours in those games.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:08.940
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah,
so maybe some of it

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.660
is trying to validate
that time spent.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.710
I think there is
an element where

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.210
I like to think anyone who's
making that argument, including

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:26.170
myself, it's because there has
been at least one game that's

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.860
impacted you in a way that
any other medium would.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:35.120
So it's hard to negate that
or put a divide somehow

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:41.610
between the experience
I had with-- I'm

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.650
trying to think of
any of them, even

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:52.340
"Zelda 64" and the emotional
journey of that story.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.400
I know a lot of
other people my age,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.690
it's "Final Fantasy 7,"
which is the hero's journey.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:04.430
And the impact that had
on them and their psyche,

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.630
it just feels similar
to other art forms.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.770
So we say that.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.240
But the other component
of it is then, really,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.170
I think formalizing the
vocabulary and ideas

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.580
around that when I
was at grad school.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.670
And within the game developer
community as a whole,

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.000
I think that's a large
thrust of the work

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.940
that we do as a
community, is really

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.740
understanding what is
codifying and trying

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.810
to put vocabulary around this.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.900
That professor,
Tracy Fullerton, was

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.860
part of a whole academic
movement which is really

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.730
captured in her book, "Game
Design Workshop," which

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.930
is based on this idea I think
coming from a time when there

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.850
was this idea that game
designers were just wizards

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.990
and you could do it
or you couldn't do it.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.910
You were either good at
it or not good at it.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:07.410
But there was a whole other
subculture saying, well,

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:12.750
we think that we can put
some structure around this

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.310
and put some ideas to this,
that we could teach anyone

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.609
how to do it.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.329
You can at least make
someone a good designer

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.540
and maybe make a good
designer a great designer

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:28.380
through this process.

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:36.430
So I think that was hugely
formative and really

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:43.050
solidifying, for me, the idea
that games have the potential

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.780
to be artistic.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.850
I don't think all
games are artistic,

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:52.140
but I don't think all television
is art or all films are art.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.850
But is it capable of that?

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.300
Yes, it's definitely
capable of that.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.450
There's a vocabulary.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.160
There is a language.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.240
You can use it to speak to
other people through it.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.430
SAL YANEZ: That's great.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.330
So when I think about
video games and so on,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.340
I think that there can be many
different components of it.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.780
One can be the
graphics part, that I

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.940
can see graphics being art.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.740
You can think about
the music, the music

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.436
in a video game being are.

00:18:19.436 --> 00:18:20.810
But you're referring
specifically

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.720
to the storytelling, to how you
connect with other audiences.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.360
And the example that
you bring is Zelda.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.550
It has a storytelling to it, but
it's a very complicated story.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.360
So when you compare
it against "Cloud,"

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.950
this kid who just dreams about
going through the clouds,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.986
or a video game where
you're just the wind

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:43.970
and you're going
through the mountains,

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.680
it's a very different story.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.130
And you mentioned
it even now, I'm

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.940
surprised that so many
people got into it.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.660
What do you think made so
many people get into it?

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:58.050
It's definitely art,
but art is not always

00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:59.410
appreciated right away.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:03.150
It doesn't become as viral
as your games have become.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:06.170
What do you think made your
game special as opposed

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.440
to other games who might
be trying storytelling

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.432
in this novel way but
didn't succeed as you did.

00:19:12.432 --> 00:19:14.640
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah, I
mean, I think a lot of games

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.010
require a lot of
players in order

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:23.230
to get that story out of it.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.990
I mean, accessibility as a
whole was really important to us

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.690
and continues to be
important to all of us.

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:35.840
And so how could
we remove barriers?

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.170
How could we create experiences
that really invited people

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.140
into them as opposed to
punishing them for not doing

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.700
the things we want them to do?

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.840
So not requiring a
lot of time in order

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.140
to even grasp the
story I think is

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:57.170
a barrier that we removed there.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:00.272
Controls, "Cloud," actually
had really weird controls,

00:20:00.272 --> 00:20:01.730
because we were
trying to make ones

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.860
that were more accessible
than your average PC game.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.170
We failed at it on
"Cloud." it was something

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.710
that we took into our
work on PlayStation

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.600
and iterated over
time and every project

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.220
in trying to really
remove those barriers.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.940
I have many friends who pick
up the controller in any

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.740
of our games and they
almost are sweating.

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.400
Oh my god, what am
I supposed to do?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.140
It's OK.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.764
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

00:20:33.764 --> 00:20:34.680
You can figure it out.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.330
It's all right.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.560
You have time and there's
nothing coming out after you.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:47.800
So yeah, trying to think about
not just making a game easier.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.520
Difficulty is a barrier,
but there actually

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:57.190
are these other
barriers that almost

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:59.900
are psychological
to many people when

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.992
they approach a video game.

00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:03.700
SAL YANEZ: Great.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.540
And so just building
on that, when

00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.330
you were thinking about
launching a new game,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:12.610
and you want to adjust the
difficulty, the controls,

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.290
every single aspect
of the game, how

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:20.020
do you think about it when it's
such a new way of doing gaming?

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.000
Because you can't really compare
the controls against a fighting

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.510
game or something like that.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.020
And even how people think
about it and they get engaged,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.050
it also varies.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.120
So how do you do it?

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.050
Did you start with
your small community

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.730
and then build up from there?

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.760
And if so, were you concerned?

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.905
How did you tackle the
obstacles that the market

00:21:40.905 --> 00:21:42.946
might be different from
the small group designing

00:21:42.946 --> 00:21:43.446
this game?

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.050
KELLEE SANTIAGO:
Yeah, play testing

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:49.400
is really, really critical.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.150
And for us, we would
do it every two weeks

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:53.260
from the very
beginning of a project,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:58.480
because we would start
with this very vague idea.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.050
Like with "Journey," it was,
make an online multiplayer

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.100
console game that left
you with a renewed

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.740
sense of faith in humanity.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:08.970
There's a lot that
could fall under that,

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:14.620
and so you just start
throwing things at the wall.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.610
And it's very painful.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.600
I think one of the biggest
mistakes game designers make

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.860
is not doing that.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.600
And it's something that
everyone talks about.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.630
But it's hard to watch people
play this thing that is ugly

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:33.445
and you know isn't
good but it's so useful

00:22:33.445 --> 00:22:34.570
to get that feedback on it.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:37.530
And yeah, I always
start with what's

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.480
called friends and
family playtests

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.300
and bring in even
more than just friends

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.890
and families but limiting
it to close advisors

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.760
who were also usually game
developers who I found

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.200
were very articulate.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.240
So they could hear
what is that goal

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:01.100
and then how is our experience
aligning with that goal or not.

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.630
Then maybe opening it
up to friends and family

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.850
and then opening
up to a broad pool.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.980
I mean doing very traditional
like user testing, focus

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.450
testing style sessions
with our games.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.870
But at the end, I always felt
like-- I mean, especially

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:19.180
with "Journey" and
being an online game,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.330
we didn't do an
online beta, really.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.760
We did one limited.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.170
So we didn't know
how many people

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.500
were always going to be
on together, for instance.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.920
Those kind of questions
we had to launch

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.650
with them being unanswered.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:41.710
And for me, it was,
do I think that we

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:45.210
made the game that articulated
the original goals we set out

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.120
to do?

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.960
Yes, OK, then I
think it's a success,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:54.690
and then everything else happens
outside and I can't control it.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.290
SAL YANEZ: Well, in
that very specific case

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.640
for "Journey," it sounds like
there were a lot of things

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.330
that you did different,
maybe based on the experience

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.710
that you had before.

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:07.830
So can you talk a little
bit about whether you

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.170
think that was part of
the success of "Journey?"

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.980
So when you compare it
against "Flow," "Flower,"

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.770
or even "Cloud," "Journey"
was a lot more successful

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:20.080
but it sounds that it's the one
where you didn't do the beta.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.705
You didn't do a lot of testing.

00:24:21.705 --> 00:24:24.080
Did you just decide to
go for the storytelling

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.410
and answer the question, am
I creating the product that I

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.490
want to create?

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.109
Do you think that
that's what generated

00:24:32.109 --> 00:24:33.150
the success of "Journey?"

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.010
And if so, if you were going
to launch another game,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.860
is that what you would do again?

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.568
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Well,
we still get a lot

00:24:39.568 --> 00:24:40.760
of testing with "Journey."

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.100
We just didn't do a full
online test with it.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.304
But I don't know.

00:24:48.304 --> 00:24:50.470
Whenever there's something
that's really successful,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.011
it's really easy to
go back and think

00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:55.220
you're reverse engineering it.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.120
I do think there is an element.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.964
Like in "Journey,"
it is first of all,

00:24:58.964 --> 00:25:03.080
it's the hero's
journey structure

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.630
that came from, again,
this idea of creating

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.180
games that would resonate
with a wide group of people.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.560
And then saying, oh
here's Joseph Campbell

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.400
and all his research
on hero's journey.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.290
That's a story
that has resonated

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.280
with a wide group of people
over thousands of years.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.240
What if we took it
into a video game?

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.910
But then, also, you were
playing as this avatar which

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.820
you weren't in our
previous games, really,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.650
this sort of human-like being.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:35.950
I think that possibly
resonated more

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.000
with the core PlayStation
audience, at least

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.670
at that time.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.730
So yeah, I mean, there was
always a part of our process

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.940
that was understanding
who our core audience was,

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.190
which I think is
really helpful and not

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.550
something many people
maybe pick up on, as far as

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:56.910
what we were doing, or what I
think is still really critical.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.700
Which is, there is this
story you want to tell,

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.572
but having impact
is this process

00:26:01.572 --> 00:26:03.780
of thinking of like who is
your initial core audience

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:06.300
and radiating out from there.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.290
And because we had an
exclusive deal with Sony,

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.331
we knew our audience was
going to be this PlayStation 3

00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:13.830
audience.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.250
That fundamentally was who
we were locked to at launch.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.000
And if we don't
resonate with them,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.430
it's not going to have that
ripple effect outwards.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.350
So we deliberately made choices
around what it would look like.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.820
And of course, Sony
having some input on that

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:37.680
as far as their goals
for what looks like

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.970
and feels like a polished
PlayStation experience.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:41.660
SAL YANEZ: OK.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.360
Did they have a lot of
influence in the game, then?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.840
Were they actively
involved in that one?

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.590
KELLEE SANTIAGO: So
for the most part, no.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:51.530
They're very hands
off as a studio

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:54.440
with their external developers.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.250
But I think, the
positive influence of it

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:02.210
is that we all were kids
straight out of school

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:04.850
and we had no experience
doing commercial games.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:10.080
And they really pushed
us in understanding

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.500
what it meant to make
a high quality console

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.960
title, which is very different
than making a student project.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.182
There are a lot of
growing pains along that.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.890
Yeah, growing pains is probably
the best way to describe it.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.210
SAL YANEZ: OK.

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.810
So it sounds like you
as a group learned a lot

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.270
from that experience.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.240
And thinking about
the group, I would

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.120
like to go back to something
that you said earlier about how

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:39.310
at the beginning you were
feeling like an outsider.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.920
And then there was a point where
you felt like you belonged.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.810
Thinking about the
framing of this talk,

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:49.490
we're doing this as part
of Hispanic Heritage Month,

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:54.080
I would like to ask you how
do you find that community?

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.600
Being a Hispanic woman in
the video game industry,

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.260
how did you navigate that?

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:01.960
Were there any
obstacles that you

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.810
needed to tackle that
you want to highlight?

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.360
And if so, after
that, how did you

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.955
build that community that
you felt like you belonged?

00:28:08.955 --> 00:28:10.830
But I think it's very
important for everybody

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:15.670
here to understand how do you
find that place, that community

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.542
where you feel like you belong?

00:28:17.542 --> 00:28:19.290
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Mhm.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.870
Yeah, that's huge.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:31.340
So I don't know anyone
else's experience but my own.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.885
I guess that's the first thing.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:45.300
I think feeling like an
outsider from early on

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:53.640
has helped me in giving me a
certain naivety around what's

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.341
acceptable for me to
say and do or not.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.140
At the same time,
I think it also

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:10.550
made me feel from early
on that there was maybe,

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:14.540
even if it wasn't literal,
but a language barrier to me

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.830
and other groups of people.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.090
I could figure out
how to plug myself in,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.730
if I could figure
out the right way

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.260
to say the thing I needed to
say to this group of people.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.970
Which has helped in public
speaking and teaching

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:28.590
and stuff.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:32.000
It's a good way
to think about it

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.660
and dialogues cross-culture
is really helpful.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:42.510
But at the same time,
going into games,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:49.880
there was a lot of,
I think, doubts.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.580
I perceived a lot of
doubts around my presence

00:29:52.580 --> 00:30:00.500
in that space, whether it
was doubts about my validity

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.900
as a woman, like, oh, I'm
here because I'm the girl,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.490
or I'm here because
I'm cute, or whatever.

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.900
That sense and
that idea of being

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:21.760
around me, it was a really huge
turning point for me, actually,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.100
getting to join the
TED Fellows network

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.910
and being a part of a community
where actually a lot of them

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.760
are in similar positions
or a lot of outsiders

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:38.270
in their fields and getting
advice back to me about really,

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:42.150
at a certain point,
taking feedback is good

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:54.120
but you also need to come at
it with a core grounding that

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.430
had gotten worn down for me.

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:03.370
And it definitely opened
me up to a greater sense

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.510
of understanding and
empathy for all minorities

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.430
in whatever field.

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:13.670
Because I think that
that's an issue that

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:17.350
affects us all,
having a constant,

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.110
you're not really
supposed to be here.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.350
You're only here
because of this.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.240
Whatever that is.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:37.130
So really being regrounded
and saying almost--

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:43.400
what is that joke around
affirmation style?

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.220
"You're good and people
like you" or whatever.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:53.050
But really, for a while, having
to feel that within myself,

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.660
this is what I'm bringing.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:56.800
This is where I'm coming from.

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.680
And this is valuable on its own.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.280
This is not just valuable
in a certain context

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.010
in a certain place,
but this is valuable.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.490
And I think that's also allowed
me to be in a better place

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:07.930
to accept feedback.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.530
And I have grown and
evolved much quicker.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.980
But for a while, it
was this downward trend

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:19.210
that I could have seen on
another path stalling out.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:24.410
And I think that's what
happens to many of us.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:25.420
SAL YANEZ: Of course.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.060
KELLEE SANTIAGO: You're just
gonna say I'm just tired

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.860
and I'm not going
to do it anymore.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.870
SAL YANEZ: Yeah.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:36.310
And it's difficult for many
of us-- the stereotypes,

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:39.980
the obstacles that one
needs to just jump in order

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.460
to get to where we are.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.940
Thank you for sharing that part.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.950
That was extremely
powerful, and I

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:49.940
think it's very inspiring
for the audience here.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.900
How do you think
you are translating

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.190
that, all that experience,
everything that you learned

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.390
in the video game industry into
Google, especially thinking

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.150
about how to open
it up, how to bring

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.962
more people into the community,
how to make it more inclusive?

00:33:05.962 --> 00:33:07.670
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah,
well, so right now

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.120
I'm working as a publishing
producer on the Daydream team.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.660
And so really it's an
all new virtual reality,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.310
augmented reality, how are you
going to operate in that space?

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:23.690
Also publishing games and
building out an ecosystem.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:29.930
And it feels like yet another
moment to set a new precedent

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.400
and set a new tone,
which is something,

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.900
I think, we're, always hoping
to do in whatever we're

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:39.370
doing at Google,
because they provide

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.150
that kind of
opportunity and outlook

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.590
towards the world
in what you do.

00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:48.960
So I mean, in preparation
for this talk,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.340
I was thinking a lot
about this and that I

00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:57.910
think games, what I love
about them within tech

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.350
is that they are
really inclusive space.

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.160
There are like huge
development communities

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:13.590
now in Brazil and Argentina,
Mexico, and Puerto Rico,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.500
and then growing
scenes in others.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.070
So it's a great way for people
to come in and get skills

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:24.080
and technology that I
think have a lower barrier

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.790
than other sectors of tech.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.270
And games themselves
are the space

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:34.810
in which you are invited
to drop your identity,

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:38.880
assume another, pretend
to be someone else,

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:45.219
to play out the worlds that
you want as opposed to the one

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.650
that you are in.

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:51.150
Gaming culture is a
whole other thing,

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:56.350
and that's been a big subject
for the last few years.

00:34:56.350 --> 00:35:03.530
And I think that we
can separate those out,

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:07.430
games from the gaming culture.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.680
And here is an opportunity
with a new platform,

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:15.150
a new ecosystem, to maybe
make a positive contribution

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:19.560
in setting a new tone
for a new culture.

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.810
Another way it's really
impacted me is I'm involved.

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:28.510
We're a growing team and
so I've been thrust in.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.917
This is just now my
first year at Google,

00:35:30.917 --> 00:35:32.500
but I think I've
been thrust in really

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.230
fast to the interviewing process
and learning about how it's

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:44.230
done here and thinking a lot
about what are ways in which- I

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.904
know we're always trying
to remove that bias,

00:35:48.904 --> 00:35:50.820
but what are ways in
which it's still present?

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.830
Are there ways in
which are questions

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:59.440
around logical thinking biased
towards a specific person

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:02.024
that's come from a specific
privileged background?

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:05.790
I'm not saying that it is.

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.400
It's just something
I think about a lot,

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.880
and I am shaping the questions
that we ask other people.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.730
So I'm really trying at every
step to ask those questions.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.440
And it's great to
be in a community,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:26.160
actually, of other Googlers
that accept those questions very

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.663
genuinely.

00:36:27.663 --> 00:36:28.538
SAL YANEZ: Of course.

00:36:28.538 --> 00:36:29.430
And that's great.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.290
And I think it does work at the
dual level study you described.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:36.030
First is, how do you form
of team here that works

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:38.030
against those unconscious bias?

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.950
How can you form all
these perceptions

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.510
that allow you to bring
your full self to work?

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.430
But then there's also
how, as platform creators,

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.820
can you impact the
gaming culture?

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.070
I think that one is
even more powerful,

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:55.060
because I think that's where the
vast majority of the problems

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.840
are.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.112
Do have any initial
thoughts about how

00:36:58.112 --> 00:36:59.320
you were thinking about that?

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.710
How do you think
you can positively

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:07.020
impact the gaming culture via
the other platform creation?

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.020
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yes.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:12.130
It's a tricky spot that
Google operates in, right?

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.800
I think as we're
all familiar with,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:19.110
which is setting up tools
and structures to be open

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:24.980
and for everyone while at the
same time wanting to present

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:25.950
a certain perspective.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:33.100
And with Daydream
publishing, we're

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.610
really on the edge of
that, because publishing

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.482
isn't an operation
Google typically does.

00:37:38.482 --> 00:37:39.940
Google builds the
platform and then

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:42.310
people make the stuff
for the platform.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.230
And with publishing,
you're going out

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.240
with whatever resource it
is, even if it's just a hey,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.470
we're going to be
really hands on with you

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.470
and give you advice
and consultation

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.770
from our original partners.

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.770
The projects you
choose to do with that

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.170
put a perspective out
there in the world.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:08.610
And so I don't know if I can say
too much more than that, other

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.670
than we're constantly
thinking about it.

00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:19.730
Well, I guess at Google, you try
to think about things at scale,

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.530
but we also try to think
about the tone we're

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:25.010
setting at scale.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.590
What does it mean to pick
this project over this one?

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.290
Yeah.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.290
SAL YANEZ: That's great.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.850
I mean, the initial thoughts
are more than useful.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.770
It's about how you think
about the developers.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.305
Where are you sourcing ideas?

00:38:40.305 --> 00:38:41.680
Where are your
sourcing products?

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.340
What are you supporting?

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:45.325
And then which kind of
ideas they are promoting

00:38:45.325 --> 00:38:46.450
within the platform, right?

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:47.930
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Right.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.610
SAL YANEZ: So thanks.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.630
Let me make sure that
we can open it up

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.592
to questions from the
audience before we finalize.

00:38:54.592 --> 00:38:56.550
Because I'm pretty sure
there's a few questions

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.804
that people will want to ask.

00:38:58.804 --> 00:38:59.720
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.990
SAL YANEZ: I want to
give them a chance first.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.624
Do we have our
microphone, by the way?

00:39:04.624 --> 00:39:06.290
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yes,
Elizabeth has one.

00:39:10.052 --> 00:39:10.718
SAL YANEZ: Yeah.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.516
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:16.516 --> 00:39:17.450
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Hey.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.380
AUDIENCE: Is it on?

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.000
SAL YANEZ: I don't
think it's on.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.250
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Try it again.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.880
SAL YANEZ: Is the
microphone working?

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.130
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yes, yeah.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:27.480
SAL YANEZ: It is
now working, yes.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.337
AUDIENCE: So I wrote down a few
questions but I'll just as one.

00:39:30.337 --> 00:39:31.420
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Oh, cool.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.072
AUDIENCE: One is
something that I

00:39:33.072 --> 00:39:35.280
thought of while you were
talking about storytelling.

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.920
I feel like text adventures are
a huge place where innovation

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.900
has happened, But
it's an old thing.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.530
And I was wondering
if it's something

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.687
that you've looked into
or drawn inspiration from.

00:39:46.687 --> 00:39:48.020
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Oh, definitely.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.380
I mean, it's been huge,
especially drawing

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:55.280
in and empowering
the transgender

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.360
community in game development.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:03.140
A lot of the Twine
community has really

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.530
empowered that in
such an awesome way.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:09.890
So yeah, I think about
how can we build on that.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:13.100
Is it just time?

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.680
Is it that tool is
there now and then

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.270
it's just waiting for people
to build up the skill sets?

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:24.610
Or are those voices getting
lost at a certain point?

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:26.550
To me, it's what's the
next step from there?

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.832
Because it's definitely
providing a lot of opportunity

00:40:28.832 --> 00:40:30.790
for a lot of people that
didn't have it before.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:37.330
And how can I like enable those
experiences in other mediums

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.130
that I'm working on, for sure?

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.522
Some of those, yeah,
they're really great.

00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:43.480
AUDIENCE: I also really
appreciate the call-out

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.190
to the transgender community.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.389
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Oh sure.

00:40:46.389 --> 00:40:47.430
AUDIENCE: It's important.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.760
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious,
what makes you decide

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.390
to leave thatgamecompany?

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:06.045
And what makes you think you
picked VR as the new direction

00:41:06.045 --> 00:41:07.712
to pursue after?

00:41:07.712 --> 00:41:10.030
And do you think
VR is a bad example

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.506
about gaming story like art?

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:19.070
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah,
so part of the answer

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:20.730
to thatgamecompany
is easy, which

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.430
is it was six years together.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.530
And it's like having a company
together is like a long term

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.170
relationship.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:30.110
And at that point, either
you're growing together,

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.149
you're all growing and
changing over six years.

00:41:33.149 --> 00:41:35.440
You're either growing together
or you're growing apart,

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.900
and we just recognized
that we were growing apart

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.670
in what we wanted to do next.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:47.370
And really, it felt like
putting the round peg

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:53.640
in the square hole, or vice
versa of being together

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.380
and constraining ourselves.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:59.710
So instead, let's separate
and really unchain ourselves

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.990
and feel free to
pursue exactly what it

00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:03.840
is we wanted to be doing.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.445
One of the things was
originally with thatgamecompany,

00:42:06.445 --> 00:42:08.580
the idea Jenova and
I had was to build

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.230
an umbrella under which
many studios could operate,

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.680
but that's not how
thatgamecompany evolved,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.940
for good reasons.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.330
And I still wanted to.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.760
I still wanted to put
a multiplier effect

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.632
on this impact.

00:42:23.632 --> 00:42:25.090
And that's part of
also what led me

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:27.830
to Ouya, the
Android-based console

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.170
where I was head of developer
relations and content

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.147
acquisition.

00:42:32.147 --> 00:42:34.480
And it was like the pendulum
swinging all the other way,

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.792
the entire way, where at
thatgamecompany, "Journey" was

00:42:38.792 --> 00:42:39.500
the last project.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.320
It had been three years,
one game at a time.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.270
And Ouya was working
on 500 games at a time.

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:52.150
And now I'm somewhere
in the middle.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.330
So I got exactly what
I needed out of that

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.710
and continue to do so
at Google in interacting

00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.280
with the wide range
of studios and really

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:07.910
getting to see why things
are the way they are today.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.495
How do we get to
the places of making

00:43:10.495 --> 00:43:12.870
this certain type of game or
this certain type of product

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:15.620
and this certain
type of platform.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:22.310
As far as why VR and AR, part
of it's because it's new.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:28.060
Yet again, the industry is
at this place where there's

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.000
this budding new medium,
and there is very few rules

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.650
and definition around it.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.770
So here is a time where we
get to play and figure out

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:38.855
those rules for ourselves.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.067
yeah?

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:44.650
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.020
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Hey.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.453
AUDIENCE: So with
each of these games,

00:43:49.453 --> 00:43:53.740
the thatgamecompany games,
you had a specific goal,

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.800
an experience you
wanted to evoke.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.910
But the secondary goal
of almost all games

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:03.910
is to make it just
a fun experience.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.980
And you definitely succeeded
on that front as well.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.200
So I was wondering
if there are times

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.710
when you have to make
compromises between the story

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:16.320
that you want to tell, the
feeling that you want to evoke,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.320
and things that
make the game fun?

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.860
Is there any tension there, or
do they just flow naturally?

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.440
KELLEE SANTIAGO: So for me,
I think another word for fun

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.630
is engaging.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:34.820
And I think, well,
with some exception,

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:37.010
there are games
intentionally not fun

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:39.390
or intentionally not engaging.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.720
But when we're
talking about ones

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.830
where your goal is
commercial success,

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.560
I think engaging
is core to that.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.130
You want you want
people to gravitate

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:54.900
towards it, to play it, to not
drop it, and to get to the end.

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.780
So to me, it doesn't feel like
compromising so much as, I

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:00.170
think, it's just
one of the goals

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:03.110
you have to hit as the project.

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:07.610
Probably the thing that feels
like the most compromise

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:11.370
is time and resources.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:15.710
So just having to
say, this doesn't

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:20.910
feel like the best solution
but we have to move on.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.860
Everyone in games,
there's the phrase,

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.220
you don't finish a
game, you abandon it.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.610
That's how it always
feels, no matter what.

00:45:36.187 --> 00:45:37.270
You want another question?

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.300
Yeah.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.164
Yeah.

00:45:40.164 --> 00:45:43.230
AUDIENCE: The microphone
just comes to the area.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.464
I was wondering if you
had any recommendations

00:45:46.464 --> 00:45:51.695
for really good storytelling
games that you'd like to share.

00:45:51.695 --> 00:45:52.695
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Oh man.

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.784
What's that?

00:45:56.784 --> 00:45:58.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.122
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah,
that would be good.

00:46:01.122 --> 00:46:04.260
Make a co-link-- Kellee's
favorite storytelling games.

00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:12.900
Probably two of the
ones in recent history

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:21.610
would be "Papers,
please" and oh my gosh.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:23.270
Another one.

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:27.180
"Papers, please,"
yeah, is one of them.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.942
Because it really
tells its story.

00:46:30.942 --> 00:46:33.400
It's one of those that tells
the story through every aspect

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.060
of the game, the
visuals, the music,

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:38.770
the narrative itself, and
then also the mechanics

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:43.680
all place you in this
situation by which you're

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.700
receiving the story
through all those elements.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.672
And it does it in a
really fantastic way.

00:46:54.731 --> 00:46:55.605
SAL YANEZ: Thank you.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.933
AUDIENCE: Do you
want another one?

00:46:59.933 --> 00:47:01.308
SAL YANEZ: You
can have one more.

00:47:08.822 --> 00:47:10.280
AUDIENCE: One of
my other questions

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:14.127
is, how do you deal
with the internet?

00:47:14.127 --> 00:47:15.585
The dark underbelly
of the internet

00:47:15.585 --> 00:47:19.060
can be really toxic, especially
to [INAUDIBLE] game designers.

00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:25.739
Have you dealt with a lot of
vitriol from the internet?

00:47:25.739 --> 00:47:26.905
And how do you deal with it?

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.240
KELLEE SANTIAGO: So I have not.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.090
I will say I'm not the most
outspoken social person

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.550
on social media.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.180
And I think about that a lot.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.860
Am I not outspoken because I
don't want to deal with that?

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:51.010
Is that a reason to not be
outspoken or vice versa?

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:55.660
Or is it that I'm also
burnt on all social media

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.730
platforms being designed to
sell you stuff right now?

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:04.310
And that is just really
toxic in and of itself.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:08.670
That's a whole other
fireside chat maybe.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.280
But yeah, I am being
tracked somewhere.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.560
It's for my activities
in the games industry,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.510
because there's a whole idea
around the social justice

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.160
warrior mafia.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.610
Which I love that that's
an insult of a name,

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:26.320
because I think "social justice
warrior" sounds amazing.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:29.050
I would love that.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.420
But yeah, I haven't
experienced it.

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.000
Certainly, many people
very close to me have it,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.200
and that's what I was
thinking about when

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:41.130
I was thinking about the
separation between games

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:44.060
and gaming culture.

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.720
Specifically, my
professor, Tracy Fullerton,

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:48.780
very recently went through this.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.240
And now she's just
not on Twitter

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.370
and she's not on Facebook.

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:57.130
She's just ghosted
herself from social media.

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.390
And I don't know.

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:08.600
That's a loss but she's
still doing her work.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:14.170
So yeah, I don't know how
we extract these things

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:14.950
from each other.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.377
SAL YANEZ: Yes.

00:49:20.377 --> 00:49:20.960
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.210
So I was curious.

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:28.500
Well, first I wanted to say
that when I was a little kid,

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.244
Sierra Online put
out "King's Quest."

00:49:30.244 --> 00:49:31.160
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.720
AUDIENCE: And "King's Quest,"
one of the two creators of that

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.900
was Roberta Williams.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:35.858
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Right.

00:49:35.858 --> 00:49:38.358
AUDIENCE: So it actually never
occurred to me until recently

00:49:38.358 --> 00:49:40.774
that women weren't actually a
part of the game development

00:49:40.774 --> 00:49:41.300
world.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.258
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Right.

00:49:42.258 --> 00:49:43.360
Yeah, right.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.780
AUDIENCE: Those were
also my favorite games.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:49.280
But what I wanted to ask
was, Sony gave you this time

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:50.780
in order to develop this game.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.140
How much freedom
did they give you

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:56.730
to just explore your own
thing versus reign you in

00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:00.760
and try to make a
commercially viable product?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.840
KELLEE SANTIAGO: So each game
that we did was more expensive.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.920
So on "Journey," it was really
interesting and educational

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.010
for me, because we
had hit a budget

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:13.030
point where suddenly
a lot more people were

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:17.430
focused on the game.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:20.950
Again, their position towards
third party in general

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:22.340
was pretty hands off.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.800
So I think we were
probably shielded

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.720
from quite a lot of it.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:34.520
But before that, we were
operating at a budget

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.392
which is a smart thing to do.

00:50:36.392 --> 00:50:37.850
When you're creating
content that's

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:40.950
sort of weird and
different, or at least

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:44.340
different from mainstream or
what's been done in the past,

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.250
keeping your budget
low is a good way

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:49.620
to just float under the radar.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.930
Because it won't require
that many approvals and not

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.370
that many people have to
look at it to get paid.

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:59.730
So yeah, it was very
educational in that way.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:04.600
But then getting to
"Journey," we got to see more,

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.230
because now we need to charge
a certain price for it.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.271
So it really needs
to have these things.

00:51:09.271 --> 00:51:11.020
Now, by that point,
it was our third game,

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:16.660
so our egos were pretty
high and that shielded us.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:21.110
For better or for worse, we
just didn't accept a lot.

00:51:26.302 --> 00:51:27.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, So
I really like when

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.160
you were talking about games
being potentially an easier

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.670
route into tech for people
from other backgrounds

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:37.130
and also that you came from
theater yourself originally.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:41.140
Do you feel like there's not
that many easy ways for people

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.640
from the arts to get
into tech, or it's

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.045
been actually developing to be
a bit more easily accessible,

00:51:47.045 --> 00:51:47.920
or that it should be?

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.185
Do you have any
thoughts about that?

00:51:50.185 --> 00:51:51.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:53.780
KELLEE SANTIAGO:
Yeah, so I'm not

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.600
exposed to every sector
of tech, so there

00:51:55.600 --> 00:52:00.490
may be ones where it's
much easier than others.

00:52:03.185 --> 00:52:06.240
But for games, I
think fundamentally,

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.970
for a lot of
technology companies,

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:13.000
it's important to demonstrate
work on technology.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.840
So games now, there are so
many tools, and web development

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:24.910
as well, to learn how to code.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:27.200
At the same time,
the specific coding

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:32.690
that you learn for games,
that way of approaching it,

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.670
I find just a really
useful practice

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:35.670
in learning programming.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:46.080
Understanding 3D space is the
best way to learn 3D math.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:50.020
Approaching it in games was very
different than approaching it

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.710
in just a textbook.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:56.850
So I think it's that practice
of doing and that you can do it,

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.540
and also the reward of playing a
game that you made with someone

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.740
else is a really great payoff.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.395
And so that creates
its own like, in a way,

00:53:04.395 --> 00:53:08.770
game loop and state
of flow through it.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:12.010
So fundamentally, you're
just practicing and getting

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:15.650
that portfolio built
out, or at least

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.677
a body of work you can reference
and take into an interview

00:53:19.677 --> 00:53:20.176
somewhere.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.690
Yeah, there was something
else I wanted to say about it,

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:26.860
but I totally forget.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.151
You were asking something else?

00:53:29.597 --> 00:53:31.180
AUDIENCE: Is it easy
enough for people

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.230
to find those opportunities?

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.396
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:33.396 --> 00:53:35.380
Oh yeah, so the other
part is, I think

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:37.560
this is shifting
now slowly, which

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.040
is really exciting to see.

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:43.970
Well, there are definitely
more sectors now applying

00:53:43.970 --> 00:53:47.490
game design to their
work, like in politics,

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:49.820
in health, in science.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:50.920
They're looking.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.200
Here at Google, there
have been more people

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.520
from the game industry
hired in the last year

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:56.680
than I think ever.

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.615
And we're seeing that at many
other technology companies.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.390
So at the same time, people
with strict art backgrounds,

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:11.240
I feel like there's still
this divide that I would like

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:18.290
to keep bending us towards
having more creative directors

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:23.380
and writers and people that
just have arts backgrounds.

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.450
That's very valuable and
contributes something

00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:28.210
to all of our work.

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:29.150
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:32.110
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah.

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:32.942
SAL YANEZ: Yes?

00:54:32.942 --> 00:54:33.765
AUDIENCE: Um.

00:54:33.765 --> 00:54:35.265
SAL YANEZ: Just
with the microphone,

00:54:35.265 --> 00:54:38.384
please, because
there's a livestream.

00:54:38.384 --> 00:54:39.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:43.030
So one of the many
pushbacks for Oculus

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.406
has been the lack of content.

00:54:47.114 --> 00:54:50.650
A year in at Google, what
are we doing to address it?

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:54.157
And how long do you think it
will be for good gaming content

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:56.407
to show up on Daydream or
just for the virtual reality

00:54:56.407 --> 00:54:57.190
platform in general?

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:59.773
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah, , I mean,
certainly Daydream Publishing

00:54:59.773 --> 00:55:05.794
is trying to speed things
along and creating tools.

00:55:05.794 --> 00:55:07.460
I mean, there's also
the googly approach

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.530
of creating easy to use
tools to make creating

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:17.210
awesome experiences easier.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:24.390
The other part is the lower
cost of the hardware itself.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:28.200
So it being based on
smartphones, hopefully

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.420
many people that subsidize
through their carriers,

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:36.690
the viewer and controller
itself is at a low price point.

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:41.700
And so that will allow more
people than other platforms

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.960
to just have access.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:47.740
Because every phone is a
development kit as well.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:50.975
And so that'll just empower
a greater community.

00:55:50.975 --> 00:55:52.600
To me, that's always
what it comes down

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.750
to is fundamentally that cost.

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.554
I mean, that's
what we talk about.

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.095
That was something
I learned at Ouya.

00:55:59.095 --> 00:56:01.510
And being more exposed to
the hardware side of things,

00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:04.310
it's really expensive
to import things

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.020
to most South
American countries.

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:13.900
So they don't even have
the hardware to work on.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.930
And then that's true within,
of course, certain populations

00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:19.260
in the United States as well.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.450
So the more we can do to
lower that barrier to entry,

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:28.124
the more we enable more types
of people to express themselves.

00:56:28.124 --> 00:56:30.540
AUDIENCE: You're saying the
lower cost of hardware itself,

00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.684
not the cost of development
for a completely

00:56:33.684 --> 00:56:34.830
different platform?

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:37.322
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Yeah,
I think that's a base.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.500
SAL YANEZ: So I want make
sure we do finish on time,

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.990
because people have meetings.

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:47.020
But I do want to
thank you very much,

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.930
Kellee, for sharing your story.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.440
I think your story is very
powerful, very inspiring,

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.290
especially for Hispanic
Heritage Month.

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:57.320
It's full of finding
your inspiration,

00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.710
a sense of belonging,
building communities, bringing

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:02.880
a passion that you have
into a new industry,

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.920
and even changing paradigms,
looking at video games as art.

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.545
So thank you very
much for sharing it.

00:57:07.545 --> 00:57:08.670
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Thank you.

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:09.820
SAL YANEZ: Please, give
a big round of applause.

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:10.944
KELLEE SANTIAGO: Thank you.

00:57:10.944 --> 00:57:13.033
Thanks for coming out.
