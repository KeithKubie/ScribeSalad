00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.800
 What is my advice to young men looking for a wife to marry and start a family with? 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
 Yes, okay. A clear question. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.780
 What you cannot ignore is the requirement of mutual attraction. 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.200
 This is important. And mysterious. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.380
 So for example, this is something crazy. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.800
 One of the things we know that attracts people to each other is a symmetrical face. 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.800
 You can give men a rating for the degree of symmetry of their face. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Then you give the most and the least symmetrical men a clean t-shirt to wear for a day. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.200
 Then let your women judge the smell of the shirt on attractiveness. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.800
 The women will find the smell of the symmetrical men more attractive. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.000
 And there are more factors that determine sexual attraction that are based on biological factors. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.700
 They are deeply embedded in our nature, such as scent. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:21.900
 Women also appear to be less attracted to the smell of men with a rhesus factor that can cause problems when having children. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 One reason women give for finding the smell of such men unattractive is that they smell too much like their brother. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.300
 Strange, mysterious things determine whether or not people are sexually and physically attracted to each other. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.500
 I think this is an important part of a marriage relationship. 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:48.500
 Almost as important is trust, man, there is no successful marriage without trust. 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.980
 You must be honest with each other. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:59.600
 One of the reasons Carl Jung believed that marriage should be an oath and a covenant was very wise. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:09.600
 You know, being honest with someone is not easy, because there are many things about us all that are terrible, weak, repulsive and shameful. 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.400
 And these things must come to the table and be discussed. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.900
 But you are not going to tell the truth about yourself to someone who can scream away when you reveal who you really are. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 So the marriage bond is something like: Ok, here's the deal. I chain myself to you and you to me. 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.800
 And then we tell each other the truth and neither of us can run away. 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.400
 And when we know everything, then we are going to torture each other with it or we will try to face that truth and try to become better people. 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:53.600
 Together. And thus we become more powerful and resilient and deeper and wiser as we go through life together. 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.900
 I think that's brilliant. Because if you leave a way open, man, then you will use it, that's for sure. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.400
 The oath is there - and this was Jung's vision of the spiritualization of the human couple band. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 By a Christian marriage, for example, that emphasized the, let's say, subjection of both participants to a higher power as embodied in the Logos. 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:37.800
 So the idea is that in a Christian marriage, for example, not the man or the woman is the boss, but the shared person who is seeking the truth in both of them. 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.900
 You can see this as their joint submission to the Logos. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.700
 And that's so true, man. 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.500
 The benchmark for your married life should be your promise to tell each other the truth. 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:58.400
 Because at a difficult moment in your life, if you have done something incredibly stupid that can cost you the head, if there is no one you can turn to ... 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:07.900
 If you have a partner that you can trust, you can say: Hey, I made a big mistake with money, I am awake, I feel so stupid and it can go completely wrong. 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 This person will help you come up with a solution. 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.900
 And he or she will know that when it is the other way around - and that will certainly happen - you will be there to talk to you, and that you will work it out together. 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.700
 This is important. 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.660
 There are a few things in our culture that are completely wrong, and one of them is the underestimation of marriage. That's a bad idea. 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.500
 Your marriage is one third of your life, maybe more. And children, also one third. 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.300
 The rest out there is also one third of the life, just about. 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.160
 To miss anything is a huge mistake. 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:55.200
 That being said, there are also people who have to miss one or more because they have a good reason for it. 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.900
 Perhaps they are incredibly creative artists who have to devote themselves entirely to their career. 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.500
 Or they excel in one way or another and can justify thereby sacrificing part of the life trinity for another part. 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.900
 But in general that is very dangerous, and you shouldn't do it. 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.900
 Children also have a bad time, while they can be great fun if they behave well. 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.500
 One of the chapters of my new book is called "Don't let your children do anything that you don't like them anymore." 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.100
 This is possible, especially if you discuss it well with your partner, with the person who helps you raise your children. 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.800
 And children are the best company, because they are very enthusiastic about everything. They love new things. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.900
 They love you, so they are happy when you get there. 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.700
 You just have to make sure that they are not too hot or too cold, and that they have eaten and are not too tired. 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.500
 And don't expect them to keep their attention for longer than they can. 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.000
 We took our children out to dinner when they were little, and they sat at the table without any problems when they were two and three years old and behaved well. 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.260
 But no longer than 45 minutes. 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:14.000
 You shouldn't ask too much. But I have noticed that small children become restless and unreasonable about five to ten minutes earlier than adults. 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.300
 Only they are too stupid to notice. Children notice it immediately. 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.660
 OK, back to the marriage. 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.500
 You are looking for someone who you find attractive, who you love and who you trust in damn well. 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.980
 And then you are honest with them. 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:36.600
 And so you may be able to beat yourself through life, and find someone with whom you can intertwine the rope of your being into a stronger rope of yours together. 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.700
 So that your story gets some continuity, and you can have children and then grandchildren. 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.860
 And then you have a life, man. 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.700
 It's such a privilege if you get that done, so that's it. 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.200
 My answer to the question: What is your advice to young men looking for a wife to marry and have children? OK then. 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.500
 And furthermore, marry someone you think she would be a good mother to, and who is so wise to know that she also wants children. 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:11.000
 Some women do not want children. Fine. And some women might not get them. That is also possible. 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:26.100
 But the rule of thumb is that a woman in her mid-20s who doesn't know - or doesn't want to admit - that she wants children, unless she has a burning reason for it, 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.800
 psychologically speaking, she has not listed them. 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.860
 She does not know what is important in life. 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.060
 That can of course also apply to you. That is probably also the case. 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.200
 But it's a good rule of thumb.
