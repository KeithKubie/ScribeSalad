00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.510
Write 5 and 1/4 as
an improper fraction.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.710
So just as a reminder,
an improper fraction

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.550
is one where the
numerator is greater

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.550
than or equal to
the denominator.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.160
So improper fraction means that
the numerator-- and actually,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.900
I should say the absolute
value of the numerator--

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.360
is greater than or equal
to the absolute value

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.690
of the denominator.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.960
I could have just shortened
it, but you get the idea.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.077
The numerator is greater
than or equal to--

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:30.660
or the absolute value
of the numerator

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600
is greater than or equal
to the absolute value

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.820
of the denominator.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.570
In this situation right
here, it's a mixed number.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.750
We have it as a combination
of 5, which is just

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.180
a whole number, and 1/4,
which is a proper fraction,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.550
because the numerator is
less than the denominator.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.030
The absolute value
of the numerator

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.430
is less than the absolute
value of the denominator.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.507
So to write it as an
improper fraction--

00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:53.840
and I'll show you kind of the
methodology for doing it--

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.190
and then we'll talk a
little bit about why

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830
that methodology works.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.590
So 5 and 1/4, the methodology
is pretty straightforward.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.050
You say, OK, 5,
the whole number 5,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.570
that is the same
thing as 20 over 4.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.250
And so 20 over 4 plus
1 over 4 is 21 over 4.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.900
Or another way to think about
it is, 5 times 4 is 20, plus 1

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.400
is 21.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.857
21 over 4.

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:21.940
So that's the methodology.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.970
Pretty straightforward.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.400
And I'm going to
draw it out so it

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.660
makes a little bit more sense.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.930
So once again, you
take the mixed number,

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.310
or you take the whole
part of the mixed number,

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.030
you multiply it times the
denominator, you get 20.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.304
And then you add that 20
to 1, you get 21 over 4.

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:37.720
And now it's an
improper fraction.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.178
The absolute value
of our numerator

00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:41.650
is greater than the absolute
value of our denominator.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.530
Now I do want to show
you why this works.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.240
So to see why this
works, let's think

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.290
about what 5 and 1/4 means.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.320
It means we have 5 wholes.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.730
So let's say that
this is a whole.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.100
So that's 1 whole.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.955
And let me copy and
paste it five times.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.050
So that's 2, that's 3,
that's 4, and then that is 5.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.950
So we have five wholes.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.290
So that's this stuff
that I've drawn in green.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.540
That's 5 holes right there.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.610
And then we have 1/4.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.320
So I'll do 1/4 of a whole.

00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:35.150
And just to be clear that
it's part of a whole,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.890
I could have drawn the
whole in a dotted line,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.730
to say that we don't have that
whole, we have only 1/4 of it.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.570
And that's that 1/4.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.570
So this is 5 and 1/4.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.370
So to write it as an
improper fraction,

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.360
you can really view this
5 as some fraction over 4.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.990
And to think of it that
way, divide each of these

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.910
into fourths.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.680
Or this is one way
to think about it.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.040
So this right over here is
4/4, this is another 4/4,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.710
this is another 4/4-- I should
have copied and pasted this--

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.490
this is another 4/4,
and this is another 4/4.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.452
So now how many
fourths do we have?

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:13.160
How many fourths?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.530
We have 4/4 here, 4/4 here, 4/4
here, 4/4 here, and 4/4 here.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.910
So just what we have in green.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.125
We have 20 fourths.

00:03:27.294 --> 00:03:29.210
That's what we have in
green, right over here.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.870
That is the same thing as 5.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.540
Each of these are 4/4, so you
could view this as 5 times

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.950
4/4, right?

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.800
4/4 is 1.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.720
5 times 4/4 is 20 over 4.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.840
That's what we have
right over here.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.550
And now we can add
it to that 1/4.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.200
And you will get 21.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.460
We have the same denominator.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.030
So we can just add
the numerators.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.319
21 over 4.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.610
So that's the conceptual
understanding of why it works.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.026
But when you see
any mixed number,

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:03.650
it's a pretty
straightforward process.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.646
Multiply the 5
times 4, you get 20.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:09.892
20 plus 1 is equal to 21 over 4.

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:11.600
And actually, let me
just write that out.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.410
Just so you get clear
on what I'm doing.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.980
So 5 and 1/4, that
is the same thing--

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.220
that's equal to 5
times 4 plus 1, over 4.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.320
And this is why.
