[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.095 --> 00:00:07.220
SCOTT BERGMAN: Thank you
guys for coming out today.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.261
My name is Scott Bergman.

00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:11.050
I'm part of the Talks at Google
program here in Ann Arbor.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.960
And I have the distinct
privilege of welcoming Drs.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.922
Jeff and Staney DeGraff.

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:17.630
To tell you guys a
little bit about them,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.390
I'll give you a
little background.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.074
At 25, Dr. Jeff DeGraff
became the Senior Executive

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.240
at Domino's, which became
one of the fastest-growing

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.950
companies in America.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.780
And not only that,
he became a professor

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.270
at the Ross School of
Business here in Ann Arbor

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.310
and has become a C-Suite
advisor to over half

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.320
of the Fortune 500.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.420
Not only that, Jeff's
ideas and innovation

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.490
have been covered
by the NPR and PBS,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.550
where he has been a featured
columnist for "Inc.," "Wired,"

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.010
"Fortune," and "Psychology
Today," just to name a few.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.800
And we have Staney
DeGraff here today,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.830
who is the CEO of Innovatrium,
a consulting and training

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.520
practice here.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.460
And they also have offices
in Atlanta and in Ann Arbor.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.560
And she's also an innovation
community builder,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.311
where she runs innovation
tournaments here in Detroit,

00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:01.810
and is also the creator of the
Collaborative Open Innovation

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.370
Network used by the
University of Michigan.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.470
All right, guys.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.750
Well, come on up.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.750
We're happy to have you.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.600
JEFF DEGRAFF: Thank you.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.100
SCOTT BERGMAN: Thank you
guys for joining us today.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.660
JEFF DEGRAFF: Thanks, Google.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.600
Thanks for having us.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.010
Thanks, Scott.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.730
SCOTT BERGMAN: Pleasure.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.396
JEFF DEGRAFF: So what
I want to do today

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:16.690
is I want to challenge
a lot of probably

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.940
your most sacred notions
about innovation.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.790
I'm going to tell you a
little bit about my work

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.180
and what we know about how
innovation actually produces

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.059
value and destroys value.

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:29.350
To do that, it's going to be
like an old Western movie,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.900
where we're going to
start with the long shot

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.310
of the City of Dodge.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.830
And then we're going to move
into the tumbleweed street.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.530
Then finally, we're going to
look at the sheriff, right?

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.750
We're going to talk about you.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.290
So I want to start with
a little back story here.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.790
Both Staney and I
are technologists.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.081
We're trained as technologists.

00:01:47.081 --> 00:01:48.940
That's what our
advanced degrees are in.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.400
But interestingly
enough, whenever

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.562
I'm anywhere in an airport,
and I travel a lot,

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:55.270
somebody always wants
to stop and tell me

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.550
about new technology.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.380
Hey, have you heard
about the latest thing?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.340
And I'm sure you guys
get this all the time.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.580
And it's-- some of it's
apocryphal, that we're being--

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.830
our technology's
coming from aliens.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.509
And some of it's stuff
that you've already seen

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.979
and you already know.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.939
But you all know that
technology happens.

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:14.230
And the cycle of technology,
the magnitude and momentum

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.806
of technology, always
increases over time.

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:18.430
And there's a bunch
of laws about this.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.760
I won't bore you with that.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.790
But around the late '80s,
I got a call from an editor

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.990
at "Life" magazine.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.210
And she wanted to talk
to me about innovation.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.807
So I thought she
wanted to talk to me.

00:02:30.807 --> 00:02:32.890
And she said, no, I want
you to give a commentary.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.740
We're writing a piece on the
100 most important people

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.420
of the 20th century.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.280
And one of them
is related to you.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.150
Now, this was a huge surprise.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.810
I don't know any-- most
people related to me--

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.820
not doing so well, right?

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.730
So there-- she
talked about this man

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.750
named Charles Fair de Graff.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.750
And she sort of--

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.920
I was embarrassed.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.400
I didn't know who
this person was.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.690
Nobody told me about him.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.480
So when she got off the
phone, I looked him up.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.700
And he was the guy who
created Pocket Books.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.310
He create paperback
books in the 1930s.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.100
And his whole idea
with this technology

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.290
was that people would
become literate.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.410
If books were cheap, 2 bits,
people would become literate,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.436
but they didn't.

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:13.810
And the reason it
stuck with me--

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.810
I was doing a project with
Alan Kay and Steve Jobs

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.180
in the state of California
to try and develop

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.410
literacy for people
who were under-served.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.120
And we had the
exact same result.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.330
We didn't get any results
from introducing technology

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.770
into the situation.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.130
And so very early on, that
began to galvanize my thoughts

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.640
about culture and the role of
culture and technology and how,

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.730
in some ways, culture overtakes
or co-opts technology.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.310
So what I want to
talk about today

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.590
is that innovation isn't
really an invention.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.030
It's not just a gadget.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.070
It's not next-- the cool thing.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.730
It actually has a lot to do
with identifying patterns,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.040
how those patterns go
together, identifying

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.630
how culture and competency
interact with those patterns.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.489
And I want to give
some examples of that.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.030
But I want to start with this
whole notion of dominant logic.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.070
And it's a really
big thing for Google.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.890
And you're getting a lot of
sort of press, negative press,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.030
about this.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.760
And that is one of the things
that goes on in our world--

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.520
we sometimes call this in
business microsegmentation.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.920
The notion is we have
a tendency to identify

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.019
and value people who
are like us, right?

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.224
That's kind of one of
the big challenges.

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:20.890
And when social media
started, I started

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.720
writing articles that got a
lot of negative attention,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.710
saying that I wasn't sure
that social media was really

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.540
creating this kind of inclusive
society, that, in some ways,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.970
it was microsegmenting us.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.592
The people who are
your friends, even

00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:35.050
though they may look different
and they may seem different,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.930
they actually believe all the
same nonsense you believe.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.570
And if they don't believe
it, what do you do?

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.970
On a dark night, on a dark
road, you unfriend them.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.710
The Spanish Inquisition
couldn't have thought of this.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.057
So the notion is we get
these very vertical segments.

00:04:48.057 --> 00:04:50.140
So if you've ever talked
to anybody about religion

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.360
or politics, you know what
I mean by the whole notion

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.229
of dominant logic.

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.270
And it comes back to what
that crazy philosopher,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.700
Schopenhauer, said
over a century ago.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.100
"Every man," every
person, "takes the limits

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.644
of his own field of vision
for the limits of the world."

00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:04.060
And that's kind
of where we're at.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.934
Now, I'm going to make
the argument that this

00:05:05.934 --> 00:05:07.940
is the problem of
modernity, and there's

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.930
a way to solve this,
to get over this.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.710
So the key is how do we get
beyond this dominant logic?

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.885
How do we develop a mindset
to actually be more inclusive?

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:18.260
And I'm going to talk about
inclusiveness in a way that's

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.635
very different than you've
probably heard it because it's

00:05:20.635 --> 00:05:21.850
not just politically correct.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.100
It's not just morally correct.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.380
It's essential for innovation.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.588
I'm going to prove it to you.

00:05:25.588 --> 00:05:27.950
Now, it turns out that
every organization

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.030
has to do two things.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.380
And boy, Google, this is
really relevant to you.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.010
The first thing an organization
has to do is maintain itself.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.910
It has to produce
predictable outcomes.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.460
This is why capitalism
requires capitalists.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.250
Whether you're a private equity,
whether you're publicly traded,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.660
somebody has to show
that you're going

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.951
to do things on a normal basis.

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:49.160
And the way that that happens
is we get rid of variance.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.600
We create standards.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.520
We call this operating
rhythm, right?

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.640
Now, the notion is that
makes us all predictable.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.820
But the problem is, just
like people, we want to grow.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.570
So to grow, instead of
eliminating deviance,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.390
what we need to do
is introduce it.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.134
So innovation, by definition,
is a form of deviance.

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:09.800
And so we're going
to have this tension.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.920
And it's not a tension of type.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.240
It's not, I'm an ENTP.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.650
You're an INFJ.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.060
It's not that.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.010
It's one form of value actually,
literally, assaults the other.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.750
One form of value
destroys the other.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.970
I want you to think about
high-growth economies

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.340
versus high-quality or
productive economies.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.280
They're oppositional.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.200
And there's a reason.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.790
One is creating standards.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.260
And one is creating deviance.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.093
Now, I'm going to say
something that's going

00:06:35.093 --> 00:06:36.530
to seem very radical to you.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.010
This tension, when
used properly,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.970
is actually not only good, it's
the basis of the growth engine.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.370
So let me give some
examples of culture

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.829
and how culture
co-opts technology.

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:50.870
Interestingly enough,
everyone talks about Tesla.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.036
And it's a great technology.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.270
And I love Tesla.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.440
But here's the problem.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.170
Tesla last year
sold 55,000 cars.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.340
And they lost $600 million.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.990
Now, they're not going to lose
$600 million going forward.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.290
And they're going to sell
maybe twice as many cars.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.140
But the notion is we've had some
soft quarters in the automobile

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.370
industry, haven't we?

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.850
Tesla hasn't destroyed the
automobile industry, right?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.219
What's affecting the
automobile industry is Uber.

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:15.260
Now, I want you to think
about Uber for a minute.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.551
Where's the innovation in Uber?

00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:17.270
Ride sharing.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.290
I'm an old guy.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.112
We had ride sharing
when I was a kid.

00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:21.320
You called the parish priest.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.194
You called the coach.

00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:23.270
You got a ride.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.040
Look at the app that they use.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.370
Doesn't it look like 2007,
over-the-road, trucking app?

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.227
It's not a particularly
well-run company.

00:07:30.227 --> 00:07:32.060
There's all kinds of
legal problems with it.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.400
Where's the innovation in Uber?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.820
Young people like you will get
in the car with a stranger,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.320
right?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.120
It's a social innovation.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.110
I won't.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.760
It's like Airbnb.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.310
All of the sudden, the car is
not just something you drive.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.768
It's something you
take someone in.

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:49.940
Airbnb-- if someone
came to my house--

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.710
I have a nice house on the
Huron River-- and use my towel,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.710
I take it in the backyard,
burn it, and bury it.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.540
I'd sic the dogs on them, right?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.060
The notion is this
social form of innovation

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.440
has co-opted this.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.330
Same is true for Goldman Sachs.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.580
Anybody remember about four
years ago-- not even four,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.680
three years ago-- the number one
selling book on "The New York

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.034
Times" nonfiction book was--

00:08:08.034 --> 00:08:09.950
nonfiction list was a
book called "Flash Boys"

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.820
by Michael Lewis.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.140
It was about Spread Networks.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.450
The notion was Goldman
Sachs and Credit Suisse

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.300
were trading a little faster
than you were-- could trade.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.250
So they got the
uplift on a stock.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.120
And they got to sell,
get rid of the stock.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.360
They got to short the stock
as it started to go down.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.300
Now, think of it this way.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.800
They're the bookie-- doesn't
matter whether Michigan or Ohio

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.320
State wins.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.570
The bookie always makes money.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:29.900
That's what this deal was.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.400
And everyone said,
the fix is in.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.890
The 1% is going to get
richer and richer, until what

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.640
started happening?

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.340
Until cryptocurrency
started to come in.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.330
And that's what
you young people--

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.250
now, where did
cryptocurrency start?

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.990
And don't say the '98 paper.

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:43.720
That's not where it started.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.430
Where it really started
was in money laundering.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.110
It started with drug cartels.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.630
Where did streaming
really start?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.130
I mean, in earnest, where did
that new technology come from?

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.180
The porn industry, right?

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.290
Where did emojis start?

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.790
It started in terrorist cells.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.430
So one of the things I want
to point out right off the bat

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.300
is that technologies are often
used or first adapted by groups

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.984
that they're not intended for.

00:09:03.984 --> 00:09:05.900
Anybody see the problem
happen in Amazon right

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.970
before Christmas, their
little recommendation

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.200
engine, the little
problem that showed up

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.220
in "The New York Times"?

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.344
If you like fertilizer,
you might like black powder

00:09:12.344 --> 00:09:13.610
and ball bearings, right?

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.610
The notion is
technology is powerful.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.920
When we start looking at
people who are making these

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.670
smartphones, going
back a decade--

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.460
it's only been a decade--

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.170
in their wildest
dreams, they never

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.760
imagined that you
would use the camera

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.132
to take pictures of yourself.

00:09:27.132 --> 00:09:29.090
They thought you'd be at
Yellowstone and taking

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.560
the vistas and things like that.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.810
So culture has this
mitigating factor

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.290
where what you want technology
to do is completely different.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.020
And think about the 13
indictments two weeks ago

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.010
that Mueller has made.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.612
So the notion is this culture
piece is not only confounding,

00:09:43.612 --> 00:09:45.320
it actually does
something more powerful.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.403
And the biggest industry
to look at for this right

00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:48.410
now is pharmaceuticals.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.540
The pharmaceutical
industry is reeling.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.590
Why is it reeling?

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.990
Because all of these big
pharmaceutical companies

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.330
are all of the sudden
having to compete

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.490
with young people like
yourself who've got together

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.170
in a federation deal.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.005
And they have names like
BIOS Forum and Firestorm

00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:04.880
and things like that.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.550
And what they're doing is
they're developing medications

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.100
and therapies and drugs.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.860
And they're open source
patenting them, right?

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.810
So the notion is--
here's the question.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.070
I was at Duke the other day.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.540
And I was talking to the
head of their law school.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.370
And I said, where are all
your lawyers going these days?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.500
Because it's tough to get
a job if you're a lawyer.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.670
And they said, pharmaceuticals.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.780
Well, the answer is simple.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.070
What are they doing
in pharmaceuticals?

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.960
They're trying to protect
their intellectual property.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.440
Here becomes the
question for you.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.260
Who's going to win
this bar fight?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.000
Is it going to be the
millions of people

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
who are trying to do things
for free in this open source,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.770
or is it going to
be a handful of sort

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.690
of these very monopolistic
kind of companies

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.680
that are trying to protect
the intellectual property?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.554
That's why we're seeing
these companies start

00:10:42.554 --> 00:10:45.420
in places that don't have strong
intellectual property laws--

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.870
Tanzania, places like that,
parts of the Philippines,

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.920
Cebu, other kinds of places.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.010
So I want to take a step back.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.209
So there's this big trend, this
trend towards technology coming

00:10:55.209 --> 00:10:57.500
out of places and people
doing different things with it

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.230
because of culture, and
then this other big trend

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.050
of the challenge between
organizations trying to control

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.800
things-- we're going to
call this longitude--

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.360
and organizations networking.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.640
We're going to call
this latitude, longitude

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.440
and latitude of organizations.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.450
Well, how does
innovation actually

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.990
relate to all this is--

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.960
has to start with
what's our definition.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.330
About 1993, I got to
write the definition

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.310
for the federal
government for innovation.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.090
And all I did was co-opt
a very famous definition

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.090
from innovation from the
1960s from Marshall McLuhan.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.520
McLuhan said innovation
has four attributes.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.020
He said, first of all, an
innovation enhances something.

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.480
Well, here we are at Google.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.160
Were you the first
search engine?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.740
No.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.840
Did you have the same sort of
format as other search engines?

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.340
No.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.580
You had a little box.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.220
And what Google
made better was not

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.200
so much it was a faster
search or a better

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.840
search at the beginning,
it was an easier search.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.910
It was a simpler search, right?

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.047
So you made it better
by simplifying it.

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.630
Now, the second thing
is an innovation

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:58.910
has to eliminate something.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.070
What does the innovation kill?

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.619
Now, that's a tough one, right?

00:12:02.619 --> 00:12:04.910
I want you to think about
what did Charles Schwab kill.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.860
Does anybody remember
brokerage houses,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.810
the big brokerage
houses in-- on Fifth Ave

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.220
and down on Wall Street?

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.810
They're all gone now.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.000
EF Hutton, the quiet
company is really quiet.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.750
Why?

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.910
Because we disintermediated
the broker.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.070
Basically, we let
trading happen directly.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.444
Of course, this is an industry
you have a lot of interest

00:12:21.444 --> 00:12:23.420
in, a lot of stakes
in the ground here.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.610
It has to return
us to something.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.300
Here's an interesting one.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.100
It has to make us
feel like we're--

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.220
do we need to do something here?

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:33.720
We're OK?

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.780
All right.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.540
It has to make us feel like
we're returning to something.

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.290
So think about it.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.331
What are the big trends
in restaurants right now?

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:45.100
Is it faster food, or is
it slow food, whole food,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.840
farm to table, right?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.660
And the ultimate, the ultimate
returning us to something

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.330
we feel we lost, was
developed about two blocks

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.670
that direction,
which was Viagra--

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.180
we're 25 again.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.020
And finally, the most
important thing McLuhan said,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.220
and I've got your
little logo up here--

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.920
the most important
thing McLuhan said--

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.470
he said, over time,
an innovation reverses

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.780
into its opposite,
the anti-innovation.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.450
Does anybody remember when
email was going to set you free?

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.370
Anybody remember that?

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:12.670
Yeah.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.270
And now what?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.534
We're all slaves, right?

00:13:14.534 --> 00:13:15.700
We can't put our phone down.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.064
We're all slaves to email
and SMS and everything else.

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.980
Now, I'm going to add a
few things to McLuhan.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:25.210
Number one, innovation is
a form of useful novelty.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.220
All that means is it
can happen anywhere.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.720
Innovation can happen anywhere.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.886
So I want you to think about
Starbucks for a minute.

00:13:30.886 --> 00:13:31.870
It's a commodity.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.580
The Egyptians had it.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.075
It's something that's been
around for 3,000 years.

00:13:36.075 --> 00:13:37.575
Where's the innovation
in Starbucks?

00:13:37.575 --> 00:13:38.800
Well, it's theater, right?

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.290
It's the whole experience
of going to Starbucks.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.748
And they have names
for everything.

00:13:41.748 --> 00:13:43.300
Innovation pays in the future.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.340
It's what's called a
convex form of value.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.340
How much data do we have
on the future, anyone?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.442
How much data?

00:13:49.442 --> 00:13:51.400
So I'm coming home from
Shanghai the other day.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.780
And this guy sitting next
to me says, the dollar--

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.490
is it going up or down?

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.682
I said, it's going down.

00:13:56.682 --> 00:13:57.890
He said, why do you say that?

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.110
And I said, because it's up.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.359
And that's what currencies do.

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:01.370
They go up and down.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.080
Duh.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.250
And he said what?

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.840
He said, when?

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.160
I said, I don't know when.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.960
If I knew when, I'd
be George Soros.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.330
I'd be speculating the dollar.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.680
And I sure wouldn't be telling
a pathetic loser like you

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.030
about the dollar.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.650
So the point is the biggest
form of resistance to innovation

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.770
is excessive planning or getting
stuck in the planning cycle.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:22.970
Have you been to the
meeting about the meeting?

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.210
Have you seen the
report about the report?

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.010
Yeah.

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.010
You're the big guys now.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.710
You used to be the
small guys, right?

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.460
So someone else is running
experiment right now

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.460
where you're doing that.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.590
And finally, innovations
have a shelf life.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:34.640
They go sour like milk.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.040
So the other day,
I'm in Chicago.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.290
I'm giving the keynote speech
for the American Medical

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:38.890
Association.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.348
I'm feeling pretty
good about this.

00:14:40.348 --> 00:14:41.800
It's a big meeting.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.375
But I notice on Michigan Avenue,
the line goes all the way

00:14:44.375 --> 00:14:45.250
down Michigan Avenue.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.000
And I'm thinking, holy mackerel.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.550
There's a lot of
people here hearing

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.350
my silly talk about innovation.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:53.420
And then it occurs to me,
what's being released?

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.720
The new Apple iPhone
is being released.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.180
And they're basically in
line to get the new iPhone.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.820
And of course, what happens
to the old iPhone the minute

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.800
the new iPhone is introduced?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.270
It's rubbish, right?

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.190
It's discounted, falls
off the commodity cycle.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.620
So the big challenge
of innovation

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.995
is it's only an innovation
for a moment in time.

00:15:10.995 --> 00:15:12.370
So this is what
an innovation is,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.530
which means it can happen
in the supply chain,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.000
can happen in marketing, can
happen in the product itself.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.617
It's a lot more than the gadget.

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:20.200
So there's other
mythologies, I think,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.400
that people have
about innovation

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.510
I wanted to dispel you of.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:24.310
First of all,
innovative organizations

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.000
have very little in common.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.660
When we start looking at
the indexes for innovations,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.780
and there's about
seven that started--

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.339
there's about 13
legitimate ones now.

00:15:33.339 --> 00:15:34.630
There's hundreds of other ones.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.590
But let's say out of 13
ones, there's about 15%

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.340
of the companies that
they have in common,

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.715
which tells you
right off the bat

00:15:40.715 --> 00:15:42.710
that they're not talking
about the same thing.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.430
Two, money is almost never
a barrier to innovation.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.638
I don't know if you know
this-- one of the big issues

00:15:47.638 --> 00:15:50.069
is money often creates
a constraint when you

00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:51.610
have less money that
you have to have

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:52.540
an interesting work-around.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.998
And we could talk about how
the economy is flush with money

00:15:54.998 --> 00:15:58.330
right now because the tax
cut and all the repatriation

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.350
of the money is going
to put about a trillion,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.412
maybe $2 trillion
back in this economy.

00:16:02.412 --> 00:16:04.870
So the notion is, is this really
going to go to innovation?

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.490
Is it going to go
to stock buyback?

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.259
Is it going to go
to private equity?

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.550
Where is the money going to go?

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.550
Competitors often
compete in opposite ways.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.130
So this is one that
relates to you.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.838
Google, you have how
many companies now--

00:16:14.838 --> 00:16:16.510
58, 59 companies, right?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.660
You make everything.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.840
You're open source, man, right?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.000
Apple-- what, Apple makes what?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.710
They make nothing, right?

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.620
Foxconn and InvoTech and
a consortium of companies

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.070
make Apple's product.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.247
They make design.

00:16:29.247 --> 00:16:30.580
And they make brilliant designs.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.190
You have to give that to Apple.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:34.731
And the other thing they make
is they make a closed operating

00:16:34.731 --> 00:16:35.470
system, right?

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.810
In their ecosystem, it's not
just different than yours.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.700
It's almost oppositional, right?

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.720
One's playing offense.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.310
One's playing defense.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.824
So the whole idea that people,
even in the same kind of--

00:16:44.824 --> 00:16:47.240
in a Venn diagram-- you're not
in the exact same industry,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.880
but in related industries--
compete the same way they

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.420
don't.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.128
Incumbents are almost
never first movers.

00:16:51.128 --> 00:16:53.380
This is what you have to
worry about, Google, right?

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.520
Think about it as a bar fight.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.530
Anybody from a blue-collar
neighborhood, like I am?

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.730
Anybody from a
blue-collar-- yeah,

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.770
you're from the same
neighborhood I am, right?

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.217
The notion is who
throws the-- is

00:17:01.217 --> 00:17:02.800
it the big guy with
a Budweiser jacket

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.079
or is it the little
guy with crazy eyes?

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.790
It's the little guy.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.160
We call this in business
first-mover advantage.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.230
And this is why startups
throw the first punch,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.609
because they can't
compete on scope or scale.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.970
So when I start looking at
what's happened with Google,

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.346
I think your cap value this
morning is like $680 billion.

00:17:18.346 --> 00:17:20.720
I think you're that second or
third most valuable company

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.339
in the world.

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.569
You're no longer a startup.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.192
And the real challenge
here is what?

00:17:24.192 --> 00:17:25.900
Getting you to act
like you're a startup.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.180
I look at your new building,
your beautiful building.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.380
I see all the trappings.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.030
Remember, I built
Domino's, I helped

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.750
build Domino's in
the 1980s, which

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.390
was the fastest-growing company
in the world in the 1980s.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:37.220
The interesting thing
is at some point,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.511
you're going to have that
real challenge of maintenance

00:17:39.511 --> 00:17:40.310
versus growth.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.080
It turns out that
breakthrough happens

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.130
at the edges of the bell curve.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.880
We'll talk about that
later because that's

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:45.870
a very important point.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.120
And this is a point that
Staney's going to talk about,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.070
which is when we started looking
at innovation indexes in 1993,

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:54.770
less than 1% of them
on a regular basis

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.960
beat the growth
benchmark on Wall Street.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.700
So the notion is most
of what you believe

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.414
about innovation is untrue.

00:18:00.414 --> 00:18:02.330
And we're going to talk
about why it's untrue.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.996
There's only one thing
that we're pretty

00:18:03.996 --> 00:18:05.300
sure we know about innovation.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.883
And this is going to be the key
to the whole discussion today,

00:18:07.883 --> 00:18:10.700
and that is diversity happens
in the 30 to 50 places

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.200
on the planet that
produce almost

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.450
all the intellectual property.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.741
And when we look at these
places, whether it's Tel Aviv

00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:17.270
or whether it's a
part of Shanghai,

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.800
whether it's Ann Arbor, Michigan
or whether it's Palo Alto

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.269
or Cary, North Carolina,
wherever you're at,

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:23.810
one of the things
you're going to see

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.090
is it looks very
different than any place

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.155
if you drove 40 miles outside
of the city boundaries, right?

00:18:29.155 --> 00:18:31.780
And one of the things we see is
that people are very different.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:33.780
I'm going to talk about
why that's so important.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.960
Now, remember the whole
idea that I started with,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.418
talking about the magnitude of
innovation and the momentum,

00:18:38.418 --> 00:18:39.710
or the speed and magnitude.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:42.376
The two things you have to think
about is how much and how fast.

00:18:42.376 --> 00:18:44.820
That's the question you
always must ask yourself-- how

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.070
much innovation, and how fast?

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.777
Is a meteor careening
towards the earth?

00:18:47.777 --> 00:18:48.860
It's going to kill us all.

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.120
We better do something now.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.514
Or is it that the
ice caps are melting,

00:18:52.514 --> 00:18:54.680
and we probably should do
something in the next four

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.290
or five years in order to get
our-- a handle on this, right?

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.970
Maybe it's even a little
more urgent than that.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:59.600
Who knows?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.670
But the first thing
that companies do

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:02.940
is they build a process.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.190
Now, here's a question to you.

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.520
Does process create deviance
or eliminate deviance?

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.820
What does process do?

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.140
It eliminates deviance.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.800
Yeah.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.620
So the first thing we do to
make innovation happen is what?

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.949
We build something to
eliminate innovation.

00:19:16.949 --> 00:19:18.740
And this is what we do
in business schools.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:19.652
This is stage-gating.

00:19:19.652 --> 00:19:20.860
This is portfolio management.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:22.120
These are hurdle rates.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.160
So the notion is we're
trying to gain control

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.400
because what we really want
from innovation is what?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.830
We want predictable revenue.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:31.280
We want predictable things.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.072
So by definition, when
you build a process,

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:35.571
you're going to be incremental
because that's what processes

00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:36.363
are designed to do.

00:19:36.363 --> 00:19:38.029
That's what that tool
is designed to do.

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:40.090
Now, what if we really
wanted to do something

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.160
with much higher
magnitude for innovation?

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.020
Wouldn't we have to
change the gene pool?

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.840
It's like a great sports
team or an orchestra

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.310
or a band or a great chef.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:50.710
Wouldn't we have to go
out and get people, right?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.370
How long does it take to develop
a tremendous innovator here

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:55.600
at Google?

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.900
A long time-- or a professor
at Michigan or Stanford

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.010
or Harvard, whoever you--

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.718
wherever you came
from, wherever you are.

00:20:01.718 --> 00:20:03.910
So the notion is this
type of innovation's

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.680
much higher but harder to do.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.420
That's why Google
spends a lot of money

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.790
on you, developing you, because
that's really important.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.165
We do the same
thing at Michigan.

00:20:11.165 --> 00:20:13.060
Now, finally, if I
really, really want

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.160
to change culture,
what I-- if I really

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.130
want to change the culture
to make innovation happen,

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.552
is that going to
happen overnight?

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.260
It takes forever.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.080
Now, I'm going to say something
that's really controversial.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.540
There's only two ways
to change culture,

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:28.940
because culture isn't
a thing you can touch.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.580
Culture is in the ether.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.790
Culture is the way you talk.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.130
It's their mindset.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.900
It's the way you interact.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.302
It's not a thing.

00:20:37.302 --> 00:20:38.760
Culture is contained
in two things.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.240
Number one, it's contained
in leadership, how you lead.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.601
What do we do if you're
acquiring an underperforming

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:44.100
firm?

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.670
What is the first step when
you acquire an underperforming

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.169
firm?

00:20:47.169 --> 00:20:48.390
You got it there, right?

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.600
Knuckle bump.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.560
You get rid of the senior suite.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.180
The Chinese have a
wonderful saying.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.587
The fish stinks from the head.

00:20:54.587 --> 00:20:56.420
They have a wonderful
saying for everything.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.886
But that's what that means.

00:20:57.886 --> 00:20:59.510
That means you got
to get rid of people

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:01.650
because culture is
contained in leadership.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.950
And if you got great leaders,
you get golden handcuffs.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.030
Oh, they're going to stay
for two or three years.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.470
The second thing that changes
culture is how you work.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.160
Now, I worked on a project that
most you know as Ecomagination.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.510
It's the first $30 billion
spend on the green technology

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.800
that General Electric did.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.760
Well, one of the
things that people

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.440
get wrong about
that is it was not

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:24.279
just to change the game about
power, which it was, partially.

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:25.820
But it was also to
try and figure out

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.160
how to get 28 divisions of
one of the world's largest

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.170
companies to work in sync.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.260
So you either change
how people lead,

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.150
or you change how they work.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.980
That's how culture gets changed.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.750
But it takes a long time.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.177
So the issue is-- we all
know what's required.

00:21:42.177 --> 00:21:43.760
But are we willing
to put the time in?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.900
So what's the answer?

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.370
Well, one of my favorite answers
comes from an old philosophy

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.710
called the Dao.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.350
And you're going to see
that a lot of my work

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.180
and Staney's work really relates
from this old Chinese idea

00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.680
that's--

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.900
about 200 years before
Plato is around,

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.370
people start writing about this.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:05.078
And at the heart of
the Dao is the notion

00:22:05.078 --> 00:22:08.140
of the yin and yang, the notion
that there are conflicting

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.340
forces in the universe.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.470
And these conflicting
forces produce hybrids.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.411
They create new ways
of doing things.

00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:15.910
Well, from this, the Chinese
have done something remarkable.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.200
I've spent a lot of time
in China over the years.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.989
The Chinese developed a way of
thinking called the "I Ching."

00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:24.280
And it's called-- sometimes
called the "Book of Ching."

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.310
Just people use it for
predicting the future.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.890
But it's really used so that
people can think through all

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.270
the options that they've got.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.090
This is sometimes called
heuristics or cognitive

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.824
algorithms.

00:22:34.824 --> 00:22:36.990
Finally, out of this, there's
a lot of how-to books.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.340
And the most famous one is a
book called "The Art of War,"

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.060
written by Sun Tzu.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.280
Whether that's a real person
or not's a real controversy,

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.779
right?

00:22:42.779 --> 00:22:44.710
And then finally, the
family household--

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.840
how to use this day
in and day out-- well,

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.790
feng shui, the whole
notion of a luopan,

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.206
the whole notion of having a
compass to put this together.

00:22:51.206 --> 00:22:53.980
What it means is you don't
have to have inputs and outputs

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.460
and process because you're
thinking the way I'm thinking.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.080
And you're looking
at all the options.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.514
So I don't have to supervise
you and tell you what to do.

00:23:02.514 --> 00:23:04.180
Well, this is the
heart of our thinking.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.596
And this is the
heart of our book.

00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:08.480
We had this sort of
revelation in the early 1990s,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.596
and that was the most
innovative companies,

00:23:10.596 --> 00:23:12.220
when we start looking
at predictability

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.219
of what was going to make
an innovative company,

00:23:14.219 --> 00:23:17.090
were companies that had
constructive conflict.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:18.622
Now, this is
important because when

00:23:18.622 --> 00:23:20.080
I talk about
constructive conflict,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.490
I'm not talking about talking
disrespectfully to people.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:24.460
That's not what I mean.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.440
I don't mean
marginalizing people.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.850
I mean we have fine regard,
filial piety, collegial piety

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:31.510
for each other.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.176
Hopefully, we have--
we like each other,

00:23:33.176 --> 00:23:34.550
maybe love each other.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.060
But it means when it
comes to ideas, we engage.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.570
Now, engagement usually
means-- we talk about

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.160
engagement-- oh, you really
like being here at work.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.690
No.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.190
When we start looking
at innovation,

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:46.460
it means you have an idea.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.380
And I have an idea.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.757
And they're different ideas.

00:23:48.757 --> 00:23:51.340
Instead of being on social media
and us sniping at each other,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.040
us trolling each other,
I'm going to engage you.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.060
I'm going to get nose
to nose to you and say,

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.374
I think it should be like this.

00:23:57.374 --> 00:23:59.790
And you're going to say, I
think it needs to be like this.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.200
Now, this is a caution
to millennials.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.100
This is not an opportunity
for compromise.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.360
This is trying to push this to
the new place, the next idea,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.670
the third way, a new way.

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.490
This becomes the generative
power of innovation,

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.780
where you do it all.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.380
Think about it for a minute.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.610
Think about the
health care debate.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.920
I got to give my TED Talk
when President Obama rolled

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.170
out the Affordable Health
Care Act at the White House.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:23.729
It was great.

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.270
The problem is you
got one group that

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.240
says this should all be public.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.323
And the other group says
it should all be private.

00:24:28.323 --> 00:24:30.130
Are those really our options?

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.770
Aren't the options
everything in between and how

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.409
do we take that forward, right?

00:24:34.409 --> 00:24:35.950
We spent a trillion
dollars basically

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:37.866
yelling at each other,
yelling over the fence.

00:24:37.866 --> 00:24:41.390
So my point about social media
is we haven't had conflict.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.740
We've had yelling at each other.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.144
But no one is engaged.

00:24:44.144 --> 00:24:45.310
Is everybody following this?

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.950
So the thing is we're
going to engage ideas.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.590
So there is no such
thing as a safe place.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.990
It means if we
talk respectfully,

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.950
we're going to engage.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.658
And this means at the
heart of innovation

00:24:55.658 --> 00:24:57.070
is this concept of diversity.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.032
So diversity is more
than just a moral issue.

00:24:59.032 --> 00:25:00.490
And of course, it
is a moral issue.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.390
But it's more.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.400
And it's not just the
color of your skin.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.240
It's your belief system.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.684
It's your cognitive maps.

00:25:06.684 --> 00:25:07.600
It's how you interact.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.870
It's your profession.

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.880
So to do this, Staney
and I built our model

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.140
on Quinn and Cameron's model.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.940
Bob Quinn had been
here, I believe.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.500
And he was sort of
one of my mentors,

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.320
along with CK Prahalad
and Rudolf Arnheim.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.750
Quinn-- this is their model
called the Competing Values

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.474
Framework.

00:25:23.474 --> 00:25:25.265
We took it towards the
innovation direction

00:25:25.265 --> 00:25:27.820
and did a lot of research on
it over the past 30 years.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.710
And it's often referred
to as the innovation

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.900
genome-- if you read the popular
literature, the innovation

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.210
code.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:33.640
So we're the developers of that.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.730
And it basically says there
are four types of innovators.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.800
And they compete
against each other.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.110
And the key to
innovation is following

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.730
these kitty-corner competitions
and looking for hybrids.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.480
So I'm going to explain
what each of these

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.780
means in just a minute.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:54.370
But to put it simply, innovation
has longitude and latitude.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.212
There are two continuums in
which you have to look at.

00:25:57.212 --> 00:25:59.170
And if you can figure
out those two continuums,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.810
the most important thing are the
dynamics between the opposites.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.440
Now, I want to emphasize this
is not an opposite of type.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.310
This is not an
opposite of style.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.370
This is what you're
trying to create destroys

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:10.690
what I'm trying to create.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:14.170
So when quality goes
up, you reduce errors

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.330
and innovation goes down.

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.820
When innovation goes
up, I introduce errors.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.880
This is sometimes called
economy at risk, right?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.170
So there's a trade-off.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.620
What we're saying is when these
two things show up together,

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.270
what we've learned
in our research

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.330
is those stocks
over time outperform

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.190
all the other stocks, right?

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.912
And they outperform the
indexes that people have.

00:26:35.912 --> 00:26:37.870
So these conflicts are
going to become central.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.703
So let me talk a little
bit about conflicts.

00:26:39.703 --> 00:26:41.680
Now, first of all, this
is not just about you.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.304
I like to call these
Russian matryoshka

00:26:43.304 --> 00:26:44.940
dolls, or Russian
nesting dolls, right?

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.160
I don't know.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:45.960
Do you do this?

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.070
I read self-help books.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.330
And then I go, you know
what I'm going to do?

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.320
I'm going to do this.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.820
I'm going to go
to Traverse City.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.710
And I'm just going
to quit my job.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.620
And I'm going to write
a crappy science fiction

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.740
novel-- is what I'm doing.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.948
And I've worked hard in my
life, made a little money.

00:26:58.948 --> 00:26:59.700
I'm doing OK.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.554
I'm chucking it all.

00:27:00.554 --> 00:27:01.470
That's what I'm doing.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.553
Anybody get to that point?

00:27:02.553 --> 00:27:05.100
I've had enough of this.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.760
Yeah.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.480
But there's another nesting
doll in my nesting doll.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.080
It's called, I'm married.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.290
And I have three children.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.172
And I have a dean.

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:13.380
And I have business partners.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.430
And I have people who
count on me, right?

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.930
Yeah.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:16.680
That's the other part.

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.138
And then what happens after
that is there's the real world.

00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:20.440
That's the big nesting doll.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.780
There's a pandemic.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.576
There's a war.

00:27:22.576 --> 00:27:23.700
There's a financial crisis.

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:25.470
Boy, you young people
got blown out bad.

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.970
No, wait.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.630
That was pretty bad.

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.320
Yeah.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.590
The notion is you don't
act alone, do you?

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:34.830
You act in accordance
to your community.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.620
And you act in accordance
to the situation.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:39.714
So it's not about you.

00:27:39.714 --> 00:27:41.880
It's not about, I'm this
type, and that's all equal.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.780
That's not what's going on.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.230
What's going on is there's
situational effectiveness.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.600
And it's not situation
like, this is awkward,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.250
like it's a social situation.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:53.140
It's like what's happening
in the outside world,

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.870
and how do you need
to act to do this.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.480
It's like playing a sports
game, like football or soccer,

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.770
whatever you follow.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:01.140
There's a time that you do
a certain sort of things

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.510
because it's appropriate
to do it at that time.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.990
Surgeons-- the same way.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.940
So let's look at the first one.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.700
The first one is the creative
type or the artist type.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.200
I was really lucky
when I was young.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.970
I got to be an
advisor to Steve Jobs.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.400
It was great.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.180
Walt Disney was
one of my heroes.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.190
Anybody like Disney?

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:20.670
Other than he had some opinions
that were not very cool,

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.530
but he did some cool stuff.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.600
Think about Elon Musk.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.260
Think about Tesla-- not
just a company, but the--

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.200
Nikki Tesla and all
that kind of stuff.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.170
So what's interesting
about this type of person

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.420
is that they're very good
in unique situations, things

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.710
we haven't seen before.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.870
We're trying to cure
an incurable disease.

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.980
We're going into a
battlement situation

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.634
we've never seen before.

00:28:40.634 --> 00:28:42.300
A meteor is careening
towards the earth.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.180
It's highly unique so
that you're making it up

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.020
as you go along.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.460
There isn't really a lot of
precedents for these people.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.168
They have a high
tolerance for ambiguity.

00:28:50.168 --> 00:28:51.390
They love ambiguity, right?

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:53.340
They love to spread the field.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.670
They love to try stuff.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:57.270
My favorite example of this
is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.970
Anybody remember three years
ago the Bose-- the God particle,

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:00.469
right?

00:29:00.469 --> 00:29:02.910
Here we are in-- at
CERN in Switzerland.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.470
We have seven Nobel
Prize winners.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.580
Two believe it will
create a black fissure.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.500
Do you remember this?

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.208
They thought it would
create a black hole

00:29:09.208 --> 00:29:10.260
and destroy the universe.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.540
They bet a beer and
pulled the switch!

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.620
See you in hell, Jurgen.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.330
These are these guys.

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.762
They're going to drive the
Harley into the pool, right?

00:29:17.762 --> 00:29:19.470
But they're going to
see the future first

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.340
because they're looking for it.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.907
So the organizations
are very ad hoc.

00:29:21.907 --> 00:29:23.490
They're making it
up as they go along.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.330
They're morphing.

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:25.150
People are coming.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.550
They're going into
these organizations.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.260
And the artists themselves--
what they really want

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.640
is they want to be creative.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.279
They're serial monogamists.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:32.820
They don't like
staying in their job.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:33.940
They're always looking
at a new thing.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.880
They're all ADD, every
last one of them.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.885
They pick up every pretty
pebble on the beach.

00:29:37.885 --> 00:29:38.760
You know what I mean?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.190
This is-- it's a Fellini movie.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.400
This is that group.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.960
It's a Grateful Dead concert.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:43.800
Jerry's playing.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.749
Mickey's in the bus.

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:47.040
The girl in the white dress
has had too many mushrooms.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.300
And she's spinning.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.970
The spinners-- you're probably
too young to remember all this.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.470
That's what's going on here.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.710
This is this group of people.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.890
So they're-- have a high
degree of innovation.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.020
But their speed is
relatively moderate

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.569
because the delta is very large.

00:29:59.569 --> 00:30:01.110
Something's going
to happen tomorrow.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.520
This is when hell freezes over.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.370
But the biggest problem is
they're high-risk, right?

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.880
Oh, that blowed up real good.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.130
You remember last fall?

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.870
SpaceX blew up a
billion-dollar rocket.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:11.740
And they blew up
Facebook's rocket, too.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:12.532
Oh, that blowed up.

00:30:12.532 --> 00:30:13.031
Yeah.

00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:13.840
How about that?

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.340
Yeah.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.600
This is this group of people.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.790
So where do we find them?

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.110
We find them taking risks.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.340
We find them in strategy.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.810
We find them in the arts.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:23.880
I bet some of you wanted
to be in the arts.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.220
And you sort of are in the
arts, aren't you, right?

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.050
Look at the-- yeah,
look at sheepish looks,

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.060
because what you
really want is freedom.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.019
And you're held together
by your vision, right?

00:30:32.019 --> 00:30:33.726
So one of the things
I learned real early

00:30:33.726 --> 00:30:36.060
in being around these people,
the early days of Silicon

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.590
Valley, were these
visionaries, who

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.237
used to be-- like follow
the Dead or ski bums, right?

00:30:40.237 --> 00:30:42.570
And then they built these
companies, including your own,

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:43.140
right?

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:48.060
And how the opposite of this
group could engage this group

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.910
is do things like understand
that this group is

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.700
going to try and make
problems bigger, not smaller.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.770
This group doesn't
want an answer.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:56.940
They want to play.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.210
So bring a fifth of Jack
Daniels and some crayons.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.876
You're going to do
some colorin', right?

00:31:00.876 --> 00:31:01.680
This is this group.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.140
They're never going
to be on time, right?

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.500
These are these people, right?

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.740
Now, the opposite are
the responsible people,

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.606
the engineers.

00:31:11.606 --> 00:31:12.730
I call them autonomous man.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.054
I'm Autonomous Man!

00:31:14.054 --> 00:31:15.720
I've thought of it
coming in here today.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.000
It came fully formed from
my forehead like Athena.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.915
And they quietly sing, heigh-ho,
heigh-- these are these guys.

00:31:20.915 --> 00:31:23.040
They know the right way
and wrong way to do things.

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.850
And they'll point it out to you.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.350
They love to tell you,
you know, Jeff, that's

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:26.391
the wrong way to do that.

00:31:26.391 --> 00:31:28.290
I'm on all these
famous journals.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.077
And all these other
guys in the journal

00:31:30.077 --> 00:31:32.160
love to tell me all the
stuff I'm not doing right.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.215
You know, Jeff, you
didn't evaluate--

00:31:33.215 --> 00:31:34.151
I'm like, I got it.

00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:34.650
OK.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.300
We wear funny hats.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.085
We have medieval ceremonies,
the whole nine yards.

00:31:39.085 --> 00:31:41.460
So these people are going to
be in predictable situations

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.290
where there's a lot of scale.

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:44.610
And failure's not an option.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.109
So you're going to
see three things.

00:31:46.109 --> 00:31:49.140
Scale-- we're selling
a lot of something.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.510
We're going to see complexity.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.500
Think about Boeing
and the new 87th--

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.970
has two million moving parts.

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.100
And the whole notion
is if you send--

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.290
you bring that down the
wrong way, it goes kaboom.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:31:59.100
Bad things happen.

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.440
You operate the wrong way, you
send the young men and women

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.040
off to combat.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.120
Bad things happen.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.670
Now, interestingly enough, my
favorite example of predictable

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:06.890
is McDonald's.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:09.440
Some illiterate kid presses
the cheeseburger button.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.260
And simultaneously, somebody
shoots a cow in Argentina.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:12.800
Bang!

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.060
And everything in
between happens.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.050
And Smithers, come here.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.216
These are these guys, right?

00:32:16.216 --> 00:32:18.020
They want everything to work.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:22.970
And, ironically, in
Google, as in Amazon,

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.310
a lot of your success is here.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.350
It's not in the green.

00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:28.760
It's here, right?

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.020
You're running a back-office,
very intricate supply

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.870
chain is what you're doing, with
algorithms all over the place.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.230
So it's all about
efficiency and quality.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:41.650
Where the other one was
about innovation and growth,

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.220
radical innovation
and growth, this

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.840
is innovation to
make things more

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.020
efficient to make them work.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.870
And the people who
run this-- we're

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.410
going to call them engineers.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.527
It's all about security
and productivity,

00:32:50.527 --> 00:32:52.860
the whole idea of doing the
right way and the wrong way.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.502
So you see that these are quite
different from each other.

00:32:55.502 --> 00:32:56.960
So these people
are very good where

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.280
there's large-scale projects.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.030
We're going to build
something really big,

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.880
like this whole campus
up here at Google.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.860
And we're going to have a
right way and a wrong way.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.910
We're going to get
these people who

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.100
have technical degrees--
engineering, medicine,

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.109
the sciences.

00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:10.400
And what these people want
is they want responsibility.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.540
Because what they seek
is they seek process.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.630
And the reason they use process
is because what they have to do

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.390
is take the vision
that the artist has,

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.250
and they have to materialize it.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.876
They have to build the
stupid thing, right?

00:33:24.876 --> 00:33:26.750
And incidentally,
artists-- one of the things

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.240
you love to tell the
engineers is it's 80% done.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.500
What's it really mean?

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.851
It's 20% done on a good day.

00:33:32.851 --> 00:33:34.850
You're not any-- and the
artist will take credit

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.433
for everything, don't
they, engineers?

00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:37.220
They take credit.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.490
Yeah.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.781
That's the way the artists are.

00:33:38.781 --> 00:33:40.451
They crow about it.

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.950
So what you can do, artists,
when dealing with an engineer--

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.380
one, show up on time.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.079
You think they don't notice.

00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:49.370
Oh, the engineers are the
most passive-aggressive group

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:50.036
you've got here.

00:33:50.036 --> 00:33:52.460
And on a dark night on a
dark road, you'll disappear.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.110
They got a file on you like
J. Edgar Hoover, right?

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.070
They absolutely
watch you, right?

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.570
No.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:57.800
Look it.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.030
Yeah, you know this, right?

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:00.650
The notion is look at the data.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.840
Actually read the data, right?

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.130
How about that for a change?

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.887
And follow the accepted form.

00:34:05.887 --> 00:34:07.970
And in the book, there's
a lot of keys about this.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.190
Now, here's the point.

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.550
The point is the
success of this group

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:16.723
comes down to your ability
to partner with the opposite.

00:34:16.723 --> 00:34:18.139
So the first thing
I'm telling you

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:21.139
is on a very personal level,
the person who makes you crazy

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.170
is probably what's
missing in your ability

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.880
to grow as a person
and your ability

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.834
to add value to
the organization.

00:34:27.834 --> 00:34:29.000
Is everybody following this?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.120
Number two, you have
to manage appropriately

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.929
to the outcome you want.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.460
So if I want the engineer
outcome, I have to use process.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.630
It's complicated.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.429
If I want the
artist outcome, I'm

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:42.030
going to change the gene pool.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.370
And I'm going to hedge.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.170
That's why startups
run the way they do,

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.630
because they can't
compete on scope or scale.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.389
So the notion is I've got
a screwdriver, a hammer,

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.389
a wrench, and a saw.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.440
They're great tools.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.790
They're not interchangeable.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.370
And that becomes
the first challenge.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.300
Now, we have to
encounter the other.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.190
That's the key.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.190
I want you to think about
your own organization.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.880
Think about Larry and Sergey.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.530
You see this?

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:03.440
They're opposite.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.980
Lennon and McCartney-- you're
going to see this over and over

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.710
again.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.770
You have to find the person
that makes you crazy.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:11.790
So I like superheroes.

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:14.450
So this is Johnny
Storm, the flame.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.190
Incidentally, superheroes
need to be more inclusive.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:19.350
I couldn't find any sort
of balanced superhero.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:20.639
So I'm sorry about that.

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:23.180
But we'll have to get Stanley
to work on that a little more--

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.070
maybe some of the newer
ones I don't know about.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.570
And then we got
Richards here, who's

00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:28.302
sort of the red genius guy.

00:35:28.302 --> 00:35:30.260
Well, let's turn this
around and talk about one

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:35.120
of my favorite groups, which is
the compete group, the blues.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.406
These are the athletes.

00:35:36.406 --> 00:35:38.030
I teach at the Ross
School of Business,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.400
where we grade on
a curve, right?

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.430
And we have sayings like,
don't send your ducks

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:43.670
to eagle school.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.830
And it's like the University
of Chicago or Wharton

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.430
or MIT, right?

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:49.720
The whole notion is
it's competitive,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.370
that what we're
trying to develop

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.780
are athletes, people
who are positive.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.310
They're forward-moving.

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.311
But the notion is
they're ready to compete.

00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:59.060
They're ready to do
what needs to be done.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.726
So these are people who are very
good at contentious situations.

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:03.680
So last week, I was
the keynote speaker

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.290
at the Air Force, their big
annual convention, right?

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:10.220
You want athletes in your
military services because what?

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.830
Their job is what-- is
to keep everybody safe.

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:13.914
That's their job.

00:36:13.914 --> 00:36:15.830
So they're going to be
aggressive in demanding

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:16.550
situations.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.597
So whether you're a
sports team and it's

00:36:18.597 --> 00:36:20.180
Michigan competing
against Ohio State,

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.054
or whether you're
competing for potato chips,

00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:23.540
or you're making
smartphones, this

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.050
is where there's someone
else coming after you, right?

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.470
And we always make fun of
these people till we need them.

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:31.160
Then we need them.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.990
Then it's a whole
different deal, right?

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:34.130
These are MBAs.

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.657
These are our
businesspeople, right?

00:36:35.657 --> 00:36:37.490
And they're very
market-based organizations,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:38.630
meaning they face outside.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.160
And they're beholden
to shareholders

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:41.180
or they're beholden to guidance.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:42.500
They have something
that they told people

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.666
they're going to accomplish.

00:36:43.666 --> 00:36:46.580
So they're very interested
on speed and profitability.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.250
The notion of profitability,
even in a nonprofit, is

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.824
are-- have we got
bigger endowment?

00:36:51.824 --> 00:36:53.990
Michigan likes to say, we're
not interested in that.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.030
But of course, the truth is
all the best schools have what?

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:57.570
They have these huge
endowments, right?

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.530
And that's kind of the score.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.905
And finally, these
people are all

00:36:59.905 --> 00:37:01.260
about vitality and prosperity.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.510
And you must have
some of these people

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:04.218
because I'm walking
around your building.

00:37:04.218 --> 00:37:05.090
You got a gym.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:06.850
And people are tracking how--

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:07.550
are they fit?

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.080
And are they doing stuff?

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.340
Who's in first place?

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.896
And who's in last place,
and top 10 and bottom 10?

00:37:12.896 --> 00:37:14.270
So you're not
fooling me, Google.

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.639
You got these guys, too.

00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:16.680
And we need these people.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.710
We're going to find these
people in a lot of places.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.450
We're going to find them
wherever the challenge is

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.169
results-driven.

00:37:21.169 --> 00:37:22.460
These are "get it done" people.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.200
And they get it
done very quickly.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.300
These are not long-cycle people.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.940
So they're going to look where
the goals are focused, like we

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.100
have to make the quarter.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.850
Where we got a problem
we've got to solve.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:32.780
Something didn't work.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:33.655
And it's got to work.

00:37:33.655 --> 00:37:35.770
But more importantly,
more importantly, we're

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.020
going to find these people where
challenges and resources result

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.760
in some kind of a score.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.670
Now, what the sages can do--

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.950
this is going to be an
interesting thing because I

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.410
have to warn you about blues.

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:52.910
Boomers in the United
States are typically blue.

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:53.510
You know what?

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.843
When I came to college, I
came to college as a wrestler.

00:37:55.843 --> 00:37:58.040
I got to come to
college as a wrestler.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.020
And that meant somebody
got a gold medal.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.600
And the rest of you were
pathetic losers and either went

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.020
to therapy or learned to drink.

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.350
That's what it was, that
my generation-- you ever

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.070
watch the Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer thing at Christmas,

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.820
and you think Santa
Claus is a total jerk?

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.320
Yeah.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.770
That's my generation, right?

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:13.640
We went to the moon.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.570
We licked the commies.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.627
We built the net.

00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:16.820
[GRUNTING]

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.200
That's us.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.380
But our children are
not those people.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.360
Our children have
a little trouble

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.270
with our goal-centricity,
our focus on goals,

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.750
why we're obsessed with goals,
why we compete and fight

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.530
over everything.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:31.590
It's very confusing.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.650
Well, our children
are these sages.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.820
And sages collaborate.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.120
So they're very good at
cooperative lifestyle things.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.580
They're very good at searching
and reapplying ideas.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.577
They're very good
at sharing, right?

00:38:42.577 --> 00:38:44.660
They don't like the idea
of intellectual property.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.243
They don't like the
idea that somebody

00:38:46.243 --> 00:38:47.480
owns something, asymmetries.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.220
They have a very
democratic notion

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.770
of the world, a very
inclusive, a very consensus

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.690
notion of the world in
general, in general.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.710
These are generalities.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.730
Interestingly enough,
their organizations

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:59.430
are very clannish, very
community-oriented,

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.710
very network-oriented.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.390
So you're connecting
to people that you

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.890
want to connect
with, that you share

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.450
some kind of personal
affinity for.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.120
You're very
values-oriented, right?

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.980
Where the boomers
are goal-oriented,

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.150
you're values-oriented.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.580
And I believe this is
creating the largest

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.620
cultural shift in my lifetime.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:16.579
It's not like the '60s.

00:39:16.579 --> 00:39:18.661
I want to tell you three
things about young people

00:39:18.661 --> 00:39:20.060
that you probably already know.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.640
Over half of all live births
to women under the age of 30

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.702
starting in 2014 are
outside of marriage.

00:39:24.702 --> 00:39:26.660
The more educated the
woman is, the less likely

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:27.740
she is to marry.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.360
Marriage is no longer normative.

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.850
I've been married
(WHISPERING) forever, right?

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.290
She's been married
to me forever, right?

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:36.290
The notion of what you
want to do for a living--

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:39.050
here at Google, is this a
lifetime event at Google?

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:40.460
Are you going to
be here forever?

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.668
Interestingly enough,
according to the Pew Charitable

00:39:42.668 --> 00:39:44.660
Trust, what do you
really want out of life?

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.710
You want to have impact.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.270
You want to make meaning.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.640
You want to take time off
to cure river blindness

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.440
in Tanzania because you care
about culture, as opposed

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.170
to my generation.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.186
And finally, the other
thing that's very big

00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:57.560
is when you ask
young people what

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:00.510
their religious affiliation
is, the number one growth

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:01.280
area is what?

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.900
No affiliation, right?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.550
So if you're
talking to a boomer,

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.290
I've been married
forever, right?

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:07.760
I'm a practicing Roman Catholic.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:09.230
And I'm a capitalist pig, right?

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.670
I teach in a business school.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.942
So we're different about this.

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:13.400
It doesn't mean we
can't get along.

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.899
And it doesn't mean we don't
have a lot to teach each other.

00:40:15.899 --> 00:40:17.390
But the notion is, and it's--

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.640
I'm doing this in a very
gross way, obviously,

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:20.569
to sort of teach this.

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:22.610
But I also want to point
out that the Chinese are

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:24.350
a clannish culture.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.580
They're the opposite
of American culture.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:28.280
American culture
became American culture

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.200
in a very ballistic
way, in a very hard way.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.360
I want you to think
about 2008, September 15,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.280
when Lehman crashed.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:36.000
Between September
15 and January 1,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.730
we laid off 6 million people--
bang, bang, bang, right?

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.650
But we also hired
them back faster.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.301
This culture doesn't--
takes care of people

00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:44.550
because they're value-centric.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.383
But it also takes longer
to bring them back.

00:40:46.383 --> 00:40:47.670
So it's a long-cycle culture.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:49.920
We find these people in
community service, places

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:51.690
where conflict is managed.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:55.170
We find these people where we're
dealing with people in a way

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:59.340
that we're trying to
help them develop.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.827
We're trying to
mitigate conflict.

00:41:00.827 --> 00:41:02.910
And we're going to find
these people where harmony

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:05.790
is paramount, where people are
respecting each other in a way

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.160
that they don't have
the kind of conflicts

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.750
that I'm suggesting here.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:12.105
So how can the
athletes engage people?

00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:14.430
Well, athletes,
boomers like me--

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:16.410
we have to be more patient.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.960
That's a big one because you've
got a lot of things that--

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.660
you'll say, I need
more time on this.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:21.930
If you're a boomer, what
does the boomer say?

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:22.780
Oh, you don't have more time.

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:23.850
It's due on Wednesday.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.180
We have to be more
cheerful with you.

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:30.720
You know how people
say, you can do it?

00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.230
There's all this big thing
about positivity now.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.140
And what are old boomers
like me thinking?

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:35.640
No.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.210
You suck.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:36.600
You can't.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.266
Sit down, right?

00:41:37.266 --> 00:41:38.440
That's what we're thinking.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.523
But no, you're encouraged.

00:41:39.523 --> 00:41:41.970
So we have to be
understanding of that, right?

00:41:41.970 --> 00:41:45.130
And of course, I'm dealing
in gross generalities here.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:48.090
But the notion is the challenge
here, the other thing that

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:51.450
predicts value, is that
these two things get along.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.420
And that's one of
the secrets, I think,

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.500
to when my generation
and your generation

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.750
collaborate, when Americans
and Chinese collaborate.

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.940
I think there's something
very powerful that

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.510
happens in those communities.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.020
So I think of this like
Sue Storm and the Thing.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.610
Sue Storm's one of
my favorite ones.

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:06.870
She could-- she
has a force field.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:08.160
How many would
like a force field?

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.130
She can read your mind.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:10.995
That's what I want to do, read
your mind, read my kids' mind

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:12.037
and protect them, right?

00:42:12.037 --> 00:42:13.620
And then the Thing
just smashes stuff.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:15.661
I'm sorry that my generation's
kind of the Thing.

00:42:15.661 --> 00:42:16.499
We apologize.

00:42:16.499 --> 00:42:18.540
But things need to be
smashed every now and then.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.130
So there is a whole
world view here.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.600
I'm not going to spend
any time on this.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.224
But this is not sort
of pop psychology.

00:42:23.224 --> 00:42:26.310
There's a lot of work about
how you think about time, how

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.830
you think about space, what
you value, what you chase,

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:30.280
who you want to be dealing with.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.840
So these world views
are very deep, right?

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.810
And they can be
partially cultural.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.670
And there's a lot
of neurobiology

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.772
that says some of this
may actually be hardwired.

00:42:40.772 --> 00:42:42.480
I don't want to go
there because then you

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.646
start getting into eugenics.

00:42:43.646 --> 00:42:45.960
But the notion is we are a
combination of our biology

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.510
and our history and
our experiences, right?

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.887
So there's problems.

00:42:49.887 --> 00:42:50.970
Let me tell you a problem.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.340
This comes with-- anyone
who's been married

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:56.040
for a long time will
tell you that-- can you

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.194
change the other person?

00:42:57.194 --> 00:42:58.110
Now, you're all young.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.860
And you think you can.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.760
I just have to tell you, as
I'm a pod from the future,

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.700
you're not going to
change the other person.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.440
The number one year
for divorce is when?

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.540
It's year one-- year one.

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.310
What do you figure
out in year one?

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.480
They're not going to change.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.640
You either can live
with this, or you can't.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.570
That's it.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:16.870
So why am I telling you this?

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.240
Because you're going to try
and change these people,

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:18.823
and you can't.

00:43:18.823 --> 00:43:19.980
So what's the problem?

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.810
When you get the reds in your
group, what do they always do?

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:22.750
They're very judgmental.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:23.910
They'll tell you the right
way and the wrong way

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.129
to do things, right?

00:43:25.129 --> 00:43:27.420
When you get the greens in
the groups, what do they do?

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.420
They have no discipline.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.576
They get up and walk away.

00:43:29.576 --> 00:43:30.450
They don't follow up.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:32.037
They have bad methodologies.

00:43:32.037 --> 00:43:32.870
What do-- the blues?

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.560
The blues love to take over.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.110
The blues-- they can be boorish.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.720
[GRUNTING]

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.590
Here's what we should do.

00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:39.590
Short-term, let's make
the meeting five minutes.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.760
It's like a drive-by
shooting-- bang, bang, bang--

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.100
PowerPoint slides everywhere
because they can't speak in

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.034
complete sentences yet, right?

00:43:46.034 --> 00:43:48.450
And finally, when you get the
yellows, it's all about, oh,

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:49.324
we can pull together.

00:43:49.324 --> 00:43:51.720
And we can-- let's just
have another meeting.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.000
The notion is you're going
to try and change that.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.110
You can't.

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.300
This is the downside that
goes with the upside.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.220
This is what you
have to deal with.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.800
Nation states also
have this challenge.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.110
Now, every nation state
has all four of these.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.230
And the whole idea of a nation
state's kind of an old idea.

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.820
But think about
Japanese culture.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.340
Why were the Japanese so good
at quality after the war?

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.170
When we basically
invented quality--

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.440
Six Sigma in New York, right?

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.540
So what's been interesting
is the Japanese had

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.580
a 2,000-year-old tradition
of [? Hari ?] design.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.290
This is part of
their culture, right?

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:23.460
Think about the Netherlands.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.722
My name's DeGraff, right?

00:44:24.722 --> 00:44:26.430
The Netherlands-- how
has the Netherlands

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:29.190
been able to have this
incredible, prosperous

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.740
community?

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.050
It's a really small country.

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.400
It's the tallest
country in the world.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:32.760
I don't know if you know this.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.230
I'm not representing.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.790
Well, my mother's Hungarian.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.030
But the notion is because things
have gone well after the war

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.220
because the Dutch can't
compete on scope or scale,

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.790
so they have to
go out and trade.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:44.250
They have to invent
stuff, right?

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:45.270
Think about the United States.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.040
How did we get to be
the United States?

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.530
You either came here
to chase Gold Mountain,

00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:52.020
you came to escape the czar,
you came here in chains,

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.730
or you thought you
were here, right?

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.980
It was not exactly
a picnic, right?

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.290
That's how we do things,
rather ballistically.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.850
And finally, think
about China, where

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:02.040
there are over 50 words
in Chinese for which uncle

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:02.290
are you.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:03.090
Are you the rich uncle?

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:04.370
Are you the crazy
uncle, the uncle

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.786
we avoid, the uncle
we suck up to?

00:45:05.786 --> 00:45:07.110
Who are you in the family?

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.097
The notion is you're
always going to see this.

00:45:09.097 --> 00:45:10.680
And what happens is
we have a tendency

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.430
to vilify the people who
aren't like us instead

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:15.832
of understanding them.

00:45:15.832 --> 00:45:17.290
And that becomes
the big challenge.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.498
So we have to have the right
person at the right job.

00:45:19.498 --> 00:45:22.050
Now, I'm going to throw some
self-help stuff out the window.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.051
It's going to upset you.

00:45:23.051 --> 00:45:25.508
But I'm going to tell you what
basically the research says.

00:45:25.508 --> 00:45:27.930
First, the assumption of
type doesn't mean competency.

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:28.717
Oh, I'm an artist.

00:45:28.717 --> 00:45:29.550
But you suck, right?

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:31.080
You're just not a good artist.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.163
The assumption that talent
can be developed-- this

00:45:33.163 --> 00:45:34.280
is my favorite one.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.050
It can be developed to a point.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.460
But you're not going to make
Mozart or Michael Jordan.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.170
Those are things that are a
confluence of natural talent

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.280
and the situation that
they find themself in.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.080
Assumption that all types
are equal-- they're not.

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.246
If I'm an investment banker,
what am I trying to do?

00:45:47.246 --> 00:45:48.470
I'm trying to do blue stuff.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.840
If I'm a university professor,
I'm trying to do yellow stuff.

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.850
So the blues are going to be
more valuable in one situation,

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:53.824
the yellows in another.

00:45:53.824 --> 00:45:55.490
And finally, the
assumption that balance

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.045
is better-- not necessarily so.

00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.670
When I'm starting a
project, the greens

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:01.490
are geniuses because they love
the ambiguity-- make stuff

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.354
as they go along.

00:46:02.354 --> 00:46:03.770
At the end, the
reds are geniuses.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:05.710
And everybody in
between is a genius.

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.730
Now, remember, I haven't
spoken about the Xers.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.640
Xers-- what they're
genius is at is connecting

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.980
boomers and millennials.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:13.400
Xers are the
smallest generation.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.320
But they're the most
ambidextrous generation

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.130
we've seen.

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:18.440
So the only reason I talk
about boomers and millennials

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.810
is we're the largest
generations by far, relatively.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:21.870
X are smaller.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.120
Gen Z are going to be smaller.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.040
But they might be the
most valuable, right?

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.140
And incidentally,
millennials, remember this--

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:29.199
there's more of you now
than there are of us.

00:46:29.199 --> 00:46:30.740
You're on the sunny
side of the hill.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.573
And if you ever figure
that out politically,

00:46:32.573 --> 00:46:35.510
boy, it's going to get real
interesting real fast, right?

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.100
So the direction you
move under stress

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.150
is what people really are.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.100
So if you really want to
know what somebody is,

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.183
see what they do when
they're really under stress.

00:46:42.183 --> 00:46:44.480
Do they go get on social
media, talk to their friends?

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.950
Do they shorten the
field and sort of look

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.158
at the three things in front?

00:46:47.158 --> 00:46:48.320
Do they look at the data?

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.395
Do they go weasel out of
stuff and sort of go off

00:46:50.395 --> 00:46:52.520
the reservation and do all
kinds of creative stuff?

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.410
That will tell you
what that person is.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.275
But here becomes the
money part of this.

00:46:57.275 --> 00:46:58.670
This is the key part.

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.327
How you innovate is
what you innovate.

00:47:00.327 --> 00:47:01.910
How you innovate is
what you innovate.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:03.076
You want radical innovation?

00:47:03.076 --> 00:47:04.370
You got to embrace the artist.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:05.090
You want to get scale?

00:47:05.090 --> 00:47:06.527
You got to embrace the engineer.

00:47:06.527 --> 00:47:07.360
You want to go fast?

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.540
You got to embrace the athlete.

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:09.590
You want to build
something sustainable?

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:10.850
Embrace the sage.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:12.867
And you need all
four of these to win.

00:47:12.867 --> 00:47:15.200
So here's the biggest problems
you're going to run into.

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.840
And we're going to talk about
the data in one second on this.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.210
The biggest problem you
have is that the people

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.820
who are in the green
position are orphans.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.065
The artists are orphans.

00:47:24.065 --> 00:47:25.940
The city that you're in
right now, Ann Arbor,

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.740
has more venture
capital per person

00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.240
than any city in
the United States.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.570
The problem is, does it relate
to anything else in this state?

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.250
No.

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.350
You're orphans.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:36.830
So the problem is
you got to snuggle up

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:39.260
to people who are
trying to make a living

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.130
and do things in other areas.

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:43.400
The second problem are
the blues and the yellows.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.980
And the problem is they're
oppositional, dogs and cats.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.590
So one, you have to really
engage the conflict.

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:50.847
And the second problem is
this is by far the longest

00:47:50.847 --> 00:47:51.680
cycle of innovation.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.096
It's sometimes
called Death Valley

00:47:53.096 --> 00:47:54.440
or the bottom of the bathtub.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.610
How many have been in a
project that lost momentum?

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.485
Anybody been on a project
that lost momentum,

00:47:58.485 --> 00:47:59.210
and you sort of--

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.070
and you have to platoon
players in and out?

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:01.570
Yeah.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:02.430
This is that part.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:04.820
And finally, the reds, the
engineers-- the problem

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.950
is they're so
optimized that there's

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:09.570
no room to try anything else.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:11.156
And so when the
new thing shows up,

00:48:11.156 --> 00:48:12.780
they're not prepared
for the new things

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.920
because every moment of their
life is basically taken up.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:17.657
So we have to rely
on each other.

00:48:17.657 --> 00:48:20.240
Now, the other thing that's very
important about the dynamics,

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.215
which is a key
point, is innovation

00:48:22.215 --> 00:48:24.590
doesn't move from the inside
out-- moves from the outside

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:25.160
in.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.380
And think about
this for a minute.

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.560
When do people really change?

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.684
When do you really change--

00:48:28.684 --> 00:48:30.300
I mean, really?

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:30.800
Yeah.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.900
When you made a mistake,
when your life sucks,

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.030
when you get divorced,
when you lose a job,

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:36.809
when your house
goes away, somebody

00:48:36.809 --> 00:48:37.850
close to you passes away.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:40.250
Why do you change
when your life sucks?

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.810
Because the risk
of trying something

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.810
radical and the reward
of seeing where you're at

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.154
is reversed in a crisis.

00:48:47.154 --> 00:48:48.320
Is everybody following this?

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.710
Whether this is Apple
trading at $3 a share

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.910
in 1997, whether this is
Gandhi in the march to the sea,

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:57.260
it also has a negative effect.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.450
This is also Hitler
and the Brownshirts.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.580
The notion is it
doesn't move inside out.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.576
It moves outside in, where
the middle of the organization

00:49:04.576 --> 00:49:05.450
is trying to do what?

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:06.190
Maintain.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:07.690
And the outside's
trying to do what?

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:09.072
Introduce diversity.

00:49:09.072 --> 00:49:11.030
Now, the other time that
people change is when?

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.320
When they're on a roll.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.220
You win the lottery.

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:13.970
You got promoted.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.737
You're in love, all that stuff.

00:49:15.737 --> 00:49:16.820
Why do you try stuff then?

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.891
Because the same thing--

00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:19.390
the risk of trying
something radical

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.598
and the reward of where
you're at is reversed, right?

00:49:21.598 --> 00:49:23.270
It's called risk
capital in our world.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:24.350
And incidentally,
Google, you've had

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:26.224
a lot of risk capital
over the past 10 years,

00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:27.350
a lot of risk capital.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.020
So the notion is don't launch
innovation from the inside out.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.730
Because what'll happen to
that innovation is what?

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.580
The organization will
begin to converge it.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.930
It will begin to make
it more incremental.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.670
You have to start
at the perimeter.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.460
The farther away you can
be from headquarters,

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.160
the farther you can be
away from the watchful eye,

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.630
the better off
you're going to be.

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:47.220
Now, this leads us to
this last slide here.

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:51.630
This is referred to as
the Schumpeter cycle.

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.060
And the Schumpeter cycle--

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.250
I want you to think
about this for a minute.

00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:59.360
First of all, organizations are
created by greens, typically.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.140
They want to have freedom.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.740
This is Larry and Sergey--

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:05.700
created in a garage
in Menlo, right?

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.860
This is what this was.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.690
But next, we got to
get money involved.

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:11.500
And these are the people who
gave you money early on, right?

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.745
These are the big
Apollo funds and things

00:50:13.745 --> 00:50:15.620
that gave Google money
at the very beginning.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.057
And they focus the two.

00:50:17.057 --> 00:50:18.890
Then what happens is
you grow ballistically.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.090
We got to get the
yellows on board

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:20.990
because we got to
have the right people,

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:22.650
sell to the right people,
build the right community.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.941
And then we have to have,
ultimately, the reds on board

00:50:24.941 --> 00:50:26.484
because we have to get to scale.

00:50:26.484 --> 00:50:27.650
Is everybody following this?

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:29.480
Now, what's
important about this?

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.880
Once we get to
scale, the problem

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.970
is every capital committee
person, every metric

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:39.140
that we've got, every
process that we've run,

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.330
is designed to do
what to deviance?

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.850
To eliminate it.

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:48.370
Why didn't Sears become Amazon?

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:51.820
Why didn't Microsoft
become Google, right?

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.150
Why didn't McDonald's
become Starbucks?

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.130
It had nothing to
do with competition.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:59.140
They had all the stuff
in the lab, right?

00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:00.090
You know this.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.410
The notion is, and this
is the radical part

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.492
of this whole discussion-- what
Schumpeter said is radical.

00:51:05.492 --> 00:51:07.450
And whether-- it depends
on who you're talking.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.770
We had six or seven Nobel
Prize winners in economics

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:10.630
since 1969.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:11.680
I've talked about this.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.040
The radical part of this is
that what Schumpeter said

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.460
is that we're not
destroyed by competitors.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.939
What Schumpeter said
is we kill ourselves.

00:51:20.939 --> 00:51:22.480
We have seen the
enemy, and he is us.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.850
Our dominant logic
becomes so strong,

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:26.680
we can't get over it, right?

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.150
And as a nation
state in America,

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:30.130
aren't we suffering
from this right now,

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.680
that we can't get over
our dominant logic?

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.360
We can't see the other.

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:38.050
He calls this the point
of creative destruction.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:41.560
And ironically, organizations
that begin to fail quickly

00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.240
have a much better
chance of innovating

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:45.730
because they have to go back
to the beginning of the cycle.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:47.474
Apple trading at $3 a share--

00:51:47.474 --> 00:51:48.640
is everybody following this?

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.680
But think about General
Motors in 1950--

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.280
had 53% of the
world car market--

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.491
drip, drip, drip.

00:51:55.491 --> 00:51:56.490
It's called flat-lining.

00:51:56.490 --> 00:51:59.130
So the notion is there's an
interesting sort of confounding

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:02.610
part to this, where even
though there's tension,

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:06.150
the best thing that can happen
is when one cycle shifts

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:08.854
into the other cycle in a
relatively straightforward way

00:52:08.854 --> 00:52:10.520
so we can put cause
and effect together.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.515
So here's what--
here's the thing to do.

00:52:12.515 --> 00:52:13.800
Then I'm going to turn
this over to Staney.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.216
She's going to
talk about the book

00:52:15.216 --> 00:52:16.980
and what you can do
here in your work.

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:19.000
Stop believing you
can see the future.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.850
Make smaller, wider bets,
choosing big over fast.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:22.350
No.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.340
Pick up your pace.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.290
Go faster, right?

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:27.600
Mistaking your managers
for innovators-- no.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.830
Encourage, encourage,
and support your weirdos.

00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:33.257
We need weirdos.

00:52:33.257 --> 00:52:35.340
And incidentally, if you're
an organization that's

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.714
really green, weirdos are reds.

00:52:37.714 --> 00:52:38.880
Is everybody following this?

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.310
If you're-- if you're
a yellow organization,

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:42.540
the weirdos are blue.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:43.860
They're just not like you.

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.980
Having more ambition
than capability--

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.390
talent matters.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:50.765
You got to go out and build
on the capability you have.

00:52:50.765 --> 00:52:52.140
I love what the
armed forces say.

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.490
You don't fight with
the army you want.

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.926
You fight with the army you
have, which I think is great.

00:52:55.926 --> 00:52:57.300
Starting at the
center, move out.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.500
It's not student body.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.622
It's a perimeter game.

00:52:59.622 --> 00:53:01.080
I worked on a
project that you know

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.359
that was originally called C2.

00:53:03.359 --> 00:53:04.400
You know it as Coke Zero.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.984
I worked on Coke Zero.

00:53:05.984 --> 00:53:07.650
The problem with Coke
Zero was everybody

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:09.900
thought they had it right,
and they launched it as C2.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.900
We had to move it out of sight,
work it out off Broadway,

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:13.650
and bring it back.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:15.870
And that became Coke Zero.

00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:17.256
Listening to the wrong people--

00:53:17.256 --> 00:53:18.630
don't listen to
the customers who

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:20.780
are your big customers, because
are they going to move first?

00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:21.720
They're going to move last.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.270
Finally, failing to
connect the dots-- you

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:24.120
got to connect the dots.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.110
That's why we're here.

00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.220
You got to put all
four of these together.

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.500
Now, the last part of this--

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.450
I want Staney to come
up and talk about this.

00:53:30.450 --> 00:53:33.270
I want to talk about the book,
and the four steps in the book,

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.070
and what you can do
to actually engage

00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.384
the constructive conflict.

00:53:37.384 --> 00:53:38.425
STANEY DEGRAFF: I got it.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.530
Hi.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.977
So I won't bore you.

00:53:42.977 --> 00:53:44.060
And I won't take too long.

00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:47.740
But we've created about
four really simple steps

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.720
for you guys to create
a constructive conflicts

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.469
because the thing about
it is you actually

00:53:51.469 --> 00:53:52.770
have to do this every day.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.720
It's not-- once you get it,
it's almost like a muscle

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.160
that you have to exercise.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.062
Once you got it, it
becomes really easy.

00:53:59.062 --> 00:54:00.520
But if you've never
done it before,

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.936
it could be pretty
awkward and can

00:54:01.936 --> 00:54:06.130
be quite difficult, and
actually quite intimidating,

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:06.770
to start first.

00:54:06.770 --> 00:54:09.310
So the first thing
that you have to do

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.320
is really assemble a
diversity of perspective.

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:14.040
What I love about this building
when Scott gave us a tour

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.560
is there's so many spaces
here that are very open spaces

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.330
that anybody can just go to.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:23.560
So that's the first thing-- is
I always talk to our clients.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.440
And I will say, there has to be
a space where people actually

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.570
can just go in and
just talk to one

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:30.490
another like a
normal human being.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:31.990
If you put them
just in cubicles,

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:33.820
and there's no way for
them to go anywhere,

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:36.220
how are they actually
going to meet other people?

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.995
But this also talks
about recruiting.

00:54:38.995 --> 00:54:42.130
In a company, you can't just
recruit one type of person

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:43.630
or one type of skill.

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:46.720
You might want to combine the
skills you're looking for,

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.820
with the kind of age
you're looking for,

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.550
with the kind of
skin color you're

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.630
looking for, with the
kind of background,

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.760
with the kind of
diversity of thought.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.660
Where is this
person coming from?

00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:00.190
So you have to have a pool
of people in which you can

00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:02.390
communicate on a regular basis.

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:06.850
And I think this is what
Jeff always talks about is--

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:08.050
we have three children.

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:09.620
And my youngest is 16.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.440
And they're always
on social media.

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.180
And what I do see
in social media,

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.900
too, is people
start only looking--

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.880
my friends are my friends.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.880
And my friends have the
similar view that I do.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:25.240
And I get frustrated when I see
a different point of view that,

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:27.410
to me, was attacking
my point of view.

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:28.597
I don't like that.

00:55:28.597 --> 00:55:29.680
And I know people do that.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.570
We have our own niches.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:33.640
And that's actually
quite dangerous for what

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.150
we want to do.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:37.210
We should just open
up and start talking,

00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.070
have a conversation
with somebody else who's

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.200
very different from us.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.810
I was just talking to my intern.

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:46.230
And she was talking about,
how do you meet new people?

00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:48.132
And I said, well, I used
just to go to cafés.

00:55:48.132 --> 00:55:49.590
There are a lot of
people in cafés.

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.716
She's like, I've never met
any new person in a café.

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:54.590
I'm like, it's a totally
different world now.

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:56.030
I totally get that.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:57.520
But I think that's
why you actually

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:59.990
have to make the first step.

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:04.220
And so this is the kind of
types of the four colors

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:04.970
that you can find.

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.070
Usually, engineers
are-- they're organized.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.080
So they can be scientists,
analysts, those kind of things.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.910
And sages are
teachers and so forth.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.840
So you can look at that.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:18.010
But the second step is then
you have to actually engage it.

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:21.250
So we're talking about if
we are doing brainstorming,

00:56:21.250 --> 00:56:24.010
for example, to solve
a particular idea

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.530
or a particular challenge
in your organization,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.870
gather everybody and make sure
there are all the four colors.

00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:32.050
And then put it in
one space, one room.

00:56:32.050 --> 00:56:33.307
And then just engage.

00:56:33.307 --> 00:56:34.390
You actually have to talk.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.700
This is what Jeff
was talking about.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.031
If you do not agree with
something, then say it.

00:56:39.031 --> 00:56:40.030
I don't agree with that.

00:56:40.030 --> 00:56:41.500
You don't have to be mean.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:42.792
You can be respectful.

00:56:42.792 --> 00:56:43.750
But you have to engage.

00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:46.970
And I think, and forgive
me if I'm wrong--

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:50.140
but I also noticed that
in my children, especially

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.260
the 16-year-old, he
doesn't like conflict.

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:57.910
So he doesn't like telling
people, I don't agree with you.

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.840
And it's easier for him
to do it in social media

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.340
and to write something instead
of just walking to the person

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:04.759
and say, I really disagree.

00:57:04.759 --> 00:57:06.800
And this is actually a
skill that you have to do.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.860
You actually have to engage
that with this open-mindedness

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.300
and conversation.

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.560
It's really when we create
a cognitive dissonance

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:15.680
in our brain.

00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.110
And then we start
thinking about new things.

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:22.330
So one of the things that we
also talk about is talk about--

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:24.670
use this and say what worked
and what doesn't work.

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:26.740
And go through the
four colors to see

00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.020
what's working, what
doesn't right now,

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.300
and to figure out what
solutions we can come up with.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:34.480
And when you get into
a really big conflict

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.865
and you feel like you're
stuck, the third thing

00:57:36.865 --> 00:57:39.130
that you have to do
is really make sure

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:41.050
that you establish that
shared goal or vision.

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:42.700
Keep on reminding
everyone why are

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.080
you there, why in this room.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.500
We are trying to solve
that particular problem.

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:50.020
And just kind of stick with
it-- because if everybody has

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.820
the same goal, and everybody
agrees with that same goal,

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.940
and they can remove their ego--

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:56.270
I think that's a big thing--

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.360
from the situation,
then we might

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.910
be able to come
out with something.

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:03.820
And the fourth one
is just then you

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.220
have to construct
the hybrid solution.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:09.580
So brainstorm a lot of
arrays of good ideas

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:12.250
and select the best ideas
from the four colors.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:15.760
And try to see, can I put the
green one with the red one?

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.130
Could I put the blue
one and the yellow one?

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:21.650
And we put some ideas and
some methods in the book.

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:23.260
You can use metaphors.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.580
You could use different
kind of a creativity idea

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.340
that we can put up together.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:31.790
And basically, the idea
is let's not compromise.

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:33.610
Let's not choose
one idea to another.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.210
Let's figure out a way that
we can ascend all this,

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:40.170
get all disagreement together,
listen to one another,

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:44.050
create a bond and learn how
to communicate with another,

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.863
and then come out with
a better solution.

00:58:46.863 --> 00:58:48.160
Jeff?

00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.830
JEFF DEGRAFF: Well, thank you.

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:53.040
Let's finish up here.

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.110
So what's the point?

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:55.827
Take a higher point
of view, right?

00:58:55.827 --> 00:58:56.660
It's hard, isn't it?

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.700
It's hard with all of the--

00:58:58.700 --> 00:58:59.390
all the anger.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:01.181
It's hard to get to a
higher point of view.

00:59:01.181 --> 00:59:03.954
But have you noticed adults
are starting to do that now?

00:59:03.954 --> 00:59:05.370
They're starting
to say, you know,

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:07.950
even though I might be a little
bit on the side of the center

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:09.200
line, the people
who are a little bit

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:11.520
on the other side of the
line make a lot of sense.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.104
We can have a
conversation about that.

00:59:13.104 --> 00:59:15.061
And finally, I want you
to remember the DeGraff

00:59:15.061 --> 00:59:17.090
hypothesis, which is
probably what they'll

00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:18.610
remember on my tombstone.

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:20.360
Out of all the stuff
I've done in my life,

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.550
the amount of innovation
an organization produces

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:25.100
is inversely related to the
number of stupid PowerPoint

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.200
slides or elaborate
process diagrams

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.670
it makes about innovation.

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:32.105
In the old words of Phil
Knight, you just have to do it.

00:59:32.105 --> 00:59:34.730
So I want to take us-- first, I
want to thank you for having us

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:35.330
here.

00:59:35.330 --> 00:59:38.227
I want to take a second to take
some questions, if we could.

00:59:38.227 --> 00:59:39.560
I know we're a little over time.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.210
But I want to take
questions because I

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:47.810
know that this is a very
counter-intuitive view of how

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:48.650
innovation works.

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:50.390
And what we didn't
talk about here--

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.250
I took it out of the
slide deck-- is we--

00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:54.770
I did a number of--

00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:57.080
we did a lot of analysis
on the stock market--

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.180
is what it came down
to, starting in 1993,

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.020
more effectively in 2010.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:04.430
And we started looking at
these kind of indicators

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:06.680
for contrarian points of view.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.570
And what happened with
the organizations that

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:12.265
had high scores in
these opposite areas--

01:00:12.265 --> 01:00:14.390
it turns out that they
outperformed everybody else.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:17.245
And this growth index that
we've talked about that almost

01:00:17.245 --> 01:00:17.870
no one's beat--

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.369
I think we've only
lost to it, like,

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.510
a half a dozen times
over the years.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.920
So the notion is it's more than
just a typology or a style.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.810
There's really sort of
an analytical engine

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:28.065
underneath that.

01:00:28.065 --> 01:00:30.440
So with, that let's take some
questions-- some push-back,

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.060
please?

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:34.779
AUDIENCE: So here in the office,
we're broken up between floor.

01:00:34.779 --> 01:00:35.570
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:37.610
AUDIENCE: And those correspond
to the different verticals

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:38.277
that we support.

01:00:38.277 --> 01:00:39.026
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yep.

01:00:39.026 --> 01:00:40.640
AUDIENCE: I'm across
North America.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.800
On my floor, there's
a lot of innovation

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.720
that happens because we
have a lot of freedom

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.920
to pitch an idea, pitch a
project, and run with it.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:53.510
And I'm wondering, given your
hypothesis and the studies

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:57.890
you've done, how can leaders
or owners of projects

01:00:57.890 --> 01:01:02.390
best identify these
opposite colors to best--

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.980
I guess, to make the best team?

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.771
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:01:04.771 --> 01:01:07.010
I think the easy answer
to that is see what people

01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:09.470
do under stress or duress.

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:11.975
And that was that kind
of throwaway slide I had.

01:01:11.975 --> 01:01:15.397
But if you've got somebody
who's primarily a sage,

01:01:15.397 --> 01:01:16.730
they're going to be extroverted.

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:18.530
And they're going to
be highly interactive.

01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:20.030
So when they have
a problem, they're

01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.580
going to consult
other people, right?

01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.646
When you've got somebody
who's an athlete, when they

01:01:25.646 --> 01:01:27.020
get a problem,
what they'll do is

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.430
they'll shut other people out.

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.170
They're the opposite
of team people.

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:31.610
They'll take a lot of ownership.

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:33.680
And they'll get rid of
things in their life.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.590
You'll notice it's
like spring cleaning.

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.650
And they'll focus on
one or two things.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:39.590
They're very goal-oriented.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:43.220
When you're looking at
somebody who's an engineer,

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.590
they'll want to go back
and look at the data.

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.810
And they'll think
sequentially about the data.

01:01:47.810 --> 01:01:49.670
And they'll think
about sort of combing

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:52.730
through where the error
was and how to appreciate,

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:53.660
how to fix the error.

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.784
And if you've got somebody
who's a green, they'll--

01:01:55.784 --> 01:01:58.370
what you'll see them do
is look for escape routes.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:59.420
They're kind of wiggly--

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:01.760
does this make sense-- because
they're very imaginative.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.930
They know how to tell a
tale in an interesting way.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:05.055
And they'll try and escape.

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.950
So when I look at
people, one of the things

01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:08.780
I pay close attention
to is what do people

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.670
do when they're stressed out.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:12.149
Does this make sense to you?

01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:14.190
And if you really want to
make things successful,

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.915
I think the big thing is, what
do we constitute as success?

01:02:16.915 --> 01:02:19.610
So one of the things I notice
in places like Google is people,

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.109
when they do a small
experiment, are

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:24.649
highly successful because
it's very artist organization.

01:02:24.649 --> 01:02:25.940
The real question becomes what?

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:28.370
How does that make it into
something that's scalable?

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.900
And the irony of Google is what?

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:32.180
And this is sort of
the hard truth of this.

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.890
You have all these
different businesses.

01:02:33.890 --> 01:02:35.950
How many make money?

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:37.570
How many of the
businesses make money?

01:02:37.570 --> 01:02:38.840
Is everybody following this?

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:39.340
Yeah.

01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:40.714
Don't think we
don't know, right?

01:02:40.714 --> 01:02:43.950
And the notion is those are
places that effectively engage

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:46.260
the reds and the blues, right?

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.660
So there's got to be a place,
and this was the problem

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.405
when I was young in my--

01:02:50.405 --> 01:02:51.780
I was an advisor
to what's called

01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:53.730
applied integrated
systems at Apple.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.620
The problem with Apple
in the beginning days

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:57.661
was it was very much like
here, but they couldn't

01:02:57.661 --> 01:02:58.710
figure how to make money.

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:00.570
They couldn't figure out how
to get quality sorted out.

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:01.700
Does this make sense?

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.450
So when Jobs came back,
what did he learn?

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:06.130
He learned how to make money
and get quality sorted out.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.740
So this is the issue of--

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.730
it can be successful.

01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:11.169
But to be successful all
the way through the cycle,

01:03:11.169 --> 01:03:12.960
you have to look for
these different types.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.780
Now, there's a place in the
book you can go and take

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.680
the assessment.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.780
There's all kinds
of material online.

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.390
If you go to innovatrium.org
or jeffdegraff.com,

01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:22.960
there's tons of stuff.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.710
I think I've written
over the years, like,

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.220
800 articles, a lot of books.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.457
And there's a lot
of tools on there.

01:03:28.457 --> 01:03:29.790
And no one will ever bother you.

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.650
But the notion is if you want
to do something more with it,

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:32.780
there's a way to do that.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.870
But there's a card game--

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:35.510
AUDIENCE: My favorite
was the cards.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.710
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:36.150
I could give some--

01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:37.830
I have some card
games if you want a--

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.540
I'll give you a card game
when we're done here.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.490
And what's fun about the card
game is just to ask a person,

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:42.160
pick a card.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.880
Tell me what you're
insanely great at.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.450
And people are
pretty self-aware.

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.740
They'll go, I'm
insanely great at this.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:47.340
Go, great.

01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.120
That's great.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.717
Have someone else pick a card.

01:03:49.717 --> 01:03:50.550
You're the opposite.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:50.850
OK.

01:03:50.850 --> 01:03:52.410
The two of you are now
going to work on this.

01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.180
Now, here's the challenge,
the real challenge,

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.190
because we do this every
day in the innovation labs,

01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.315
some of the biggest
innovations people write about.

01:03:58.315 --> 01:04:00.300
The biggest challenge
is keeping the conflict

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:01.877
constructive, right?

01:04:01.877 --> 01:04:03.210
And I'll put it to you this way.

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:05.460
I have what I call big Jeff
days and little Jeff days.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.747
Big Jeff days, I'm very open
to constructive conflict.

01:04:07.747 --> 01:04:09.580
Little Jeff days-- you
ever get in that mood

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:12.000
where you're like, oh, god,
I can't deal with this person

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.720
today?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.006
Now-- and I'm not rude.

01:04:14.006 --> 01:04:15.880
And I'm not going to
fight in a negative way.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.046
I'm just going to disengage.

01:04:17.046 --> 01:04:20.010
I'm going to say,
today, today, there's

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:21.900
a lot stuff going on in my life.

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:22.714
And I love you.

01:04:22.714 --> 01:04:23.880
And I want to work with you.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:27.050
But today, I'm taking a holiday.

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.570
I'm getting off the grid today.

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.240
So part of it is
knowing to do that.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.906
I think it's also a
good life skill when

01:04:31.906 --> 01:04:33.899
you have a partner, right?

01:04:33.899 --> 01:04:34.440
Someone else?

01:04:36.987 --> 01:04:37.570
AUDIENCE: Hey.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.110
So you talked a lot about
the power of tension

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.730
and the creative power
of constructive conflict.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.790
And I think most
people would agree

01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:47.627
that America is in a
heightened state of tension

01:04:47.627 --> 01:04:48.460
and divide nowadays.

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:48.770
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:49.560
It sure is.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:52.080
AUDIENCE: So I'm curious
what you would recommend,

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.350
or how can we harness
this tension productively?

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:58.920
JEFF DEGRAFF: I think it's sort
of the opposite of the bell

01:04:58.920 --> 01:04:59.850
curve.

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.310
I think what's happening
is actually twofold.

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.400
First of all, I
think the conflict

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.890
that we're having is
a conflict that we've

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.500
needed to have since the 1980s.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.230
And the way I would
characterize the conflict

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:15.339
is when I looked at the--
before the election,

01:05:15.339 --> 01:05:17.130
I was at one of the
big government agencies

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:18.237
giving this talk.

01:05:18.237 --> 01:05:19.820
And so I'm not trying
to be political.

01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:22.680
I'm trying to illuminate
something here.

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:25.110
And I said I thought that
Trump may very well win

01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:26.895
the election, which, of course,
was contrary to what everybody

01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:26.990
said.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.720
And they said, why?

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.070
And I said, think of bell curve.

01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:32.660
Who got blown out after
the '08 recession?

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.190
There were four groups
that got blown out.

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.810
The first group
were young people.

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:37.820
You guys got blown out.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:38.650
It was bad.

01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:39.870
It was really bad.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.690
The second was old people
who were on retirement.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:44.040
They got blown out.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.605
And I-- the penny
dropped when I was at a--

01:05:46.605 --> 01:05:50.040
I walked by a Bernie
rally here on campus.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.940
And I'd never seen young
people with old people before.

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.769
This was like-- and
I pay attention.

01:05:55.769 --> 01:05:57.810
I'm one of those guys who
pays a lot of attention

01:05:57.810 --> 01:06:00.125
to incongruities--
and went, wow.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:01.000
Well, think about it.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.291
Those are two groups that
are one end of the bell curve

01:06:03.291 --> 01:06:04.260
that get blown out.

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:07.500
The other groups that got
blown out were people of color.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.100
All right.

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.460
Think about all the groups
in the United States.

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.680
And a lot of those
groups didn't vote.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.360
They disengaged, right?

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.610
Look at the numbers.

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:18.687
And then I need you
to think about people

01:06:18.687 --> 01:06:20.520
who look like me, who
are from neighborhoods

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.170
like where I'm from.

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:24.810
And they've been downwardly
mobile since about '83.

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:27.350
And the notion is their
real economic power,

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.640
their lack of education,
their mortality rate--

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.070
look at anything right
now in those numbers.

01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:33.540
And they were really mad.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:37.436
Out of all of those groups,
only one of them voted.

01:06:37.436 --> 01:06:38.310
Does this make sense?

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.650
And they voted big, right?

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:43.800
So when we start looking at
the numbers, what I looked at

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.377
was who's actually
going to act, which

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:47.460
is an innovation question.

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:48.330
Is this making sense to you?

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:48.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.135
JEFF DEGRAFF: So
now the opposite

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:51.760
of that is how this
will come together

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.070
is you start looking at the
middle of the bell curve.

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.480
And you draw a line.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:57.090
What's happening is
reasonable people,

01:06:57.090 --> 01:06:59.550
which constitute about
the 80% of the middle,

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:01.080
are starting to
talk to each other.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.996
So you think about being
in a business school,

01:07:02.996 --> 01:07:05.220
business school's filled
with a lot of University

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.410
of Chicago people,
very conservative--

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:09.660
they read "The Economist"
every day and the "Journal."

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:11.340
It's a little right for me.

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.260
And then there's other
people in the school--

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.690
read "The Times"
every day, "Bloomberg"

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:17.130
every day-- a little left.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:18.040
I read the "Post."

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040
I'm kind of a down the--

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.464
I'm sort of that
guy, down the middle.

01:07:21.464 --> 01:07:23.130
But the notion is
you're starting to see

01:07:23.130 --> 01:07:25.319
those people come together.

01:07:25.319 --> 01:07:27.110
The majority-- is this
making sense to you?

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:27.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.410
JEFF DEGRAFF: And
they're starting to say,

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:30.270
we're going to have to take
care of some of these things

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:31.980
that we haven't taken care of.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.260
So there are issues of--
there are social issues.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.530
And there are economic issues.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:37.000
And both of those issues--

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.970
I believe what you're starting
to see is that come together.

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:41.800
I think what'll
happen is this will

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:45.850
be horribly painful for the
next 18 months for both sides.

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:47.350
Nobody's going to win this.

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.442
But it's a kitchen.

01:07:49.442 --> 01:07:51.400
It should have started
as a kitchen discussion.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.920
And it's now a fight that's
kind of calming down.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.470
That's my interpretation
of what's happening.

01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:59.320
And I think at the end
of this, and that this

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.890
is-- because remember, conflict,
even if it's not constructive,

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:05.080
will often result in innovation.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.070
I think we will have
to get to a new place.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:09.417
Is everybody following this?

01:08:09.417 --> 01:08:10.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.010
JEFF DEGRAFF: So
that's my take on it.

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:15.840
But I can imagine being young
and seeing this rinkside.

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:19.660
It's not any-- and it's--

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.450
when people compare this to--

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:26.939
just drop the comparisons
to Hitler or to Watergate.

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:28.930
This is a whole
different animal.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:32.109
And I think a lot of those
metaphors or analogies are--

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:33.036
don't work.

01:08:33.036 --> 01:08:34.660
I think we're looking
at a world that's

01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.830
connected both vertically
and horizontally.

01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:38.979
And I think the horizontal
connections are so much

01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:40.210
stronger in your generation.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:42.120
I think it's going
to be very different.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:44.543
JEFF DEGRAFF: Anyone else?

01:08:47.410 --> 01:08:48.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:51.630
What's your perspective
on the historical cycles

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:53.939
of innovation?

01:08:53.939 --> 01:08:57.450
Even in terms of nostalgia,
as an example, this year,

01:08:57.450 --> 01:09:01.170
with all this turmoil, people
are looking back to the 1980s,

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:02.410
things like that.

01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:02.660
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.210
AUDIENCE: What do you think
about as the decade's best?

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:04.380
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.510
I'd like to say that I
don't think they exist,

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.850
but I do think they exist.

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:13.080
Here's-- there's a very
famous book written at the end

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:17.563
of the 1800s by Oswald Spengler.

01:09:17.563 --> 01:09:19.229
And Spengler basically--
it's a-- book's

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:21.120
called "The Decline
of the West."

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.630
And Spengler is this German
academic who basically gets it.

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:27.449
He's really-- he starts
showing what's going to happen.

01:09:27.449 --> 01:09:29.490
And what's amazing is he
predicts the First World

01:09:29.490 --> 01:09:31.050
War and the Second World War.

01:09:31.050 --> 01:09:33.000
And the reason he predicts them
is he understands the cycle.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.200
So he's looking at cycles.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.930
And economies happen in cycles.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:39.510
So the part that I
would say I disagree

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:42.210
is that we're in a very
different accelerated age

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:45.390
with all of this horizontal,
what I call longitude,

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:49.170
connection, the network world,
Niall Ferguson's new book,

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:51.609
"The Square and the
Tower," that stuff.

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:53.876
And I think that's true,
at least to some degree.

01:09:53.876 --> 01:09:55.500
I think the other--
but the other thing

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.160
is human nature's human nature.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.700
And what happens in human nature
is you develop a theory of--

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.510
a new theory of governance.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:08.280
And over time, that theory
decays into the very thing

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.120
it tried not to do.

01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:10.590
This is what Weber wrote about.

01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:13.207
"Nineteen Eighty-Four"-- this
is what Orwell wrote about.

01:10:13.207 --> 01:10:14.790
The animals are all
going to be equal.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.770
And then they become
Stalinist, right?

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.030
Does this make sense to you?

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:21.360
So yes, I think there
is something to cycles.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.980
I think predicting--
when people start

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.900
predicting how many years
they're going to be,

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.450
like the Russians do, or
how big they're going to be,

01:10:27.450 --> 01:10:29.460
then I think it
gets a little iffy.

01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.140
Am I making sense?

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:35.020
So in summary, yes, I
think there are cycles.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.260
But I think the cycles are
a little less predictive

01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:38.520
than people think they are.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.230
Did I answer your question?

01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:40.990
What do you think?

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:41.970
That's my question.

01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:43.500
What do you think?

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.810
AUDIENCE: I think that
when innovation happens,

01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:49.710
for a few years, people accept
that all this change happened

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:52.620
and then maybe calm
down for a few years

01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:54.990
because they're riding the
wave of the changes that

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:57.660
took place, technology birth.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:59.580
JEFF DEGRAFF: Did you read--

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:00.960
the woman's name is Jackson.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.030
She's the president of
Rensselaer Polytechnic.

01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:08.700
Did you read her book
on innovation cycles?

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.200
She basically
points something out

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.330
that I think is very damning.

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:15.180
She said that most of the
wave, which your company was

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:17.070
built on, was--

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.310
sort of ended in the mid-'90s,
and that what we've been doing

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.165
is iterations of that
wave for a long time.

01:11:23.165 --> 01:11:24.540
And I know that
when people start

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.240
talking about collaborative,
open, innovation networks--

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.940
I worked on Apple Net,
which became iTunes.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:32.710
That's, what, '84, '85, right?

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:35.730
You start thinking about what
people talk about is now.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:38.700
The Innovatrium was built
10 years before WeWork.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.010
So the notion is when
you start looking

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:43.810
at where the genesis of things
are and you-- particularly, you

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:45.060
know where this is really fun?

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:46.710
Music, right?

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:48.350
I grew up in the '70s.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:50.130
I went to high
school in the '70s.

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:52.327
And people say,
well, what happened?

01:11:52.327 --> 01:11:54.660
You give all the music genres
that people listen to now.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:56.076
And they all
happened in the '70s.

01:11:56.076 --> 01:11:57.300
Is this making sense to you?

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:59.400
So the '90s-- the
'90s for technology,

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.520
'70s for music-- the issue
becomes, at what point is

01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.010
that long cycle done, right?

01:12:05.010 --> 01:12:07.050
And usually, it has to
be disrupted to be done.

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:09.072
But you're-- I think
you're seeing disruption.

01:12:09.072 --> 01:12:10.530
I come back to what
I talked about.

01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:11.946
Maybe you weren't
in the room-- we

01:12:11.946 --> 01:12:14.280
were talking about
disruption of institutions.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.630
Marriage is different now.

01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:17.520
Religion is different now.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.900
What work is is different now.

01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:20.820
Universities will
soon be different now.

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:21.780
Trust me, they will.

01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:23.530
Medicine will be different now.

01:12:23.530 --> 01:12:26.625
And I think those are
more subtle long cycles.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:27.420
Anyone else?

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:31.980
One more.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:33.480
AUDIENCE: Kind of
going back to what

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.300
you're talking about with
contrarian indicators

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.880
and how you saw that these
companies far outperformed

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.610
any others, I was wondering
if you any insight as to how

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:44.400
we can distill that down and
take that back to our teams,

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.897
put that to work for us?

01:12:45.897 --> 01:12:47.730
JEFF DEGRAFF: I think
what I would recommend

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:49.620
is I'd read the book, right?

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:53.670
And I'd say one of the things
that the book will give you

01:12:53.670 --> 01:12:54.572
clues about--

01:12:54.572 --> 01:12:56.280
some of this-- obviously,
I can't open up

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.780
the whole can of worms here.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.550
So I don't want
over-commit to something.

01:12:59.550 --> 01:13:02.940
But you'll notice that there
are a list of attributes that

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:05.430
could easily be turned
into key indicators

01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:06.522
that you could follow.

01:13:06.522 --> 01:13:08.730
And then I'd ask you to do
some of your own research,

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:10.830
to saying if you get some
of these contrarian key

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:13.410
indicators, and I think in--

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:13.950
pardon?

01:13:13.950 --> 01:13:14.783
Can you answer that?

01:13:14.783 --> 01:13:16.329
Yeah.

01:13:16.329 --> 01:13:17.120
STANEY DEGRAFF: OK.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.100
I can speak a little
bit toward that.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:24.310
So we wanted to see if the
culture differences in the four

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:27.010
quadrants, the four
colors, would appear also

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:28.220
in company performances.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.390
So we looked through
20 years of data.

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:34.450
But what's interesting to me--
when we looked at the companies

01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:36.490
who do well over the--

01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:39.940
again, it's like they
do well, red and green,

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:41.080
and then blue and yellow.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.720
And when four of them are--
showed up at the same time,

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.650
that's better.

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:46.990
So you can be very good at blue.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:48.870
And you can be
very good at green.

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:50.140
You can be good at red.

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.630
But when you're good
at both, your value--

01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:53.950
it's multiplied.

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:55.400
That's what I'm trying to say.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.650
So what does that mean?

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.040
When I saw the data, the
data, the hard data, actually,

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.190
is telling me that you have
to have your basics down.

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:04.330
And this especially good
for you guys, for Google,

01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:06.880
because you are
based on algorithm.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:09.250
So your reds have to
be very, very strong.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:10.750
But then on top
of that, you have

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:16.040
to have these loose process,
these groups of people

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:19.680
who can take it to the next
place to look at future growth.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.970
But it is in this combinations,
I think, in particular more,

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:28.060
from my research-- look much
more relevant and much more

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:29.630
vibrant than the--

01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:31.940
the blue and yellows
have to hold it together.

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.977
But for me, what I saw
mostly is the red and green.

01:14:34.977 --> 01:14:37.060
JEFF DEGRAFF: I also think
if you go back and look

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:40.120
at some of the earlier
books that I've done,

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.690
there's a lot of clues in there
about very specific things

01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:44.750
to measure.

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:46.270
Obviously, it gets a little--

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:49.970
we're making this overly simple
to make the concept accessible

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:51.799
because there's a lot
of interdependencies.

01:14:51.799 --> 01:14:53.590
There's a lot of
complexity under the hood,

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.340
just like your business, right?

01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.570
And some of the stuff is of
great interest to Wall Street

01:14:58.570 --> 01:14:59.780
and not to normal people.

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.377
And some stuff's more interest
to people who are governance.

01:15:02.377 --> 01:15:04.210
If you read the book,
and then the next step

01:15:04.210 --> 01:15:06.376
is maybe read this book,
"Leading Innovation," which

01:15:06.376 --> 01:15:07.050
I wrote--

01:15:07.050 --> 01:15:09.850
I don't know-- 15 years ago,
then I think the interesting

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.560
thing would be-- then
if you have some--

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.550
you run it for a while.

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.800
I'd be interested to see how--

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.550
I'd be interested in hearing
from you what happens.

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:17.770
What'd you find, right?

01:15:17.770 --> 01:15:20.221
That would be of interest to me.

01:15:20.221 --> 01:15:22.615
AUDIENCE: "Making Stone Soup"
has a really great formula,

01:15:22.615 --> 01:15:23.115
too.

01:15:23.115 --> 01:15:23.906
JEFF DEGRAFF: Yeah.

01:15:23.906 --> 01:15:27.220
There's a thin book that
we wrote for jump-starting

01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:27.970
in the labs.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:29.230
I don't know if you know this.

01:15:29.230 --> 01:15:31.060
The University of Michigan
has a certified professional

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.852
innovator program,
which we created, right?

01:15:32.852 --> 01:15:35.101
So that's the first certificate
program they ever did.

01:15:35.101 --> 01:15:37.180
It's through the School
of Engineering, right?

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.350
We wrote a book for it
called "Making Stone Soup."

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:40.295
And it's a--

01:15:40.295 --> 01:15:45.570
I think it's, like,
$7 and on Android.

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:47.420
But it's a great way to start.

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:48.670
That's a great point, Lindsey.

01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:49.840
It's a great way to start.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.370
It's easy.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:51.820
It's easy way to start.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.730
So like I said, the
challenge of this

01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:56.110
is it's so easy
that people think

01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.990
it's like a DISC test
or a Myers-Briggs test.

01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:01.090
The challenge is if
you start going down

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.770
that road, what I'm
suggesting to you

01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:04.480
is you start by-- a beginner.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.180
You read as a beginner.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.180
But if you want to go all
the way down the road,

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.721
that's something you can do also
with just the resources that

01:16:10.721 --> 01:16:11.870
are publicly available.

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:15.830
It can get a lot more
sophisticated a lot faster.

01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:16.910
Anything else?

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:17.420
Thank you.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.240
I appreciate you hanging
out of here to the end.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.530
And good luck with all this.

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:22.840
And thanks for having us out.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.490
[APPLAUSE]
