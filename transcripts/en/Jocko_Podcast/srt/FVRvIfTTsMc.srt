1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,100
Jocko and Leif, how do you know
if you terminated too early?

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,120
I wanted to remove the toxicity
before damaged the team.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,910
When do you know it's
time to fire someone?

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,330
So we'll get into a little
little change in pace here,

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,570
going from the darkness of the Islamic
state into something a lot more positive,

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,740
which is people run in businesses.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,580
And it's good to clarify that because
terminated as a different context and my

8
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,890
gravy, it's, so,

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,840
this is a good question and it's something
we hear a lot and we got a ton of

10
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:37,920
questions when I put this out. So what
do you know? It's time to fire somebody.

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,750
We get this question all the
time, as you just said. And it's,

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,430
this was always the most difficult thing
and it is incredibly difficult even for,

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,270
you know, people who feel like they're
super, super tough leaders, uh,

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,190
are strong leaders in the seal teams who
have been through all our training and,

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,030
and uh, and have proven themselves on the
battlefield. It's hard to fire people.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,500
It's always difficult to fire people.

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,220
It's hard to have those tough
conversations with folks. And so, uh,

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,010
we've talked,
we talk about this,

19
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,670
that the right time to fire somebody
is when you don't feel bad about it.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,100
And what I mean by that, I don't mean
just because you're cold blooded,

21
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,390
but that you actually, uh, but that's,

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,400
you actually have taken every step to
mentor and train and provide resources

23
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,420
and, and, uh,

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,310
help that person achieve the performance
that you need them to achieve in order

25
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:35,040
to accomplish the mission. And you've
given them every chance to succeed.

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,460
And once you, you, you should feel
absolutely confident that you've, you've,

27
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,520
you've exhausted all options and then
you're not going to feel bad about it

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,290
cause you've,
you've,

29
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,400
you've taken so much time and effort
and they shouldn't even, they,

30
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,840
they're not even going
to be upset about it.

31
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,990
Not that they necessarily love
you or thank you for firing them.

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,860
But so often you see people that are
literally relieved when we work with

33
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:57,000
companies and we see this happen,

34
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,330
we see people that are relieved because
they're in a position where they just,

35
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,250
they're overwhelmed. There's
massive pressure on them.
And they knew there it was.

36
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,670
It was beyond their capability and they
just didn't want to say, I can't do this.

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,540
And so when they got either fired or
just transitioned to a different role,

38
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,470
it was real. They were relieved and they
said, thank you. And I, it really was,

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,100
that was really eating at me that I,
I didn't feel capable and I didn't feel,

40
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,370
I knew I was letting the team down.
Uh, and that's almost always the case.

41
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:26,310
Every once in a while you get the
torture genius who is just can't take

42
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:29,250
direction or won't listen.
Um, who's never going to see,

43
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,690
never going to see that I'd had,
but that's okay. It's okay. Yeah.

44
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,220
The only other thing I'd say is laying
out the real crystal clear expectations

45
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:42,120
of where you need to be. Hey, if this is
what you, there's where you need to be.

46
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
And if you don't get there,
this is what's going to happen.

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,510
And that's why you said it shouldn't
be a surprise. It should be, hey,

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,550
I knew exactly what the expectations were.

49
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,690
I knew exactly what was required of me
and I knew exactly what was going to

50
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:56,040
happen if I didn't meet those
expectations or requirements.

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,500
So that's how you know.

52
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,190
And the only other thing is we
sometimes it's totally normal.

53
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,220
We build a relationship with our people.

54
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,580
And so sometimes that relationship gets
strong to the point where you might

55
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:17,341
value that relationship more than you
value the performance of the team,

56
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,190
then that is not a good situation because
you have to look out for the whole

57
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:25,240
team. And if I say, Oh, this guy's
not doing his job, but he's my bro,

58
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:27,790
so I'm going to keep them on,
I'm letting down the whole team.

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,930
So that's just another little element
that you have to pay attention to.

60
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,530
And if you truly care about the
person, mentor them, coach them,

61
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,350
put them into position
where they can succeed.

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,450
Sometimes people aren't good at something
and you've got to move them to a spot

63
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:40,961
where they can,

64
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:43,570
you can take advantage of their strengths
instead of putting him in a spot where

65
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,570
their weaknesses are going
to be totally exposed.

66
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,830
That's how you take care of someone.

67
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,190
So that's what you gotta do
before you fire somebody.

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,940
One thing too that I learned
from you in, in, in the navy, uh,

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,080
during our time was when you
had those tough conversations,

70
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,850
you got to write it down. You
have to write it down. And
that's something that, uh,

71
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,480
I, I thought was very powerful because
so often even in the seal teams,

72
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:11,170
you'd see leaders who would say, well,
this leader screwed up, you know,

73
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:13,900
this platoon commander or this
chiefs got an issue and we need to,

74
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,040
he's causing the,
you know,

75
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,150
he's dangerous or he's
making bad decisions or he's
unprofessional, or, uh, he's,

76
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,670
you know, he's, he's not getting his
unit where, where they need to be and,

77
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,910
and we need to call them
in and tighten him up.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,740
And you'd have that conversation behind
closed doors when the person isn't

79
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,830
present and you're like, right on, let's
call them in, let's tighten them up.

80
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,060
You come in, they sit down and here
you are face to face with that person.

81
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:40,150
And you just had that closed
her conversation about
how terrible they were and

82
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:41,620
how they really needed,
you know, we're going to,

83
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:45,100
we're going to square them away and now
face to face the conversation goes like

84
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:48,490
this. Well, you're doing,
you're doing a pretty good job,

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,620
you're doing a pretty good job overall.

86
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,660
There's a couple things we need to
work on here or there, but, you know,

87
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:57,220
maybe not here. And, uh, I,
I think that's, uh, that's,
that doesn't help anyway.

88
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,730
That's the false cheerleading
is a disaster. And, um,

89
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,040
it's something that we talk about
all the time and our business,

90
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:07,060
I'm sure you've mentioned
that on the podcast a, you
know, many times before, but,

91
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,460
uh, when you write it down,
you have it in front of you.

92
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,190
So you have to have that tough
conversation and you give them a copy.

93
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,600
So they have it with them as well.

94
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:16,870
And then they can take that and understand
where they need to be and when they

95
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:20,680
need to be there. And, uh, and that forces
you to have those tough conversations.

96
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,630
It's a, it's, it's absolutely
a game changer and makes
you, makes you address that.

97
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,760
And then again,
the false cheerleading is a disaster.

98
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,840
People then when you add to fire
someone and they're like, wait,

99
00:05:30,841 --> 00:05:32,110
you just said I was doing a good job.

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,890
So obviously you failed
as a leader in another,

101
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,130
another good thing you can do to soften
the blow of this stuff when you're,

102
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,630
when you're delivering the heavy news is
you're saying, listen, I wrote this down.

103
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,000
I can put this in front of you.
Why am I doing that?

104
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,320
Because I think you can do it. I want
you to do it. I'm investing in you.

105
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,140
This is not my way to,
to make you feel bad.

106
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:57,350
This is my way to make you get better.
I want you to do better. So here's I,

107
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,530
here's what you gotta do for me.
Here it is in plain English.

108
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,560
Do you understand this bullet point?
Do you understand this bullet point?

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,120
Do you understand this bullet point?

110
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,150
That's the best possible
thing you can do and,

111
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,120
and you've got to make them understand
that cause otherwise they'll walk out of

112
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,520
the room saying, all he's picking on me,
he doesn't like me. No, no, no, no, no.

113
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,430
The opposite is true. If I didn't
like you, I would just fire you.

114
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,620
I want you to perform.
I'm mentoring you.

115
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,540
I'm coaching you cause
I want you to do better.

116
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm giving you this list so you know
exactly what you have to do to win.

117
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,720
So don't take it the wrong way.

118
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:31,700
My brother just get in the game
and get this stuff done. Hey,

119
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:35,800
do you think, cause I remember you
saying this evening Echo, good evening.

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,290
I remember you saying this to to jade.
Remember you were like,

121
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,410
you were like when you don't feel, I don't
know if you put in those exact words,

122
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:43,580
but that's basically the message.

123
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:46,520
Exactly what they said when you don't feel
bad about it, you guys both know. Yup.

124
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,733
Yup.
Deep.

125
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,260
Do you think that there's a difference
between like the seal teams for example,

126
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:55,760
because you can't just, well, I'm
assuming you can't just replace the guy,

127
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:59,270
so it's like it's worth it to
invest as much as you possibly can.

128
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:02,240
[inaudible] world and the seal teams,
I thought this would be different.

129
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,970
They're not different. They're the
same. So in the civilian world,

130
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:08,450
every company would go work with,
doesn't matter what the company is there,

131
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,220
there's no immediate replacement.

132
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,760
For somebody that knows a skill
set for a software engineer,

133
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,770
is there a great guy waiting
to come in the door? No.

134
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,050
Is there a great welder waiting
to come to the door? No.

135
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,540
Is there that just no matter
what these things are,

136
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,140
there's not a perfect
replacement coming from,

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,080
it's the same thing in the seal teams.

138
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,210
You don't have a ready
replacement ready to come in.

139
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,110
So of course you've got a person, you've
gone through the agony of finding them,

140
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,760
you've gone through the
agony of recruiting them.

141
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:35,630
You've gone through the agony of bringing
them on board, issuing them their gear,

142
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,710
getting them their computer,
letting them understand the, the,

143
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,310
the culture of the company.
I've done, I've been, you've
already invested so much.

144
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,040
You don't want to just fire the person.
You want them to work out.

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,950
And so that's why it's important on either
military and civilian. You've got, um,

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,750
you've made those investments. The, the
best outcome is to have them succeed.

147
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,280
That's always the best outcome.

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,630
And so that's why you've got to be a great
mentor, a great coach, a great leader.

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,390
And I've talked about this before.
I'm not going to go into right now,

150
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:05,540
but some people are allergic to the word
mentor and some people are allergic to

151
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:10,280
the word coach. You get some with
an ego problem. And I go, Hey,

152
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,920
life, welcome to the platoon. I'm
gonna go ahead and mentor you.

153
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,930
You know what I mean? I
don't need you to. So, so,

154
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,590
so there's a lot of people
that they think, you know,

155
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:21,110
that offends them because that implies,
I've said this before,

156
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,840
that implies that I know more than you do.
And you know,

157
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:27,790
less than me and I'm the big guy that's
going to help you, little guy. Yeah.

158
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,780
So sometimes that direct kind of coaching
is not the right answer, but you know,

159
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,790
clearly when you're getting to a
point where someone's getting fired,

160
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,120
you need to do some direct coaching.
So that's why we're right now.

161
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,170
We're getting it done correctly at one.
One more point on that, which is a great,

162
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,910
uh, a great question, a cobot, but it's,
that's the easiest, I think, fall back.

163
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,350
And we see that with a lot of leaders.
I've seen,

164
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:50,460
we saw it in the military and
we see it throughout, you know,

165
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,350
companies and organization that we work
with now. Oftentimes it's people that,

166
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,520
well, this person isn't good enough. I
need to fire them and get someone else.

167
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,870
And it, almost, most of the time, that's
not the case. Most of the time it's,

168
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
they just need to be led.
They need to be led.

169
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,410
They need to have the mission better
explained to them. They need to have,

170
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,491
you know,
the training.

171
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:11,400
They need to have a better resource
and they need to have mentorship. Uh,

172
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,070
it just as Jack was talking about. And
so that's, that's an easy fallback,

173
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,810
but it's,
it's an,

174
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,200
it's an excuse and it's the opposite of
extreme ownership and really only the

175
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:22,670
case of that tortured genius, right?
That, that, that we wrote about the,

176
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,850
the person that just cannot take
any direction no matter how, uh,

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,770
how valid, uh, our, our,
uh, our positive, uh,

178
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,590
needed or they can't take any criticism,
they won't accept any responsibility.

179
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,840
They have it all figured out.

180
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,490
The world just can't see the
genius in what they do. You know,

181
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,630
that's kind of how they look at things.

182
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,830
That's the only time that you really have
to fire those, those folks generally.

183
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,240
Yeah. The, and the, the thing
you didn't say, you hit like
four points. You want to,

184
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,950
one of the best places to start,

185
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,930
if someone's not doing what they're
supposed to be doing is explaining to them

186
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:54,900
why they're doing it. Well, this
is why I want you to do this.

187
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,320
Because then they can absorb it.
They understand what the deep mission is.

188
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,670
They understand kind of
the commander's intent.

189
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,020
So whenever someone's not doing
this, and I, you know what,

190
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,880
I'm going to go ahead and
break out a story right now.

191
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,490
So I got a seven year old daughter.
She can't ride a bike yet,

192
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,800
right? That's not good. You should
be riding a bike at four. Right?

193
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,590
And my family is four, so she can't
ride a bike yet. We're not too. So,

194
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,060
and she's, and it's become a
thing. It's become an issue, right?

195
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,950
So the other day,

196
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,550
and we're going on a big camping trip
and it's going to be necessity to be able

197
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,220
to ride the bike. So the other
day I started telling you, okay,

198
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,800
we got to go work on your bike riding.
So I'm gonna come get your shoes on,

199
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,770
get ready to grow. And she immediately
goes defensive. I don't know.

200
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,930
I don't want to ride a bike. I can't
ride a bike. I'm not good at. Right.

201
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,080
And I started getting right. You
know, no, listen, get your shoes on.

202
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,870
I went that route like an idiot.
And I,

203
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,860
luckily I didn't go too far down that
road and I just stopped myself after two

204
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:54,210
direct orders with no explanation
of why. And I said, hey sweetie,

205
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:57,030
we're going to go work on your bike ride.
Let me tell you why.

206
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,400
Because when we go camping,

207
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,340
almost everywhere we're going to be
going is going to be on the bike,

208
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,390
especially when it's time to
bike ride to go get an ice cream.

209
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,450
We're going to have to ride
bikes to get ice cream and,

210
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,900
and so all I want to make sure that
you're able to come with us when we go to

211
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,780
get ice cream. You know, I mean, I don't
want to have to bring it back for you.

212
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:18,030
I want you to come with us
and you could see, you know,

213
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:22,740
I just completely to change
attack. And she was said, you know,

214
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,510
okay,
let me get my shoes on.

215
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,620
And literally that's an example with a
seven year old, right? And first of all,

216
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,621
the first note there is that I most are
big leadership expert completely went

217
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:35,910
down the wrong road and was like,

218
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:39,420
listen to me because I'm the father
and I know you do what I tell you.

219
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,640
It's the wrong approach 100% of the time.

220
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:44,610
Even when the seven year old and as
soon as I went back and said, hey,

221
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,470
here's why I want you to end, you know,
I told her a bunch of other things,

222
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,530
you know, it's really good at this
is how we're going to do get around.

223
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,420
This is how you can get around the beach
and all these things and changed her

224
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:54,730
attitude. It literally changed
her attitude in a minute.

225
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,670
I wish I would have videotaped the whole
thing cause we could have posted it.

226
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,570
Yup. Yeah. That would've been
a good little case study. Yeah.

227
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,470
Flying through with the ice cream money.
The would you say back to the, the high,

228
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,930
the hiring and people,
you know,

229
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,990
you don't have just someone waiting
in the wings to get hired to fill that

230
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:15,870
position. Remember, um,
that kind of is the case.

231
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,750
Most of the time where if
you fire someone, it's like,
oh, we'll just replace him.

232
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,490
Right? All that work and stuff.
You got to rehire somebody,

233
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:28,690
been that you're wasting time
and resources to do that.

234
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,440
And you could just be investing
more in that guy. Always want your,

235
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,570
your team to succeed.
And sometimes people take that too far.

236
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,940
You get someone that just wants the
team to see why they're not gonna fire

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,810
somebody. So there's always
a balance. There's always
getting on me there. But yes,

238
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:45,000
that is true. So do you make the exception
if let's say, you know, let's say, hey,

239
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,150
I hired this. I don't know, you
weigh it. You weigh the pros.

240
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:53,020
So if you do have a guy kind of waiting
in the wings, I don't know my neighbor,

241
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,750
you know,
of course he's willing to say,

242
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,220
you're going to invest less than this
guy because we got this guy ready to go.

243
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:00,610
Well, no, you won't invest less.
You're not gonna invest anything.

244
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:02,680
If you've got someone that's going to
come in and do the job and this person

245
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,250
can't make it happen as failed, right.
Currently get rid of them. Yeah,

246
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,400
Jack,
there you go.
