The children clapped
their hands and cheered.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.540
Some of them laughed
until they cried.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.160
Tech White was surprised,

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.380
she'd never noticed how
funny safety tips could be.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.390
After the safety speech there
wasn't a single accident.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.630

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.100

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.790
I'm not going to give
any more speeches,

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.940

arrived at the police station.

drawing of an accident.

a note written on a paper star.

a big kiss on the nose.

a nice pat on the back.

&gt;&gt; Student: He had to earn it.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.760
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: We had to go to--
that's right, he had to earn it,

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.280
because every day we went
to school we had tests,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.000
like do you have tests
when you go to school?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.300
&gt;&gt; Student: No.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.600
&gt;&gt; Students: Yes.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.880
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Every day we
had tests, me and Hunter together,

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.360
had tests that we had to pass
and we had to get a good grade

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.610
because if we didn't get a
good grade then I wouldn't--

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.860
Hunter would not have passed and
he would not have got his badge,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.170
just like do you get
certificates at school?

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.470
&gt;&gt; Student: Yes.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:33.770
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Sometimes
when you do good work.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.430
That's what we have to do, we have
to make sure that our work was good

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.080
so that when we come
out on the street

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.700
to protect you all we know what
we're doing and we're certified

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.400
and that we did a good job.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.220
So that's how he got his badge
and that's how he started working.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.520
Yes?

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.100

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.010

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.970
&gt;&gt; Student: Does Hunter get Paid?

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:58.680
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: He does get
paid, I mean he gets food, that's--

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:04.080
that is a-- he doesn't get
money but Hunter enjoys his job

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.470
so every day he comes to work
it's like playing for him.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:12.270

reward and his treat, so.

go around and play

and he will steal the show a lot.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:39.180

Not a lot of tricks but he finds
things, that is his best trick.

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.070
the one thing that
he'll do is find--

00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:02.510
he'll find anything here on
Capitol Hill that may harm you

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.950
so that we can find it and get rid
of it so that you all will be safe,

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.260
so that's the biggest trick
that he does every day.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.490
Other than that, I mean he'll
shake your hand when you're ready

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.480
and you come around he'll
shake your pay if you want

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.140
to he'll shake your paw for you.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.960
And he's a retriever so every now
and then if you throw something

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.890
out he'll go get it, he'll go back
and retrieve it and bring it back.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.720

the tricks that he does.

Okay Hunter has a ball in his mouth
right now and when we find things

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.850
on the Hill, you asked me about
tricks, so when we come to work

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.250
and we find things sometimes
he'll get a special ball,

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.850
he'll get a special
treat, and he only gets

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.850
that when he finds harmful
things that will hurt people.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.310

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.370
if he finds it then he'll
get a special treat.

is his toy, he just likes it

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:00.700
or you go into the Burger King?

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.180 position:56%
Well Hunter will not just smell the
hamburger, he can smell the mustard,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.800
the mayonnaise, the pickle,
the ketchup, the cheese,

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.700
so he can break all that down.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.670
Sit. And so that is why his nose--

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:13.970
&gt;&gt; Renee White: I know I'm dirty.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.270
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: His nose is used

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.560
to help us find explosives
and things that blow up.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.960
So I help him get to where
he needs to go and we work

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.840
as a team together to find things.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.140
So.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.440
&gt;&gt; Renee White: You
see his little badge?

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.740
You get to see his
badge when you come up.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.900
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yeah,
he's moving a lot.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:36.140
&gt;&gt; Adult: [inaudible] test
people on the hill with Hunter

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.960
or is he only looking for things?

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.760
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: He's
only looking for things.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.670 position:56%
So he's only looking for explosives.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.340 position:56%
If you know what like bombs are,
things like that, those are the type

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:49.550
of things that me and Hunter go
and search for every day, so.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.950
He doesn't-- he doesn't work
on people but we do have dogs

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.540
that smell people themselves.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.850
They don't smell like sitting
objects like chairs and--

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:03.580
and cars and trucks; those are
the things that we look at.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.470
We look at cars, trucks, we go
in rooms, we go in buildings.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:10.720
But we have some dogs
who only sniff people.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.600
As you're walking by they might
sniff you but you're not supposed

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.450 position:56%
to pet them because they're working.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.510
&gt;&gt; Renee White: They're working.

[ Inaudible Response ]

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.340
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.640
&gt;&gt; Renee White: It was an-- yeah.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.940
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.240
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Uh-huh, yeah.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.540
&gt;&gt; Student: Where is--

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.610
what if Hunter finds a
person how can he tell you

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:36.330
that it's a person,
that it's a bad person?

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:38.420
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: That's
a very good question.

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.620
What he'll do is because we
spend so much time together

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.560
and we train together he'll give
me certain signs that tell me

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.440
and only the person who owns
him can pick up on that.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.360
So you wouldn't know because he's
not your dog but I would know.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.890
There'll be different
behavior changes.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.260
He may change his behavior
in one way or another.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.870
You know like when you're angry
you may go like this, you know,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.280
or when you're happy you smile,
so it's little things like that

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.110
that you can pick up that you
learned while you were in school

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.680
and that's how-- that's
how you're able to tell

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.130
if it's a bad person or not.

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:17.930
Yes sir?

[ Inaudible Response ]

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.290
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: That could be.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.000
It's very true.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:36.310
&gt;&gt; Adult: So when he retires
[inaudible] would you keep him

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.400
or someone else adopt
him [inaudible].

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.700
&gt;&gt; Renee White: No that's her dog.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.000
That's her dog.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.070
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: No, he'll--
when he retires he'll stay with me

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.400
and then I would get
assigned another dog.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.740
So, but he-- more than
likely he goes home

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.720
with the handler that has him.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.020
Yes ma'am.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.510
He's already a part of the
family so I can't let him go.

[ Laughter ]

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.900
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Yes ma'am?

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.200
&gt;&gt; Adult: Does he go
on vacation with you?

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.500
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: No.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.600
That's the only-- that's the
only time we're not together.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.460
We have department
issued space where we--

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.840
we leave them so they're cared for
by other members of the department.

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.060
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Yes ma'am.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.870
&gt;&gt; Adult: How do you all
determine, like because they're--

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.500
they're different breeds of--

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.430
they're different breeds
of police dogs

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.920
so how do you all determine
what breed is

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:40.890
for like a specific location
or a specific building,

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.530
like they have German
shepherds and--

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.460
I mean do you know what I'm saying?

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.760
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: No, I
understand what you're saying.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.750
We do have a lot of different
breeds of dogs but up here most

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.030
of them do all of the same work.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.300
The German shepherds do
the same thing as the labs,

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.190
as the retrievers, we're all
looking for the same thing.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:03.440 position:56%
The only difference is the dogs that
primarily are searching people most

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:06.290
of those are Labrador retrievers.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.080
But the German shepherds
do the same thing,

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.390
he does the same thing
as the German shepherds.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.690
&gt;&gt; Adult: Thank you.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:13.990
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: You're welcome.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:18.250
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Okay if we
don't have any other questions--

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:19.550
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: One
more, one more question.

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:20.850
&gt;&gt; Renee White: She got--

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:25.580
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: And form a line
and let you come and pet Hunter

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.090
and then we'll do a group
picture; is that okay Shawn?

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:34.190
So we'll do the petting
and then our photographer

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:40.080
and Sasha will help
put you all in a place

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.810
so we can do a big picture, okay.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.110
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Last question.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.410
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Alright can we
stand up then and form a line.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:49.710
Back there.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:51.010
&gt;&gt; Adult: Last question.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.690
&gt;&gt; Karen Jaffe: Okay,
one last question.

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.270
&gt;&gt; Adult: Why did you choose
to become a police officer?

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.570
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: That's good.

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:57.870
You can start.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.170
&gt;&gt; Renee White: Oh gosh
that's a good question.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.670 position:56%
I've been in this field for okay 18
years here, a total of over 25 years

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:08.920
but it's-- it's a-- it's a field
that's you get a lot of fulfillment

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.150
from it; it doesn't
seem like it but you do.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.360
You get to learn a lot of
things about people, behaviors,

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.440
and everything, meet and
greet people and kids.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.710
You get to go out and do community
service and stuff like that,

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.640
so it's enriching and it enhances
your personality and you're able

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.700
to go out there and speak and
teach people all walks of the world

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.650
because that's what we
see up here on the hill;

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.950
we see everyone [laughs].

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:36.380
And so that helped me a lot.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.070
&gt;&gt; Tiffany White: Prior to becoming
a police officer I spent a lot

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:45.040
of time behind a desk and in a
lab; I went to school for biology

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.570
and I decided that that wasn't
exactly what I wanted to do.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.650
So I wanted to be more
out in the public

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:56.580
and help people and
be more hands on.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.530
So that's how I chose the career
field of becoming a police officer

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.970
and it's been very rewarding and
fulfilling ever since so I'm glad

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:11.040
that I chose it and no
more labs for me for now.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.340
So.
