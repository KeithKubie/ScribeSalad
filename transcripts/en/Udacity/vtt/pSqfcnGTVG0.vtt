00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.900
So we're not through with the amazing story

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.290
of the CCR5 delta 32 allele yet. Another

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.910
really interesting fact about it, is now it's

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.410
believed that the CCR5 delta 32 recessive allele also

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.640
conferred resistance to the Bubonic plague during the

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.560
pandemic known as The Black Death which struck Europe

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.390
in 1347 and killed 1 3rd of the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.940
world's population. So people with two copies of CCR5

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.100
delta 32 allele had a higher survival rate.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.640
And today the highest frequency of this allele

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.760
is in northern Europe. So your fourth question

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.180
in this saga of CCR5, is this selection pressure,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.760
for it to be in northern Europe, is

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.440
this an example of natural selection or random

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.220
selection? I want you to pick one and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.500
then justify your answer in the text box here.
