00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
When we were calculating the circumference of the earth,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
our calculation was based entirely on the assumption that the sun's rays struck

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Alexandria and Syene parallel.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's examine just how true or how good that assumption was.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, the drawing I've drawn here is totally out of scale.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've drawn the earth huge and only a section of it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I've drawn the sun absurdly tiny and much, much too close to earth.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For the sake of the geometry, this picture will work.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, we know that the distance from the earth to the sun is about 150,000,000 km.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Eratosthenes knew that the distance from Syene to Alexandria.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This distance was about 5000 stadia.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Remember 1 stadion is equal to about 185 meters.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I want to know what's this angle.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
The reason why I want to know what this angle is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is because this angle somehow quantifies how parallel these lines are.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If they're truly parallel, this angle would be zero degrees.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This line would be coming in at the exact same orientation as this line.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Any deviation from 0 represents some error,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and we want to make sure that if it does deviate from zero

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that it's still quite a small number.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
For this problem, you're going to want to assume that this is a right triangle,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
even though it doesn't quite look like one.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
If we drew this more to scale, you would see that it truly is very close to being a right triangle.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, we can still use our trigonometry.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Using the fact that this distance is 150 million km,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which you could say is the length of this leg here, if you like,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
or that leg, since these are equal.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You know this length is 5000 stadia.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Can you tell me what's this angle?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We'll call this angle Î±.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Give your answer in degrees.

00:01:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
For this problem, I actually want you to round to 5 decimal places.
