James: Hi YouTube, I viewed your video and
I think I understand your concerns in respect

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.100
to the affect of knowledge based regulation
of markets.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.260
As you know on the budget this week we made
clear our intention to proceed with a common

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.470
securities regulator in Canada.
That will help us with both parts of the capital

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.579
market that are not yet regulated in the uniform
way across Canada.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.269
One of the lessons of the financial crisis
certainly is that all market participants,

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.870
and that all market products need to be tracked.
We need to have a knowledge based assessment.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.670
And we need to protect consumers in that way.
So we have a good regulatory system with respect

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.820
to our life insurance companies and our banks
through the office of the superintendants

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.610
of national institutions which reports to
the people of Canada through me as minister

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.249
of finance.
And we have the other regulatory tools that

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.019
we use regularly on a federal basis.
That has put us in good shape.

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.909
We are in the best shape of I daresay any
financial system in the world right now.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.641
And that's certainly what I'm hearing at Davos.
But we need to be more on the capital market

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:10.270
side which we will with a national securities
regulator.
