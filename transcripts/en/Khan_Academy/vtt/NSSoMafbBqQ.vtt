00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.110
I'm thinking about getting
life insurance because I

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.610
have a mortgage and
I have a young son

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.644
and another baby on the way.

00:00:07.644 --> 00:00:09.310
And so if anything
were to happen to me,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.380
I'd want them to at least be
able to pay off the mortgage

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.890
and then maybe have some
money left over for college

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.405
and to live, and whatever else.

00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:19.030
And so I went to the
insurance company,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.905
and I said I want to
get a $1 million policy.

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:24.080
And what I'm actually
getting a quote on

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.380
is a term life policy,
which is really--

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.880
I just care about
the next 20 years.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.700
After those 20 years, hopefully,
I can pay off my mortgage.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.290
There'll be money saved up.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.300
Hopefully, my kids
would kind of at least

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
have maybe gotten
to college or I

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.215
would have saved up
enough money for college.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:40.340
So that's why I'm willing
to do a term life policy.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.000
The other option is to do
a whole life policy, where

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.310
you could pay a
certain amount per year

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.760
for the rest of your life.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.100
At any point you die, you
get the million dollars.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.600
In a term life, I'm only
going to pay a $500 per year

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.620
for the next 20 years.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740
If at any point over
those 20 years I die,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.440
my family gets a million.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.255
At the 21st year, I have
to get a new policy.

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:03.880
And since I'm going
to be older and I'd

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.190
have a higher chance
of dying at that point,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.972
then it's probably going
to be more expensive for me

00:01:08.972 --> 00:01:09.680
to get insurance.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.160
But I really am just worried
about the next 20 years.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.618
But what I want to
do in this video

00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:15.340
is think about given
these numbers that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.940
have been quoted to me by
the insurance company, what

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.780
do they think that
my odds of dying

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.941
are over the next 20 years?

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.940
So what I want to think
about is the probability

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.900
of Sal's death in
20 years, based

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.720
on what the people at
the insurance company

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.344
are telling me.

00:01:36.344 --> 00:01:38.610
Or at least, what's
the maximum probability

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.570
of my death in order
for them to make money?

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.070
And the way to think about it,
or one way to think about it,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.620
kind of a
back-of-the-envelope way,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.220
is to think about what's the
total premiums they're getting

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.660
over the life of this
policy divided by how much

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.910
they're insuring me for.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.370
So they're getting $500
times 20 years is equal to,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.060
that's $10,000 over the
life of this policy.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.335
And they are insuring
me for $1 million.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.210
So they're getting-- let's
see those 0s cancel out,

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.370
this 0 cancels out--
they're getting,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.030
over the life of the
policy, $1 in premiums

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:33.090
for every $100 in insurance.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.920
Or another way to
think about it.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.010
Let's say that there were 100
Sals, 100 34-year-olds looking

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.680
to get 20-year term
life insurance.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.310
And they insured all of them.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.250
So if you multiplied
this times 100,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.965
they would get $100 in premiums.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.660
This is the case where
you have 100 Sals,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.770
or 100 people who are
pretty similar to me.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.560
100 Sals.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.450
They would get $100 in premium.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.150
And the only way that they
could make money is if, at most,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.280
one of those Sals-- or really
just break even-- if, at most,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.950
1 of those Sals were to die.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:23.987
So break even if
only 1 Sal dies.

00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:25.320
I don't like talking about this.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.650
It's a little bit morbid.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.191
So one way to think
about it, they're

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:29.860
getting $1 premium
for $100 insurance.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.090
Or if they had 100 Sals, they
would get $100 in premium,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.050
and the only way they
would break even, if only 1

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.010
of those Sal dies.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.190
So what they're really
saying is that the only way

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.840
they can break even is if
the probability of Sal dying

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:51.525
in the next 20 years is less
than or equal to 1 in 100.

00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:52.900
And this is an
insurance company.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.880
They're trying to make money.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.860
So they're probably
giving these numbers

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.230
because they think the
probability of me dying

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.140
is a good-- maybe it's 1
in 200 or it's 1 in 300.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.790
Something lower, so
that they can insure--

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.790
one way to think about it--
they could insure more Sals

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.992
for every $100 in premium
they have to pay out.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:12.950
But either way, it's a
back-of-the-envelope way

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.110
of thinking about it.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.940
And it actually makes me
feel a little bit better

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.900
because 1 in 100 over the
next 20 years isn't too bad.
