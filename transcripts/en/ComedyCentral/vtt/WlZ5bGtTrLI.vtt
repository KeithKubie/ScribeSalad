Opposers...

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:05.138
I want to talk about
the most vulnerable Americans:

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.973
guns.

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.142
Everywhere you look,
enemies of the Second Amendment

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.110
are making it harder
for gun lovers

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.879
to become gun owners.

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.914
The freedom haters
at Dick's Sporting Goods

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:17.350
recently took a stand
against the NRA

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:20.053
and experienced
a small rise in sales.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.521
Unbelievable.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.023
You know, I try not
to think about Dick's,

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.759
-but sometimes I can't help it.
-(laughter)

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.228
It makes me confused, you know?

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.431
I'm sure the left would love it

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:34.367
if I just played footage
of Dick's all night, but...

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.502
there are other channels
for that.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:38.638
See, I want to focus
on the people

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:41.474
<i> helping</i> to keep us armed,
so let's celebrate

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:45.244
our country's bravest and
loudest Guardians of the Guns.

(cheering, applause)

00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:50.750 line:0%
Yes.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.220
Our first guardian is
Kansas gubernatorial candidate,

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:55.488
Kris Kobach.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.956
He's a MAGA bumper sticker

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.860
origami'd into a swan
that hates Mexicans.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:03.229
Now, you remember Kobach
from his brave push

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.231
to prove the president's claim

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:07.967
that three to five million
people voted illegally

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.469
in the 2016 election.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.371
Now, just because the press
will tell you Kobach

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.674
did not prove his case
on voter fraud

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:18.244
does not mean this hard-right
hero is done poking libs.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.580
Kobach is now under fire
for being--

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.582
I can't believe
I'm saying this--

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.450
too patriotic at a parade.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.297 line:0%
with the gun on the side?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.899
Yes! Love that question.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:41.167
(laughter)

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.970
But to clarify,
Kobach's gun was on the<i> top.</i>

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.972
The side gun is for picnics.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.540
This was a parade.

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.775 line:0%
For most people, that is
the perfect parade vehicle.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:52.612 line:0%
In fact, the audience reaction
was overwhelmingly positive.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.213 line:0%
I've been in dozens of parades,

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.383 line:0%
never had so much positive
reaction from the audience.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.051
"So much positive reaction."

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.120
It's amazing
how much people love you

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:03.222
when you hold them at gunpoint.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:05.158
(laughter)

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:08.328
One thrilled spectator
noted that...

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.968 line:0%
...and that he was there
with his six-year-old daughter

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.604 line:0%
who "worries constantly"
about school shootings

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.006 line:0%
and...

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:27.380
Yeah, Kris, sounds like they
(bleep) loved it.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.815
And who cares if you scare
a six-year-old.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.651
She can't vote.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:35.955
And by the time she can, you can
just purge her from the rolls.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:38.891
So, Kris Kobach, welcome to
the Guardians of the Gun.

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:40.526
(gunshot)

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.230
Now, once again the left
is picking on Florida.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.632
Just because when you give
America a good shake,

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.869
it's where all
the weird stuff ends up.

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:53.806
This time, they're going after
Florida agriculture commissioner

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.176
and Republican gubernatorial
hopeful Adam Putnam.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.646
This beautiful
vitamin deficient Ron Weasley...

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.848
(laughter)

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:05.751
has had a target on his back
ever since he tweeted,

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:08.421
"I'm a proud #NRASellout."

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.890
Of course, the libs were pissed
he sold out.

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.025
They hate it
when anyone makes money.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.394
And now the media
is coming after Putnam

00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:18.564
for this overblown
nothing pancake.

00:03:18.597 --> 00:03:21.434 line:0%
An investigation in Florida
found that the state failed

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.971 line:0%
to review concealed weapons
background checks for a year

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:28.140 line:0%
because an employee couldn't
log into the database.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:29.375
(laughing)

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:31.310
Log in problems?

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:33.112
How many times do I have
to tell you guys

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:35.114
the password is "Bang Bang 69"?

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:36.549
Write it down.

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.551
(laughter)

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.554
Like any good leader Putnam
was quick to place the blame

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:44.457
on a deceitful
and negligent employee.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.927
An issue I grapple with myself
all the time, Lorraine.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.563
(laughter)

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:52.732
The disgraced employee
who went directly

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:56.035
from working in the mail room,
to overseeing the use of the

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.604
national instant criminal
background check system,

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:03.242
added, "I didn't understand why
I was put in charge of it."

00:04:03.275 --> 00:04:06.779
I've heard that one before,
Lorraine.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.449
So, thank you, Adam Putnam,

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.718
you are a steadfast guardian
of the gun.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.954
-(gunshot)
-(cheering and applause)

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:17.790
Now, look...

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:20.326
I know that gun violence is
a problem in America,

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.927
especially in our schools.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.597
And I'm devoted to finding a way
to solve this problem.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.033
But while the crazy left
is chasing after

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.836
pipe dream solutions
like fewer guns,

00:04:30.869 --> 00:04:34.206
realists like me and defense
specialist Allison Barrie

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:37.877
at Fox News, are focused on more
reality-based solutions.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.412 line:0%
Here's the scenario:

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:41.447 line:0%
<i> We've got children barricaded
 into classrooms.</i>

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.916 line:0%
<i> What if we were able to just
 roll up this cannon,</i>

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.853 line:0%
<i> punch holes-- escape holes,
 man-sized escape holes--</i>

00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:49.889 line:0%
<i> into those walls safely,</i>

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:53.059 line:0%
<i> so that children aren't hurt</i> 
<i> by that blast,</i>

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.695 line:0%
and that the children escape
directly out of the classrooms.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:58.064
Finally someone's talking sense!

00:04:58.097 --> 00:05:01.233
Ah! Ah!

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:03.235
(applause)

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:06.038
Next time there's an active
shooter incident,

00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.341
all we have to do
is line up this cannon

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.142
and methodically blow holes

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:13.379
in every exterior classroom wall
in the building.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:16.115
This is exactly the kind of
"more gun" solution

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:18.117
I was waiting for.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.620
And I got to be honest,
it sounds like a lot of fun.

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:23.556
BARRIE:<i> Now I know it sounds
 like a lot of fun.</i>

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.124
<i> It gets better.</i>

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.560
What does it use for ammo?
It has unique ammo.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.196
It uses water bottles
as powerful missiles.

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.833
<i> Once loaded into this cannon,
 they can punch through walls,</i>

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:36.669
<i> two layer walls, brick walls,</i>

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:38.871
<i> rip through metal,
 rip through vehicles,</i>

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:42.174
<i> just using water bottles
 as ammunition.</i>

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.976
Yes, weaponizing water.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.213
It's what Jesus would do
if he wasn't such a pussy.

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.182
(laughter and applause)

00:05:50.816 --> 00:05:54.453
This... this is the kind of
thinking we need in America.

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:56.589
What about cannons in every
classroom designed

00:05:56.622 --> 00:06:00.059
to launch kids through the roof
at the first sign of danger?

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:03.662
What about an entire school
that<i> is</i> a cannon?

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:07.867
That's how we take education
to new heights.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.503
So, water cannon, welcome to
the Guardians of the Gun.

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.639
-(gunshot)
-Now...

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:16.108
Stay locked and loaded,
Opposers,

00:06:16.141 --> 00:06:19.111
and remember,
it's "Bang Bang 69."

00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:20.580
Also, Lorraine, you're fired.
