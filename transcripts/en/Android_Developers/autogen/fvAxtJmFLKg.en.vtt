00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290
know Android pattern so let's see what
 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.800
know Android pattern so let's see what
we've done with the screen yep so the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
we've done with the screen yep so the
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.140
we've done with the screen yep so the
first thing we did was we added a proper

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150
first thing we did was we added a proper
 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.199
first thing we did was we added a proper
action bar my shadow zoom in here later

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209
action bar my shadow zoom in here later
 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.909
action bar my shadow zoom in here later
a proper action bar we also added a

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919
a proper action bar we also added a
 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.409
a proper action bar we also added a
navigation drawer which we'll talk about

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419
navigation drawer which we'll talk about
 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.379
navigation drawer which we'll talk about
in just a second but we also you know

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389
in just a second but we also you know
 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.759
in just a second but we also you know
tweaked a lot of the metrics and that's

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769
tweaked a lot of the metrics and that's
 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.640
tweaked a lot of the metrics and that's
one of the things that I definitely tend

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650
one of the things that I definitely tend
 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.530
one of the things that I definitely tend
to harp on when I when I look at apps is

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
to harp on when I when I look at apps is
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.909
to harp on when I when I look at apps is
metric spacing font sizes margins

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919
metric spacing font sizes margins
 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.469
metric spacing font sizes margins
padding's things like that you'll notice

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479
padding's things like that you'll notice
 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.499
padding's things like that you'll notice
that in the original you know the the

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:14.509
that in the original you know the the
 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:16.610
that in the original you know the the
text I guess the titles are kind of

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620
text I guess the titles are kind of
 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.310
text I guess the titles are kind of
cramped with the image to the left and

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
cramped with the image to the left and
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.899
cramped with the image to the left and
then the font size is kind of vary

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909
then the font size is kind of vary
 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.270
then the font size is kind of vary
throughout so one of the things we did

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280
throughout so one of the things we did
 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.680
throughout so one of the things we did
was we standardized some of the font

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690
was we standardized some of the font
 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.870
was we standardized some of the font
sizes as well as some of the margins we

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880
sizes as well as some of the margins we
 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.770
sizes as well as some of the margins we
use a standard 16 bit

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780
use a standard 16 bit
 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.950
use a standard 16 bit
kind of base grid we have 16-bit margins

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960
kind of base grid we have 16-bit margins
 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.660
kind of base grid we have 16-bit margins
throughout we have we use eight dip in

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670
throughout we have we use eight dip in
 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.760
throughout we have we use eight dip in
some places Biel notice that's just a

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770
some places Biel notice that's just a
 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.070
some places Biel notice that's just a
little more you know properly spaced out

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080
little more you know properly spaced out
 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.250

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260
in my opinion we also obviously did some
 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.990

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919
screen which is the actually this is
 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:08.650
screen which is the actually this is
just another example as you scroll down

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660
just another example as you scroll down
 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.140
just another example as you scroll down
you would obviously see more items and

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150
you would obviously see more items and
 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.409
you would obviously see more items and
and you'd have the overflow which would

00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:14.419
and you'd have the overflow which would
 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:15.940
and you'd have the overflow which would
contain my profile settings help about

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:15.950
contain my profile settings help about
 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.469
contain my profile settings help about
the standard stuff to you but there yeah

00:07:17.469 --> 00:07:17.479
the standard stuff to you but there yeah
 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:18.820
the standard stuff to you but there yeah
it's worth recapping here as well like

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830
it's worth recapping here as well like
 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.590
it's worth recapping here as well like
the rules we kind of tend to think about

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600
the rules we kind of tend to think about
 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.909
the rules we kind of tend to think about
for when things should be in action

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919
for when things should be in action
 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:23.800
for when things should be in action
which is you know immediately available

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810
which is you know immediately available
 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.420
which is you know immediately available
on the action bar on when things you get

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430
on the action bar on when things you get
 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.040
on the action bar on when things you get
to motive I'd say something like my

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.050
to motive I'd say something like my
 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.230
to motive I'd say something like my
profile is gonna be an uncommon action

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240
profile is gonna be an uncommon action
 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.730
profile is gonna be an uncommon action
you're not going to be clicking into

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:30.740
you're not going to be clicking into
 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.610
you're not going to be clicking into
that many times right so that probably

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
that many times right so that probably
 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.530
that many times right so that probably
should always go into the action

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:35.540
should always go into the action
 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.210
should always go into the action
overflow similar to how health and

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220
overflow similar to how health and
 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.560
overflow similar to how health and
settings and about would always go in

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:38.570
settings and about would always go in
 

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.510
settings and about would always go in
the action overflow as uncommon actions

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520
the action overflow as uncommon actions
 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.940
the action overflow as uncommon actions
and you wouldn't want to have to promote

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950
and you wouldn't want to have to promote
 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.130
and you wouldn't want to have to promote
this to a kind of action item even if

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:45.140
this to a kind of action item even if
 

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.360
this to a kind of action item even if
there was facing on a larger device

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:46.370
there was facing on a larger device
 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.460
there was facing on a larger device
because it's like not a common action

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.470
because it's like not a common action
 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.900
because it's like not a common action
another thing I wanted to mention is

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:49.910
another thing I wanted to mention is
 

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.880
another thing I wanted to mention is
that if you if you know if you want to

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:51.890
that if you if you know if you want to
 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.279
that if you if you know if you want to
kind of encourage the user to log in to

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:54.289
kind of encourage the user to log in to
 

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:56.440
kind of encourage the user to log in to

create an account for your app you know
 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.909
create an account for your app you know
using the overflow for that it's

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:57.919
using the overflow for that it's
 

00:07:57.919 --> 00:07:59.380
using the overflow for that it's
probably not a good idea probably not

00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.390
probably not a good idea probably not
 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.060
probably not a good idea probably not
gonna get too much engagement there but

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.070
gonna get too much engagement there but
 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.529
gonna get too much engagement there but
what you could do is have like a like a

log in so let's move on to the next
 

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.990
log in so let's move on to the next
actually this is this is the scroll down

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000
actually this is this is the scroll down
 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.670
actually this is this is the scroll down
version you notice that rather than

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680
version you notice that rather than
 

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.640
version you notice that rather than
having this extra arrow here to show all

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:36.650
having this extra arrow here to show all
 

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.110
having this extra arrow here to show all
the listings we just have like an all

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120
the listings we just have like an all
 

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.360
the listings we just have like an all
listings item at the very bottom so

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:40.370
listings item at the very bottom so
 

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.070
listings item at the very bottom so
you'd show maybe three or four items as

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080
you'd show maybe three or four items as
 

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.839
you'd show maybe three or four items as
kind of a summary of the post and then

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:43.849
kind of a summary of the post and then
 

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:45.340
kind of a summary of the post and then
at the bottom you click on all this that

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:45.350
at the bottom you click on all this that
 

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.110
at the bottom you click on all this that
you touch all this things to take you

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120
you touch all this things to take you
 

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.190
you touch all this things to take you
there

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200
there
 

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.710
there
so let's look at the the drawer so you

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720
so let's look at the the drawer so you
 

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.180
so let's look at the the drawer so you
have right now if you if you touch that

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.190
have right now if you if you touch that
 

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.389
have right now if you if you touch that
top left search icon you get this I

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399
top left search icon you get this I
 

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:57.610
top left search icon you get this I
guess it's kind of like a navigation

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:57.620
guess it's kind of like a navigation
 

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.900
guess it's kind of like a navigation
drawer to the left it shows you the list

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:58.910
drawer to the left it shows you the list
 

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:00.730
drawer to the left it shows you the list
of categories as well as a list of

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:00.740
of categories as well as a list of
 

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.280
of categories as well as a list of
recent searches along with search itself

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:03.290
recent searches along with search itself
 

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.500
recent searches along with search itself
so search is kind of part of this bar

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:05.510
so search is kind of part of this bar
 

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.240
so search is kind of part of this bar
and it makes sense in terms of proximity

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.250
and it makes sense in terms of proximity
 

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.699
and it makes sense in terms of proximity
right the the search bar is right next

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:09.709
right the the search bar is right next
 

00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:12.370
right the the search bar is right next
to the recent searches however I mean

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.380
to the recent searches however I mean
 

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.960
to the recent searches however I mean
it's it's a somewhat of an uncommon

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:13.970
it's it's a somewhat of an uncommon
 

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.000
it's it's a somewhat of an uncommon
place for search users really expect

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.010
place for search users really expect
 

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:16.990
place for search users really expect
search to be in the action bar

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000
search to be in the action bar
 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.939
search to be in the action bar
immediately available not two touches

00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:18.949
immediately available not two touches
 

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:20.500
immediately available not two touches
away but immediately kind of one touch

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:20.510
away but immediately kind of one touch
 

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.800
away but immediately kind of one touch
away and and this is it's not really

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:23.810
away and and this is it's not really
 

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.430
away and and this is it's not really
violating any any strong semantic rules

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440
violating any any strong semantic rules
 

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.019
violating any any strong semantic rules
for the navigation genre there aren't

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:29.029
for the navigation genre there aren't
 

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.569
for the navigation genre there aren't
any actions in here except for search

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:30.579
any actions in here except for search
 

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:32.829
any actions in here except for search
but it is kind of pushing the content

00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839
but it is kind of pushing the content
 

00:09:32.839 --> 00:09:35.920
but it is kind of pushing the content
over pushing the the top bar over and so

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:35.930
over pushing the the top bar over and so
 

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.720
over pushing the the top bar over and so
in terms of the interaction itself it is

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:37.730
in terms of the interaction itself it is
 

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.460
in terms of the interaction itself it is
it's not really violating the guidelines

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:39.470
it's not really violating the guidelines
 

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.930
it's not really violating the guidelines
but it's not adhering to the to the

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:40.940
but it's not adhering to the to the
 

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.060
but it's not adhering to the to the
guidelines that we have set out so what

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.070
guidelines that we have set out so what
 

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.160
guidelines that we have set out so what
we decided to do is see what this look

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:45.170
we decided to do is see what this look
 

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.439
we decided to do is see what this look
would look like with a proper new

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:47.449
would look like with a proper new
 

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:50.259
would look like with a proper new
navigation drawer so you have you know

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:50.269
navigation drawer so you have you know
 

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:51.939
navigation drawer so you have you know
home at the top which is kind of your

00:09:51.939 --> 00:09:51.949
home at the top which is kind of your
 

00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:55.120
home at the top which is kind of your
your stream per se and then each of the

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.130
your stream per se and then each of the
 

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.769
your stream per se and then each of the
other things are still represented there

00:09:56.769 --> 00:09:56.779
other things are still represented there
 

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.000
other things are still represented there
we also added a couple of things like

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.010
we also added a couple of things like
 

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.610
we also added a couple of things like
like section headers to make sure that

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:00.620
like section headers to make sure that
 

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.340
like section headers to make sure that
it's clear what you're looking at and

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:03.350
it's clear what you're looking at and
 

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.720
it's clear what you're looking at and
yeah you could do the same thing as you

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:04.730
yeah you could do the same thing as you
 

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.120
yeah you could do the same thing as you
can like dismiss recent searches you can

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:07.130
can like dismiss recent searches you can
 

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.370
can like dismiss recent searches you can
you know you can switch between the

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:09.380
you know you can switch between the
 

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.660
you know you can switch between the
different categories and things of that

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:10.670
different categories and things of that
 

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.790
different categories and things of that
but the the the core point here is that

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800
but the the the core point here is that
 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.319
but the the the core point here is that
you know since the action bar doesn't

00:10:14.319 --> 00:10:14.329
you know since the action bar doesn't
 

00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:15.490
you know since the action bar doesn't
slide out of the way search is still

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:15.500
slide out of the way search is still
 

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.319
slide out of the way search is still
accessible search is still in action

00:10:17.319 --> 00:10:17.329
accessible search is still in action
 

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:20.710
accessible search is still in action
that's there in the action bar because

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720
that's there in the action bar because
 

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.970
that's there in the action bar because
it's globally relevant it's not

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:21.980
it's globally relevant it's not
 

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.340
it's globally relevant it's not
contextually relevant to the screen that

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:24.350
contextually relevant to the screen that
 

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.949
contextually relevant to the screen that
the navigation drawer is hiding so it's

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959
the navigation drawer is hiding so it's
 

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.449
the navigation drawer is hiding so it's
totally fine to leave that action there

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:28.459
totally fine to leave that action there
 

00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:32.949
totally fine to leave that action there
when a navigation drawer is exposed okay

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959
when a navigation drawer is exposed okay
 

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:36.250
when a navigation drawer is exposed okay
let's see so what else did we do here so

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:36.260
let's see so what else did we do here so
 

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.370
let's see so what else did we do here so
once you jump into once you actually

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:39.380
once you jump into once you actually
 

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.410
once you jump into once you actually
perform a search let's say you you press

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.420
perform a search let's say you you press
 

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.910
perform a search let's say you you press
one of these categories or you click on

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920
one of these categories or you click on
 

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.620
one of these categories or you click on
a recent search you get taken to this

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:44.630
a recent search you get taken to this
 

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.990
a recent search you get taken to this
screen which again has those persistent

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000
screen which again has those persistent
 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.870
screen which again has those persistent
top left and top right I guess jars

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880
top left and top right I guess jars
 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.829
top left and top right I guess jars
available and it also lets you sort so

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839
available and it also lets you sort so
 

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:56.230
available and it also lets you sort so
the the issue here is that it's you know

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240
the the issue here is that it's you know
 

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.699
the the issue here is that it's you know
there isn't a concept of really

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:57.709
there isn't a concept of really
 

00:10:57.709 --> 00:11:00.400
there isn't a concept of really
hierarchy and you're you're kind of like

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.410
hierarchy and you're you're kind of like
 

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.499
hierarchy and you're you're kind of like
just at another flat part of

00:11:02.499 --> 00:11:02.509
just at another flat part of
 

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:04.030
just at another flat part of
you're just on another part of the app

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040
you're just on another part of the app
 

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.229
you're just on another part of the app
that happens to be search results so

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:05.239
that happens to be search results so
 

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:07.629
that happens to be search results so
there's no quick way besides pressing

00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639
there's no quick way besides pressing
 

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.210
there's no quick way besides pressing
the back button to get home so what we

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.220
the back button to get home so what we
 

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.199
the back button to get home so what we
did here was we we actually you know

00:11:14.199 --> 00:11:14.209
did here was we we actually you know
 

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:16.929
did here was we we actually you know
mirrored a lot of the things from we

00:11:16.929 --> 00:11:16.939
mirrored a lot of the things from we
 

00:11:16.939 --> 00:11:18.369
mirrored a lot of the things from we
copied a lot of the things from the

00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:18.379
copied a lot of the things from the
 

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:20.350
copied a lot of the things from the
original or the current app we still

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360
original or the current app we still
 

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.669
original or the current app we still
have you know obviously the images on

00:11:21.669 --> 00:11:21.679
have you know obviously the images on
 

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:23.410
have you know obviously the images on
the left and the the metadata on the

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:23.420
the left and the the metadata on the
 

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.900
the left and the the metadata on the
right and you know obviously what we we

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:25.910
right and you know obviously what we we
 

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.220
right and you know obviously what we we
did some typographic treatments there

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.230
did some typographic treatments there
 

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.340
did some typographic treatments there
but we kept the navigation drawer I'll

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:30.350
but we kept the navigation drawer I'll
 

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.720
but we kept the navigation drawer I'll
actually talk about that in a second and

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:31.730
actually talk about that in a second and
 

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.669
actually talk about that in a second and
then we moved the common actions of

00:11:33.669 --> 00:11:33.679
then we moved the common actions of
 

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:35.710
then we moved the common actions of
things like filtering and sorting which

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720
things like filtering and sorting which
 

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.299
things like filtering and sorting which
we'll talk about in a second into the

00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:37.309
we'll talk about in a second into the
 

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:38.979
we'll talk about in a second into the
action bar in there in a normal place

00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:38.989
action bar in there in a normal place
 

00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:41.229
action bar in there in a normal place
now in terms of the navigation drawer

00:11:41.229 --> 00:11:41.239
now in terms of the navigation drawer
 

00:11:41.239 --> 00:11:43.299
now in terms of the navigation drawer
some folks may may think oh why isn't

00:11:43.299 --> 00:11:43.309
some folks may may think oh why isn't
 

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:45.160
some folks may may think oh why isn't
there an UP button here now the reason

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.170
there an UP button here now the reason
 

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.780
there an UP button here now the reason
for for this and this is kind of

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:46.790
for for this and this is kind of
 

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.160
for for this and this is kind of
contentious you could probably go either

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:48.170
contentious you could probably go either
 

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.739
contentious you could probably go either
way on it my thinking here was that

00:11:50.739 --> 00:11:50.749
way on it my thinking here was that
 

00:11:50.749 --> 00:11:53.019
way on it my thinking here was that
since these recent searches are

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:53.029
since these recent searches are
 

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:56.889
since these recent searches are
represented in the navigation drawer so

00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:56.899
represented in the navigation drawer so
 

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:58.979
represented in the navigation drawer so
they're here at pizza or wedding dresses

00:11:58.979 --> 00:11:58.989
they're here at pizza or wedding dresses
 

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:01.299
they're here at pizza or wedding dresses
since they're represented there they

00:12:01.299 --> 00:12:01.309
since they're represented there they
 

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:04.030
since they're represented there they
should actually they should actually

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040
should actually they should actually
 

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.340
should actually they should actually
those screens that you get taken to when

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.350
those screens that you get taken to when
 

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.079
those screens that you get taken to when
you press those should appear in the

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:08.089
you press those should appear in the
 

00:12:08.089 --> 00:12:09.759
you press those should appear in the
navigation drawer or should have the

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:09.769
navigation drawer or should have the
 

00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:11.109
navigation drawer or should have the
navigation drawer affordance and this is

00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:11.119
navigation drawer affordance and this is
 

00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:12.340
navigation drawer affordance and this is
in accordance with the guidelines that

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.350
in accordance with the guidelines that
 

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.749
in accordance with the guidelines that
we have set out so if you touch

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:13.759
we have set out so if you touch
 

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:15.159
we have set out so if you touch
something in a navigation drawer and you

00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:15.169
something in a navigation drawer and you
 

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:17.259
something in a navigation drawer and you
get taken to a new screen that screen

00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:17.269
get taken to a new screen that screen
 

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:18.699
get taken to a new screen that screen
should have access that the same

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:18.709
should have access that the same
 

00:12:18.709 --> 00:12:20.530
should have access that the same
navigation bar so you could probably go

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:20.540
navigation bar so you could probably go
 

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.819
navigation bar so you could probably go
either way I mean a lot of folks think

00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:21.829
either way I mean a lot of folks think
 

00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:23.710
either way I mean a lot of folks think
that you know on search screens you

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720
that you know on search screens you
 

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.759
that you know on search screens you
could have an up but you should have an

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:24.769
could have an up but you should have an
 

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:27.220
could have an up but you should have an
UP button and you know I guess this is

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.230
UP button and you know I guess this is
 

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.519
UP button and you know I guess this is
just one way to do it and then also you

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:30.529
just one way to do it and then also you
 

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:32.530
just one way to do it and then also you
have access to the refine search so if

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:32.540
have access to the refine search so if
 

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.809
have access to the refine search so if
you actually want to filter further you

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:34.819
you actually want to filter further you
 

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:36.369
you actually want to filter further you
could you know you could touch it up

00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:36.379
could you know you could touch it up
 

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:38.590
could you know you could touch it up
there and then you know everything else

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600
there and then you know everything else
 

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.900
there and then you know everything else
in the screen so Nick before we move on

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:40.910
in the screen so Nick before we move on
 

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:44.379
in the screen so Nick before we move on
any comments or I know just a few

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:44.389
any comments or I know just a few
 

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.850
any comments or I know just a few
comments on the on the visual designers

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:45.860
comments on the on the visual designers
 

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.009
comments on the on the visual designers
well I think even a nice job of

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:47.019
well I think even a nice job of
 

00:12:47.019 --> 00:12:49.090
well I think even a nice job of
tightening up the visual design on this

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.100
tightening up the visual design on this
 

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.159
tightening up the visual design on this
I think especially the treatment of the

00:12:51.159 --> 00:12:51.169
I think especially the treatment of the
 

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:54.819
I think especially the treatment of the
images and having them basically flush

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:54.829
images and having them basically flush
 

00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:56.109
images and having them basically flush
with the side and that and then below

00:12:56.109 --> 00:12:56.119
with the side and that and then below
 

00:12:56.119 --> 00:12:57.489
with the side and that and then below
item works really really well so

00:12:57.489 --> 00:12:57.499
item works really really well so
 

00:12:57.499 --> 00:12:59.710
item works really really well so
basically using as much space as you can

00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720
basically using as much space as you can
 

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.949
basically using as much space as you can
to show you know rich imagery which is

00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959
to show you know rich imagery which is
 

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:04.539
to show you know rich imagery which is
much quicker than you know to scan than

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:04.549
much quicker than you know to scan than
 

00:13:04.549 --> 00:13:06.519
much quicker than you know to scan than
a textual description so I think that's

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:06.529
a textual description so I think that's
 

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:07.509
a textual description so I think that's
really really nice that you give them

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519
really really nice that you give them
 

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:11.710
really really nice that you give them
that room to to show off cool ok so

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720
that room to to show off cool ok so
 

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.329
that room to to show off cool ok so
let's look at a couple details here the

00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339
let's look at a couple details here the
 

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:17.119
let's look at a couple details here the
first is the first right is that if you

00:13:17.119 --> 00:13:17.129
first is the first right is that if you
 

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.650
first is the first right is that if you
touch the recent search like wedding

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660
touch the recent search like wedding
 

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.929
touch the recent search like wedding
dresses that could be populated in the

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:20.939
dresses that could be populated in the
 

00:13:20.939 --> 00:13:22.610
dresses that could be populated in the
top so that could effectively be an

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620
top so that could effectively be an
 

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:27.799
top so that could effectively be an
editable title and if you if you move on

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:27.809
editable title and if you if you move on
 

00:13:27.809 --> 00:13:29.720
editable title and if you if you move on
here so you'll notice that sort is a

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:29.730
here so you'll notice that sort is a
 

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.660
here so you'll notice that sort is a
submenu so when you touch this sort I

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:32.670
submenu so when you touch this sort I
 

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.030
submenu so when you touch this sort I
con you get a list of sort options

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040
con you get a list of sort options
 

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.889
con you get a list of sort options

00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:39.089
should actually have radio buttons next
 

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:41.660
should actually have radio buttons next
to them that's a design issue kind of a

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:41.670
to them that's a design issue kind of a
 

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.759
to them that's a design issue kind of a
bug there these should have radio

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:43.769
bug there these should have radio
 

00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:45.199
bug there these should have radio
buttons showing what the current sort is

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:45.209
buttons showing what the current sort is
 

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:48.710
buttons showing what the current sort is
as well and then the most interesting

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720
as well and then the most interesting
 

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.179
as well and then the most interesting
thing that part of this I'd say is the

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:50.189
thing that part of this I'd say is the
 

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:52.699
thing that part of this I'd say is the
filtering so actually I lied a bit when

00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:52.709
filtering so actually I lied a bit when
 

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:55.429
filtering so actually I lied a bit when

here when you touch here right so when
 

00:13:59.939 --> 00:14:01.999
here when you touch here right so when
you touch here you actually don't get

00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:02.009
you touch here you actually don't get
 

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:05.150
you touch here you actually don't get

screen you get taken to a filter

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:07.309
screen you get taken to a filter
 

00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:09.799

interstitial first so you actually get

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:09.809
interstitial first so you actually get
 

00:14:09.809 --> 00:14:12.379
interstitial first so you actually get
taken to wow this is looking to see if I

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:12.389
taken to wow this is looking to see if I
 

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.889
taken to wow this is looking to see if I
can get to it

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899
can get to it
 

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:15.170
can get to it
you actually get taken here first so as

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180
you actually get taken here first so as
 

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.579
you actually get taken here first so as
soon as you touch a category you get

00:14:16.579 --> 00:14:16.589
soon as you touch a category you get
 

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:19.999
soon as you touch a category you get
taken to a filter screen which then you

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:20.009
taken to a filter screen which then you
 

00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:21.860
taken to a filter screen which then you
can obviously modify and then once you

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:21.870
can obviously modify and then once you
 

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:23.989
can obviously modify and then once you
choose the right filters you can swipe

00:14:23.989 --> 00:14:23.999
choose the right filters you can swipe
 

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:26.179
choose the right filters you can swipe
over to see the results so instead of

00:14:26.179 --> 00:14:26.189
over to see the results so instead of
 

00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:29.629
over to see the results so instead of
instead of having another left pane what

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639
instead of having another left pane what
 

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:31.519
instead of having another left pane what
we decided to do is you know filtering

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:31.529
we decided to do is you know filtering
 

00:14:31.529 --> 00:14:33.590
we decided to do is you know filtering
is really kind of like an action it's

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600
is really kind of like an action it's
 

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.030
is really kind of like an action it's
it's the action

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040
it's the action
 

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.160
it's the action
the act of filtering your current set of

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:37.170
the act of filtering your current set of
 

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.989
the act of filtering your current set of
results so we decided to do is move this

00:14:38.989 --> 00:14:38.999
results so we decided to do is move this
 

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:41.210
results so we decided to do is move this
over to the right as a right drawer it's

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.220
over to the right as a right drawer it's
 

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.460
over to the right as a right drawer it's
kind of something that that's on the on

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:43.470
kind of something that that's on the on
 

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.739
kind of something that that's on the on
the right hand side like a filter or you

00:14:45.739 --> 00:14:45.749
the right hand side like a filter or you
 

00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:47.449
the right hand side like a filter or you
know you could do something like a layer

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459
know you could do something like a layer
 

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:48.980
know you could do something like a layer
selection if you're looking at a map or

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:48.990
selection if you're looking at a map or
 

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:50.389
selection if you're looking at a map or
something like that so we moved

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399
something like that so we moved
 

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.249
something like that so we moved
filtering to the right you'll notice

00:14:52.249 --> 00:14:52.259
filtering to the right you'll notice
 

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:54.799
filtering to the right you'll notice
that it's not just a drawer it's not

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:54.809
that it's not just a drawer it's not
 

00:14:54.809 --> 00:14:56.540
that it's not just a drawer it's not
just a drawer it's actually also

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:56.550
just a drawer it's actually also
 

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.519
just a drawer it's actually also
available as an action button so if you

00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:58.529
available as an action button so if you
 

00:14:58.529 --> 00:15:00.530
available as an action button so if you
if you touch the filter icon there it

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540
if you touch the filter icon there it
 

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.269
if you touch the filter icon there it
actually should expand and collapse the

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279
actually should expand and collapse the
 

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:04.189
actually should expand and collapse the
filter pane this is very similar to how

00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199
filter pane this is very similar to how
 

00:15:04.199 --> 00:15:06.980
filter pane this is very similar to how
Google Plus or Google one today do

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:06.990
Google Plus or Google one today do
 

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.439
Google Plus or Google one today do
notifications so the idea here is that

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:09.449
notifications so the idea here is that
 

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:11.119
notifications so the idea here is that
instead of being taken directly to the

00:15:11.119 --> 00:15:11.129
instead of being taken directly to the
 

00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:13.009
instead of being taken directly to the
search results you can actually take the

00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019
search results you can actually take the
 

00:15:13.019 --> 00:15:14.629
search results you can actually take the
user to the search results screen but

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639
user to the search results screen but
 

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:18.019
user to the search results screen but
immediately expose the right-hand filter

00:15:18.019 --> 00:15:18.029
immediately expose the right-hand filter
 

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.329
immediately expose the right-hand filter
jar and once they make the selections

00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339
jar and once they make the selections
 

00:15:20.339 --> 00:15:21.490
jar and once they make the selections
they could just wipe it out of the way

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:21.500
they could just wipe it out of the way
 

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.169
they could just wipe it out of the way
I'm beside this like the idea of

00:15:24.169 --> 00:15:24.179
I'm beside this like the idea of
 

00:15:24.179 --> 00:15:25.970
I'm beside this like the idea of
changing the content of the navigation

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980
changing the content of the navigation
 

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.840
changing the content of the navigation
drawer

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:26.850
drawer
 

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.370
drawer
I'm not a huge fan of I mean it's such

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:28.380
I'm not a huge fan of I mean it's such
 

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.199
I'm not a huge fan of I mean it's such
an important facility to be able to

00:15:30.199 --> 00:15:30.209
an important facility to be able to
 

00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:32.090
an important facility to be able to
navigate around the application the idea

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100
navigate around the application the idea
 

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.949
navigate around the application the idea
of having this kind of different modes

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959
of having this kind of different modes
 

00:15:33.959 --> 00:15:35.900
of having this kind of different modes
in which you're in and it's kind of like

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:35.910
in which you're in and it's kind of like
 

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.329
in which you're in and it's kind of like
lack of stability or Maisie do I'm not a

00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339
lack of stability or Maisie do I'm not a
 

00:15:38.339 --> 00:15:40.430
lack of stability or Maisie do I'm not a
huge fan of it so I think it's much

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440
huge fan of it so I think it's much
 

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.170
huge fan of it so I think it's much
cleaner and also the fact that filtering

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180
cleaner and also the fact that filtering
 

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.240
cleaner and also the fact that filtering
is tends to be an action it's not really

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:44.250
is tends to be an action it's not really
 

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.040
is tends to be an action it's not really
navigation it's kind of acting upon the

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.050
navigation it's kind of acting upon the
 

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.019
navigation it's kind of acting upon the
data you've all you you know navigate it

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:48.029
data you've all you you know navigate it
 

00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:50.540
data you've all you you know navigate it
to there it definitely maps to an action

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:50.550
to there it definitely maps to an action
 

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:51.590
to there it definitely maps to an action
and therefore I've kind of like the

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600
and therefore I've kind of like the
 

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.819
and therefore I've kind of like the
right-hand side of the action bar and

00:15:52.819 --> 00:15:52.829
right-hand side of the action bar and
 

00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:55.160
right-hand side of the action bar and
aren't in Android Model T it is much

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:55.170
aren't in Android Model T it is much
 

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.769
aren't in Android Model T it is much
better exactly yeah so you'll notice

00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779
better exactly yeah so you'll notice
 

00:15:57.779 --> 00:15:58.910
better exactly yeah so you'll notice
here that there's kind of like an UP

00:15:58.910 --> 00:15:58.920
here that there's kind of like an UP
 

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.160
here that there's kind of like an UP
button ins or a back button inside of

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.170
button ins or a back button inside of
 

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.900
button ins or a back button inside of
the navigation drawer anytime you see

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:02.910
the navigation drawer anytime you see
 

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.389
the navigation drawer anytime you see
that definitely try to avoid that the

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399
that definitely try to avoid that the
 

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.710
that definitely try to avoid that the
only type of hierarchy you should have

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720
only type of hierarchy you should have
 

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.660
only type of hierarchy you should have
within the drawer is collapsible

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:08.670
within the drawer is collapsible
 

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:10.639
within the drawer is collapsible
sections so you can have you know kind

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:10.649
sections so you can have you know kind
 

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:12.019
sections so you can have you know kind
of like a collapsible item within the

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:12.029
of like a collapsible item within the
 

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:13.970
of like a collapsible item within the
drawer but definitely if you have

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980
drawer but definitely if you have
 

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.490
drawer but definitely if you have
different entire context within the

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500
different entire context within the
 

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.439
different entire context within the
drawer that's that's something that you

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:18.449
drawer that's that's something that you
 

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:20.840
drawer that's that's something that you
should try to avoid and I think there

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:20.850
should try to avoid and I think there
 

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.249
should try to avoid and I think there
were there may have been no that was it

00:16:22.249 --> 00:16:22.259
were there may have been no that was it
 

00:16:22.259 --> 00:16:24.439
were there may have been no that was it
so that was the entire that was the

00:16:24.439 --> 00:16:24.449
so that was the entire that was the
 

00:16:24.449 --> 00:16:27.620
so that was the entire that was the
entire kind of type of redesign we did

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:27.630
entire kind of type of redesign we did
 

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.319
entire kind of type of redesign we did
for this app now before we you know move

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:30.329
for this app now before we you know move
 

00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:31.910
for this app now before we you know move
on I just want to say the app itself is

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920
on I just want to say the app itself is
 

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920
on I just want to say the app itself is
is designed very well it performs really

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:33.930
is designed very well it performs really
 

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.990
is designed very well it performs really
quickly the the image loading is very

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000
quickly the the image loading is very
 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.019
quickly the the image loading is very
good so it's a very very solid app and

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:39.029
good so it's a very very solid app and
 

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:40.579
good so it's a very very solid app and
this is also a beta so it's not quite

00:16:40.579 --> 00:16:40.589
this is also a beta so it's not quite
 

00:16:40.589 --> 00:16:43.309
this is also a beta so it's not quite
out yet it's a great app you should

00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319
out yet it's a great app you should
 

00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:44.660
out yet it's a great app you should
definitely check it out but these are

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:44.670
definitely check it out but these are
 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.949
definitely check it out but these are
some of the ways in which we would kind

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959
some of the ways in which we would kind
 

00:16:45.959 --> 00:16:48.139
some of the ways in which we would kind
of improve the navigation as well as you

00:16:48.139 --> 00:16:48.149
of improve the navigation as well as you
 

00:16:48.149 --> 00:16:50.030
of improve the navigation as well as you
know separate out the concepts of

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040
know separate out the concepts of
 

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.410
know separate out the concepts of
navigation from actions such as

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420
navigation from actions such as
 

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.379
navigation from actions such as
filtering with that should we move on to

00:16:54.379 --> 00:16:54.389
filtering with that should we move on to
 

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:57.259
filtering with that should we move on to
design consistency name yeah that's all

00:16:57.259 --> 00:16:57.269
design consistency name yeah that's all
 

00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:59.960
design consistency name yeah that's all
right so this is a topic they're being

00:16:59.960 --> 00:16:59.970
right so this is a topic they're being
 

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.490
right so this is a topic they're being
chewing on for a little while and I

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500
chewing on for a little while and I
 

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.360
chewing on for a little while and I
think it's something that a lot of

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:02.370
think it's something that a lot of
 

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.189
think it's something that a lot of
people struggle and struggle with out

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199
people struggle and struggle with out
 

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:07.159
people struggle and struggle with out
there and understanding how do you

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:07.169
there and understanding how do you
 

00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:08.449
there and understanding how do you
design for Android and how do you have

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459
design for Android and how do you have
 

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:10.880
design for Android and how do you have
that consistent with with the rest of

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:10.890
that consistent with with the rest of
 

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.919
that consistent with with the rest of
your brand and application and so on out

00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:12.929
your brand and application and so on out
 

00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:16.520
your brand and application and so on out
there so when we talk about consistency

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:16.530
there so when we talk about consistency
 

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.380
there so when we talk about consistency
there's a few kind of dimensions we want

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:18.390
there's a few kind of dimensions we want
 

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:19.909
there's a few kind of dimensions we want
to kind of redefine and really kind of

00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919
to kind of redefine and really kind of
 

00:17:19.919 --> 00:17:22.579
to kind of redefine and really kind of
dig into and the first one is like about

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:22.589
dig into and the first one is like about
 

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.110
dig into and the first one is like about
cross-platform so obviously there's a

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120
cross-platform so obviously there's a
 

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.240
cross-platform so obviously there's a
bunch of different and OS platforms out

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:26.250
bunch of different and OS platforms out
 

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.159
bunch of different and OS platforms out
there which you and say you know your

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:28.169
there which you and say you know your
 

00:17:28.169 --> 00:17:29.630
there which you and say you know your
application your service whatever might

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640
application your service whatever might
 

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.399
application your service whatever might
be probably wants to be present on so

00:17:31.399 --> 00:17:31.409
be probably wants to be present on so
 

00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:32.810
be probably wants to be present on so
there's got to be an element of

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820
there's got to be an element of
 

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.360
there's got to be an element of
consistency and so users know how to use

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:35.370
consistency and so users know how to use
 

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.260
consistency and so users know how to use
your application across these

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.270
your application across these
 

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.850
your application across these
the next dimension we think about is

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:38.860
the next dimension we think about is
 

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.860
the next dimension we think about is
kind of like your branding really like

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:40.870
kind of like your branding really like
 

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.750
kind of like your branding really like
so even if you're running on these

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760
so even if you're running on these
 

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.520
so even if you're running on these
different platforms you want to be

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:44.530
different platforms you want to be
 

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.350
different platforms you want to be
recognizable as the same service and how

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360
recognizable as the same service and how
 

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.200
recognizable as the same service and how
do you kind of achieve that and the next

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.210
do you kind of achieve that and the next
 

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.460
do you kind of achieve that and the next
submission we think about so when we're

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.470
submission we think about so when we're
 

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.150
submission we think about so when we're
talking specifically about Android

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160
talking specifically about Android
 

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.590
talking specifically about Android
Android obviously has its own look and

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600
Android obviously has its own look and
 

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.630
Android obviously has its own look and
feel its own interaction patterns and so

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640
feel its own interaction patterns and so
 

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.580
feel its own interaction patterns and so
forth kind of wrapped up in the in the

00:17:59.580 --> 00:17:59.590
forth kind of wrapped up in the in the
 

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.380
forth kind of wrapped up in the in the
holo design language and the Android

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:01.390
holo design language and the Android
 

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.320
holo design language and the Android
design patterns so how do you kind of

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.330
design patterns so how do you kind of
 

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:05.940
design patterns so how do you kind of
like reconcile being consistent with

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:05.950
like reconcile being consistent with
 

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.610
like reconcile being consistent with
that so there's a lot of kind of like

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:08.620
that so there's a lot of kind of like
 

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.310
that so there's a lot of kind of like
confusion and choice out there so to

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320
confusion and choice out there so to
 

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.690
confusion and choice out there so to
tackle those we kind of break it down

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:12.700
tackle those we kind of break it down
 

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.730
tackle those we kind of break it down
into three kind of design disciplines so

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:14.740
into three kind of design disciplines so
 

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.410
into three kind of design disciplines so
we're going to talk individually about

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:16.420
we're going to talk individually about
 

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.840
we're going to talk individually about
your information design your interaction

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:18.850
your information design your interaction
 

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.750
your information design your interaction
design and your visual design and kind

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760
design and your visual design and kind
 

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.419
design and your visual design and kind
of how to be consistent with those so

00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:24.429
of how to be consistent with those so
 

00:18:24.429 --> 00:18:27.780
of how to be consistent with those so
first up the information design like we

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:27.790
first up the information design like we
 

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.820
first up the information design like we
really know Android or the holographic

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:29.830
really know Android or the holographic
 

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.980
really know Android or the holographic
and the holo design language really

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:31.990
and the holo design language really
 

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:33.660
and the holo design language really
isn't going to economic take you or tell

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:33.670
isn't going to economic take you or tell
 

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.540
isn't going to economic take you or tell
you anything here there's nothing you

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:36.550
you anything here there's nothing you
 

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.669
you anything here there's nothing you
know stopping you from using the same

00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679
know stopping you from using the same
 

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:40.500
know stopping you from using the same
information architecture that you use

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:40.510
information architecture that you use
 

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.840
information architecture that you use
say if you already have a web property

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:42.850
say if you already have a web property
 

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.490
say if you already have a web property
or a different platform you know this is

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:44.500
or a different platform you know this is
 

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.620
or a different platform you know this is
all down to your application I think

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:46.630
all down to your application I think
 

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.240
all down to your application I think
this is just comes down to good design

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:48.250
this is just comes down to good design
 

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.440
this is just comes down to good design
you know where you want to sit down and

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:49.450
you know where you want to sit down and
 

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.600
you know where you want to sit down and
like map out what the base entities are

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:51.610
like map out what the base entities are
 

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.370
like map out what the base entities are
in the information architecture of your

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:53.380
in the information architecture of your
 

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.010
in the information architecture of your
of your application and but Android

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.020
of your application and but Android
 

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.690
of your application and but Android
isn't gonna implementers at all so it is

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:57.700
isn't gonna implementers at all so it is
 

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.299
isn't gonna implementers at all so it is
all kind of on you what kind of like

00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:00.309
all kind of on you what kind of like
 

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:02.940
all kind of on you what kind of like
slider map I guess that the point I

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:02.950
slider map I guess that the point I
 

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.470
slider map I guess that the point I
wanted to make here is that you the

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480
wanted to make here is that you the
 

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.090
wanted to make here is that you the
information design especially for apps

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:06.100
information design especially for apps
 

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.040
information design especially for apps
that are information architecture

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.050
that are information architecture
 

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.240
that are information architecture
especially for apps that have an

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.250
especially for apps that have an
 

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.280
especially for apps that have an
existing potentially very large user

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.290
existing potentially very large user
 

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.860
existing potentially very large user
base or existing property you know on

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:13.870
base or existing property you know on
 

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.650
base or existing property you know on
the web or other mobile platforms you

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:16.660
the web or other mobile platforms you
 

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:18.930
the web or other mobile platforms you
don't want to compromise your your

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:18.940
don't want to compromise your your
 

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.400
don't want to compromise your your
information architecture you don't have

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.410
information architecture you don't have
 

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.660
information architecture you don't have
to choose a completely different

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:21.670
to choose a completely different
 

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.669
to choose a completely different
information architecture just for

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679
information architecture just for
 

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:25.950
information architecture just for
Android so when you look at Android

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960
Android so when you look at Android
 

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.330
Android so when you look at Android
don't think of it as designing a

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:27.340
don't think of it as designing a
 

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.280
don't think of it as designing a
completely separate app it's really how

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:29.290
completely separate app it's really how
 

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.169
completely separate app it's really how
do I map my existing information

00:19:31.169 --> 00:19:31.179
do I map my existing information
 

00:19:31.179 --> 00:19:33.510
do I map my existing information
architecture my existing entities the

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520
architecture my existing entities the
 

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.790
architecture my existing entities the
objects I deal with the sibling

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:35.800
objects I deal with the sibling
 

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.710
objects I deal with the sibling
relationships of things have you mapped

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720
relationships of things have you mapped
 

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.140
relationships of things have you mapped
those on to Android so it's really in

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.150
those on to Android so it's really in
 

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.970
those on to Android so it's really in
this case in the information

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:41.980
this case in the information
 

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.440
this case in the information
architecture portion of the design

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:43.450
architecture portion of the design
 

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.060
architecture portion of the design
process you really have to think about

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:45.070
process you really have to think about
 

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.280
process you really have to think about
you know how do i best communicate my my

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:47.290
you know how do i best communicate my my
 

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:48.640
you know how do i best communicate my my
existing

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:48.650

my current content and manifested in an

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:51.290
my current content and manifested in an
 

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.950
my current content and manifested in an
Android friendly way so if you take a

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960
Android friendly way so if you take a
 

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.360
Android friendly way so if you take a
look at an example of Gmail for example

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:55.370
look at an example of Gmail for example
 

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.970
look at an example of Gmail for example
a property which existed on the web and

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:57.980
a property which existed on the web and
 

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.390
a property which existed on the web and
elsewhere long before Android came along

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400
elsewhere long before Android came along
 

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.830
elsewhere long before Android came along
Android does not dictate anything at all

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840
Android does not dictate anything at all
 

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.450
Android does not dictate anything at all
about this you know he's obviously using

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:04.460
about this you know he's obviously using
 

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.280
about this you know he's obviously using
some hand Roy interaction patterns and

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.290
some hand Roy interaction patterns and
 

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.260
some hand Roy interaction patterns and
visual design here but the information

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:08.270
visual design here but the information
 

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:10.230
visual design here but the information
architecture there basically and

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240
architecture there basically and
 

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.910
architecture there basically and
messages conversations labels and so

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:12.920
messages conversations labels and so
 

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.820
messages conversations labels and so
forth this is purely dictated by the

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:15.830
forth this is purely dictated by the
 

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:17.800
forth this is purely dictated by the
product by Gmail so Android has no

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:17.810
product by Gmail so Android has no
 

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:20.020
product by Gmail so Android has no
bearing yeah yeah and it's very

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:20.030
bearing yeah yeah and it's very
 

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.430
bearing yeah yeah and it's very
important to make sure that when a user

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440
important to make sure that when a user
 

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:24.040
important to make sure that when a user
comes from the web to Gmail not that

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:24.050
comes from the web to Gmail not that
 

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.810
comes from the web to Gmail not that
they immediately see the same exact

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:25.820
they immediately see the same exact
 

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.220
they immediately see the same exact
things like you don't want them to see

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:27.230
things like you don't want them to see
 

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.010
things like you don't want them to see
the exact same you know visuals maybe

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:30.020
the exact same you know visuals maybe
 

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.040
the exact same you know visuals maybe
not even necessarily the exact same I

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.050
not even necessarily the exact same I
 

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:35.170
not even necessarily the exact same I
guess ordering of content but you do

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:35.180
guess ordering of content but you do
 

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.220
guess ordering of content but you do
generally want them to immediately

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:36.230
generally want them to immediately
 

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.620
generally want them to immediately
understand where things are and what you

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.630
understand where things are and what you
 

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.900
understand where things are and what you
know kind of that all the things that

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:40.910
know kind of that all the things that
 

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.420
know kind of that all the things that
they expect to be there are there right

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:43.430
they expect to be there are there right
 

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:48.340
they expect to be there are there right
so the next slice we're looking at is an

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:48.350
so the next slice we're looking at is an
 

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.280
so the next slice we're looking at is an
interaction design so here we say that

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:51.290
interaction design so here we say that
 

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.380
interaction design so here we say that
it is actually more important to get a

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:53.390
it is actually more important to get a
 

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.620
it is actually more important to get a
lot closer to two holo and to the

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:56.630
lot closer to two holo and to the
 

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.810
lot closer to two holo and to the
Android design patterns then to anything

00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:58.820
Android design patterns then to anything
 

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.930
Android design patterns then to anything
like really really a spoke the reason

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:01.940
like really really a spoke the reason
 

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.700
like really really a spoke the reason
being that while users kind of like

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:03.710
being that while users kind of like
 

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.200
being that while users kind of like
might know your brand and so on when

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.210
might know your brand and so on when
 

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.820
might know your brand and so on when
they're on in the context of a mobile

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:06.830
they're on in the context of a mobile
 

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.620
they're on in the context of a mobile
device when I'm on my Android phone and

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:08.630
device when I'm on my Android phone and
 

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.720
device when I'm on my Android phone and
I'm using you know multiple apps like

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:10.730
I'm using you know multiple apps like
 

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.370
I'm using you know multiple apps like
it's very important that your

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:12.380
it's very important that your
 

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.530
it's very important that your
application works the same way as the

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:14.540
application works the same way as the
 

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.630
application works the same way as the
rest those applications that can be used

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:16.640
rest those applications that can be used
 

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.090
rest those applications that can be used
side-by-side so this is where I think

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:19.100
side-by-side so this is where I think
 

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.410
side-by-side so this is where I think
interaction patterns such as the

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:20.420
interaction patterns such as the
 

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.870
interaction patterns such as the
navigation are really really critical

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880
navigation are really really critical
 

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.280
navigation are really really critical
that a user instantly knows how to use

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.290
that a user instantly knows how to use
 

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.730
that a user instantly knows how to use
your application and some users will

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:27.740
your application and some users will
 

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.410
your application and some users will
have multiple devices maybe different

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:29.420
have multiple devices maybe different
 

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.760
have multiple devices maybe different
OSS you know what I might use the

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:30.770
OSS you know what I might use the
 

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.490
OSS you know what I might use the
website for one thing and the phone for

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:33.500
website for one thing and the phone for
 

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.380
website for one thing and the phone for
something else but in our kind of a

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:35.390
something else but in our kind of a
 

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:38.560
something else but in our kind of a
research and experience users tend to do

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:38.570
research and experience users tend to do
 

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.690
research and experience users tend to do
like kind of a context switch when they

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:40.700
like kind of a context switch when they
 

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.700
like kind of a context switch when they
switch between these devices so I don't

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:42.710
switch between these devices so I don't
 

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.430
switch between these devices so I don't
expect you know an application on an

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440
expect you know an application on an
 

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.080
expect you know an application on an
Android phone to function exactly like

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:47.090
Android phone to function exactly like
 

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:49.060
Android phone to function exactly like
the web site I expect it to function

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.070
the web site I expect it to function
 

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.620
the web site I expect it to function
like an Android app and I kind of expect

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:50.630
like an Android app and I kind of expect
 

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.020
like an Android app and I kind of expect
that to happen and one thing one kind of

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.030
that to happen and one thing one kind of
 

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.430
that to happen and one thing one kind of
like point we wanted to make is that

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440
like point we wanted to make is that
 

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.260
like point we wanted to make is that
bespoke interactions which kind of key

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.270
bespoke interactions which kind of key
 

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.930
bespoke interactions which kind of key
to your brand are fine that's absolute

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:57.940
to your brand are fine that's absolute
 

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.840
to your brand are fine that's absolute
okay but it's kind of if you do have an

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:00.850
okay but it's kind of if you do have an
 

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:02.430
okay but it's kind of if you do have an
interaction which is at odds with the

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440
interaction which is at odds with the
 

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.889
interaction which is at odds with the
Android design patterns it's working out

00:22:04.889 --> 00:22:04.899
Android design patterns it's working out
 

00:22:04.899 --> 00:22:06.389
Android design patterns it's working out
where it makes sense to back off and

00:22:06.389 --> 00:22:06.399
where it makes sense to back off and
 

00:22:06.399 --> 00:22:07.649
where it makes sense to back off and
where it makes sense to do something

00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:07.659
where it makes sense to do something
 

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:10.350
where it makes sense to do something
more than spoke as an example kind of

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:10.360
more than spoke as an example kind of
 

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.810
more than spoke as an example kind of
outside of the mobile context I mean on

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:12.820
outside of the mobile context I mean on
 

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.119
outside of the mobile context I mean on
websites right or on the web

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:15.129
websites right or on the web
 

00:22:15.129 --> 00:22:17.970
websites right or on the web
you have the full breadth of HTML and

you have the full breadth of HTML and
 

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.639
you have the full breadth of HTML and
CSS and styling and stuff to kind of

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:20.649
CSS and styling and stuff to kind of
 

00:22:20.649 --> 00:22:23.190

communicate your your content right but

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200
communicate your your content right but
 

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.200
communicate your your content right but
almost every website at the top left

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.210
almost every website at the top left
 

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:27.690
almost every website at the top left
they have a logo their navigation is

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:27.700
they have a logo their navigation is
 

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.639
they have a logo their navigation is
either at the top or along the left side

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:29.649
either at the top or along the left side
 

00:22:29.649 --> 00:22:31.019
either at the top or along the left side
and that's really just something that

00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:31.029
and that's really just something that
 

00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:33.180
and that's really just something that
that's in the culture and kind of the

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.190
that's in the culture and kind of the
 

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:36.240
that's in the culture and kind of the
core of the web right so people kind of

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:36.250
core of the web right so people kind of
 

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.889
core of the web right so people kind of
expect that so that's that's something

00:22:37.889 --> 00:22:37.899
expect that so that's that's something
 

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:39.330
expect that so that's that's something
where you know you want to you know take

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:39.340
where you know you want to you know take
 

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.100
where you know you want to you know take
your your information architecture your

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.110
your your information architecture your
 

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.810
your your information architecture your
content you know bring it to the web but

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:42.820
content you know bring it to the web but
 

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.919
content you know bring it to the web but
you want to make sure that you use

00:22:43.919 --> 00:22:43.929
you want to make sure that you use
 

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:47.070
you want to make sure that you use
interactions that are very understood on

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080
interactions that are very understood on
 

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.320
interactions that are very understood on
Android or not on Android on the web and

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:49.330
Android or not on Android on the web and
 

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.299
Android or not on Android on the web and
it's the same thing on Android so now

00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:51.309
it's the same thing on Android so now
 

00:22:51.309 --> 00:22:52.320
it's the same thing on Android so now
you really want to make sure that when

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.330
you really want to make sure that when
 

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:54.060
you really want to make sure that when
you come to a platform you bring your

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:54.070
you come to a platform you bring your
 

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.619
you come to a platform you bring your
stuff you bring your luggage and stuff

00:22:55.619 --> 00:22:55.629
stuff you bring your luggage and stuff
 

00:22:55.629 --> 00:22:57.480
stuff you bring your luggage and stuff

take a look at so we've got four things

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799
take a look at so we've got four things
 

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:11.190
take a look at so we've got four things
which are kind of slightly beyond

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200

information architecture here but

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480
information architecture here but
 

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.509
information architecture here but
they're kind of blending that with the

00:23:42.509 --> 00:23:42.519
they're kind of blending that with the
 

00:23:42.519 --> 00:23:43.710
they're kind of blending that with the
Android design so when it comes to

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720
Android design so when it comes to
 

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.360
Android design so when it comes to
things like navigation and performing

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.370
things like navigation and performing
 

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.909
things like navigation and performing
important actions here they kind of like

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919
important actions here they kind of like
 

00:23:47.919 --> 00:23:49.919
important actions here they kind of like
get much closer to the action bar

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:49.929
get much closer to the action bar
 

00:23:49.929 --> 00:23:51.600
get much closer to the action bar
paradigm so while it's not kind of a

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:51.610
paradigm so while it's not kind of a
 

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.610
paradigm so while it's not kind of a
stock action bar it's been customized

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:53.620
stock action bar it's been customized
 

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.499
stock action bar it's been customized
slightly and it's very very important

00:23:55.499 --> 00:23:55.509
slightly and it's very very important
 

00:23:55.509 --> 00:23:57.060
slightly and it's very very important
that users kind of familiar with that

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.070
that users kind of familiar with that
 

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.190
that users kind of familiar with that
and kind of understand all right this is

00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200
and kind of understand all right this is
 

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.049
and kind of understand all right this is
how I navigate hierarchically or this is

00:24:01.049 --> 00:24:01.059
how I navigate hierarchically or this is
 

00:24:01.059 --> 00:24:02.519
how I navigate hierarchically or this is
how I perform actions or this is where

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:02.529
how I perform actions or this is where
 

00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:03.620
how I perform actions or this is where
I'll look for

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:03.630
I'll look for
 

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.640
I'll look for
supplemental actions exactly and the

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:07.650
supplemental actions exactly and the
 

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.380
supplemental actions exactly and the
next example is kind of like the

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:09.390
next example is kind of like the
 

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.490
next example is kind of like the
canonical example of that kind of

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500
canonical example of that kind of
 

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.260
canonical example of that kind of
marking of bespoke interaction is

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:12.270
marking of bespoke interaction is
 

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.420
marking of bespoke interaction is
something like Flipboard so Flipboard

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:14.430
something like Flipboard so Flipboard
 

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.730
something like Flipboard so Flipboard
whole kind of value propositions brought

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740
whole kind of value propositions brought
 

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.860
whole kind of value propositions brought
up and it's kind of magazines which you

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:18.870
up and it's kind of magazines which you
 

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.960
up and it's kind of magazines which you
can flip around so that's also a very

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:20.970
can flip around so that's also a very
 

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.950
can flip around so that's also a very
custom interaction for navigation which

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960
custom interaction for navigation which
 

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.410
custom interaction for navigation which
is fine but when it comes to kind of

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:27.420
is fine but when it comes to kind of
 

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.610
is fine but when it comes to kind of
other other things like you know

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:28.620
other other things like you know
 

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.050
other other things like you know
performing actions or hierarchical

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.060
performing actions or hierarchical
 

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.850
performing actions or hierarchical
navigation they do get much closer to

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:31.860
navigation they do get much closer to
 

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.520
navigation they do get much closer to
the Android and design pattern so using

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:34.530
the Android and design pattern so using
 

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.770
the Android and design pattern so using
kind of the action bar affordances so

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:36.780
kind of the action bar affordances so
 

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.360
kind of the action bar affordances so
I'd love to see them get slightly closer

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:38.370
I'd love to see them get slightly closer
 

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.890
I'd love to see them get slightly closer
to kind of more of a stock action bar

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:39.900
to kind of more of a stock action bar
 

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.720
to kind of more of a stock action bar
presentation but largely they're kind of

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:41.730
presentation but largely they're kind of
 

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.280
presentation but largely they're kind of
like following the spirit of oh I know

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:43.290
like following the spirit of oh I know
 

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:45.020

patterns so a visual design yeah so uh

00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720
patterns so a visual design yeah so uh
 

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.240

interactions on Android are swiping and

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:22.340
interactions on Android are swiping and
 

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.640
interactions on Android are swiping and
scrolling and I'd say that both of those

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:24.650
scrolling and I'd say that both of those
 

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:26.049

you know it looks very very custom but
 

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.930
you know it looks very very custom but
you know as soon as you open up the app

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:31.940
you know as soon as you open up the app
 

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:33.490
you know as soon as you open up the app
you kind of start swiping around and
