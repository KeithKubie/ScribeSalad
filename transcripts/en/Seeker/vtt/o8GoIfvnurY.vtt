00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.489
Given the racialized violence we have seen
in our country, it is clear the civil rights

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.820
movement is NOT over and America is still
plagued with racist ideology.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.740
But what does science say about race?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.150
What if science could help us erase racism
once and for all?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.150
Hey everyone!

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.480
I’m Natalia Reagan back at it again at DNews!

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.180
First of all, it’s time that we start teaching
our kids as soon as they can talk (and adults

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.430
for that matter!) that there is no biological
basis for racial classification!

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.420
In terms of biology, race doesn’t exist.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.480
That’s not to say race isn’t real!

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.910
Though, it’s important to understand that
it’s a cultural construct, that humans created

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.250
and has nothing to do with our biology!

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.290
There are no distinct genetics boundaries
for the groups commonly called races.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.320
Traditionally, scientists have used ‘race’
to refer to a subspecies, and what determines

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680
a subspecies from species varies among taxa.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
But in humans, there are no distinct genetics
boundaries for the groups commonly called

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.059
races and we have only .1% variation within
our species versus chimpanzees which have

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.730
.7% variation.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.379
Now, there IS genetic variation within and
between populations but it is quite small.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.960
And the most amount of genetic variation found
within our species isn’t between those of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.530
European and African ancestry, it’s between
various populations within Africa.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.280
This is called the “founder effect” or
a “reduced genetic diversity in a population

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.320
founded by a small number of individuals”.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.940
Scientists refer to races as ‘populations’
or ‘ethnic groups’ And many of the physical

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.670
characteristics that are associated with race
are due to adaptations to climate and environment.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.460
This can include skin color, height, nose
shape.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.610
These slight morphological differences are
called clines- they are genetic adaptations

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.170
to the environment over time and a geographic
area.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.909
As biological anthropologist Todd Disotell
says, ‘it’s about clines not clades!’

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.320
Meaning that the variations between populations
of our species are rather small versus being

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.400
another branch in the ol’ evolutionary family
tree.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.590
There is also the idea that certain races
are more susceptible to certain illnesses,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.780
such as heart disease and diabetes in African
Americans.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.910
However, extensive research has shown that
these illnesses are highly correlated with

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.659
diet, stress, and socioeconomic standing-
thus, it’s a lot more complex than just

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.429
saying certain ‘races’ are more likely
to suffer from certain illnesses than others.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.670
Ok, we’ve established that race as a scientific
concept does not exist, so if race doesn’t

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.890
exist then WHY are people racist?

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.910
Are we born to be wary of ‘the other’
or is this learned behavior?

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.510
Biological anthropologist Robert Sussman’s
tackles the history of racism and the concept

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.540
of race in his book “The Myth of Race”.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.720
He stresses that racism is a learned behavior
or ideology that can be avoided if parents

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.950
teach their children to be open and tolerant.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.530
Sussman also discusses the history of racism
stating that “concept of human races began

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.000
during the Spanish Inquisition (around 1480),
when a purity of blood decree was established

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.550
and those converting to Christianity (or converses)
needed to prove their Christian origins.”

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.660
Searching for ‘pure blood’ is a ridiculous
idea considering there has never been a point

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.810
in time when any population could be considered
'pure'.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.280
This ideology, rooted in a racist political
and religious agenda, continued on and was

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.160
used by the Nazis to justify their goal to
create an “Aryan Race” which led to the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.600
murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others
who were deemed inferior- including gypsys,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.270
homosexual and transgender individuals.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.910
But what if the Nazi agenda worked?

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.960
Sure we would probably all speak German, but
we might also have a population of people

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.180
who are considered ‘purer’ in terms of
lower genetic diversity.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.490
But low genetic diversity is usually the result
of long-term inbreeding.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.920
So, we’d have a population of inbreds that
would also inherit a slew of genetic ailments

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.650
associated with inbreeding.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.650
Yeah.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.909
How’s that for the not-so-fabulous result
of genetic ‘purity’?

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.199
And guess what!?

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.830
Genetic diversity is actually good for us!

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.380
It leads to robust and healthy offspring,
and who doesn’t want that?

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.240
Scientifically speaking, there’s only one
race- the human race!

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.780
We’re all pretty much the same.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.330
