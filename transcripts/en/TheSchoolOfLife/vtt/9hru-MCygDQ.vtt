00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.000
In another incident today

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.000
ten people died in a terrible (inaudible) crash

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.200
there was a huge fireball...

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.600
Female Reporter: After days of torrential rain the

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.980
landslide completely buried the house killing the

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.180
inhabitants, 32

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.680
Male Reporter 2: Shortly after take-off the plane's left-handed

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.260
jet blew up. Passengers reported hearing a bang before (fades)

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
Female Reporter 2: When the giant crocodile rushed to him and ate his leg

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.940
in one bite.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.120
Alain: We all love watching news of disasters.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.120
It's embarrassing, but true.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.440
We like hearing about car crashes,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.700
we really love plane crashes,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.240
we're fascinated by landslides,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.760
We quite enjoy train dropping incidents,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.400
we're fascinated by deadly scorpions that bite holiday-makers,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.120
and we're really pretty gripped by crocodiles.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.580
It all looks like the lowest distraction.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.060
What monsters we are; rubber-necking the scenes of tragedy on the worst day of other people's lives.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.940
But it isn't all trivial.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.200
We're trying to get at something important by looking at tragedy.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.000
We're trying, somehow, to keep in mind that life is fragile for all of us.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.440
It might not be a plane crash that finishes us off,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:05.860
or a fierce crocodile.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.920
It might just be a slow cancer or the gradual wearing away of time, but it will happen.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.480
And yet our lives go wrong because we don't keep death in mind enough.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:23.440
Death is the most terrible thing, but we can evoke the thought of death to evoke what life should be about.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.980
It's this powerful fact that may be at the back of our minds when we rush to check up on the latest disaster.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.740
We're not being ghoulish.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.120
We're simply searching for the meaning of life.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120
We're reminding ourselves to do our hopes and talents justice in the time that remains.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.460
The thought of death has the power not only to stir our fears, but also to strengthen our resolve to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.200
appreciate more fully and use more wisely the present moment.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.580
To reform our priorities and to be kind, grateful, and serious.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.280
In case tomorrow never comes.
