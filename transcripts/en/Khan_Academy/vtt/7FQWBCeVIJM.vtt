00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.390
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we
can evaluate the indefinite

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.200
integral x over two times sine of

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.638
two x squared plus two, dx.

00:00:07.638 --> 00:00:08.976
And try to pause the video and

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:11.669
see if you can work
through it on your own.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.968
So, let's see what is going on here.

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:16.940
So, I have this x over
two, and then I have

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.215
sine of two x squared plus two.

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.814
Now, if I were just taking
the indefinite integral of

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:26.576
sine of x, that is pretty straightforward.

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:28.433
The indefinite integral of sine of x.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:32.682
Well, we know that the
derivative of cosine of x

00:00:32.682 --> 00:00:35.297
is equal to negative sine of x.

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:39.105
So if I were to take the
derivative of negative cosine of x,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.627
that's going to be positive sine of x.

00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:44.019
So this is just going to
be negative cosine of x.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.782
And I could have made that even clearer.

00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:49.661
I could have put a negative
here and then a negative here.

00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:51.774
And you see, well look,
the anti-derivative of

00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:54.119
negative sine of x is just
cosine of x, and then I have

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.975
this negative out here,
negative cosine of x.

00:00:56.975 --> 00:00:58.113
But that's not what I have here.

00:00:58.113 --> 00:00:59.877
I don't have sine of x.

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:03.221
I have sine of two x squared plus two.

00:01:03.221 --> 00:01:05.984
But then I have this other
thing with an x here,

00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:08.445
and so what your brain
might be doing, or it's good

00:01:08.445 --> 00:01:09.760
once you get enough
practice when your brain

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.684
will start doing this, say
okay, this is interesting.

00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:17.552
This kind of looks like
the derivative of this.

00:01:17.552 --> 00:01:20.246
And this is, if we were to call this...

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.894
I'm tired of that orange.

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:24.263
If we were to call a...

00:01:24.263 --> 00:01:27.583
Why am I doing this,
color changing this...

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:30.114
If we were to call this f of x.

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:33.457
If two x squared plus two is f of x,

00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:36.917
Two x squared plus two is f of x.

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:38.891
What is f prime of x?

00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:42.211
Well, then f prime of x, f prime of x

00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:45.020
is going to be four x.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.364
And this thing right over
here isn't exactly four x,

00:01:48.364 --> 00:01:50.941
but we can make it, we can
do a little rearranging,

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:52.683
multiplying and dividing by a constant,

00:01:52.683 --> 00:01:54.192
so this becomes four x.

00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:57.907
What if, what if we were to...

00:01:57.907 --> 00:02:00.127
What if we were to multiply
and divide by four,

00:02:00.127 --> 00:02:03.981
so we multiply by four there
and then we divide by four,

00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.086
and then we take it out
of the integral sign.

00:02:06.086 --> 00:02:08.918
And even better let's take this
two out so let's just take.

00:02:08.918 --> 00:02:10.953
So, let's take the one half out of here,

00:02:10.953 --> 00:02:12.415
so this is going to be one half.

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:15.713
And so I could have rewritten
the original integral as

00:02:15.713 --> 00:02:18.336
one half times one
fourth, so it's one eighth

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:22.121
times the integral, times the integral

00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:25.243
of four x

00:02:25.243 --> 00:02:27.403
times sine

00:02:27.403 --> 00:02:32.046
of two x squared plus two, dx.

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.779
Well, now this is interesting,

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:37.448
because if this is f of x, if...

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:40.620
If this business right
over here if f of x,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.127
so we're essentially
taking sine of f of x,

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:46.678
then this business right over here is

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:50.090
f prime of x, which is a
good signal to us that, hey,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.574
the reverse chain rule
is applicable over here.

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:55.593
We can rewrite this, we
can also rewrite this as,

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:58.356
this is going to be equal to one.

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:02.628
We can rewrite this as, the
same things as one eighth...

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:03.284
They're the same colors.

00:03:03.284 --> 00:03:06.372
I'm using a new art program,
and sometimes the color

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:08.763
changing isn't as obvious as it should be.

00:03:08.763 --> 00:03:13.443
So one eighth times the
integral of f prime of x,

00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:19.005
f prime of x

00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:22.377
times sine,

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:25.162
sine of f of x,

00:03:25.162 --> 00:03:28.180
sine of f of x, dx,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.502
throw that f of x in there.

00:03:30.502 --> 00:03:33.033
So, sine of f of x.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.007
And so when you view it
this way, you say, hey,

00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:37.352
by the reverse chain rule, I have...

00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:41.253
I have a function, and I have
its derivative here, so I can

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.775
really just take the antiderivative
with respect to this.

00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:45.470
This is essentially what
we're doing in u-substitution.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.745
You could do u-substitution
here, you could set u

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:51.632
equalling this, and then du
is going to be four x dx.

00:03:51.632 --> 00:03:53.207
But now we're getting a little
practice, starting to do a

00:03:53.207 --> 00:03:55.366
little bit more in our heads.

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:58.756
So, what would this interval
integrate out to be?

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:02.925
Well, this would be one eighth times...

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:07.571
Well, if you take the
antiderivative of sine of f of x

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:10.148
with respect to f of x,
well, we already saw that

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:13.004
that's negative cosine of
x, so this is going to be

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:17.160
times negative cosine,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.178
negative cosine of f of x.

00:04:20.178 --> 00:04:23.644
Negative cosine of f of x,

00:04:23.644 --> 00:04:25.478
negative cosine of f of x.

00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:28.068
Woops, I was going for the blue there.

00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:32.087
And then of course you have your plus c.

00:04:32.087 --> 00:04:34.408
So what is this going to be?

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:35.686
Well, instead of just saying f pri..

00:04:35.686 --> 00:04:38.170
Instead of saying in terms
of f of x, we just say it

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.517
in terms of two x squared.

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:40.654
This is going to be...

00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:44.253
Or two x squared plus two
is going to be one eighth.

00:04:44.253 --> 00:04:47.040
Times, I have a function
and I have its derivative,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.502
so I can really just
integrate with respect

00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:51.080
to that function, so
it's going to be times

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.073
negative negative cosine

00:04:55.073 --> 00:04:57.851
of two x squared plus two,

00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.357
two x squared plus two,

00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:04.561
and then, of course, I have my...

00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:06.163
I keep switching to that color.

00:05:06.163 --> 00:05:09.948
I have my plus c, and of
course, I could just take the

00:05:09.948 --> 00:05:12.409
negative out, it would be
negative one eighth cosine

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.195
of this business and then plus c.

00:05:15.195 --> 00:05:16.403
And we're done.

00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:18.237
We have just employed
the reverse chain rule.

00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:21.302
We could have used
substitution, but hopefully

00:05:21.302 --> 00:05:22.765
we're getting a little
bit of practice here.

00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:24.576
Hey, I'm seeing something
here, and I'm seeing

00:05:24.576 --> 00:05:27.292
it's derivative, so let me
just integrate with respect

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:29.104
to this thing, which is
really what you would set

00:05:29.104 --> 00:05:31.843
u to be equal to here,
integrating with respect to the u,

00:05:31.843 --> 00:05:33.329
and you have your du here.

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:37.277
This times this is du, so you're, like,

00:05:37.277 --> 00:05:39.738
integrating sine of u, du.

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:42.199
I encourage you to try to
use u-substitution here,

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:45.727
and you'll see it's the exact
same thing that we just did.
