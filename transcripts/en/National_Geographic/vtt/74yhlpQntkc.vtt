00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.734
WOMAN: Here's my first letter.

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:05.367
It tells me I got
to have re-sampling.

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:07.633
A month later, a little
over a month later,

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.800
again, my well water
is not safe to drink.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.266
Then the third letter I get
says my water is safe to drink,

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:16.800
almost 11 months later.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.567
[inaudible] are leading in the
nation in coal ash clean up.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:24.467
This ain't leading no
nation in coal ash cleanup.

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:27.433
Telling people to drink
contaminated water

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:30.367
that you have told me
twice not to drink--

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:33.767
that's not being a leader.

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:38.333
What you have is a system
guaranteed to pollute,

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:40.567
a system a primitive
storage we wouldn't

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.333
allow anyone else
to do, and a system

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.233
that is primed for catastrophe.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.100
Every day they are
polluting groundwater rivers

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.333
and lakes with toxic metals.

00:00:54.333 --> 00:00:57.500
The companies have a
reason not to clean up--

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.000
they can't afford to and
still make coal profitable.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.800
If you took all the profit
that's made burning coal,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.233
it's not enough hours to
clean up after the mess

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.200
that coal leaves behind.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.633
Coal ash is an enormous
problem across this country.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:14.567
There are about 1,000 coal ash
sites with very heavy levels

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:16.800
of pollution,
ultimately ending up

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.834
in some waterway that people are
relying on for drinking water.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:26.000
It's a ticking time bomb
for millions of Americans.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.033
OK, what you need, baby?

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:27.867
Gas.

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:28.834
Go on, go on.

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:29.667
Fill her up.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.633
Send her on down.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.800
We know that Duke Energy is
never going to admit this,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.300
because if they do,
there's six other states

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.100
waiting to pound on them.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.367
We know that.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.367
We just want them to
do the right thing.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.700
Clean the mess up.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.500
Clean up their own trash
on their own property,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.467
just like they would
expect us to do.

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.400
And provide us clean safe water.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.834
We know too much now to
turn around and back up.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:56.734
And we are not going away.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.166
