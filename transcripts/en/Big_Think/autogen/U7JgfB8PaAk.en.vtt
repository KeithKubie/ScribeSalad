00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.770
I still believe in the saying of this oath
Frankford School fellow traveler Marxist Valter

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:19.220
Benjamin who said that behind every rise of
fascism there is a failed revolution.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.869
I think even if we strategically, I'm not
sure about it, accept this term Islam fascism

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:33.390
for Islamic fundamentalist, this so called
Islam fundamentalism is strictly relative

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.050
with the disintegration of secular Islamic
left, which was pretty strong in the '50s,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.829
'60s and so on, but then began to disintegrate.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.740
So I think we shouldn't be too fascinated
with this phenomenon.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.730
We should rather ask what happened with the
left.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.949
I think this phenomenon of right wing populism
are strictly the obverse of something that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:00:59.989
did not happen.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.220
They didn't just happen, they happened because
something else didn't happen because the left

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.490
didn't provide a proper answer.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.040
And that's for me the true tragedy today.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.080
On the one hand we are entering a period,
and we are already in this period for almost

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.050
ten years, where rage, discontent are exploding
everywhere, even in our Western countries,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.380
Occupy Wall Street in Europe, the demonstrations
in France, Greece and so on.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.909
On the other hand it is as if the left, even
if it succeeds in, sometimes not always, in

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:53.149
recapturing the energy of this rage cannot
really offer a new political model that would

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:01.610
be not only seductive enough to mobilize millions
of people, but even in itself it doesn't have

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.340
enough consistency.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.990
What I'm saying is this, in Europe we didn't
yet fully accept the fact that the 20th century

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.990
is over.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:20.520
By this I mean the following: The 20th century
left, which had basically three strengths

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.600
orientations, Stalinist communism, that's
over.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.330
Not only it's over, in a beautiful irony where
ex-communists are still in power they are

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.970
mostly the most efficient agents of the most
ruthless new liberal global capitalism.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.770
Do you know what I mean?

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.940
If you want to be a successful capitalist
today don't go to Western Europe, go to China

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.770
where every Chinese will tell you the main
function, almost, of the communist party is

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.440
to prevent the formation of an independent
working movement trade unions to keep workers

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.840
under control, Vietnam the same story and
so on.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.970
So, old Stalinism is no longer operative.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:11.810
Unfortunately because of the change economic
situation and so on, also we don't have new

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.230
social democracy.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.900
Social democracy in the sense of the old welfare
state it simply belongs to another era.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.760
It would have to be radically reinvented,
it didn't happen.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.630
Which is why unfortunately some even right
wing analysts who claim that social democracy

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.530
where it still exists is today the greatest
conservative force.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.330
In a way tragically they are right because
almost all the struggles of social democracy

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.550
today is to keep the old rights, you know,
no they will not take from us, I don't know,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:56.120
health insurance or whatever like to stick
to the rights which were gained 30/40 years

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.380
ago.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.730
Now of course I absolutely sympathize with
it, but so many things are happening.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.440
Can you even imagine how our lives at all
levels were revolutionized through digitization,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.160
through new forms of science, new forms of
liberal capitalism?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.799
I don't think that a simple return to old
social democratic welfare state can work.

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.650
Then we have a third orientation subterranean
one, which still is popular among some people.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:37.010
This idea of rejecting big state representation
mechanism, political parties, state power

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.400
and to opt for local democracy, transparent
local communities managing their affairs.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.870
I also think that we have to drop this last
dream.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.390
It doesn't work.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:59.411
It's good when it happens but if nothing else
today's problems are global problems in a

00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:01.410
much more radical sense.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.460
Think about what is happening with capitalism.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.210
I know works that are popular at least in
Europe Jeremiah Ripken, Paul Basin, this idea

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.910
which I find wonderfully attractive, although
I think they're simply fighting a little bit

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:24.720
too much, namely what is happening today with
digitalization, biogenetics and so on, is

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:33.090
almost a new beautiful example of the most
orthodox Marxism when they say with the development

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:40.370
of productive forces a new situation emerges
where old relationship production no longer

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.960
can cope with, isn't this happening today?

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.610
Everybody knows even, the how is that guy
called from Tesla boss Elon Musk or what,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.360
he said recently private property will no
longer work.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.250
We will have to introduce some kind of citizens
general income plus government; we have to

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.250
pay for it.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.000
So everybody knows that, at least the way
we know it the model of capitalism is reaching

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.370
its limits.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.901
On the one hand with so-called cooperative
commons, free circulation and so on, it's

00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:14.210
over.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.860
The market economy is approaching its limit.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:27.550
Of course, there are attempts, even very successful,
to re-privatize we took over again these commons.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:35.120
For example, Internet, ideal place of commons,
we all communicate and so on, but you know

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:42.280
you have Facebook controlling private communication,
if you want to buy books and so on all this

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.540
it's controlled intellectual exchanges by
Amazon.com, just name them, software controlled

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.620
by Microsoft and so on.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.750
But nonetheless, it's clear that capitalism
is approaching a limit.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:02.730
Okay, but I don't believe in this simplistic
answer where they say oh this is this self-organization

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.510
without central power and so on and so on.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:14.860
No, I think the big task today is precisely
to reinvent large-scale very strong social

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.080
political agents structures with strong authority.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.990
Just think, for example, about biogenetics.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.510
Tremendous things are happening today.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:35.110
We really are on the edge of creating a new
man like reconstructing through biogenetic

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.470
interventions our genetics and so on.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.580
Who will control this?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.500
Should these be privatized and so on?

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.560
Intellectual property.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.690
Everybody knows it's a mess, it's ridiculous
how big companies try to control it.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.310
Ecology, it's no longer this individualist
approach which is very intelligently supported

00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:05.400
I hope you noted this by big companies and
state apparatuses, the way to divest us or

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:13.120
redirect us from really approaching the big
problems by addressing us as individuals,

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:19.169
responsible individuals like let's say, simply
by situation, you criticize big companies

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:25.120
for polluting environment and a typical ideologist
today would tell you, but what did you do?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.150
Who are you to criticize it?

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.730
Did you recycle all your Coke cans?

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.010
Did you put all newspaper aside and so on
and so on?

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.669
And this works wonderful.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:45.050
It redirects your attention to yourself and
then it makes you feel guilty, at the same

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:52.029
time it offers you an easy way out, redirect,
buy organic food and so on and you can go

00:08:52.029 --> 00:08:54.250
on living the way you are.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:09:00.800
So back to the main points so I don't lose
myself, it's clear that we are approaching

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.210
different levels a critical moment.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.600
But the left, and this should be the natural
terrain traditionally of the left.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:20.830
The left was thriving in such critical moments,
now let's be frank, it doesn't have a solution.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.450
Let me give you a metaphor that I always like
to use for this.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:31.320
I hope our viewers have seen a movie I think
about ten years ago it was popular V for Vendetta.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.612
I will not go into the story.

00:09:33.612 --> 00:09:42.140
The point is that at the end there is a revolution
in England, imagine England the crowd breaks

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:48.630
through the police barrier penetrates the
British Parliament; the people take over and

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.230
the end of the film.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:58.060
My idea is that, sorry for this vulgar expression
but it expresses precisely how I feel, I would

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:05.270
like to see - I would sell my mother into
slavery to see a movie called V for Vendetta

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.790
Part II.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.880
Okay guys, people took over.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.070
What would they have done a day later?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.350
How would they re-organize the power?

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.620
The same stage how would they restructure
the power?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:25.730
This gap becomes like you could have touched
it.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:31.960
It becomes so obvious with here is a government,
big populous , they want referendum.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960
No.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:39.300
A day later as you know, literally almost
a day later they capitulated, they make a

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.800
deal with the European Union.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.250
Now for me it's too easy to criticize them
traders; they betrayed it.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.200
What could they have done?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:57.180
Give me – accept from these empty phrases
of we need more true democracy; people's voice

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.540
should be heard, what does this mean?

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.610
This is nonsense.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:07.610
Here I disagree softly with my otherwise good
friend I admire him, Yanie with his idea of

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.420
DM democratize Europe.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:17.589
I always am telling him let's take these two
cases how they dealt with the European Union,

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:22.000
I mean the Greek state and immigrants.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.950
But if the European Union were to be more
transparent in the sense of democratically

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:33.920
controlled, but in the simple sense of more
acting in accordance to the will of the majority,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.780
refugees would have been treated in a much
worse way.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:44.150
A big majority today in Europe of people,
I wouldn't say how big majority, but clearly

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:49.260
a majority are against any new immigrants
and so on.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:56.500
In this sense I write this about in the book
how this was a very simple but efficient right

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.700
wing criticism of Angela Merkel, where is
her sense of democracy?

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:06.339
She invited one million immigrants to enter
Germany.

00:12:06.339 --> 00:12:09.620
Who legitimized her in doing this?

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.910
I am on her side but in a very precise sense.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.900
I think we should take this very painful lesson,
the majority is not automatically right.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.630
Now, I'm not saying there should be a communist
party which is always right, I'm just saying

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:34.370
that a certain dose of healthy mistrust of
not democracy as such but will of the majority

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:38.560
is for me totally legitimate.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.600
People quite often are not right.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.700
And I think Angela Merkel did something that
great politicians do, you enforce a measure

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:56.360
knowing that the majority is against it hoping
that if you have enough time to enforce this

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:03.010
measure retroactively through its success
it will become acceptable to the majority,

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.010
but you have to take the risk.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:12.370
So, back to my big problem, I think that the
ultimate cause of all this populism and so

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:20.360
on is the simple fact that we live in an era
of great dissatisfaction rage and so on, but

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.130
the left doesn't have a model, it's all empty
praises.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.410
People should decide more through democracy,
blah, blah, blah, but what does it mean?

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:31.750
Like what to do?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.100
How to re-organize the state?

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:40.930
Because the big problem is this one, of course,
it's still the old Fukuyama problem I claim.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:47.130
You know Francis Fukuyama have forgotten today,
and I don't agree with him, but he was onto

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.180
something in that sense.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.870
Even today the majority of the politicians,
even the leftists, are Fukuyamaists in what

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:56.870
sense?

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:09.670
They think that liberal democratic capitalism
is the ultimate form and all we can do is

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:15.330
to render it better, you know, more health
service, more tolerance whatever you want,

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:20.760
more welfare, but the basic model is accepted.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:26.850
No one is asking the questions that people
were asking 40/50 years ago like is capitalism

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.170
the ultimate answer?

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.860
Can we imagine social organization beyond
state and so on and so on?

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:41.940
So that's for me the big problem is this let's
call it enlightened social democratic Fukuyamaism

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:48.820
like what Tony Blair stood for in the United
Kingdom.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.310
Is this enough or is something more radical
needed?

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:59.459
I think it is, not that I believe in any communist
revolution or whatever, but simply I think

00:14:59.459 --> 00:15:04.490
that the problems we are facing cannot be
resolved at this level.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.690
So, that's my sad prediction.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:17.580
Either a new form of the left will be reinvented
or here is my simple but I love it answer,

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.270
or look at Hollywood, I always trust Hollywood.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:26.269
Hollywood is warning us all the time Hunger
Games, Elysium and so on, that's the society

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:27.410
we are approaching.

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.980
Twenty percent of people live in the privileged
