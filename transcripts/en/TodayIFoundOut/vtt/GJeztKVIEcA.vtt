00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.350
The Surprising Truth About Cousins and Marriage

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.970
In modern western society, marrying your cousin
is not well accepted, particularly in the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.280
United States.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.880
Through a combination of old prejudices and
present-day conventional wisdom about inherited

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.320
birth defects, first cousin marriage is seen
by many as a little too close for comfort,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.490
as well as a bad idea if you want children.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
However, first cousin marriage is far more
common, and far less dangerous, than many

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.949
of us have been led to believe, as you’ll
soon see.

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.119
Further, if you include second cousins in
the mix, according to the Clinical Genetics

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.420
Handbook, the increased risks with regards
to having children are nearly non-existent

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.000
in this case compared with non-cousin marriage.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.789
So where did the taboo against cousin marriage
start?

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.360
While there have been instances of the banning
of marriage between cousins at various points

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.649
through history, such as the Roman Catholics
banning the practice for a time starting with

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.420
the Council of Agde in 506 AD, for the most
part marriage among cousins has been popular

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.550
as long as people have been getting married.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.850
In fact, it is estimated that as many as 80%
of the marriages in human history have been

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.550
between first or second cousins.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.980
This switch in cousin-marriage’s acceptance
began in earnest in some parts of the Western

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.800
world in the mid-19th century.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.760
Specifically, until the 1860s or so, first
cousins commonly married in Europe and the

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.760
U.S.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.130
In fact, Charles Darwin, Mr. Natural Selection
himself, was married to his first cousin Emma

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.130
Wedgwood.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.630
Nonetheless, the practice soon fell out of
fashion in the United States.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.540
Although never outlawed in England, during
the second half of the 19th century, many

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.380
states began to ban marriages between first
cousins, as part of a larger movement after

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.450
the Civil War for greater state involvement
in a variety of areas, including education,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.730
health and safety.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.190
Researchers note that the distinction in marriage
bans between England and the U.S. may be explained

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.390
by the fact that, in the United States, the
practice “was associated not with the aristocracy

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.800
and upper middle class [Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert were second cousins] but with

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.940
much easier targets: immigrants and the rural
poor.”

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.630
Regardless, cousin marriage bans began popping
up across the states, with the first in Kansas

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.630
in 1858.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.430
Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Washington and Wyoming banned

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
the practice in the 1860s, and many more had
enacted bans by the 1920s.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.200
The most recent state to ban cousin marriage
was Texas in 2005.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.100
Today, first cousin marriage is only allowed
without restriction in 19 states, and with

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.590
some restrictions in Arizona, Illinois, Indiana,
Maine, Utah, Wisconsin and North Carolina

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.520
(in North Carolina, while first cousins may
marry, “double cousins” may not- more

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.100
on this one in a bit.)

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.700
The distinction lies in the debate about whether
or not there is an increased risk that the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.690
partners’ shared genes will produce an increased
chance that their offspring will have recessive,

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.220
undesirable traits.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.560
A recent report on births in a British-Pakistani
community (where first cousin marriage is

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.720
very common) demonstrated that first cousin
children there were twice as likely to be

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.970
born with “potentially life threatening
birth defects” as compared with the children

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.050
of unrelated parents.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.990
Advocates on the other side point out that
this resulted in only a 6% chance for the

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.660
children in the study, as compared with a
3% chance for the population as a whole.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.800
For your reference, this increase in birth
defect rate is about the same as the increased

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.069
risk of a woman having a baby when she is
40 vs. when she is 30.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.000
Proponents here point out that few would advocate
banning a 40 year old woman from having children.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.220
They also point to recent testing that placed
the increased risk of spina bifida and cystic

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.840
fibrosis at only 1.7% to 2.8% higher than
for children of unrelated parents.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.930
Further, researchers point out that “the
widely accepted scare stories – even within

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.280
academia – and the belief that cousin marriage
is inevitably harmful have declined in the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.240
face of some of the data we’ve been producing.”

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.170
It should also be noted that some of the children
born with defects in the recent British study

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.790
may, in fact, have been double cousins (best
explained by an example):

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.209
“If a girl and her sister . . . meet two
brothers, they pair off . . and each couple

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.020
produces a baby . . . those kids [would be
double cousins]”

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.430
A community nurse who works among the Pakistani
community in the British study opined:

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.090
“A first cousin marries a first cousin and
the couple’s own grandparents are cousins,

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.090
too.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.370
I have heard of first-cousin marriages going
back generation after generation in some families.”

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.900
This brings us to cross-cousins vs. parallel
cousins.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.440
In some societies, first cousin marriage is
traditional and well-accepted, although many

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.610
make a distinction between “cross-cousins”
and “parallel cousins.”

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.330
Cross cousins have parents who are siblings,
but of the opposite sex.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.250
The parents of parallel cousins are also siblings
but are of the same sex.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.180
In cultures where cross cousins are encouraged
and parallel discouraged, it is often an inherited

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.470
taboo, passed down from when there was greater
inter-marriage and inter-mingling among the

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.040
members of an extended family – with a greater
chance that first cousins could also be half-siblings.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.840
As noted in the book The Evolution of Sex,
“Fathers who are also brothers may overtly

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.260
or covertly share sexual relations with the
wife of one or the other . . . . Likewise,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.460
mothers who are also sisters may overtly or
covertly share sexual access to the husband

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.150
of one or the other, raising the possibility
that apparent parallel cousins are actually

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.040
half-siblings, sired by the same father . . . .[With]
cross cousins, because in the absence of full-sibling

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.350
incest, it is unlikely [they] . . . can share
a father . . . [unless a] mother had a brother

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.710
whose wife was impregnated by [mother's husband].”

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.919
This is not very likely to happen in modern
societies that practice first-cousin marriage.

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.570
In fact, in a number of countries, including
the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Yemen and

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.250
in the Palestinian Territories, paternal parallel
cousin marriage is the preferred form of consanguineous

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.250
marriage.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.460
In the end, despite Western taboos today,
globally, cousin marriages are still going

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.080
strong, with an estimated 10% of all marriages
in the world being between cousins, and as

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.389
high as 50% in some regions of the world.

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.680
However, cousin marriage is making a comeback
in the U.S., as well, as more and more studies

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.900
continue to debunk the overblown risks once
commonly touted.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.680
First cousins marrying in 21st century America
discover that many states no longer regulate

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.760
the practice, despite perhaps having laws
against it.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.240
Likewise, most sects of Christianity do not
forbid it, which would be hard to do given

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.570
cases like Isaac and Rebekah in the Book of
Genesis.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.810
For instance, the Methodist Church, has “no
official position on marriage between cousins.”

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.460
Nonetheless, it’s not easy being in a first
cousin marriage in some regions of the world.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.520
As one man in such a relationship recently
discussed, some members of the couple’s

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.320
immediate family no longer speak to them and
have never met the couple’s children.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.419
On top of that, he stated,
“We don’t typically tell folks.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.120
We told our daughters, “It’s not something
to be ashamed of, but [don't] tell your friends

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.020
. . . people are fickle, and preteens and
teens can be downright cruel.”

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.040
Bonus Fact:
• Some famous individuals who married their

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.620
first cousins include: Albert Einstein (with
his second wife Elsa), H.G. Wells (with Isabel

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.050
Mary Wells), Saddam Hussein (with Sajida Talfah),
Christopher Robin Miln and his wife Leslie

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.770
(the former being of Winnie the Pooh fame),
and Edgar Allen Poe with Virginia Clemm, among

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.140
many, many more.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.729
A recent famous example of a second cousin
marriage was between Rudy Giuliani and (his

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:34.570
now ex-wife) Regina Peruggi.
