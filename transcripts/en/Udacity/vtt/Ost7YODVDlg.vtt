00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.560
So I understand how I can have different phenotypes, but

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.320
I can't really keep straight which alleles cause which phenotypes.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.410
&gt;&gt; That's a really good point, and there's actually a really good solution for

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.880
it, too. We can actually symbolize which

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.180
allele causes which phenotype. For example, we

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.260
can symbolize lactase persistence with the plus

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.170
sign or the positive sign here, and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.620
lactase non-persistence with the minus sign or

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.790
the negative sign. This means that the T

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.990
allele would be associated with the plus

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.830
symbol, and the C allele would be associated

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.480
with the minus symbol. So, if we rewrite

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.350
all of our allelic combinations that are possible

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.662
we'll remember that there are three possibilities. T/T,

00:00:40.662 --> 00:00:43.240
T/C or C/C. And now that means we

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.050
can have plus, plus. Plus minus and minus,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.380
minus. This gives us a far more functional

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.420
looking symbol that tells us maybe a little bit about the phenotype. Rather than

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.940
just the letter itself, which can be

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.510
hard to remember which phenotype it's associated with.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's a lot easier to follow now.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.280
&gt;&gt; Well, notice that in the case of lactose

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.830
intolerance, all you need is one allele of lactase

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.090
persistence, so that you can actually digest lactose in

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.270
the first place. Okay, but how is that possible?

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.630
&gt;&gt; Well, Remember, because all you need is some

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.140
lactase protein around the digest lactose at all. Having one allele,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.230
the T allele, will give you enough lactase protein at all

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.200
to be able to digest lactose. Let's think about it like

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.880
we did in our recipe analogy from lessons 3 and 4.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.720
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay. I'm with you.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
&gt;&gt; Alright. What we're going to do this time, is, instead of

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.700
using lots of different ingredients, we're going to use an ingredient, cheese.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.580
Now, I see. So, we have one gene, but two types

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.770
of alleles. We have the cheddar allele and the mozzarella allele.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.000
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and just like in a gene, we have two copies of

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.760
the alleles for that gene. So, Lauren,

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.860
what are the possible allelic combinations here?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.950
&gt;&gt; Well, we can have two cheddars.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.660
&gt;&gt; Right. Which would be our two T alleles.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.860
&gt;&gt; Or we can have. Two mozzarellas.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.450
&gt;&gt; Right, which would represent our two C alleles.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.270
&gt;&gt; Or, we can have one mozzarella and one cheddar.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.830
&gt;&gt; Right, this would be the heterozygous condition where we have both a T

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.500
allele and a C allele. So, really the important question now,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.130
is in this heterozygous condition, which flavor are we going to

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.090
taste? Well, I think you taste the cheddar flavor, because that's

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.450
going to overpower the mozzarella flavor, because it's just a stronger flavor.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.258
&gt;&gt; Exactly. This allele is going to be dominant, and so this

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:26.141
flavor's actually going to overpower the flavor of the mozzarella, which means.

00:02:26.141 --> 00:02:28.307
&gt;&gt; That you're going to need two mozzarellas to be

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.890
able to taste the flavor of the mozzarella, right?

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.140
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.010
Now think about all the genotypes and phenotypes surrounding the trait

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.320
of lactase persistence. I want you to match each genotype to the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.030
expected phenotype here. So for each genotype that you see, select

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.280
whether or not you think it'll be lactose tolerant or lactose intolerant.
