00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.610
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.900
I'm Mark Sweeney, the acting
Deputy Librarian of Congress.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.410
And it's my pleasure
to welcome you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.250
to the library's historic Thomas
Jefferson Building for which

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.920
to this afternoon's symposium,
the first public event

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.370
in the United States related to
the Georgian Papers Programme.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.630
Launched in April of 2015,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.760
the Georgian Papers Programme
is a collaborative effort led

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.070
by King's College London and
the Royal Collection Trust

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.300
to make an accessible and
extraordinary rich collection

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.700
of primary source material
from the Georgian monarchs,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.190
including King George III,
the British monarch in power

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.530
when the American colonies
declared independence.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.170
Comprising nearly 350,000
pages of correspondents, maps,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.640
and royal household
ledgers, the Georgian Papers,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.080
85% of which have been
unknown to scholars until now,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.000
stand to revolutionize
our understanding

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.850
of 18th century British,
American, and Atlantic history,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.240
an era of profound
cultural, political, economic,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.640
and social change in many ways
continues to influence us today.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.930
Last year, in one of the first
acts as Librarian of Congress,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.980
Dr. Carla Hayden
signed an agreement

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.220
with King's College London
and the Royal Collection Trust

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.550
to collaborate on
digitization, dissemination,

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.080
and interpretation of the
papers of King George III

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.430
and the other Georgian
Papers' materials.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.250
Over the next four years,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.010
the Georgian Papers
Programme promises

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.850
to reveal many more dimensions

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.560
to Britain's longest reigning
king, allowing scholars

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.880
and the general public a
unique window into the life

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.410
and times of King George III.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.300
The Library of Congress
holds the papers

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.240
of numerous United States
founders, including those

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.210
of George Washington, offering
historical context when paired

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.280
with the documents of
the Georgian Papers.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.430
As such, it is quite
fitting for us

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.500
to actively embrace this
project, and my colleagues

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.220
and I are delighted to partner
with our peers both here

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.730
in the United States
and across the pond.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.010
The Omohundro Institute
of Early American History

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.010
and Culture is the
primary US partner

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.340
for the Georgian
Papers Programme.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.780
The Library of Congress
joins the Sons

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.670
of the American Revolution

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.630
and the Mount Vernon Ladies'
Association as a critical part

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.610
of the American Collaboration.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.360
This afternoon's
symposium is hosted

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.600
by the John W. Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.030
in partnership with
the Omohundro Institute

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.450
and King's College London.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.400
The Kluge Center brings together
scholars and researchers

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.440
from around the world
to stimulate

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.190
and energize one
another to distill wisdom

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.400
from the library's rich
resources and to interact

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.720
with policymakers and
the general public.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.520
In a few moments, we will
hear from four scholars

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.790
who were recently
among the first

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.080
to examine the Georgian
Papers held at Windsor Castle.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.240
Each scholar's presentation will
reveal their early findings,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.550
describing for us some

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.290
of the remarkable historical
discoveries that are being made.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.240
But before introducing them,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.080
a few important announcements
related

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.320
to the library's participation
in Georgian Papers Programme.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.770
First, a major exhibition, the
Two Georges is planned for 2020,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.770
2021 to explore the overlapping
worlds of King George III

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.690
and George Washington, two
globally significant figures

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.890
of the late 18th century.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.050
The exhibition, exploring the
commonalities and contrast

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.880
between the two men and
the global, political,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.790
and cultural context of their
lives will open first here

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.480
at the Library of Congress

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.340
and subsequently at
a venue in London.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.430
More details to come on
this exciting project

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.290
as it continues to develop.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.510
And second, for those of
you who may be inspired

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.910
by today's event,
the library is proud

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.140
to announce a new
Georgian Papers fellowship.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.360
Interested scholars may apply
for a two-month fellowship

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.780
to pursue independent
research in the Georgian Papers

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.110
of the Royal Archives at Windsor

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.570
and in the Early American
Collection at the Library

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.490
of Congress with one month
in residence in London

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.960
and one month in residence
here at the library.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.470
The application deadline for the
Georgian Papers fellowship is

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.910
January 31, 2018, and the
fellowship recipient will be

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.810
selected based on the
relevance of their project

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.400
for research at both
institutions.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.190
For more details, please
visit the Kluge Center website

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.570
at loc.gov/kluge.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.720
Finally, the Library
of Congress would

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.320
like to thank our
generous donors, Beverly

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.450
and Lyman Hamilton, members

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.600
of the library's private-sector
support group, the John--

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.500
the James Madison Council, for
making this program possible.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.770
We are delighted that Beverly
Hamilton is in the audience.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.410
Mrs. Hamilton, would you
please stand and be recognized.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.210
Thank you.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.160
[ Applause ]

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.010
I will now turn the podium
over to my colleague,

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.430
Dr. Colleen Shogan, deputy
director for National

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.390
and International Outreach
here at the library.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.050
Colleen is our Georgian Papers
Programme project manager,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.170
and she's going to handle the
remainder of today's program.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.860
Colleen. Thank you.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.280
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J.
Shogan: Thank you, Mark,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.150
for those terrific
introductory remarks.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.000
What a terrific moment
in history

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.340
for this Anglo-American
collaboration.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.690
Of course, through the
Georgian Papers Programme,

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.330
the United Kingdom is
providing greater access

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.450
to important documents
and papers

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.150
that have gone largely
unexamined for many years.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.380
And the United States,
as we all know, well,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.260
we're great exporters.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:44.470
Apparently these days, this
also includes princesses so--

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.590
That's a joke for old
folks, but we do want

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.500
to wish congratulations to
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.820
and we wish them the best.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.840
There's a few people
I'd like to acknowledge

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.850
in the room before we begin.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.460
First, the director of National

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.110
and International
Outreach, Jane McAuliffe.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:06.010
Next, the director of the
Kluge Center, John Haskell.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:09.510
And then I'd also like
to introduce you to two

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.950
of our exhibit-- lead
exhibit members of our team

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:16.210
for the Two Georges,
Julie Miller our historian

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.260
and our curator for the
Early American collections

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.720
and Cheryl Regan the
senior exhibit specialist

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.120
in charge of the Two Georges.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.220
Lastly, I'd like to thank Travis
Hensley who worked very hard

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.100
to put this program
together, also in conjunction

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.680
with our special events team
here at the Library of Congress.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.110
There will be plenty of time
at the end of the program

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.920
for questions, but we ask that
you hold all your questions

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.120
and your thoughts until
the end of the program,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.790
after all the speakers
have spoken,

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.930
and then they will
join us on stage

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.240
to take all of your questions.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.390
So now, I'd like to introduce
our first speaker, Arthur Burns.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.490
We're very happy that Arthur
was able to make the trip today

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.190
from London to join us here
at the Library of Congress.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.590
Arthur is a professor of
Modern British History

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.300
at King's College London,
historian of the Church

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.650
of England from the
18th to 20th centuries.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.950
He was one of the editors of
the prize-winning "St. Paul's:

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.940
The Cathedral Church
of London" published

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.260
by Yale University Press in
2004, and is a director of one

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.620
of the first large-scale
public-facing online history

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.750
projects in the UK, The
Clergy of the Church

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.860
of England Database
1540 to 1835,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.860
which he co-founded in 1999.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.770
And most important
for our purposes,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.300
he's the academic director of
the Georgian Papers Programme.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.600
Arthur, the stage is yours.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.460
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: Thank
you very much, Colleen.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.170
And can I just say what a
pleasure it is to be here.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.170
It's a really exciting
program for all of us involved.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.450
But to come here and speak
at the Library of Congress,

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:52.740
as you can imagine, is
something of a treat.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.740
So thank you, everybody,
who's made that possible.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.640
So, my task this afternoon is
to introduce the Georgian Papers

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.590
and to say a little bit about
the project as a preface

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.000
to the reflections you will
hear from my colleagues

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.240
about their actual
researches into the program.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.840
So they will be giving you the
hardcore research findings.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.980
I'm going to try and give you a
sense about just how interesting

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.740
and exciting a program this is.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.460
Now, I have to confess because
I'm a bit of an archives junkie.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.640
I've spent the last 30 years on

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.440
and off investigating
the contents of archives

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.890
across the UK, some of which
are state-of-the-art archives

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:35.310
with the computer catalogs and
advanced access arrangements,

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.610
and others which conform

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.250
about the more popular
stereotype archives

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.720
with stone clad vaults
and cobweb documents.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.640
The contents of which is
rather hard to predict

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.670
since we've actually blown the
dust physically off the boxes

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.330
and ledgers.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.130
On the other hand, in
my capacity as director

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.380
of the clergy database
you just heard about,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.910
I've also had 20 years
experience working getting

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.440
archival documents
online in the form

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.880
where the wider public can
access them and scholars

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.220
across the world
make use of them.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.700
So if you think of the
two unique selling points

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.720
of Georgian Papers as
archival and online,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.120
you might think this just feel

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.580
like another day at
the office for me.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.380
That's far from it.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.920
The Georgian Papers
are different

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.350
and I find myself absolutely
caught up in the excitement

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.740
that all my colleagues
here feel for the project.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.110
I just hope I can get some of
that excitement across this.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.540
I've been told to be lively.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.690
I'll do my best with my cold,
but we'll see how we get on.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.730
So a good place to start.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.910
Well, maybe the actual archive

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.390
in which the Georgian
Papers are held.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.760
Now in all kinds of ways,
this Windsor Castle conforms

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.050
to the archive as
impenetrable treasure chest

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.690
of popular imagination
and something

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.640
of that I think is
captured in the documentary

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.700
that BBC made a year ago to
introduce the Georgian Papers,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.510
"The Genius of the Mad King".

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.970
[ Music ]

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.000
&gt;&gt; [Background Music] Windsor
Castle is the treasure chest

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.700
of royal secrets.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.140
Here in the round tower
are the personal papers

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.830
of all British monarchs
and their families

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:15.490
from George III right down
to Elizabeth the second.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.920
They've always been
out of bounds,

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.970
except to a few select
historians.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:31.430
&gt;&gt; Documents that really
you're wanting to keep forever,

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:40.590
you think about a
strong place to put them.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:46.380
And in the case of Windsor
Castle, the very strongest place

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.620
to put them is inside
the round tower.

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.600
And the round tower
is built on the site

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:59.700
where William the Conqueror
founded the castle in 1070.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:09.180
And that settles the round tower
oval to the mid 12th century,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.410
so for very sensible and very
secure place to keep papers.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:12.710
&gt;&gt; Nowhere safer?

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.010
&gt;&gt; Nowhere safer?

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.310
&gt;&gt; What's happening
here at the top

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:16.610
of these 104 stone steps
is history of sorts too.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.910
Nearly two centuries
after George III's death,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.210
all his private papers,
hundreds of thousands

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.510
of them are being
released to the world.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.810
Now some may ask, why
has it taken so long?

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.110
But here in this fortified royal
vault, it's groundbreaking.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.410
&gt;&gt; Never before has a group

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.710
of academics been allowed inside
the inner sanctum to rifle

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:27.010
through these invaluable
documents.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.310
So the first visit of scholars
from King's College London,

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:29.610
partners in this project, was
a kind of royal revolution.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:30.910
&gt;&gt; If you could break
yourself into groups

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.710
of three or four [inaudible].

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:43.270
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.570
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: So that's--

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.140
So from now I'm reporting
on that fondling

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.130
that was just described there.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:52.170
And I think that does capture
just how difficult an archive

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.050
this has been to access in the
past, which is why we estimate,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.650
as you already heard, that
despite the obvious importance,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.850
only some 15% of the papers

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.700
which it contains have
ever been published.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.110
In terms merely of its size,
with some 350,000 pages

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.340
of documents to appear
by the time the program

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.890
on digitization concludes,
this is clearly one

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.550
of the most significant
caches of 18th

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.670
and early 19th century papers

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.970
that will be made
widely available

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.270
to new audience for decades.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.900
And it's not only a matter of
making available digital images

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.320
of the documents online.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.730
The documents fit formally.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:27.140
You could only get
to it by going to sit

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.540
in this glamorous reading room.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.290
It sometimes feels a bit
like the historical versions

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.420
of prince and sleeping
beauties of hacking your way

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.030
into the round tower together.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.700
Or indeed, so we're going
to digitize them, yes.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:41.820
But of course, it's not just
the question of digitization

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.690
because some of the documents
are damaged and they have

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.880
to be conserved first before
they could be made available.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.890
We also don't have a proper
catalog of these documents.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.060
So a key aspect of the project
is going to be making a catalog

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.600
so we actually can describe
these documents the way it

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.380
should be confined with
appropriate metadata.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.410
And we're probably going to
transcribe a fair number of them

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:04.780
as well into machine
readable text,

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.180
which for the first time enables
scholars really to engage

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.400
with these documents
in a serious way.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.760
So, so far I think that document
should capture something

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.380
important but it also obscures
one or two key features

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.820
of the archives to make
it all the more intriguing

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.620
to us scholars.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.410
And obviously one thing
that is obvious for this,

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:26.150
we thought all about George III.

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.680
We said George-- that there's
a lot about George III in here

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.620
and George III is obviously
of particular interest

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.920
with transatlantic audience

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.370
because of his rather
painful role

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.110
in the creation of your nation.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.150
And the sense also that
he has a very long reign.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.720
I mean he does stay around--

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.350
the longest reigning
monarch we have.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:44.650
But it's really important,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.640
don't forget this archive
also contains papers relating

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.410
to other monarchs, in
fact four of the monarchs.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.820
George I came to
the throne in 1714.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.120
His successor George II,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.920
who reigned until George
III succeeded him in 1760.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.840
And a much more significant
number of documents relating

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.830
to George's success of his
son George IV both as king

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.940
and when he was Prince
of Wales and regent.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.520
And finally, there's a smaller
bunch of documents that relate

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.700
to the reign of William IV
under his death in 1837,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.730
Victoria took the throne.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.110
So the archive that gets
this inside is right

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.090
across the Hanoverian
period which even

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.620
without the American Revolution
would surely count as one

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.670
of the most significant
periods of British history.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.450
Moreover, the archive also
contains papers relating

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.450
to many other members
of the royal family,

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.030
such as the monarchs' consorts

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.550
and children who's often
owned rather turbulent lives--

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.240
and there were some really
quite extraordinary life stories

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.220
in the immediate
family of the king.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.270
Of equal interest to those
are the monarchs themselves.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.080
Secondly, I think the
emphasis in the documentary,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.990
the vault-like security
of Windsor Castle needs

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.250
to be balanced by the fact that
these archives weren't there

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.000
for a long time and they didn't
arrive there in the present form

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.430
until the early 20th century.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.010
The bulk of the collection
has been left by George IV

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.570
to the care of his executor,
who just happened to be the Duke

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.940
of Wellington with
the instruction

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.360
to be destroyed unread.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.970
Well, luckily for us, the
instruction was largely ignored

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.460
and as was the collection
itself until it was rediscovered

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.580
in 1912 in the basements

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.780
of Wellington's Apsley
House then transferred

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:23.830
to its present home in 1914.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.640
So some records have
ever been consigned

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.040
to the fire before it went
to Wellington are bits

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.850
of the royal records which
clearly were not [inaudible]

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:33.780
of Queen Charlotte's
papers and disappeared.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.090
Some of George III's early
papers have disappeared.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.390
And that's the most
distressing one.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.370
The years when George is dealing
with the other [inaudible]

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.300
in which a lot of
key policies relating

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.900
to North America
were being discussed,

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.330
some of those papers we
think are just missing.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.090
Others suffer from the
neglect in the interim.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.670
We do have damaged
documents from damp and all

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.600
of those other things reflect
things have not properly been

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.870
kept from the years
in Apsley House.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.580
And this means we don't
therefore have a complete set

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.680
of all these monarchs' papers.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.270
But against that,
we can set the fact

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.400
that these collections had been
augmented by gifts and purchases

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.650
which extended coverage to many
key men and women of the court

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:11.680
or the employee of the monarchs.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.470
And we were already finding
that some of the key discoveries

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.770
that some of you will hear

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:17.020
about later are being made
among these tapes of the papers

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.070
that were those closely
associated

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.850
with the king [inaudible]
the king himself.

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.520
And those have not been
investigated anyway near as much

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.730
as the papers of George III's
own handwriting on them.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.820
And then there were odd
additional items and of

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.690
such things of now that
are usually lurking

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.260
under that catchall title,
miscellaneous in the catalog.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.280
And one such curiosity which
I think illustrates the kind

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.610
of things you can find
there is a pair of letters

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.960
from Admiral Lord Horatio
Nelson to Emma Hamilton.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.570
And you can see a
little bit of one here.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.940
Now, it's not hard to
assess why these documents

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.190
which have no immediate
or thorough connection

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.920
with the royal family end
up in the royal archives

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.600
in the 20th century for
in them Nelson warns Emma

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.590
that he's heard that the
Prince of Wales wants her

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.010
for her mistress and he's
trying to persuade her to stay

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.030
out of any contact with him

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.700
in any place lest this
happens [inaudible]

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.410
of events today this document.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.630
The next [inaudible] is when you
would [inaudible] the evidence

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.490
that we might then hear
because they also illustrate

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.460
incidentally the force
of Nelson's passion.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.110
I don't know how good
your paleography is,

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.400
but if you look closely
at the screen,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.370
you'll see that in this excerpt
he declares his own feelings be

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.770
so strong that, "I
might be trusted

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.540
with 50 virgins naked
in a dark room."

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.340
So, that's Lord Nelson.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.860
He was writing this after he'd
had his hand amputated as well,

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.010
so we [inaudible] as he's
dictating this to someone,

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.340
which is hard to imagine, but
probably he taught himself

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.830
to write with his other hand.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.870
So, it was a private
communication.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.650
It's important to
emphasize, I think therefore

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.650
that the sheer variety of
papers, the Georgian Papers,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.830
is a key part of the importance.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.170
And as we might expect,
both Andrew

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.870
and Jim will show you shortly,

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.120
discoveries in the papers
already shed new light

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.270
on politics, both domestic and
international in the period,

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.800
including the [inaudible]
relations of Britain

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.080
and the North American colonies
and then the United States.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.380
But it goes also interactions

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.920
with Europe during
the revolutionary

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.790
and Napoleonic Wars
and with other parts

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.290
of the British Empire and
beyond, the Macartney mission

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.880
to China for example
being one of those.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.400
And these are the
kind of revelations

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.840
that we might all expect
from the monarchs' papers.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.490
But there's a lot
more to it than that.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.210
And this pie chart, which
is a work in progress,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.230
it changes every time I see it.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.080
It tries to analyze
what we've got

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.290
in these papers in
breaking it down.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:38.590
And anyone who is good

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.730
at taxonomy will instantly see
these are not a coherent set

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.250
of categories because we
have some personal names

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.460
of the [inaudible] themes
and therefore all kinds

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.980
of overlaps are taking
place here

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.250
within those broad
sways that's labeled

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.090
with a particular
monarch's name.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.400
But even allowing for
all its weaknesses,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.850
this does give you a sense of
the sheer variety of papers

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.380
which are in the documents
even before you take account

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.250
of the variety hidden behind
those monarchs' names.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.560
There's lot here, for example,
the historian of science

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.460
and medicine manifest-- we know

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.590
after that George III was
famously ill for a long time

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.630
and awful lots of records
relating to the treatment

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.850
and diagnosis of that illness
and that often painful reading,

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:22.370
stuff relating to his
interest in scientific inquiry,

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:23.740
relating to a magnificent
collection

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.180
of scientific instruments that
my university is not fortunate

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.090
to own but you can see
through our kindness

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.620
in the science museum
where they were on display,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.960
a magnificent collection
of telescopes

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.700
and [inaudible] and so on.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.440
But you'll also get the emphasis
with the other family members

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.630
and they suffer from
distress in large variety

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.080
of illnesses between--
across the range of them.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.250
And you'll find also lots of
stuff in their emotional lives,

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:47.660
of all these princes

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.250
and princesses often very
complex relationships often

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.550
ending tragically.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:54.190
And again, anyone with an
interest in the history

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.370
of interpersonal
relations or gender history

00:20:56.370 --> 00:21:00.670
from the people find awful lot
of [inaudible] material here.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.350
Then there were papers
relating to the workings

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.580
of the royal households,
the knots and bolts

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.790
of keeping the show on the road
in terms of food, provisioning,

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.210
equipping the buildings
with objects, and so on.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.630
And that's another very rich
dimension of the collection

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:20.110
which we only just began to
think about historians of art,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.930
the book, or maps,
we'll find documents

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.230
that are absolutely vital

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.590
to interpreting magnificent
collections

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.950
of those objects held by the
British Library and at Windsor

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.390
and anyone who's
had a chance to look

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.360
at the map collection
of George III.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.360
It's an absolute
fantastic resource.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.510
If you didn't travel, this
was how he knew the world.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:37.070
He looked at the
maps and pictures.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.410
And that's how he understood
the world around him.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:44.170
And of course the [inaudible]
because they bought lots

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.620
and lots of stuff, lots
of really important

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:50.390
for art historians you could
do an awful lot of these lined

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.850
up against the libraries
collections or against those

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.150
in the British Library.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.050
Commissioning buildings,
commissioning paintings,

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.820
commissioning music,
handle festivals, right,

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.120
a part of George III's life.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.050
So, something for everybody
is the basic message

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.060
and exploring the
papers we'll find a lot

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.440
about English monarchy
but also about societies

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.500
in which the monarchs lived
and also the societies

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.120
in which they didn't
live, those overseas

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.350
in which [inaudible] to rule.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.580
And most-- many of the
papers I think which relate

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.220
to the less person
[inaudible] the monarch

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.010
of those we know
the least about.

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:26.800
And as we move into those,
I think it's very hard

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.740
to predict what we
find but there is going

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.690
to be some major new
agendas I think set

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:35.620
for researchers very
rapidly as we explore those.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.510
That said even where we've
had papers that's already been

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.200
published, the program
is shedding new light.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.590
And we can see for example,
where editions mistook

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.820
or omitted or misinterpreted.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.370
And it's very striking
for example

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:52.220
that the very first
volume of published letters

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.580
of George III came out in
the 1920s by the librarian,

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:00.120
since then he produced a very
thick volume of correspondents.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:03.160
One of his colleagues was
so outraged by the quality

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.830
of this edition that he then
published the hardback edition

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.500
of corrections to that
volume, to volume one

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.870
that was 100 pages long.

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:14.680
And yet that's the collection
we still have to work with.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.700
So, we're going to put
these digitized images,

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.170
we're going to be looking
at those documents and new.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.120
But also of course when you look
at the document in manuscript

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.480
or in the very high
quality digital

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.140
and if you see something
quite different

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.760
from when you look
at the printed page.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.300
If you look at George
III's abdication letters

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.850
when he's drafting this
potential abdication speech,

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.160
he thinks he might need to
give shortly after the loss

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.460
of the American colonies.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.600
It's one thing to read
the finished version.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.800
But you look at the original

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.100
and you see the agonized
crossings out.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:47.150
You see the rethinking
that's going on,

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.030
something about the
psychological state of mind

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.680
that comes across
[inaudible] in that form

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.930
that simply could not be
reproduced even if you try

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:00.250
to annotate a printed edition to
indicate all those corrections.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:03.580
And I think we look at them
fresh again, if we're looking

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.730
at them as a document
rather than as part

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.030
of a narrative history

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.240
where maybe this is
reproduced as a part of a story.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.190
And we know that he thought
of that abdication and we know

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.700
that it's part of the story
of George is agonizing

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.540
after the end of
the American war.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.190
But nobody has ever
reported to say, well,

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.170
where did you get the
idea of abdicating from?

00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:24.110
Because after all, this is was a
king who is very, very conscious

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:28.690
of being a divinely authorized
and responsible person

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.710
for his people, and yet here
he is starting to walk away,

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.380
walk away at the
moment when he knows

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.760
that this is a [inaudible]
no respect whatsoever

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.060
as potential monarch.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.610
So how does he think this is an
exercise of his responsibilities

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.370
to his maker if he's doing that?

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.630
So we can rethink the questions
we ask about these documents,

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.400
I think, as we see
them as documents.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.120
Another way we see [inaudible]
part of bigger collection,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.420
because the proximity of
all these different themes

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.960
in one collection reflects
the very real proximity

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.750
of a monarchy where you
have a small court operating

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.800
in a very intimate setting
with politicians and princesses

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.850
and coaches and servants all in
a very limited particular space

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.850
and of course all at
the heart of London,

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.360
the leading world city
of the late 18th century.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.820
We could therefore have to
think quite harder what the

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.640
interconnections are
among with those papers.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.210
And that takes me into the
final we're going to talk

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:29.730
about which is how we then
add value to these images

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:33.510
into the collection of
objects we're making public.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.450
And there is a fantastic
program of research that's going

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.180
on in association
with this program.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.390
Thanks to King's and
the Omohundro Institute

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:43.600
and the generosity of our
associates at Mount Vernon

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.180
and the Sons of the
American Revolution

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.780
which we're enormously grateful,
now joined by the Library

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.630
of Congress if you heard more

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.270
than 35 scholars have already
been actively researching the

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.470
Georgian Papers as Georgian
Papers fellows exploring the

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:00.410
range of themes which match the
diversity of the archive itself.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.730
A particular relevance
this afternoon for example,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.580
we should note that the
Omohundro alone has now funded

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.860
more than a dozen scholars
working on an American

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.270
or Atlantic world
topics in this program.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.450
And that's fantastic feature.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.640
And for me, it's been terrific
because I'm a really bad example

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.350
to kind of put a historian
who doesn't ever look

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.840
up to other places doing my work
and having to work alongside

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.890
so many people working
in American themes

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.870
such as illuminated so many
things I just wouldn't have got

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:28.310
to without this program.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.210
And I think that's true of
a lot of British historians.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:33.540
There's something special I
think as well about having

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:37.410
so many people who can feedback
into the cataloging process

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:40.220
because that's going to help us
improve the means back to others

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.520
because we're thinking

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.040
about what these documents
are all the time the scholars

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.340
as well.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.570
And also the fact we were
working on one archive.

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:50.910
And that for me says a really
special about this program.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.200
Quite often I go to campuses
and the biggest difference

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.610
between me and the other people
there is we don't use the same

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.850
stuff and so we can't
find an easy common ground

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.210
on which to debate things.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.930
Here we have a load of scholars
doing extraordinary different

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.980
things who've all been
physically working

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.700
on the same papers.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.040
And we had a marvelous meeting
this September organized

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.300
by Omohundro where we brought
together 14 or 15 of the people

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.290
who already done work
to get papers and a lot

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.090
of the others came as well.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:21.110
And the connections the people
were making of animal history

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.120
through to the highest
politics you can imagine

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.590
through the history of food
and the dining traditions

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.570
of the monarchy, the points

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.220
of sparking going off
suggesting people that you think

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.200
about new dimensions
[inaudible] research

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.180
on that context was
really wonderful.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.570
And I really do think that's
going to be a big feature

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.740
to the program as we go forward
is that we accumulate more

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.790
and more of these fellows.

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:48.080
And indeed, we're now-- as we've
gone digital, as we have more

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.070
and more documents online,
that community doesn't have

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.390
to be just [inaudible], we
can have a digital community.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.340
Two weeks ago, we
launched, The King's Friend,

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.320
which is online network
research to see opportunities

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.500
to advance the work
through the papers program.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:05.140
And already more than 220
scholars joined that network.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.640
About a third of those
were in the United States

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.550
but they're worldwide and they
come from department of history,

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.520
of literature, of art, of
music, and lots of curators

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.110
and archivists as well.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.810
And then we're going to
be keeping them involved

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.290
with the project
as it goes forward,

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.120
having to give them advance
opportunities to look

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.720
at materials before
it goes public

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.900
so they can contribute the
interpretations for us.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.490
It's a new approach to try to
bind people to approach you

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.550
like this, one which we
are really excited about,

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.850
which we hope will
feed into things

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.370
like the exhibitions we've been
hearing about as we go forward.

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:36.500
And of course the digital lets
you do is potentially make

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.180
relations with other archives
and put documents together

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.050
which you wouldn't always
be able to do physically.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:43.940
And we hope to try and do some
of that with making connections

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.270
to other archives
online, particularly those

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.410
that are endangered, say those
in Jamaica or other places

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.000
where we might be able to make
connections with them and try

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.310
and do something together.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.020
Another [inaudible] see
transcription going forward

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.440
with students, scholars,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.670
and wide [inaudible] public
taking part in the act

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:04.010
to practice transcription and in
the interpretation of documents.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.440
And already both
William and Mary

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.070
and King's both postgraduate

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.280
and undergraduate students have
the opportunity to get involved

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.930
in this project at first hand.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.230
My own students at
King's selected each

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:16.880
of the document at random.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.610
They would give them a free
choice to go to the archive

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:20.360
and find some things
that's both to them

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.110
and then they were
given 10 weeks

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.320
to produce an online digital
edition of that document.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.970
And they came from all
kinds of disciplines.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.570
So one of favorites
was a math student

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.670
who never had done any
history before and they went

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.460
into George's exercise books
as a young man and say,

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.760
what math is he doing?

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.160
Where is he getting
that math from?

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.320
And they identified
the textbooks he used.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.170
Why he was doing this math,
is all about ballistics

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.840
so he could picture, you know,

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.460
the cannonballs landed
in the right place.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.160
But no, it's a fantastic thing
for her to do to take ownership

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.530
of this, her own project
and we'll feed that back

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.730
into the archive project
because we didn't know this.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.030
That student founded that

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.620
and that would be her
contribution to the project.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.050
So that's a great thing I think,
putting research into the heart

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.040
of student's education.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.340
We're next taking it schools.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.960
I'm talking to the British
Historical Association building

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.250
a collection of documents will
be used in school when teaching

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.300
for [inaudible] school children
due the [inaudible] using

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.380
Georgian Papers to
illuminate the curriculum.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.400
Not just about George III
but about literacy and things

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.840
as part of the school
curriculum.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.320
So, all of those things
speak to what I found is

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.540
that digital was doing
the last 20 years.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.160
It's an extraordinary
moment for us

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.400
that we can take our
serious scholarly work

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.740
without compromising
it in terms of rigor

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:33.550
or scholarship find
point connection

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:36.640
with the wider historical
public and work together to try

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.780
and improve and enhance
our interpretation.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.580
It's a wonderful
thing to be able to do

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.100
and the Georgian Papers
project offers a possibility

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.790
of doing this with a
new set of documents

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:46.590
on a different scale
and internationally.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.880
And that's just fantastic
I think for me.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.590
That said, the work
professional scholars will be

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.970
at the core what
we're going to do

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.380
as you would like
to hear, folks.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.180
And period we're dealing
with obviously is a complex

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.080
and extraordinary one
exhibiting both parallels

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:02.710
with their own time
and you can think

00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:05.940
of the globalization
shifting political tectonics

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.280
that leave people wrong-footed
at every moment to what

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.480
to do next or how to act,
the impact in new media

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.000
like a very striking parallel
between the politics there

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.830
and now and rapidly evolving
social economic challenges.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:21.460
There's also striking contrast,
we see the origins of many

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.920
of our contemporary
institutions and practices

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.060
and with very different
circumstances

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.360
in which they now operate.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.130
And to make sense, that's
going to require a lot of skill

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.810
and patience and research as
well as a lot of foreknowledge

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:34.420
so we will need professional
historians.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.970
So it's pleasure to be able to
hand over to three such scholars

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.230
who all got patience
and foreknowledge

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.010
and they will continue our
discussion by explaining some

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:44.430
of the themes that's researched

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.150
in the papers is
already highlighting.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.450
Thank you very much.

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:49.750
Applause

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J.
Shogan: Thank you, Arthur.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.780
That was terrific.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.520
Now I'd like to introduce
our second speaker.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.590
Jim Ambuske is the former
post-doctoral fellow

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.830
in Digital Humanities at
the University of Virginia,

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.620
School of Law Library.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.160
A historian of the
American Revolution

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.460
and the Early Republic,

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.020
Jim recently completed
his PhD at UVA.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.550
In addition to his work
on the Georgian era,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.590
he co-directs the Scottish Court

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.170
of Session Digital
Archive project

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.840
in the 1828 catalog project
at the UVA Law Library.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.820
The later being an initiative
to reconstruct the law--

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.640
the legal library that
Thomas Jefferson created

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.990
for the University of Virginia.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:39.510
Please join me in welcoming
Jim to the Library of Congress.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.000
[ Applause ]

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.470
&gt;&gt; Jim Ambuske: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:51.970
I just want to begin by thanking
Karin and Shaun and Colleen

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.200
and Travis for inviting
me here today.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.820
It's nice to see some
of my fellow fellows

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.870
from the Georgian
Papers project.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.750
Two years ago I had
the good fortune

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:05.410
of being the first
Omohundro fellow to be

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.200
in the Georgian archive.

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.560
I beat my fellow over
there by about a month.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.190
So now I'm giving a talk
in the Library of Congress.

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:14.870
I'm not sure it's going
to get any better so I'd

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.130
like to announce my
retirement at the conclusion

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.690
of today's program [laughter].

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:23.360
I wanted-- I'd like to tell
you about my time in Windsor

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.270
and a bit about my
research there

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.250
by telling you a
story about two men.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:32.350
Admiral Sir Samuel Hood
and General Jacob De Bude.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.660
These are common household
names in the history

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.470
of the American Revolution
although it's entirely possible

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:40.250
and you probably have
heard of Lord Hood.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.710
But they shared a correspondence
during a critical period

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:45.500
of the American warfare
independence.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.490
Letters that I found locked away

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.580
in the royal archives
of Windsor Castle.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.610
By necessity, then this story
begins not of the 18th century

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.830
but on the 21st on a
cool September morning,

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.390
two years ago in
the round tower.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.900
I applied for my Georgian
Papers fellowship hoping

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.750
to find material for
my dissertation project

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:07.930
which was a study of Scottish
immigration to North America

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.750
in the era of the
American Revolution.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:14.150
And I found that other
evidence in some archives

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.820
that George III was aware what
some amongst the Scottish elite

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.910
described as a depopulation
crisis in Scotland.

00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:25.210
In other words they believed
that a combination of factors

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.500
that push Scots out of
Scotland and pull them

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.070
to the colonies here would
deprive Britain of laborers

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:35.680
and soldiers at a critical
moment in the imperial crisis.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.430
And so as I waited
through boxes of material

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.940
on the royal archives,
seeking answer to my questions,

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.770
I ask to see the papers
of General Jacob de Bude,

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:48.550
the man so honored here
by this inscription

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:51.070
within Saint George's
chapel located just

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.600
down the hill from
the round tower.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.860
Born in Geneva in the early
18th century, as a younger man,

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.510
de Bude acted as a military page

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.460
for George III's great uncle
William, Prince of Orange.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.710
He later served in
a Swiss regimen.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:09.330
In 1772, de Bude joined
the British royal household

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:10.650
to oversee the education

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:13.220
of the princes William
Henry and Edward.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.880
George III made him a
general in the Hanoverian army

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.460
and apparently became
the king's aide-de-camp.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.910
He later served as Prince
Frederick's secretary

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.760
and it was Frederick who
placed memorial to de Bude

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.450
in St. George's Chapel,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:30.550
a testimony to that man's long
service to the royal family.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:34.340
And so on that September
morning, in 2015,

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.930
I received a red archival box
similar to what Arthur showed

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.400
in the video there containing de
Bude's papers hoping upon hope

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.090
that they pour something
directly

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:45.980
on my dissertation topic
hoping that I find a letter

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.880
from the king where he's
talking to de Bude in confidence

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.640
about this potential crisis.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.800
And I didn't find
anything, but that's OK.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.390
And part of the process of
this program is to figure

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:01.150
out what is there and
what is not there.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.850
And as I'd like to say,
what I found is better

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:07.990
in more instances that one,
and so in that box sandwiched

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:11.710
between account books and
a collection of recipes.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.000
So if you need anything for
the holidays, let me know.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.990
I found a catch of letters
wrapped in brown paper

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:21.130
and bound together
by a piece of string.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:22.770
Opening that package
I discovered

00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:26.660
about 140 letters plus
enclosures written

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.110
to de Bude from Admiral Hood.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:35.100
Here was a collection unknown
to scholars, dating between 1781

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.810
and 1783, written by one of
Britain's senior naval officers

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:43.300
to one of George III's
trusted men in the last years

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.600
of the revolutionary war.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.260
I wonder what it could mean
that these letters existed

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.140
in this collection within
this particular archive

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.470
and what they might tell
us about the relationship

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:59.020
between these two men, about
the American Revolution

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.760
and about George III.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.540
To begin to answer
those questions,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.840
we need to know something

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.190
about de Bude's correspondent,
Admiral Hood.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.850
A season naval veteran,
Hood first went to see

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.500
with the royal navy
in the 1740s.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.050
Served in a seven years war,

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:18.500
what we commonly called
the French-Indian war

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.210
in North America,
stationed in Halifax,

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:24.810
Nova Scotia in the years
before the American Revolution,

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.620
served as a commissioner
of the naval yards

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.460
at Portsmouth, England.

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.740
Before becoming a flag
officer in the British fleet

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:35.240
in the early 1780s, confident
in his own abilities,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.820
often to the point of arrogance,
Hood all too easily found fault

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:42.890
in the conduct of his fellow
officers, even his superiors.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.060
He was not afraid to express
his opinions to his friends

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.380
and to his civilian superiors
and the luminous correspondents.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.930
But it was never without a
point and that's important,

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.960
Hood wanted his correspondents
to understand

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.110
where the officers had gone
wrong, wanted to expose flaws

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:03.210
in British military strategy
and wanted to offer a sense

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:07.090
of the potential consequences
of certain military choices.

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.400
Now of course, you know,
Hood, he's not writing this

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.730
without an eye towards his own
conduct, his own reputation.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:16.150
He wants his correspondents
to hold him in high regard.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.930
But he generally believed
in the righteousness

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.230
of the British cause

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.880
in suppressing the
American rebellion.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:26.440
He was content on doing his duty
to king, country, and empire.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.310
And he was also a
politically astute man.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.570
He was well versed
in 18th century ideas

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.020
of duty, honor, and propriety.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:36.390
While he was on friendly
terms with the king,

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:38.280
Hood dared not flout
the chain of command

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.650
and send his grievances
directly to George III.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.410
And so with that in mind, I
want to emphasize the importance

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.650
of to whom Hood is writing.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.520
True, some of what Hood wrote

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.270
to de Bude mirrored what
he communicated to others.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.820
But the fact that he provided
de Bude one of the king's men

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.500
with detailed accounts
of the war effort

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.280
and the people involved
raises [inaudible] prospect

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.620
that Hood saw these letters
as way to back-channel

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.340
to George III himself.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.260
Hood's correspondence with
de Bude written in the wake

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.980
of a catastrophic British defeat
in the late summer of 1781,

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.900
offers an excellent
example of the kind

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.420
of information he might have
conveyed to this exchange.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.390
They help illuminate a fatal
moment and the people involved

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.310
in Britain's efforts to
subdue the rebellion.

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.680
And so most of us are aware
I think with the Battle

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.250
of Yorktown of October 1781,

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.880
the victory by the combined
Franco-American army

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.940
that traps Cornwallis southern
Army on New York peninsula

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.720
and leads to peace
negotiation with the Americans.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.020
Certainly if you're familiar
with the Hamilton's soundtrack,

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.330
you know this by heart
by now [laughter].

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:52.260
Far fewer know much about
the Battle of the Chesapeake,

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.440
just one month before on
September the 5th, 1781.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.140
This was the decisive
naval engagement

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.830
of the American Revolution,

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.720
especially with respect
securing American independence.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.220
It is difficult to imagine
Cornwallis' surrender

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.050
without it.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:10.360
The clash of the Virginia coast
was a reflection of Britain's--

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.630
the British military
and southern strategy

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.490
in this period of a war.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:18.560
After John Burgoyne's
surrender at Saratoga in 1777

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.610
and France's formal entry into
the war the following year,

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:23.610
the British military
concentrated its efforts

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.390
in the southern colonies,
partly in the belief and not

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:29.280
without good reason that they
would find greater numbers

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.160
of loyal Americans in the south.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.590
In for a time, the
British found success.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:37.740
They actually re-conquered
Georgia in the fall of 1779.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.660
That colony is declared at
the king's peace, all right?

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.980
So that's one check mark.

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:45.020
In May 1780, they captured
Charles Town, South Carolina,

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:46.670
all right, captured one

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.690
of the southern coast's
most important ports.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.280
And after Charles Town
falls into British hands,

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:54.700
Lord Cornwallis takes
command of the southern army,

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.500
spends the better part of the
next year and a half working

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.370
to pacify South Carolina where
a very violent civil war breaks

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.890
out between patriot and
loyalist, moving north

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.240
into North Carolina and
finally into Virginia.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.220
And in Virginia, he has orders
from General Sir Henry Clinton

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.140
to establish a fortified
position near a port

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.960
to which the British
could send supplies.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.770
And all the while,
American continental

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:22.650
and militia forces are
harassing him and his men.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.240
By the summer of 1781,
George Washington

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.150
and de Rochambeau
sense an opportunity.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.500
Stationed up the Hudson River
near White Plains, New York,

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.440
the two generals debated
whether to launch a strike

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.710
against the British
headquarters in New York City,

00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:38.640
a city that the British
[inaudible] of the war

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.330
or to begin an offensive
in Virginia to capture

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.490
or destroy Cornwallis'
southern army.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.270
And ultimately they
choose Virginia largely

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.650
because Rochambeau convinces
Washington who really wants

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:52.830
to just go in there and get
the crap out of the British

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.750
in New York that Virginia
is the better option.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.530
But with the British Navy
patrolling American waters,

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.660
Washington and Rochambeau
needed the assistance

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.890
of the French fleet to
accomplish their objectives.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.130
One small French naval force lay
off Rhode Island while another

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.480
under the command of Admiral
de Grasse was soon expected

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:11.950
on the West Indies.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.500
If you'd like to know more
about the American Revolution

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.910
in the Caribbean,
I encourage you

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:18.790
to read Andrew O'Shaughnessy's
book "An Empire Divided".

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:20.100
It's terrific.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.380
Go pick up your copy today.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.780
And once that fleet arrives,
Rochambeau sends a message

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.490
to de Grasse asking him
to bring his fleet north

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.290
to assist the allied armies
marching toward Virginia.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.810
The British had a fleet in
the West Indies as well,

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:37.860
one that included Hood
abort his flagship.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.250
And the British rightly
suspected

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:42.630
that their enemies were
preparing a joint operation

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:45.290
either against General
Clinton's forces in New York

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:48.730
or against Lord Cornwallis
in Virginia.

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.450
The senior British
admiral ordered Hood

00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:54.690
to take a detachment of 14 ships
of the lines to the battleships

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.350
to track de Grasse after the
French commander began the

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.800
voyage north.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.020
Because Hood took a more direct
route to the American mainland,

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.890
he actually passes
de Grasse and arrives

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:08.280
in Chesapeake Bay
on August 25, 1781.

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.240
Finding no French ships in
the bay, Hood sailed north

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.970
to New York City to
consult with Admiral Graves

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.660
who had the overall command
with the British fleet

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.820
in North America at this time.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:21.690
And when Hood, Graves, and other
officers observed the sailing

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:24.550
of the French fleet at Rhode
Island, they correctly suspected

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.570
that Virginia was the target.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.900
Mobilizing a combined fleet
of 19 ships of the line,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.390
the British sailed south
to prevent the French

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.210
from isolating Cornwallis' army.

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:39.710
And here you have a map from
the Library of Congress,

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.370
depicting this battle.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.880
And the British fleet is--

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.480
are the darker of
the two colors there.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.910
On September the 5th, 1781,
Hood, Graves, and the rest

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.590
of the British fleet encountered
de Grasse and his force

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:56.120
of 24 ships of the line near
the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.990
Outnumbered, outgunned,
outmanned,

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:01.650
the British nevertheless
put up a decent fight

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:05.410
for a few hours before
being forced to withdraw.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.570
De Grasse's victory
left the French

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:09.350
in command of Virginia waters.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.420
Tracking Cornwallis on land
has the Franco-American army

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.090
drew near.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.610
Despite the magnitude
of this defeat,

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.420
Admiral Hood was
not lost for words.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.720
He sent letters

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.300
to correspondents
including Jacob de Bude,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.340
describing the battle in what he
thought it meant for the faith

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.510
of Britain's American empire.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:33.620
He composed a long letter to de
Bude 11 days after the battle,

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:37.230
in which he noted, "On
the 5th instant, at 11 am,

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.380
we plainly discovered 24 sail
of French ships of the line

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.660
and two frigates at
anchor about Lynnhaven Bay,

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:46.050
which afforded the British
fleet a most glorious opening

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.270
for making a close
attack to advantage

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.590
but it was not embraced.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:54.990
But with this letter,
Hood also included a copy

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.520
of his thoughts composed on
the morning after the battle.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.600
Although uncharacteristically
short nevertheless,

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.240
Hood was characteristically
blunt

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.020
in his assessment of the battle.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.590
And this is the message
he wants to convey

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.690
to his correspondents
including de Bude.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.470
"Yesterday the British
fleet had a rich

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.370
and most delightful harvest
of glory, presented to it,

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.800
but admitted to gather it
in more instances than one."

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.950
And here we see a fine example
of Hood noting the failure

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:30.580
of a superior officer's judgment
in superiority of his own.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:32.990
Hood argued that Admiral
Graves who commanded the center

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:35.710
of the British line
failed to press the attack.

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:38.040
He believed that if Graves
had exploited weak points

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.980
in the French line, it
might have been able Hood

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.390
to cut the French
center to pieces.

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:47.060
But as Hood sought, Graves
failed to act decisively.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.990
In this another letters,
Hood made claim to de Bude

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.370
that defeat on the
5th of September along

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.740
with the later decision not to
mount another rescue effort,

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.380
portended doom for Lord
Cornwallis, his army,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.680
and the British war effort.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.490
I found in this particular
collection, he writes letters

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.660
on the 24th of September where
he describes the council of war

00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:07.180
and Hood is desperately arguing

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.070
that the British should send
fire ships in to French lines.

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:12.900
Basically they would set their
own vessels on fire and ram them

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.820
into the French fleet as
a means to punch a hole

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.900
to rescue Cornwallis, and he
can't convince them to do it

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.600
and he is just beside himself.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.940
He's really quite passionate

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.690
about what he thinks is
the right thing to do.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.500
In the intimate nature
of this correspondence

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.860
between these two important
figures in the British military

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.480
and in the royal household
and the implication

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.850
that it may represent a
means to convey information

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:39.310
to George III, compels
us to ask new questions

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.640
about various aspects of
the American Revolution.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.450
You know, in this town we

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:45.050
like to ask what did
the president know

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:46.400
and when did he know it.

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.450
And we can modify that
question to ask with, well,

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.130
what did the king know
and when did he know it?

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.920
And so I want to leave you with
the idea that the significance

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:57.500
of the Hood-de Bude letters
is that they are suggestive

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.430
of a broader and formal
intelligence network

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.570
that George III used to gather
information about the progress

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.640
of the American war,
developments

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:07.630
in Europe, and matters at home.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:10.360
George III took his duties
as sovereign seriously

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.500
as Arthur suggested, making
it a point to know as much,

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.570
if not more about policy,
politics, and military strategy

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:21.480
as the ministers who ran his
government and his empire.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.120
And for a king who gave his
last full measure of devotion

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.240
to the preservation of that
empire and whose ministers had

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.220
to drag him to the conclusion

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:32.180
that Britain could not win
this imperial civil war,

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.480
letters such as these along

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:35.940
with other evidence can give
us a new window not only

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.520
into naval history,
military history,

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.790
but also into the king's mind.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:43.590
The letters between the admiral

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.990
and the aide-de-camp tell us
much about the relationship

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.540
between Hood and de
Bude and Hood's service

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.670
on the oceanic front lines
of the American rebellion,

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.730
yet they raised exciting
new questions

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.980
about George III's
American Revolution.

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.080
And now through the Georgian
Papers project and generosity

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:03.320
of many, many people here and
not, we are getting access

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.180
to the-- that archive
that will help us

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.030
to answer those questions.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.830
Thank you very much.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:19.300
[ Applause ]

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J.
Shogan: Thank you, Jim.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.680
Our next speaker is Andrew
Jackson O'Shaughnessy,

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.450
who is the vice president
of Monticello,

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:27.750
the Saunders Director

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.280
of the Robert H. Smith
International Center

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.390
for Jefferson Studies
and Professor of History

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.680
at the University of Virginia.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.440
He is a dual citizen of
Britain and the United States.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.710
His most recent book,
"The Men Who Lost America:

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:46.160
British Leadership, the American
Revolution, and the Fate

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.560
of the Empire" received eight
national books awards including

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:54.680
the New York Historical Society
American History Book Prize,

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.990
the George Washington Book
Prize, and the Society

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.500
for Military History Book Prize.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:04.350
A fellow of the World Historical
Society, he is an editor of--

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.840
for the Journal of
American History.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.260
Andrew, we welcome you
to the Jefferson Building

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.510
of the Library of Congress.

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:16.790
[ Applause ]

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:18.190
&gt;&gt; Andrew O'Shaughnessy:
I'd like to begin

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:22.710
by thanking the Library of
Congress especially Colleen

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:28.290
and her colleague Travis Hensley
who've been primarily involved

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.930
in coordinating this.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:35.430
I also want to thank the Sons
of the American Revolution.

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:43.130
And I put a slide there of my
giving lecture sponsored by them

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:49.070
for two months at King's
College London University.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.990
They paid for me
essentially for two months

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.840
to be a visiting professor
at King's in association

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:59.240
with King's College Joe Dooley,

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.130
a former director general
who's sitting in the third row.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.100
And he's really led
that organization

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.440
in a remarkable direction to
do many more academic programs

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.600
to have regular academic
conferences and make it more

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.060
than simply a social
organization.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.790
And also, I would like
to thank King's College

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:28.890
and especially Arthur Burns
who hosted me very warmly,

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:34.100
that the faculty do make
visitors really feel part

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:38.790
of the college while they're
there even though one's spending

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:41.830
most of your time at Windsor.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:46.490
Now my objective now is going
to be to show you the importance

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.990
of this archive for
American history

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:52.470
and specifically the
American Revolution.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.860
And this is why I applaud
the Library of Congress

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.490
and the Kluge Center
for its involvement

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:04.110
and because this is important
albeit for the British side

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.950
of the American Revolution.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:09.550
But the British side
is very essential part

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:14.800
of understanding the American
Revolution more generally.

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:21.900
George III was in some ways
the last king of England

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.400
to rule in any real sense.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:29.870
It might be said by pedants
that there are important moments

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:34.220
where monarchs did
intervene like William IV

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:40.860
with the reformat-- and even
most recently the Queen in 1963,

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:44.170
she appointed a prime
minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:49.750
who was virtually unknown
at the time in a situation

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:53.000
of the gridlock in parliament.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.500
But George III letters
has always been debated

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.600
as to whether it
was a constitutional

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.990
or unconstitutional monarch.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:05.160
George III did have real power.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:11.280
And he was able to choose
members of the cabinet

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:16.050
and he was able to choose
the prime minister as long

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.480
as he chose a prime minister

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.360
who generally had
support in parliament.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.860
But that gave him
a lot of leeway.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:30.360
George III was not responsible
for the policies that led

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.910
to the American Revolution
even though he's blamed as such

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:37.300
by the declaration
of independence.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:42.350
And John Adams in retirement
complained to Thomas Jefferson

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:46.680
that he shouldn't have
called George III a tyrant.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:50.820
But George III does become
the leading war hawk.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:55.190
And this is one of the reasons
that these are the key papers,

00:52:55.190 --> 00:53:00.290
the papers of George
III for high politics

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:04.070
and the military during
the American Revolution

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:07.120
from the British side.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.510
Unfortunately, the papers

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.680
of Lord North are very
disappointing and very limited.

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:17.680
The only papers that really
compete would be those

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:21.910
of the colonial office
in the national archives.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:26.990
George III essentially
became obsessed with this--

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:30.880
with the issue of America
after the Boston Tea Party.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:37.020
That was the moment that he
decided that war was inevitable

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.310
and he became, in the words
even of his own admirers,

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:43.860
almost his own prime minister.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:49.670
He dominated Lord North who was
constantly trying to resign,

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:54.420
who lost faith in the
conflict very early on.

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.870
He refused to negotiate
with opposition leaders

00:53:57.870 --> 00:54:04.410
who were committed to withdraw
from America as early as 1778.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.250
And he was almost
Churchillian in the words

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:11.300
of Herbert Butterfield
who was a historian

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:13.680
at Cambridge during
the Second World War

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.620
and wrote this shortly
afterwards that he reminded

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.170
of Churchill when
he read phrases like

00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:23.890
"If any 10 men will stand
beside me, I intend to go on."

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.680
George III was so obsessed

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:32.940
that he actually threatened
his abdication during the war

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.720
before-- long before he wrote
the actual abdication letter.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.920
And when he heard about the
news of Yorktown, he sent--

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:46.980
well, up today, we would
think of almost like an email

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.500
because George III,
whenever he was writing,

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:53.920
would put the exact
time of the day almost

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:57.980
to the last second on the note.

00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:02.190
But in this particular message,
which was sent to the secretary

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:08.280
of state for America in his
house in Pall Mall in London,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.410
he failed even to put
the date which shows

00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.940
that there was a certain anxiety

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.530
because he just heard
about Yorktown.

00:55:14.530 --> 00:55:18.770
And he wrote to Germain who
was dining with nine guests.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:23.820
And the nine guests were unaware
in fact to the news of Yorktown

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:28.360
but they knew something major is
happening when the message came

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:31.830
from the king late at night
during a dinner party.

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.630
And one of the guests happened
to say that they'd heard

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:40.840
that the French foreign
minister died and how sad

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.830
because the minister would
never know what the outcome

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.940
of the American Revolution was.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:52.190
And Germain-- Lord Germain
said he did know the outcome

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:55.460
of the American Revolution.

00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:58.130
And most of the party
at that point felt

00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:01.730
that they were referring to the
Battle of the Chesapeake Capes,

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:05.080
because most people
still expected Cornwallis

00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.650
to be victorious.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.900
They're even calling
him an English Hannibal

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:13.550
in the British newspapers.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:16.340
And then Germain passed
around the message

00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:18.950
which said he'd heard that
Cornwallis had surrendered

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.680
at Yorktown but we
intend to go on.

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:28.000
This is a minor setback
like Saratoga but most

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:31.750
of the army is still
in place in New York.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:36.200
We still have cities throughout
the eastern seaboard including

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.840
Savannah or in Charleston.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:43.620
We still got Canada
and we will fight on.

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:46.320
And indeed, one of the reasons

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:50.170
that North eventually
resigned was

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:54.410
because he couldn't really
persuade the king for him

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.820
to be able to give an
unequivocal commitment

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:00.500
that Britain would
withdraw from America.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:05.940
And opposition leaders
came in to replace him.

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:11.650
George III during the American
Revolution made his main palace

00:57:11.650 --> 00:57:15.900
outside of London Windsor
Castle, where the archives are.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:20.050
And that is the round tower
where they're contained.

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:23.280
I've always started
symbolically quite significant

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.850
that he would base himself
in a castle during the war

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:35.040
because both-- his father died
of course before becoming king

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.260
but his grandfather George II

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.030
and his great grandfather
George I,

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:42.060
both of them [inaudible]
Windsor Castle.

00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:47.000
In fact, a lot of work had to
be done to make it inhabitable.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.660
George III would have military
music played constantly there.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.090
He even designed the kind

00:57:53.090 --> 00:57:57.870
of uniform coat wear
called the Windsor uniform

00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:03.340
that was introduced
towards the end of the war.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:07.090
And he obsessed about
every detail of the war.

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:10.830
And that is very apparent
when you start to go

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:13.610
through the correspondence.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.260
Now, Arthur alluded
earlier to the fact

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.560
that correspondence was
published in the '20s

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:22.100
by a man called Sir
John Fortescue,

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:25.290
who's a remarkable librarian
of the royal archives

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.440
and a remarkable historian

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:32.710
who wrote multi-volume
histories of the British army.

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:36.110
And although in terms
of their interpretation

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:39.260
of attitudes, they're
very dated.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.010
Nevertheless, John Shy,

00:58:41.010 --> 00:58:44.080
one of the America's
leading military historians

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.560
of the American Revolution,

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.860
he recently reprinted
the section dealing

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.220
with the American Revolution

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:56.330
because he particularly admired
the way Fortescue is very easily

00:58:56.330 --> 00:59:02.320
and briefly able to
summarize battles and events.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.510
But the problem with that
correspondence is firstly it's

00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:08.910
incomplete as we
again see in a moment.

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:13.120
Secondly, his author alluded
it's not really reliable.

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:16.210
And it was Sir Lewis
Namier who's regarded as one

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.730
of Britain's leading
20th century historians,

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:24.230
who went through just the first
year and produce the volume

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:29.150
of corrections and amendments
to Fortescue's series.

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.800
Incidentally, that
had a credible effect

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.920
to all documentary
editors afterwards.

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:42.110
It sent shivers people
spying that because a lot

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:47.140
of these changes were
hardly significant,

00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:52.970
nevertheless it was a warning
never to entirely rely on this--

00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:56.830
on the printed edition.

00:59:56.830 --> 01:00:03.410
Thirdly, actually seeing the
original documents is in itself,

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:08.460
does influence your
reading of them.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:15.000
This on the screen is a list
of George III's own hand

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.410
of ships of the French Navy.

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:19.670
And one of the most
remarkable things to me--

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:24.320
and I was actually curious
about George III's influence

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.370
on strategy because like the
president of United States,

01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:32.840
he was commander-in-chief
of the army.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:37.800
But he actually knew by
name most of his officers.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.950
He was also the most proficient
monarch in naval affairs

01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:48.880
since at least William
III, if not the equal

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.300
of someone like James II.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:54.810
Supposedly, he knew off by
heart the soundings and depths

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:59.850
of various harbors
around Europe.

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:07.220
And I found lots of
letters and lists

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:10.300
where he'd copied
in his own hand.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:16.430
The most remarkable is in fact
the Siege of Boston in 1775

01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:19.690
where he's got information
about ordnance.

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:25.070
And what he do is he'd receive
the official papers from one

01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:28.050
of the secretaries of
state usually germane

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.450
and then he copy it out.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:34.480
So, what was the
discovery for me was

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.210
that of course he
had no secretary.

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:41.390
This material was
thought of as so private.

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:43.620
And he remained without
a secretary

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.610
until really quite later on
when ill-health forced him

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:50.240
to have a secretary.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.010
And so, all of this
material is in his own hand.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:02:01.810
Thanks to his keeping letters
and papers that we have so much

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:06.590
of Lord North's correspondence
because North didn't keep

01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:09.030
as much for his own part.

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:12.470
I mentioned that a lot of
papers that are admitted

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:18.000
by Sir John Fortescue, the most
entertaining are the series

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.700
of the letters from a spy, and
it might have actually been more

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:28.610
than one person, who
signs himself Aristarchus.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:34.860
I was asked by the BBC, was he
a kind of James Bond figure?

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:37.810
And I said, I didn't think so
because he describes himself

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:42.580
as being in his late 60s.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:47.490
Although he said he felt like a
younger man, sort of 40 years,

01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:51.240
his junior, but he was very
much stationary in London

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.680
but receiving intelligence
reports especially from France.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.790
One of them describes a plot

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.940
that they thought was
an assassination plot.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:05.940
They said the French know that
you often are seen walking alone

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:10.380
in your garden without
anyone around you,

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:13.250
and so that this was a warning.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.180
Another more entertaining
one was

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.680
that a British agent had
been put up a chimney

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.130
in which Benjamin Franklin--

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:25.140
a room in which Benjamin
Franklin was meeting

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:30.950
with the emperor of Austria
to overhear the conversation.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.830
But some of it goes beyond.

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:35.820
And I always imagine
that Fortescue

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.910
as a military historian
is mystic

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:40.150
because he didn't think the
intelligence is very good.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:41.900
That was always been my guess.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:46.770
So, I really don't understand
why would particular letters--

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:52.380
there are even letters of Lord
North that are not printed

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.680
in the correspondence.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.830
I'm not sure if it
was just negligence

01:03:56.830 --> 01:03:59.120
or if he had a specific reason.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.200
But there are other
intelligence reports

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.910
that really are very important.

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:07.880
I thought one of the most
important came in a booklet

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:13.660
and it's from 1777,
1781 and it's a book

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:20.020
of naval intelligence by British
spies based near the coast near

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.300
the port of Brest watching the
movements of the French fleet.

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:27.560
And that is pretty critical
because one of the reasons

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.460
that British got it wrong
in Yorktown is that one

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:35.250
of the only times in the war
they had bad naval intelligence.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.370
The British planned to have a--

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.370
what was known as
a [inaudible] navy.

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:43.060
And that would be navy that was
strong enough to defeat France

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.640
and Spain simultaneously.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.640
Nearly for all of
the 18th century,

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:51.280
the British had naval
superiority.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.110
It was the basis
of their empire,

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:56.550
their control of the seas.

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:59.200
But the battle of the
Chesapeake Capes is one

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.600
of the only battles
they really lost.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.360
And it was a loss
even though much

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.640
of it was simply drifting apart.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:10.730
But the fact that the
British were not able

01:05:10.730 --> 01:05:12.910
to defeat the French
Navy and open

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:17.290
up the Chesapeake
represented a major defeat.

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:22.000
And one of the reasons
was bad intelligence.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.460
And he's very curious
because the two commanders,

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.780
army commanders would blame
each other after the war.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.730
Sir Henry Clinton, the
commander-in-chief in New York,

01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:37.180
Lord Cornwallis in Yorktown,
they would blame each other and

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.090
yet both have been misled
and both had preceded

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:44.930
on the assumption that Britain
would've had the superior navy.

01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:47.580
Had they done so, it
would've been possible

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:52.460
to simply ferry Cornwallis out
Yorktown and to get him back

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:58.070
to New York or to Charleston.

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.620
Other papers that are
important and they're more

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:02.330
than just papers of George III,

01:06:02.330 --> 01:06:08.210
Jim spoke about Sir
Samuel Hood's papers

01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:10.910
and those papers are
very interesting too

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.940
for the royal family
because Sir Samuel Hood

01:06:13.940 --> 01:06:17.150
for a long while looked
after Prince William.

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:20.430
It was part of George III's
obsession with this war

01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:24.220
that he sent two of his
own sons into the military,

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:27.500
one into the army and the
14-year-old Prince William

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:31.870
into the navy where he
essentially was eye witness

01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:35.660
to some horrendous
moments almost

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.030
from the moment that
he left England.

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:43.080
The father was incredibly
disappointed with him later

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:48.370
on because he acquired
such foul language, manners

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:52.340
and alcohol habits from
his time in the navy.

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:55.720
But Hood oversaw him and
gives us a lot of information.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.670
Hood was also in the Caribbean.

01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:00.040
So, it's a very important source

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.450
for naval warfare
in the Caribbean.

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:05.670
These materials were
never used by any

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.890
of Sir Samuel Hood's
biographies.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.870
So they really were unknown

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:16.110
and they do represent a
very major new discovery.

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:18.620
A third set of papers that
are important are those

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:22.500
of Prince William
himself who corresponded

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.750
with his father throughout.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.400
He was the only member of
the British royal family

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.120
to visit America before
it became independent.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.210
And what was most dramatic
to me was his descriptions

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:40.390
of British occupied New York.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:46.180
And what was amusing was
his description of arriving

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:51.130
and he was greeted by Henry
Clinton who's commander-in-chief

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:55.200
who you think might had other
preoccupations at the time

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.980
because this was literally
about a month before Yorktown

01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:03.660
where people are going mad
in New York with the fleet

01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.200
of Sir Samuel Hood
having returned,

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.650
knocked about by de Grasse.

01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:11.780
And supposedly they were trying
to refit it and repair it to go

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:17.700
and have another attempt
to release Cornwallis.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:23.930
But when Prince William arrived,
he met Sir Henry Clinton

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:26.810
and he walked through what
he called the Parade Ground

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.070
but what we call Bowling Green.

01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:32.470
And at this moment,
his relationship

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:36.180
with his father was
incredibly tense

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:39.970
because the father really
was upset by now at the sort

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:42.790
of relationships the
son was developing,

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:45.120
the fact that he
wasn't studying.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.590
And he said as he walked
through Bowling Green,

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:52.210
and I saw the pedestal

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:55.380
where once he imagined the
statue stood [laughter].

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.280
And it's difficult not to think

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:05.930
that this was a [inaudible]
dad [laughter].

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.840
Also, part of the papers,

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:13.830
although they are being
digitally copied separately,

01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:17.180
but an important part of
the papers are the maps

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:21.110
and military plans
and engravings

01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:23.310
in the royal collection.

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:26.170
These are very remarkable.

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:29.940
I looked at several,
the Bunker Hill,

01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:32.200
and I initially thought
I recognize these.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:39.040
These are the famous plans of
Bunker Hill that you'll see them

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.620
in almost every textbook.

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:45.900
And then I realized they showed
different parts of the day

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.680
of Bunker Hill that these
had not been reproduced.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.070
Now, I can tell you
that the Library

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:56.390
of Congress actually
did microfilm

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:58.820
of these many years ago,

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:02.040
but I don't think many people
would be aware of that.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.350
But the Library of Congress is
the most important secondary

01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:09.180
repository for a lot
of British materials.

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:13.560
They copied all of the
colonial office materials many

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:14.860
decades ago.

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.820
So it's an excellent
place to come

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:20.310
and study the American
Revolution.

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:21.900
Nevertheless, when
you're dealing with maps

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.410
and engravings, you
really do want

01:10:23.410 --> 01:10:29.190
to see the original not
look at it on microfilm.

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:34.510
And finally people
mentioned that there are lots

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:41.830
of miscellaneous papers at least
to do with trying to get his--

01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:45.320
buy out his son from letters

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.750
that the son had
foolishly written--

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.660
this was the future George IV--

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:55.360
to his mistress and the father
had to pay a lot of money

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.670
to get these letters back.

01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:05.290
The woman involved was a very
smart actress and she managed

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:08.050
to secure a very
large sum of money.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:12.580
She then went on to be the
partner [inaudible] probably the

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.680
most hated British
officer in America

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.210
but it's often said although
people regard [inaudible]

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:22.170
memoirs as a lot of
lies, but they're some

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:25.250
of the best written memoirs
by any British soldier.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:28.350
But that's because she was
a novelist and a writer

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:32.070
and it almost certainly a
ghost written his memoir.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:36.650
All I can say by ending and any
of you might consider applying

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:39.040
for this fellowship, is

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:42.250
that it's just the most
wonderful location.

01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:46.990
These are a few photos that
I just took with my iPhone.

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:53.250
The Nell Gwynn coffee house
supposedly there are tunnels

01:11:53.250 --> 01:11:54.700
from that coffee house

01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:57.970
which Nell Gwynn used
to see Charles II.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:00.310
There's a changing
of the guard just

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:03.670
like Buckingham Palace everyday.

01:12:03.670 --> 01:12:06.680
And of course it's terribly
tempting because I meant

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.730
to be inside the castle.

01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:14.560
But there's always so much
going on outside and, you know,

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:19.970
just observing sunset-- there's
an even song there everyday,

01:12:19.970 --> 01:12:23.400
a beautiful song, even
sung in St. George's Chapel

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.100
where Elizabeth I
is also buried.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.130
And it's worth going to just
purely as a good concert

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:33.430
and you can also
get free admission

01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:36.180
to the castle if you go to that.

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.750
So I'll just leave you
with those visitors.

01:12:40.750 --> 01:12:44.280
But I'll end by saying I think
that is wonderful the Library

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.580
of Congress is involved.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:50.810
I've met with Carla Hayden
at Monticello and again

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:52.110
at the British embassy.

01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:54.960
I know how personally
enthusiastic she is

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.260
about this program.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.670
But what I really liked
and especially when I came

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:03.130
for planning session of the
exhibits on the Two Georges

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:04.450
that they're planning is

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:08.200
that this clearly is not
a top-down enthusiasm,

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.430
there's real enthusiasm among
the staff of this relationship.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:15.560
And in the museum
and library world,

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:18.010
these kinds of collaborations
are becoming more

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:19.310
and more important.

01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:21.110
So, thank you very much.

01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:28.530
[ Applause ]

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:30.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J. Shogan: Last
but certainly not the least.

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.160
It's my distinct honor
to introduce Karin Wulf.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.380
Karin is a historian
of early America

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:39.340
and the early modern Atlantic
world focused on gender,

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.250
family, and the state.

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.240
She is director of the
Omohundro Institute

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.090
of Early American History
and Culture and a professor

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:49.590
of History at the College
of William and Mary

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:51.860
where she directs
graduate student research

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.730
in early American
and gender history.

01:13:54.730 --> 01:13:56.880
She is a founder and
co-chair of the William

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:00.980
and Mary's Neurodiversity
Initiative and a co-founder

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:04.990
of Women Also Know History,
a media and curriculum tool

01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:09.250
for supporting and advancing
the work of women historians.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.610
And most importantly,
she is the academic lead

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:14.890
for the Georgian Papers
Programme in the United States

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:17.660
and is proven to be a terrific
colleague and collaborator

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.450
for the Library of Congress
and our GPP partnership.

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:24.510
Karin, we look forward
to your presentation.

01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:31.790
[ Applause ]

01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:34.030
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Well first, I
want to thank our colleagues

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:37.640
and host here, of course first
of all Colleen but also John

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.020
and Travis and others for
joining us in the work

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:42.850
of the Georgian Papers
Programme and in helping us

01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:45.930
to bring attention to its
work and its potential.

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:49.750
I also want to thank some absent
friends, colleagues especially

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.680
at the royal archives whom
you saw in some of the images

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:55.550
that Arthur shared and who
are scanning, cataloging,

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:58.820
and posting the materials on the
Royal Collection Trust website

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.470
and aiding of course all
of the scholars now working

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:04.100
in the materials both the
physical archive at Windsor

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.630
and the digital archive that
we're producing collaboratively.

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:11.580
So the documentary from which
Arthur shared some clips,

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.200
Robert Hardman's
"Genius of the Mad King",

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.950
was on BBC last January
as a way of introducing

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.270
to the British public, the
Georgian Papers Programme.

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:25.110
And actually all four of us
appeared in the documentary.

01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:28.530
Jim used to actually saw
Arthur among that collaboration

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:31.550
of scholars there in the
first clutch, you know,

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:33.200
getting to touch the
materials and so on.

01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.330
And he and Jim and Andrew
are each interviewed

01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:39.780
in the documentary
about their research

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.230
and about the wonderful
findings.

01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:45.820
From my rather ignominious part
in the documentary, I was filmed

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:51.020
at an event almost two and a
half years ago now, on April 1st

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.920
of 2015 about two dozen of us
gathered in the royal library

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.370
at Windsor where Her Majesty the
Queen formally inaugurated the

01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:00.220
project and we were
all introduced.

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.180
And it was quite
wonderful of course.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.150
She's kind of extraordinary.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.170
And I was babbling
a bit with her

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:09.270
about the excitement
of the archives.

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:11.130
So, that's the piece
that made it

01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:13.430
into the documentary [laughter].

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:18.820
Now I've been reliably
informed that many people start

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.790
to babble a bit when
in the presence.

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.700
But honestly, my enthusiastic
fulminating wasn't entirely

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:26.000
about speaking with the queen.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.990
Anyone who's enthusiastic,
whatever you're enthused about,

01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:32.050
whether you're into cars
or knitting or fine wine

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:37.560
or barbecue or founding father
saltshakers is actually a thing

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.020
will know that a fantastic
example of the object

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.230
of your enthusiasm will
make you completely gaiety.

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:47.430
So yes, the archives themselves
are absolutely fabulous.

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:50.880
King George III wasn't
employing a secretary

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.550
at an arguably enormously
important period

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:55.910
in the history of
our two countries.

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:58.460
So to handle those
materials, to see the shade

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.840
and feel the weight
of the paper,

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.300
to look at where he lifted the
quill or maybe press too hard

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.620
to make a point, a point
that were directly on the war

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.360
that created our country, well,

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.050
the physical object itself
is beyond compelling.

01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:16.270
But even that isn't what made
me quite so kind of nutty

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:18.520
in that film clip that
I'm purposely not sharing

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.650
with you [laughter].

01:17:21.650 --> 01:17:23.930
What compels us still
as we explore

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:27.150
and shape this project going
forward is really the potential

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:28.980
of the project.

01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:31.180
Refresh historical understanding

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:35.130
that is really what makes
this project so exciting.

01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:38.190
I don't think there's anyone
here that I have to persuade

01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:40.000
about the importance of history.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.640
I'm going to just go
with assuming that.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.770
But history is the context
in which we make decision,

01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:50.380
everyday consequential and
minute, domestic and national.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.450
And these archives give
us an opportunity to think

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:57.400
with fresh evidence about the
history that shapes the world

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.740
that we live in right now.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:03.280
In part it's the fresh material
like the Aristarchus material

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.770
that Andrew just discussed,
the de Bude correspondence

01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:08.260
that Jim's analyzed, but
it's also a chance to think

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.860
about how we can see
things in a fresh light,

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.980
make new connections or
create an entirely new frame

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.160
of reference or subjective
analysis.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:19.100
We can use it to see people
and subjects that may have been

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.040
or may have seemed to be
marginal to its interest

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.490
that is the interest
of the court

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.750
but in fact incredibly
important,

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:28.520
especially in an American
and Atlantic context.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.010
And the Omohundro
Institute's chief investment

01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:33.540
in this project is
entirely along these lines.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.540
To take the opportunity of this
incredible archive that bear

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.190
so importantly on our
country's early history,

01:18:39.190 --> 01:18:41.390
to illuminate fresh
histories of early America

01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:42.690
and the Atlantic world.

01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:45.780
Just one of these potential
topics is the nature

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.790
of 18th century women's
intellectual exchange.

01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:53.800
In the 18th century, a
robust intellectual exchange

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.830
across the Atlantic,
sometimes called the Republic

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:59.890
of Letters included
philosophers, scientists,

01:18:59.890 --> 01:19:03.420
and statesmen from England and
the continent, and Americans

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:06.320
such as most famously
probably Benjamin Franklin

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.620
and Thomas Jefferson.

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.330
Now this developing web

01:19:09.330 --> 01:19:12.420
of intellectual connection
was fueled by an exchange

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.120
of writing, mostly letters
and other manuscript material

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.250
but also printed books,
treatises, pamphlets.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:22.100
Jefferson and Franklin produced
and received roughly 10,000

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:24.940
and 15,000 letters respectively

01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:27.820
in their lifetimes giving
you some idea of the volume

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.480
of this Republic of Letters
and anybody who's tried

01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:34.330
to get their email inbox down
to zero can appreciate the size

01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:36.280
of this endeavor.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.020
Scholars have mapped
the Republic of Letters

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:41.220
in putting data on
authors and recipients

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.760
to produce data visualization.

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.080
There's actually
terrific project

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.290
out at Stanford University
called Mapping the Republic

01:19:46.290 --> 01:19:47.590
of Letters.

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:49.970
For America, the primary
observation of mapping

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.010
that republic is
that the Republic

01:19:52.010 --> 01:19:55.980
of Letters looks very focused
on England and particularly

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.120
on London networks that
is for the Americans

01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.420
who are participating.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.560
And of course the most
elaborate work has been done

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.040
on the primarily male
participants in these networks.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.060
But women's literally

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.500
and intellectual networks
were also flourishing

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.800
in the 18th century.

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:12.550
And they may not yield to
the kinds of data points

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:15.780
and mapping approach but the
voluminous correspondents of men

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:17.850
like Jefferson and
Franklin might,

01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:20.830
but rather take some teasing
out of themes and influences.

01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:24.210
Now scholars have studied
closely what's known

01:20:24.210 --> 01:20:27.400
as the bluestocking circle
of women writers in England.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:30.010
And other scholars have also
studied early American groups

01:20:30.010 --> 01:20:32.820
of women, particularly in
the urban hubs of Boston,

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:35.240
Philadelphia, and New
York who are writing

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.950
and reading one another's work.

01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:38.680
How might these groups
have intersected

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.810
and what can the
Georgian Papers illuminate

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:44.500
in fresh possibilities
about these women writers?

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.510
So, I want to invite to take
three quick steps with me

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:49.600
through women's transatlantic
connection centering

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.640
on intellectual and
literally concerns.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.940
The first concerns, two of the
most prominent women of England

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.420
and America, respectively,
Catharine Macaulay

01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:02.340
and Mercy Otis Warren,

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:06.040
whose connection offers us
just a quick place to begin.

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.190
Macaulay was one of the most
prominent public women in an era

01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:11.890
in which very few women were
either and certainly not

01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:13.640
as intellectual as we've
heard already a lot

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.320
about princesses and mistresses.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.280
She was known colloquially
as the female historian.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.380
Macaulay wrote a history
of 17th century England,

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:26.030
the history of England from
the ascension of James I

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:28.670
to the revolution
in eighth volumes

01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:31.200
with the first volume
published in 1763

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.660
and the last 20 years
later in 1783.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:37.760
This was a political history
that is a history of politics

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.670
and governance but also a quite
politically charged history.

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:45.670
It [inaudible] for mostly Whigs
and was seen as a kind small

01:21:45.670 --> 01:21:48.330
"r" republican work
and anti-royalist,

01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:50.560
though not necessary
straightforwardly so.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.180
She was incredibly
critical of Oliver Cromwell.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:56.950
For example, she called
him a glorious usurper.

01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:58.790
She's a great writer.

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:00.570
I hear applause out there

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.460
for being glorious
usurper, OK [laughs].

01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:08.080
Macaulay's history was praised
by major figures of the day

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:10.170
in England even by
William Pitt for examples

01:22:10.170 --> 01:22:12.210
in the House of Commons.

01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:14.160
Mercy Otis Warren's
life was marked

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.840
by the revolutionary
era in which she lived.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.890
Born of a mayflower family
mother and a lawyer father,

01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:22.120
mercy and her siblings
were raised and educated

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.990
to an extraordinary
high standard.

01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:27.180
One of her brothers, James Otis,
for example, authored key text

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.230
to the American Revolution such
as the famous pamphlet "Rights

01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:32.700
of the British Colonies
Asserted and Proved".

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.480
He famously articulated the
principle of no taxation

01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.030
without representation
in regards to the scheme

01:22:38.030 --> 01:22:41.530
to collect taxes on American
consumption of British goods.

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:44.420
Mercy wrote in a variety
of genres including one

01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:47.720
of the more significant
publications of the late 1780s,

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:50.160
advocating for the
inclusion of a bill of rights

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.270
in the new US constitution.

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:56.570
And in 1805, she published the
product of decades of writing

01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.290
about the unfolding events

01:22:58.290 --> 01:23:01.050
of the revolution
and its aftermath.

01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:04.930
Thomas Jefferson wrote that her
rise, progress, and termination

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:07.560
of the American Revolution,
was "a truthful

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.250
and insightful account
of the last 30 years

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:13.030
that will furnish a more
instructive lesson to mankind

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:15.750
than any earlier
period in history."

01:23:15.750 --> 01:23:18.520
Because of Warren's
increasingly anti-federalist

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.260
and Jeffersonian
leanings however,

01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:23.910
John Adams who had been a long
time dear friend denounced

01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:25.470
the work.

01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:28.460
These two extraordinary women,
these two historians, Macaulay

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.700
and Warren, maintained a long
and intense correspondence

01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:34.020
across two crucial decades.

01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:38.360
They began to correspond in
1773 and Warren's last letter

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.950
to Macaulay was in May of 1791,
the year that Macaulay died.

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:45.520
In an early exchange
about whether women could

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.510
and should express
political opinions,

01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:50.420
obviously they were preaching
to one another there,

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:54.720
Mercy Warren wrote to her famous
friend, "I disregard the opinion

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.450
that women make but in
different politicians.

01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:00.520
When the observations are
just and do honor to the heart

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.170
and character, I think it very
immaterial whether they flow

01:24:04.170 --> 01:24:06.950
from a female lip or are
thundered in the Senate

01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:10.130
in the bolder language
of the other sex."

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:13.140
Macaulay and Warren's
friendship was tested as they

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:16.050
like many other figures in this
period who are deeply involved

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:18.780
and invested disagreed,
sometimes mildly

01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:21.000
and sometimes sharply,
sometimes privately

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.100
and sometimes actually
quite publicly.

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:26.220
But their mutual
admiration never waned.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.420
Macaulay visited
America for over a year,

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:30.270
beginning in the summer of 1784.

01:24:30.270 --> 01:24:32.100
And she spent time
in Boston with Warren

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.970
and she actually spent
time at Mount Vernon too,

01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:35.960
visiting George and
Martha Washington.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.940
Now that we've established
something of the extent

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.560
of women's transatlantic
connections, courtesy of Warren

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:45.040
and Macaulay, let us turn to one
that brings us into the courts

01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:47.280
and the Georgian Papers.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.600
This example concerns one

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.970
of the 18th century's
most celebrated novelists,

01:24:50.970 --> 01:24:52.540
Frances Burney known as Fanny.

01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:56.330
Burney was a prodigious diarist.

01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:57.630
In fact just this year,

01:24:57.630 --> 01:25:01.100
the Guardian described
her edited diaries as one

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.870
of the 100 most important
nonfiction works of all time.

01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:07.530
She's a great diarist
and great writer.

01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:11.550
She published her first novel in
1778 and her second, "Cecilia",

01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:14.050
to great acclaim in 1782.

01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:17.190
The enthusiastic reception for
"Cecilia" included attention

01:25:17.190 --> 01:25:18.710
from the royal family.

01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:20.810
The queen urged her
daughters to read it

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:22.510
for amusement and for education.

01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:26.390
And in 1785, Queen
Charlotte asked Burney

01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:29.960
to accept the position at court,
which the novelist accepted.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.640
She was one of the queen's
ladies for five years,

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.870
difficult ones that included
King George III's first intense

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:38.310
period of mental illness.

01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:41.220
We've heard quite a bit about
the king's qualities as a sort

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:43.900
of intellectual magpie you might
have gathered he was interested

01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.660
in all kinds of different
things from agriculture

01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.800
to astronomy to statecraft.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.840
And Charlotte too had a lively
curiosity for botany, for music,

01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.030
and language but especially
for history and literature.

01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:59.520
She was keen to have
bluestockings around her.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.100
Burney wasn't the only one.

01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.110
And they remained close.

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:05.630
Burney remained close
to the princesses too

01:26:05.630 --> 01:26:08.930
after she left royal service.

01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:13.170
Burney's reputation flourished
internationally and in America.

01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:18.100
The London edition of "Cecilia"
was advertised as early as 1784

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:22.530
in America and was printed in
an American edition in 1793.

01:26:22.530 --> 01:26:24.280
Now these novels are
sometimes described

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.880
as precursor to Jane Austin.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.740
They're witty, they're
country house settings.

01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:31.260
In these books, the
women are always readers.

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:34.570
And in fact Austin's-- the title

01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:37.210
of probably Austin's most
significant novel comes

01:26:37.210 --> 01:26:39.820
from a line in "Cecilia" where
a character notes that the whole

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.500
of this unfortunate
business has been the result

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.800
of pride and prejudice.

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:48.660
Burney' reputation
among American educators

01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:50.190
in particular only grew.

01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:52.600
As the 19th century
dawned, there was a rush

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.380
of new academies founded for the
education of privileged girls

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.300
in America and an embrace
of the value of education

01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:00.470
for free girls of elite families

01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:03.050
as a benefit to the
new republic.

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:06.090
Among the great writers and
advocates was another Bostonian,

01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:07.630
Judith Sargent Murray.

01:27:07.630 --> 01:27:10.480
She was an early advocate
for equality of the sexes,

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.540
publishing an essay by that
name in 1790, well in advance

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.320
of Mary Wollstonecraft in fact.

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.020
And she gathered her many
essays together in 1798.

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.990
Just as Americans were
beginning to think

01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:24.320
about creating a new national
literature and she published

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.530
in three volumes "The Gleaner",

01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:28.400
which incorporated
her political views

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.550
and especially her interest
in women's education.

01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:32.990
And she'd go on to
found a women's--

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:35.920
a girl school herself
with two friends in 1802.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.500
And in "The Gleaner" which
Murray is publishing in 1798,

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.870
she advocated for the value

01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:45.530
of Burney's novels,
especially "Cecilia".

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:48.760
In a period when novels were
often dismissed as frivolous

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.050
or not reflective of the
virtues of the new nation,

01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:54.480
there's actually a very snarky
John Quincy Adams quote about

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.500
"Cecilia" specifically.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.850
But Murray and others made
clear that in their reflections

01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:01.630
on character and circumstances,

01:28:01.630 --> 01:28:04.830
novels could be essential
reading and learning.

01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:07.090
And here of course she's
echoing Queen Charlotte

01:28:07.090 --> 01:28:09.420
who if you remember
advocated Burney's books

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:12.260
for her daughters
for the same reasons.

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.440
And now let's bring
this quickly together.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.670
The transatlantic connections
among women intellectuals,

01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:20.470
they were reading one another's
work, writing about one another

01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:23.880
and even directly communicating,
in fact across political--

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.460
what we might think of
as political device.

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.810
My third example here
concerns the place of history

01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:31.560
in geography in women's
education in the late 18th

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.200
and early 19th century.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.280
In those early female academies,

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.860
like the one Judith
Sargent Murray helped found,

01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.770
the curriculum included novels
in place of course in poetry

01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:44.080
but it also emphasize
the importance of history

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:46.730
and geography essential
to the education of women

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:49.220
as Denisons [phonetic]
of this new nation.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.410
And here you'll see on
the right there an example

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:54.680
from a Quaker school right
outside of Philadelphia

01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.230
where teachers created their
own textbooks of poetry

01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:00.020
and also had their students
create their own globes.

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:03.180
This stitched globe is actually
it's got hardcore interior

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:06.170
and batting around it and
there are number of examples

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:07.470
from this particular school,

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:10.270
the Westtown School,
as well as others.

01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:12.270
And then the longitude
is stitched.

01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:14.890
It's really faded there but
it's a really beautiful object.

01:29:14.890 --> 01:29:16.440
It's [inaudible]
center right now

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:18.560
at the Boston Public Library.

01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:21.730
This stitched globe
helped these young women

01:29:21.730 --> 01:29:24.360
as they had male
students for centuries,

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:26.770
not only with basic
geographical orientation

01:29:26.770 --> 01:29:28.700
but with geometry and astronomy.

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:32.820
And back inside Windsor
Castle, Queen Charlotte,

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:35.980
her six daughters, the
princesses and their governesses

01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:37.280
and ladies in waiting

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.790
like Frances Burney were
creating curricula of their own.

01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:44.340
The Queen established at
Frogmore House a private retreat

01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:48.320
on the grounds at Windsor,
a printing press of her own.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:50.520
And there, among
many others projects,

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.980
they created boxed
sets of historical

01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:55.070
and geographical information.

01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:58.390
Here you see, on
the top left there,

01:29:58.390 --> 01:30:03.440
an example of a manuscript
version, which on that kind

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.740
of upper left there

01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.550
in the center what you
see is a whole bunch

01:30:07.550 --> 01:30:09.550
of those manuscript
cards stacked together

01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:12.040
with their own really
beautiful box next to it.

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.140
So, even the manuscript rough
draft copy gets a beautiful

01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.440
leather box.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.770
Anyway, and then you also
see the printed cards there.

01:30:20.770 --> 01:30:22.840
So you can see how they
were printed at Frogmore,

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.410
on the press at Frogmore.

01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:27.230
Printed cards and boxes
about Spain, Germany, France,

01:30:27.230 --> 01:30:30.660
Portugal, and Rome, or United
States of America you'd say.

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:32.810
So how might these have
reflected the work of some

01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:36.590
of the important historian
of the day like Macaulay?

01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:39.760
The queen herself was also
writing historical accounts

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.730
that reflected her
veracious reading.

01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:44.170
She may have been like her
husband and many others

01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:46.520
of their era copying
work she read

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.050
or combining her own thoughts
and words with those of others.

01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:51.320
And I've been reading in
her historical accounts.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:54.970
She began to keep careful track
for example of the history

01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:57.770
and lineage of Sophia,
Electress of Hanover.

01:30:57.770 --> 01:31:00.040
There are two copies in
the queen's handwriting

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.040
of the lineage of Sophia.

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.900
Why would she be
writing multiple times

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.210
about Sophia the
Electress of Hanover?

01:31:08.210 --> 01:31:10.310
Well, those of you
who know your 17th

01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:13.280
and 18th century English
history will know exactly why.

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:15.940
Because this was-- She was
the granddaughter of James I

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:19.300
and this was the lineage that
would shift the British monarchy

01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.010
from the Stewarts to the
Hanovers with George I

01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:23.680
and would bring Charlotte
to England

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:26.020
as the consort of George III.

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:28.450
She wrote out this
history of Sophia,

01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:31.050
Electress of Hanover
multiple times.

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.530
How meaningful that was
and yet how contested

01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:35.440
in the many histories
of the 17th century

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.160
and earlier that she had read.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:39.540
How consequential in
the 18th centuries

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.160
through to what she was living.

01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:43.610
These are just a few of
the extraordinary stories

01:31:43.610 --> 01:31:47.530
and connections that we can
pull out of the Georgian Papers.

01:31:47.530 --> 01:31:49.990
And I want to suggest
that if you want

01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:52.740
to explore the Georgian
Papers yourself,

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.640
the items are being digitized

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.330
and then released
online in trenches.

01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:59.080
There are about 50,000
items already on the website

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:03.100
and they're being released
and rolling about 25

01:32:03.100 --> 01:32:05.110
to 30,000 items at a time.

01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:08.520
And you can begin by looking
at our three project websites.

01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:11.540
To read more about the
blog post and information

01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:14.630
about the GPPU can consult the
Omohundro Institute and William

01:32:14.630 --> 01:32:20.090
and Mary site which is
georgianpapers-us.wm.edu.

01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:22.160
We'll post all these
staff for you.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.860
And the King's site which
is georgianpapersprogramme,

01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:27.740
with an extra M-E dot com.

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:30.490
These are mirror sites and
they express our mutual

01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:32.390
and ongoing scholarly work.

01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:34.210
The papers themselves
along with some

01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:37.020
of the academic commentarial
including pieces by all

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:41.540
of us are at
gpp.royalcollection.org.uk.

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:44.600
And if you toggle to
the upper right there,

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.540
you'll see the GPP micro site.

01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:48.450
And that has at least
50,000 items

01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:50.010
that are already posted some

01:32:50.010 --> 01:32:51.650
of the materials
we've shared with you.

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:55.470
But more all the time is this
project continues through 2020.

01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:57.510
Thank you so much
for your time today.

01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:06.070
[Applause]

01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:07.370
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J. Shogan: OK.

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:10.190
So now we're going to ask all
of our presenters to come back

01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:13.050
up on stage and it's
time for you,

01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:15.030
you've been very
patient audience,

01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:17.280
if you have questions for them.

01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:19.670
We have about 20 or 25 minutes.

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:23.180
And we also have microphones
coming around the room.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:24.480
So when I call on you,

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:27.040
please wait until the
microphone arrives.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:31.220
Is there anybody
that has questions?

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:32.520
Yes, over here.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:35.920
Yeah, just wait for
the microphone, please.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.550
&gt;&gt; So, best estimate,
overall, what percentage

01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:50.220
of papers have been
at least indexed?

01:33:50.220 --> 01:33:56.000
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: It depends on
what you mean by indexing.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.300
I mean, there's a kind of--

01:33:57.300 --> 01:33:59.460
there's a rough look
at the whole--

01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:04.340
the pie chart that Arthur showed
you, you know, is from a kind

01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:07.880
of rough cut look, but when
you say index, nothing.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.790
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: Possibly
even less than 15%, in fact.

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:12.090
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Yes.

01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:13.390
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns:
Is a real indexing.

01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:14.690
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Yeah.

01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:15.990
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: So you can--

01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:17.730
What's on the outside of
the box, we can tell you.

01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:19.030
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Yeah.

01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:20.330
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns:
Beyond that, no.

01:34:20.330 --> 01:34:21.630
&gt;&gt; Andrew O'Shaughnessy: I
thought I'd been deficient

01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:24.770
because I kept expecting
it would be somewhere kind

01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:26.800
of printed manuscript
guide that you have

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:30.850
for almost every archive
and it doesn't exist.

01:34:30.850 --> 01:34:35.720
And one of the problems reminds
me a little once I mentioned

01:34:35.720 --> 01:34:38.890
this to Karin, Gary
Hart [assumed spelling]

01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:42.280
when he was asked to
investigate the CIA and FBI

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.470
with Barry Goldwater and he
said we didn't know what we were

01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:49.880
looking for [laughs].

01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:55.000
And that is the difficulty,
always nervous

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.800
as to whether you're awfully
aware of exactly what is there

01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:03.870
or if there are boxes that you
just haven't been told about.

01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:09.010
You rely a lot of course
on the on-site librarians

01:35:09.010 --> 01:35:10.690
to tell you what they have.

01:35:10.690 --> 01:35:12.650
But I would stop by going

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:15.410
to the published
Fortescue correspondence.

01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:18.950
So at least you can get a sense
of what you might find in there.

01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:20.880
&gt;&gt; Jim Ambuske: A few weeks
before my arrival I was sent a

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.450
spreadsheet, an Excel
spreadsheet

01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:27.590
that essentially had, as Arthur
said, an indication on what was

01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:29.750
on the label on the box.

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:33.790
Some sense of what had
been published before

01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:35.900
in Fortescue [inaudible]
and that was it.

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:38.590
So, there was very little
[inaudible] sub-collections.

01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:41.770
So one of the cool things about
this submission is that I got

01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:44.550
to work with Oliver Walton
and the archivist to figure

01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:48.230
out what was actually in these
things and then we all did.

01:35:48.230 --> 01:35:49.800
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: That's
the other you can do.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.130
You can become a King's friend.

01:35:51.130 --> 01:35:54.780
And if you sign up to King's
friends, we're very happy

01:35:54.780 --> 01:35:57.480
for anyone to say I'm looking
for this, what have you got?

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.270
And we will follow that up.

01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:01.820
And actually [inaudible] we
don't know what's in there,

01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.860
what we might want to find,

01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.410
the more people would tell
us what they'd like to find,

01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:07.860
the more we can try to find it.

01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:09.540
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: The other
thing I would just say--

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.230
I know there are other
questions, so sorry--

01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:14.610
but is that some of
the fellows have gone

01:36:14.610 --> 01:36:17.130
to the archives looking
for particular topics

01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:20.760
and the not finding has been
a significant as the finding.

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:24.000
There's a wonderful blog
post on our mutual sites

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.650
by Professor Cynthia Kierner

01:36:25.650 --> 01:36:27.770
from George Mason
University who's been working

01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:30.730
on a wonderful book about
early American disasters.

01:36:30.730 --> 01:36:34.320
And she was actually going
in search of information

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.910
about the royal philanthropy
because--

01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:38.990
which really takes off
in a big way starting

01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:40.910
with the 1755 Lisbon earthquake.

01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:43.160
And she wanted to
know what did they say

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.440
about their incredible
philanthropic efforts

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:48.060
and the answer was
almost nothing.

01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:50.140
And just the fact that they were

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:52.780
so little there tells
you something.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:54.540
Anyway she's got-- I
won't give it all away

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:57.750
but it's a wonderful blog post
about why finding nothing can be

01:36:57.750 --> 01:37:01.120
as important and revealing
and tells us actually

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:02.850
as much as finding a lot.

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:05.310
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J.
Shogan: Other question?

01:37:05.310 --> 01:37:07.610
Right here.

01:37:08.690 --> 01:37:13.310
&gt;&gt; All of you have spoken
about collections of objects,

01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:16.260
things that can be
listed in spreadsheets.

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:19.100
But when you make a digital
collection, it seems to me

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:21.780
if you look to the future
information technology,

01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:24.500
which happens to be my
specialty not history,

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:33.030
allows you to build graphs
of links into my new elements

01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:37.320
in different objects,
different documents.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:40.910
And if someone looking
ahead to how

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:47.280
such a metadata can be
created to address themes

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:54.330
and documenting whatever
historical findings they have

01:37:54.330 --> 01:37:57.720
by linking many different
places not just

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.410
in the Georgian Papers
collection

01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:04.950
but even collections
that are related.

01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:08.490
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: So, it's a real
challenge and it's something

01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:11.870
that was quite a few on the team
have worked [inaudible] basic

01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:17.120
ways are fully aware of and also
just what an opportunity it is.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:19.380
The peculiar challenges with
this collection is partly is

01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.810
because of the range
of the materials in it.

01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:23.680
So the expertise you need

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.520
to produce a metadata is
extraordinarily wide ranging

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.830
in this case.

01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:30.980
So again, what we're
trying to bring people in,

01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.630
it could be part of the
conversation that we're trying

01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:34.820
to get it right and there
are lots of examples in UK,

01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:37.410
I'm sure that are here too,
places where they got it wrong

01:38:37.410 --> 01:38:40.260
and it's left with
metadata unusable,

01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.420
at least because there
have changes in their name

01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:45.590
so [inaudible] all English
politicians always have

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:49.220
about four different titles
and the most famous examples

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:51.260
with the British parliamentary
archive that failed

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:52.560
to realize the same people

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:55.420
in the metadata creation,
link them together.

01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:59.320
So we have a very good team
of digital humanist at King's

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.610
and at William and Mary
who are working together

01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:03.030
on these issues.

01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:05.150
We hope we'll be able
to make a start on it,

01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:07.270
probably to make a
success of it we'll need

01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:10.680
to get a funding going
that would build that.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.460
But it's very much
something that's in my mind

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:14.740
and also trying to think how
we provide web architecture

01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:18.390
and we'll have other people join
with us to do that throughout

01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.820
and to do it entirely
on our own.

01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:21.840
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: And there's been
a wonderful initiative here

01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:24.180
at the Library of Congress
actually to fund questions

01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:27.630
about interoperability
and making collections.

01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:29.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J. Shogan:
That was our first four away

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.510
into the project is--
Is Charlotte here?

01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:32.810
Charlotte?

01:39:32.810 --> 01:39:36.550
Charlotte Caslick [assumed
spelling] was a digital

01:39:36.550 --> 01:39:38.470
stewardship resident
that we actually sent

01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:39.770
to Windsor for several months.

01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:42.540
She was in residence here
then residence in Windsor

01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:44.070
and she was working on the issue

01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:47.710
of metadata inoperability
particularly between the Library

01:39:47.710 --> 01:39:52.230
of Congress collections
and the GPP collections.

01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:57.080
OK. Yes, in the back.

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.800
&gt;&gt; We're pretty certain
about the nature

01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.310
of George III's madness but
I was wondering of this sheds

01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:06.600
in any new light on how it--

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:14.600
or its incipient stages may
have affected policy in Britain.

01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:18.840
&gt;&gt; Andrew O'Shaughnessy: He
had about sickness at the time

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.720
of [inaudible] in the 1765,
which went on for months.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:27.580
So that was actually the
first intimation of it.

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:31.990
But there's no evidence that
he was sick during the American

01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:33.440
Revolution itself.

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:35.550
It was really on the eve
of the French Revolution

01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:40.310
that he had the first
sustained belt that was

01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:46.330
in fact the subject to the movie
"The Madness of King George".

01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:49.100
The thinking seems
to be changing.

01:40:49.100 --> 01:40:54.210
For decades, they thought
that this was porphyria.

01:40:54.210 --> 01:40:58.300
It's a mother-son
team of psychiatrists.

01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:02.100
And I thought that they've
made quite a conclusive case

01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.560
because there's a giveaway
characteristic of porphyria

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:10.230
which is a blood disease
caused often by intermarriage,

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:16.400
very like hemophilia but it's
kind of purple-colored urine.

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:22.750
And so-- And one of the
doctors constantly alluded

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:28.830
to urine color and we've
got incredible archives

01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:32.340
of the doctor's reports.

01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:36.340
But it seems that
it's changing again.

01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:42.280
I've actually seen this in
the BBC, an academic article

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:47.410
that they're going back to
thinking that he was bipolar

01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:50.390
and that would make
a difference.

01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:55.430
But-- And there's nothing
of the characteristics

01:41:55.430 --> 01:42:01.260
of the later madness of then
in 1765 and then again 1789.

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:04.490
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: What you
do find is that an awareness

01:42:04.490 --> 01:42:07.150
on politicians, the key moments

01:42:07.150 --> 01:42:13.640
that something going
before it becomes clear.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:19.730
That's just how extensive the
problems are and the effort

01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:23.370
to manage the news
around the [inaudible].

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:27.230
&gt;&gt; What happened in this second
decade of the 21st century

01:42:27.230 --> 01:42:31.670
that after all these years
the crown decided or somebody

01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:35.210
in England decided to
open these archives?

01:42:35.210 --> 01:42:36.840
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: So
I think that a number

01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.140
of different things
come together,

01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.260
one is just the technical
possibilities doing this

01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:45.690
that other people done it
to the [inaudible] for it.

01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.080
The [inaudible] has begun

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:49.400
with smaller projects they
took Queen Victoria's journal

01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:52.140
for example and made
those online.

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:54.440
And I think we've taken it
back that we have interest

01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:57.130
that were shown in,
in that project

01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.810
and that was behind
the [inaudible],

01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:00.750
so this was the first way to be

01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:04.480
to do it would genuinely
open resource

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:07.000
with academic collaborators.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.040
I think the second feature is
that the royal archives having

01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.730
under pressure to
become more public.

01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:14.440
There's been a lot
of interesting things

01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:17.840
in 20th century, royal
family in their papers.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.830
Obviously there's been
quite tricky issues

01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:23.170
about personal [inaudible]
people still alive

01:43:23.170 --> 01:43:24.470
and I think what they wanted

01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:27.720
to show is their overarching
mission to treat these

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.830
as public documents
even though they're

01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:34.420
in fact private documents which
is part of a national heritage

01:43:34.420 --> 01:43:35.720
and therefore there's been--

01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.020
it's extraordinary
effort I think

01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:39.270
for those [inaudible]
party was very,

01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:42.390
very hard unless you were
fully tenured professor

01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:45.100
with a very particular project
even to get to see what was then

01:43:45.100 --> 01:43:46.400
because there were no catalogs.

01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.770
You could find out until
you got there what they was.

01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:51.890
And now it was full of
people, not just with us,

01:43:51.890 --> 01:43:53.940
there are an awful lot

01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:56.540
but actually they've
read on the reading room.

01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.140
There's now more opportunities
to go in and use the papers.

01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:00.630
They've increased their opening.

01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:03.260
So it's a genuine attempt.

01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:05.120
I think it's very rewarding
for the archivist there too

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:07.400
that they found they
been able to do their job

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.720
of interpretation

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.450
and understanding
far more actually now

01:44:10.450 --> 01:44:12.440
that there are more changes
towards people [inaudible].

01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:14.320
It's a very well [inaudible].

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.410
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Given the
restriction there and it is

01:44:17.410 --> 01:44:19.380
where a monarch lives.

01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:23.790
So the security restrictions are
pretty intense and, you know,

01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:25.270
the restriction on
what can be done

01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:27.110
within that space
are pretty intense.

01:44:27.110 --> 01:44:29.410
Given all that I think they've
been really extraordinary

01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:33.000
about opening access to
these archival materials.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.150
And, you know, if you go
to the website, you know,

01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:37.520
anybody all over the
world can freely see.

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:42.130
And by 2020, you know, anybody
all over the world can see all

01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:44.240
of the Georgian Papers
collection digitally.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.620
Well, anybody with a, you know,

01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.920
connection in the
computer anyway.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.220
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: And it is all--

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.520
I think that's quite
important to emphasize.

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.210
It's not the sense
of selection--

01:44:51.210 --> 01:44:52.790
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Yeah,
it's everything.

01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:54.900
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns:
It's the archive.

01:44:54.900 --> 01:44:56.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J.
Shogan: Another question.

01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:58.900
Yes, down in front.

01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:04.280
&gt;&gt; Those were four
fabulous presentations.

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:06.600
I can't tell you how
they fit together

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:08.510
and also stood on their own.

01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:12.850
[ Applause ]

01:45:12.850 --> 01:45:15.250
And I care about 18th
century British history.

01:45:15.250 --> 01:45:19.180
But I want to ask a little
bit about Fanny Burney

01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:23.920
and how this might help
in teaching working

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:27.980
with graduate students in
women's and gender history.

01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:29.730
Have you thought about that?

01:45:29.730 --> 01:45:31.300
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Well,
so, you know,

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.590
I'm not a Fanny Burney
expert and there are those,

01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:36.040
many of them actually, so
I don't want to suggest

01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:38.350
that somehow I know something
that other scholars don't.

01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:40.210
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:45:40.210 --> 01:45:42.750
This is why I said, well,
we'll post a bibliography

01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:46.460
on our websites for
people who are interested.

01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:49.940
But I think that the
teaching possibilities

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:52.600
for the GPP generally
are going to be terrific

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:55.800
and the Fanny Burney
material will be great.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:58.890
I'm not sure if is that's me
squeaking or someone else.

01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:00.190
&gt;&gt; No.

01:46:00.190 --> 01:46:01.490
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: OK.

01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:02.790
All right.

01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:04.090
Good. You could see
I've got a little PTSD

01:46:04.090 --> 01:46:05.390
from that BBC documentary
[laughter].

01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:06.740
But the teaching
possibilities are great.

01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.040
I mean, Arthur really
did this amazing project

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:11.640
with his undergraduates in
King's and we've been talking

01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:14.670
about a kind of collaborative
effort at William and Mary

01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:17.250
and King's to teach
with the GPP materials

01:46:17.250 --> 01:46:18.990
to give the students
a kind of, you know,

01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:21.680
a one-shot one year kind

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.500
of informal seminar
research experience.

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:27.560
But I think all over, the
access to this materials

01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:30.150
and to link them up-- I
mean, this is, you know,

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:31.880
linking sometimes in
the old-fashioned way

01:46:31.880 --> 01:46:33.970
of I thought this and
now I've thought of that,

01:46:33.970 --> 01:46:35.820
but also digitally
linking things is going

01:46:35.820 --> 01:46:37.710
to make curricular
possibilities,

01:46:37.710 --> 01:46:39.010
really extraordinary.

01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:42.040
And, you know, the
obvious, I think,

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:44.850
topics here are the
political and military ones.

01:46:44.850 --> 01:46:47.880
And I just went for the
easiest women's history one here

01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:51.360
which is the intellectual women
who are writing and publishing

01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:53.210
and who are among the
most famous, you know,

01:46:53.210 --> 01:46:55.240
of 18th century Anglo-American
women.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.920
But the women's history
opportunities in these archives

01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.680
and the opportunities to link
materials in those archives

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:02.080
with other archives here

01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:04.420
in the United States
is really incredible.

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:07.520
There are all kinds of things
we can learn about, you know,

01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:10.190
women's consumption
patterns, about food,

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:12.060
about ideas about the body.

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.360
And there are just-- Anyway,

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.870
they are just endless
opportunities

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:16.580
and those will translate
to teaching.

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.880
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: I
think one thing you have

01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.180
to example is Princess Amelia

01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:20.920
and her experience
of consumption.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.620
Now there's another
extraordinary medical

01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:23.920
case history.

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:28.730
Lived from the inside by royal
princess has also infatuated one

01:47:28.730 --> 01:47:32.730
of your queries, so does the
extraordinary romantic story

01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:36.080
of that new kind of
romantic love being embodied

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:38.940
in that situation in
[inaudible], days we're looking

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:42.310
at that, an extraordinary
material that she's found there.

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:45.390
And that was a great story
about how digital works as well,

01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:48.250
because we broadcast the
documentary on the BBC

01:47:48.250 --> 01:47:50.180
and there's a brief
section where Flora Fraser,

01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:52.220
one of our fellows who is one

01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:56.250
of our Mount Vernon
professors, talks about this.

01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:58.130
And the next day, I got a
friendly call from somewhere

01:47:58.130 --> 01:47:59.720
in the north saying, "I
think I've got the other half

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.020
of the correspondence."

01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:03.610
And it was ascendant
to one of the queries

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:04.960
that she's involved with.

01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:06.260
So we've been up there.

01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:08.350
We haven't yet found what we
can do that an idea would be

01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:11.170
to digitize those documents
and bring those in as well.

01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:12.470
And that's what you
can do with digital.

01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:15.330
You can create virtual
archives without having to mess

01:48:15.330 --> 01:48:17.130
about with physical
archives themselves.

01:48:17.130 --> 01:48:19.130
And it's fantastic
we can do that.

01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:21.420
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: Those medical--
The medical history as a kind

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.680
of theme throughout is really
compelling with George III

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:26.390
of course and Amelia
and Fanny Burney has one

01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:29.390
of the most famous women's
medical histories of the period

01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:32.860
where she, you know,
narrated her own mastectomy.

01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:34.700
She writes about
having done it under--

01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:36.000
you know, with no anesthesia.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:44.270
It's a really extraordinary
document in women's history.

01:48:44.270 --> 01:48:46.570
&gt;&gt; Yes?

01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.920
&gt;&gt; I'd read recently in
recent years about the--

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.330
that one of the key
reasons for the loss in 1780

01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:03.400
in Cornwallis was that
half of the British troops

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:05.230
in America had been diverted

01:49:05.230 --> 01:49:09.010
to the West Indies
to protect the sugar.

01:49:09.010 --> 01:49:11.990
And given what you've
referred to as--

01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:14.890
and we've seen other places
about the king's involvement

01:49:14.890 --> 01:49:20.200
of this, it's hard to quite
imagine him either suggesting

01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.750
or allowing that diversion.

01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:26.070
Is there anything that's
come to light about that?

01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:29.370
&gt;&gt; Andrew O'Shaughnessy: He
actually supported that policy

01:49:29.370 --> 01:49:32.940
and said, "We can't even
fight the American war

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:35.140
without our sugar items."

01:49:35.140 --> 01:49:41.990
And so in 1778, when the British
had occupied Philadelphia,

01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:46.170
the new commander-in-chief Henry
Clinton was given orders to give

01:49:46.170 --> 01:49:49.320
up Philadelphia to
send 5000 troops

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:52.310
down to the Caribbean
to take Saint Lucia.

01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:57.540
And then in the summer of 1779,
the British received warning

01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:59.040
that Jamaica was
about to be invaded.

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.130
They put their entire army
in New York onboard ship

01:50:02.130 --> 01:50:05.650
with Cornwallis and they were
at sea for almost a week.

01:50:05.650 --> 01:50:09.360
So this really shows
you the priorities.

01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:12.160
They did lose a large number

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:14.920
of their islands
during the revolution.

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:17.520
But it seems to have been kind

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:22.760
of one compromise they're
willing to make was

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.010
to lose Jamaica, So they're
actually sending more troops

01:50:26.010 --> 01:50:27.560
to the West Indies in the second

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.580
of the American Revolution
then to America.

01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:36.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J.
Shogan: Over here?

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:39.830
&gt;&gt; Thanks again to all of you
for wonderful presentations.

01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:43.320
I'm wondering if any
of you has any sense

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:49.090
that this project might
stimulate contextualization

01:50:49.090 --> 01:50:51.850
with parallel archives

01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:55.580
for example among the royal
houses elsewhere in Europe

01:50:55.580 --> 01:50:59.830
or perhaps even more
pertinently,

01:50:59.830 --> 01:51:04.610
papers of British aristocratic
families and households and so

01:51:04.610 --> 01:51:08.590
on or perhaps such
already exist?

01:51:08.590 --> 01:51:10.220
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: So, we
know already there are one

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.770
or two other projects that
are beginning to talk to us,

01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:15.690
some of the kind that you've
mentioned is we've got an

01:51:15.690 --> 01:51:16.990
addition of one

01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:19.500
of the courtier's papers that's
proceeding in Manchester.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:21.000
They're not talking
to us, we're hoping

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.850
to align transcription,
launch that.

01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:25.810
And there are various
tensions raised

01:51:25.810 --> 01:51:27.110
and [inaudible] we
hope we'll be able

01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:29.060
to build links possibly
even fellowships of the kind

01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:30.830
that we've had elsewhere
to bring people

01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:32.970
in to work with the papers.

01:51:32.970 --> 01:51:36.450
I think the competitive
monarchs things is a point very

01:51:36.450 --> 01:51:37.750
well taken.

01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:40.480
We're in touch with a scholar
in Leiden, Jeroen Duindam,

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:42.200
who wrote a-- I think it's
a book called Dynasty.

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.310
You may know it, which
is global history

01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:46.640
of monarchy in any
modern period.

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:48.830
He's just got some
money to do a project

01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:50.470
on Northern European monarchies.

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:53.250
And I'm talking to him about
what we might be able to do

01:51:53.250 --> 01:51:56.240
at some point for the workshops
to bring those together.

01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:58.490
And I think that that's
precisely the kind of thing

01:51:58.490 --> 01:51:59.900
that we want to see happen.

01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:02.660
And one of the nice thing about
the project, in some ways,

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:04.090
it's a very unusual project.

01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:05.870
And we don't have a
research question.

01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:08.150
And usually now, when
you set out in Britain,

01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:09.800
like if you got a
particular question, you say,

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:12.450
this is where I'm going to find
the answer and you hope you do

01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:14.180
and that's why you give
them the money to do it.

01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:16.840
Here, probably because we aren't
funded in a big research project

01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:19.550
without a single question,

01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:22.280
we can follow what the
archives suggest to us.

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.980
And the key to that is making
sure enough people know

01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:26.720
about what we're doing
and that's what links

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.510
with them the Library
of Congress and others.

01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:31.820
It's so important that we can
then make those connections

01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.600
for as wide an audience
as you possibly can.

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.600
And it's the fun of it too.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.220
&gt;&gt; Jim Ambuske: I think there's
evidence that it's beginning

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:38.520
to inspire the project.

01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:40.390
So we were just in
Scotland three weeks ago

01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:43.140
at our Scottish Records
Conference and met

01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:44.440
with the archivist at the Duke--

01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:46.790
of Duke of Argyll at
the Inveraray Castle.

01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:48.860
And they are beginning
to make public

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:51.800
and more accessible not
necessarily to digital means

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.630
but more accessible, the
papers of the Dukes of Argyll

01:52:54.630 --> 01:52:57.240
who are the most powerful
family in 18th century Scotland.

01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:00.030
And so you're getting
to see, you know,

01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:02.060
I think some momentum
built up to open

01:53:02.060 --> 01:53:06.160
up these once very closed
bases to new research.

01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:07.860
&gt;&gt; Karin Wulf: I'll just add
one quick thing there which is

01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.170
that through these back
and forth fellowships

01:53:10.170 --> 01:53:13.580
of having fellows in one archive
and then in the other at Windsor

01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.660
and at the Library of Congress
and hopefully in other back

01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:19.330
and forth spaces, you commit the
fellows really to helping talk

01:53:19.330 --> 01:53:21.790
to all of us about what's
mutually in those things.

01:53:21.790 --> 01:53:24.180
We can read an academic
monograph and see, oh,

01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:26.940
you've used archival materials
in this place and this place.

01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:29.400
They must connect
in some logical way.

01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:33.560
But because the fellows are, you
know, fellows of the project,

01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.810
they actually provide
support back to the project

01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:38.200
on exactly these
questions of linkages.

01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:39.500
&gt;&gt; Arthur Burns: One of
the interesting things

01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.510
about our period, I
think, is attentive

01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:43.660
of what situation the
US is but in the UK,

01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:46.560
the 18th century is the most
digital of all centuries.

01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:49.390
More pioneering work is being
done in digital amenities.

01:53:49.390 --> 01:53:52.660
We have the Old Bailey online
where every criminal case

01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:54.530
at that Old Bailey
is readable online.

01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:57.370
We have records of all
the London workhouses.

01:53:57.370 --> 01:54:00.580
We have records of every
murder that happened

01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:02.890
in London plotted onto maps.

01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:05.650
And so all these things
might include your database

01:54:05.650 --> 01:54:08.310
for every [inaudible]
you bring those together

01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:09.870
and we're beginning
to create a kind

01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:12.960
of unique digital environment
as well, which we can just--

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.510
there's a thing called connected
histories now where you can type

01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:18.430
in John-- well, don't
type in John Smith.

01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:21.950
But if you found a slightly
more unusual name, type it in,

01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:25.250
and it will tell you which of
those databases have references

01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:26.550
to that name.

01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:28.380
And the possibility of
linking them all up in

01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.860
that way is a very exciting

01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.490
and slightly daunting
prospect as well.

01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:35.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Colleen J. Shogan: We
have time for one more question.

01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:39.440
OK. Well, that brings
us to the end

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:42.160
of the formal part
of our proceedings.

01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.910
Once again, I would like to
thank Mrs. Beverly Hamilton

01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:46.970
for her generous sponsorship.

01:54:46.970 --> 01:54:48.430
Great public programming

01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:51.230
like today's event
is made possible only

01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:54.080
through the support
of people like you.

01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:56.660
If you'd like to help
the library offer more

01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.090
of these types of programs,

01:54:58.090 --> 01:55:04.660
please consider making a
gift at loc.gov/donate.

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:07.070
Please join us now for our
reception and a viewing

01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:09.930
of a selection of
British Political cartoons

01:55:09.930 --> 01:55:13.100
from the Library of Congress
Collection which were purchased

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:16.010
from Windsor Castle
in the 1920s.

01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:20.400
In great British tradition, we
have tea and scones available.

01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:23.510
However, our conscientious
library staff tell me

01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:27.080
that you cannot take your
tea and scones into the room

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:28.790
where we have the materials.

01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:31.150
So please enjoy your
refreshments

01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:35.590
and also enjoy the terrific
treasures on display.

01:55:35.590 --> 01:55:37.050
We hope you have a
great afternoon here

01:55:37.050 --> 01:55:38.350
at the Library of Congress.

01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:40.010
Thank you.

01:55:40.010 --> 01:55:42.370
[ Applause ]

01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:47.090
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:49.460
