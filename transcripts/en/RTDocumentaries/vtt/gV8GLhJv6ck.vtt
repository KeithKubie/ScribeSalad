00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.020
In the Philippine city of Angeles, until 1991 it used to be a US air force base

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.840
these days, though, many men who are mostly retired

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.380
flocked to the city of fallen angeles to make peace and love.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.000
As a result, a whole generation of orphan children has growing up in the Philippines

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.060
as through it was a post war country.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.600
Huge numbers of children are fathered by foreign sex tourists

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.840
they have never, and in all probability, never will meet their dads.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.200
Sarah charged us $100 for the night.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.860
She's 20, and this is the day that her daughter turns 2 month old

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.360
she continues to work in the bar, so she can afford to feed her baby

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.720
whose biological father has returned to Australia.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.620
Sarah, is it the first time that the TV crew films you

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.620
or like takes you for a night?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.020
The first time we meet Sarah wasn't in a hotel or a bar

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.460
but at her home, with visited to film her aunt Nellie.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.160
Nellie has a daughter too, from a Scottish client.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.060
Nellie had to quit sex trade because the bars don't want to hire her anymore.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.920
Youth is the only commodity that is in demand here.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.900
Is this George, father of Michelle?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.900
Wow, she's so small! Sarah!

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.440
From my first day in Angeles city

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.220
it felt that with the arrive in the modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:56.120
a city where vice is the norm. And that as seems, is the unavoidable future for the children here.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.520
Everywhere we went, we met kids who are clearly been fathered by tourists from all over the world.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.640
We wanted to record as many video letters as we could

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.240
messages to all those fathers sitting in their nice homes and comfortable cars,

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.200
and thinking about where to invest next.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.600
Jan Lester’s story is so surreal that it’s hard to believe.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.700
His German biological father left him before he was born

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:40.700
and when he was just 2 month old the boy was abandoned by his prostitute mother.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.700
She left the tiny baby to her transgender neighbour and disappeared.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.700
For Jan Lester, Pia instantly became both mother and father.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.700
This is my son Jean-Jean.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.720
Mary-Ann is the Jean-Lester's best friend in neighbor

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.960
we soon learnt that she two were fathered by a German sex tourist.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.900
In our school it is frequent.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.900
Their fathers are foreigners,

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.900
because their mothers are working in the fields,

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:10.900
and some of them they don't even know their fathers.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.520
Ok, very good.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800
Her classmates they are teasing her

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.000
because she smells bad 
sometimes she forgets to wash.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I asked her why she smelled like that

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.500
and she said the place where they get water
is very far and their home,

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500
there is no source of water in their house.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:56.500
For every week she is absent,

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500
like for example in this month

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.500
this is the first that she go back to school.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.500
- Mary Ann!

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.980
When am working in the bar, I didn't really speak English.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.920
when the guy asks me something like

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.720
'What is your name?'

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.500
I just say 'yes'.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.900
I only know say 'Yes' and 'No'.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.860
When I am getting 16, 
so I decided to starting working at a bar,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.580
so when I make money, so I can help my family.

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:53.520
But when I got pregnant to Mary-Ann. When I knew I was pregnant, so I stopped supporting them.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.500
Jenifer gave birth to Mary Ann after sleeping with a German customer.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.760
A year later, she met a local filipino guy, Aronold.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:22.500
They aren't married, 
but have now lived together for 9 years.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.500
I have a boyfriend, his name is Shawn.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:13.500
Oh I can't remember, it was a long time ago.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:20.200
You can take the girl out of a bar, 
but you can't take the bar out of a girl.

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.760
You know what I mean?

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.880
Could you explain it?

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.440
Well, you can take a girl out of the bar if you got money

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.400
but you can't take the bar out of a girl.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.800
Because they never change. They want the money.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.500
You understand?

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.800
You can't trust Filipino woman, you know?

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800
 

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:21.780
I saw Charlie playing in the street with some other kids.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.620
He wasn't very talkative, 
but his appearance gave him away.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.720
Charlie's father's name is Patrick, 
an Austrian with Irish roots.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:43.220
His filipino mother didn't just sell drinks at the local bar.

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:46.740
I looked for Jane in the bar

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:54.540
and then we talk and then go back 
and come back and ta-da-da-da.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.800
And then we get married here in the Philippines.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.200
I just love her you know, just lover her smile

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.300
and she's very funny.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:11.700
Then she has very good face, you know.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:19.660
But for me… I'm happy to be loved again.

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:24.200
Because I didn't love for maybe 2 years

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.920
or maybe 3 years.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:31.600
You know, because my wife when she left me,

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.900
I just wanted to f**king kill her.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.040
But I shouldn't say that

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.500
but that was my feeling, that's my feeling.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.300
-Hey, Charly!

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:44.800
-Yes, dad.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:51.600
-Can you bring this girl a sweet?

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.060
Bring.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
-Thank you very much. Thank you a lot.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:05.600
2 years ago, Patrick had a stoke 
and his young wife suffered the same fate.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:10.380
Jane is just 34 and for the moment,
she can neither speak nor walk.

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:16.100
Despite everything though, she can still be seen 
as one of the lucky ones.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:22.720
Her husband kept his promise to be true to her in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:33.880
One of the legs is ok, but the other one is not. Really.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.060
It's not good at the moment,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.640
but she will get better.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.420
This is the plan, we got married 14 years ago.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.360
At then, I was very fat.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.220
I was 120 kilos.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.140
I was f*****g big, really big.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.100
My f*****g face was it was f*****g like that.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.100
And here it was like that.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.100
- Patrick, how old Jen was then?

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:13.740
-She was 18 years old.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:21.060
Many girls they have to go 
to the bar, because they have to eat.

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.060
What's going on?

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.060
You wanna eat?

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:27.500
Ah?

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.500
What should we do today?

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.180
Apart from Charlie,  Patrick and Jane 
have 2 more children,

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.540
they're both grown-up.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.720
Jane had one of them she she was just 16 and working as a prostitute.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.380
It would be stretched to say that their lives resemble a hollywood story,

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:58.760
but all local bar girls dream of a happy ending just like in the movie "Pretty Woman".

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:06.260
The nurse will come tomorrow, Jane.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.820
The nurse will come here tomorrow.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.820
Five o'clock.
