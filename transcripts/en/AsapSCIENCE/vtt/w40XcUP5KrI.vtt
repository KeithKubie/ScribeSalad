00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
You may recognize the song being played as All Star, by Smash Mouth

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.300
and, if you do, something amazing is about to happen

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.180
Even though only piano notes are being played,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.720
if you know the song, you'll start to hear the lead singer's voice

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.400
and the words being sung.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.720
I swear, what you're hearing is 100% digital piano

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.580
simply matched to the frequency of the original song

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.200
and not mixed with real vocals.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240
and yet, you can hear the words.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.860
This speaking piano shows a similar fenomenum.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.880
It's hard to make out what it's saying, but

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.340
as soon as words are on screen, you begin to hear it talking.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.960
Hearing is all about perception,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.640
after a soundwave hits your ear, it's transformed into signals for your brain.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.940
But your brain gets so many external signals that it can't process it all at once

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.880
and so it uses context to craft what you're hearing.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.880
You hear the lyrics because the brain uses information it already has

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.960
to understand the world around you.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.120
Which is why if you've never heard the song, it will sound like nonsense.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.700
But, even without words, we sometimes hear things that aren't there.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.700
Take this jumping transmission tower, for example.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.820
Around 20% of people will actually hear a thud each time it lands

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.540
in a fenomenun known as visually evoked auditory response

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.540
Do you hear it?

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.380
It's a type of synesthesia

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.960
which is when the senses like hearing and sight get crossed in the brain.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.760
Expectation is also playing a role here

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.380
A 2006 study scanned the brains of participants

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.880
who were told they'd eventually hear a sound

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.620
as they were listening to the silence and expecting to hear something,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.340
the auditory cortex was activated in the same way

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.800
as when you were actually listening to sound.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.900
So, do you hear it now?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.900
Our brains are pretty good at filling in the gaps,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.140
like in this audioclip.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.635
 

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:09.825
 

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.255
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.200
But, now, listen to it with the cough removed.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.835
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.775
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.460
There's literally a full syllable missing

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.500
but, with the cough, people tend to hear the entire word.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.675
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.780
 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.840
This illusion is known as "temporal induction".

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.940
Your brain fills in information to make sense of the world.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.760
Now, listen to this rhythm.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.920
Sounds like it's getting faster, doesn't it?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.160
The thing is, it will seemingly get faster forever if I let it continue to play.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.380
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.120
This is known as the "risset rhythm"

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.800
in which a beat starts relatively slow and starts to speed up

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.820
but, as it gets faster, beat 2 starts at exactly half the speed

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940
and they increase in speed together.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.220
Eventually, the faster one fades out as the slower one fades in,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.820
and the loop continues.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.140
But, your brain can't pick up the suddlety

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.660
and, as a result, it sounds like it's speeding up forever.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.860
Love learning about amazing and interesting things in the world?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.200
We actually just started a brand new podcast called "Sidenote"

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.400
where we explore the things that are stumping us

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.840
or making us curious in life

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.040
and then insert all the mindblowing science behind it.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.020
We'd love for you to check it out at iTunes or whichever podcast app you use.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.500
Your support means a ton to us as we slowly journey into exploring more science in a new media.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.300
Again, it's called "sidenote" and it's brand new so we're excited to know what you think.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.520
We'll leave some links below

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.360
and subscribe for more weekly science videos every thursday.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.860
