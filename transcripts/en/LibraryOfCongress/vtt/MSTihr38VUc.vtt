00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.690
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.460
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: Thank you
very much for coming tonight.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.760
And forgive my voice.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.820 position:56%
I think the changing weather you all
are having is as bad as New England.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.600
And so, I'm catching
up with the blossoms

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.470
and the pollen and everything else.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.760
But anyway, I'm very excited to be
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.340
And first of all, I want to say a
personal note about the connection

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.110
between New Hampshire and
the Library of Congress.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.410
I was an arts reporter

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.510
for the Boston Globe covering
New Hampshire for 14 years.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.770
And the result of that was my
first book, which is called the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.330
"Hidden History of New
Hampshire," which is 60 stories

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.020
about New Hampshire's
most important legacies.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.330
And one of those legacies is

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.080
that New Hampshire granite
built the Library of Congress.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.940
Is this good time?

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.470
Is this close enough?

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.950
Is that where you would like me?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.190
Is that good?

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.140
Okay. So anyway, thank
you for coming tonight.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.870 position:56%
First of all, I want to thank very
much the Metropolitan Museum of Art,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.170
the musical instruments department

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.480
for giving me two research
fellowships, which allowed me

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.600
to finish my research, and
also the Hosking Houses Trust,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.390
which is in Clifford
Chambers England,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.150
and she gave me a five-week
residency just at the point

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.200
where I was trying to finish the
book, which was rather incredible.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.580
I also want to thank Carol Lynn
Ward-Bamford and the Library

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.050
of Congress for inviting me.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.540
This is a very special
opportunity for me and especially

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.610
at the beginning of women's
history month because we get

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.290
to celebrate an American
female luthier,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.630
which is rare to begin with.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.470
And Carleen Hutchins
is quite a pioneer.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.610
So I'm going to start
with the keyboard here.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:01.210
I'm trying not to lose
my cards here.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.500
The Giant by N. C. Wyeth
is my favorite painting.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.190
It always has been.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.720
I love it because it implies
the limitless possibilities

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.690
of a child's imagination.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.640
It reminds us that there
is so much more to life,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.720
to reality than meets the
eye, and it urges us to use

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.180
and not lose our imagination.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.490
The axiom the sky is the limit sums

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.270
up the nature of a
successful pioneer.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.670
In her book "Pythagoras' Trousers,"

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.540
physicist Margaret Wertheim
chronicles the unique numerous

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.870
and wonderful contributions

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.430
of female astronomers
across three centuries.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.050
The question is why astronomy.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.390
Why were females able
to self-actualize

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.990
and pursue their passion
in studying the skies?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.390
The answer is quite simple.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.460
Their classroom was the sky.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.460
No one could stop a curious
female from looking up at the sky.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.280
In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered
that the universe was expanding.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.360
But his discovery hinged
on a discovery

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.650
by a female astronomer
almost two decades earlier.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.240 position:56%
Henrietta Leavitt in 1908 discovered
the idea that the longer period

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.330
of luminosity for a star means
that is it directly related

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.400
to the luminosity of the star.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.530
Leavitt was one of a litany
of unsung female astronomers

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.390
at Harvard chronicled
recently by Dava Sobel

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.490
in her book "The Glass Universe."

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.940
These unschooled, self-taught
women made great contributions

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.830
to their field, just
like Carleen Hutchins.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.720
I got a little turned around here.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.510
And the sky was literally
the limit for George Lucas

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.510
when he had a passion
and a crazy idea

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.610
about creating a space opera
based on his passion as a child

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.820
for Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.530
After struggling with a
script for five years,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.230
Lucas never gave up on his dream.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.620
When he and partner Gary Kurtz
pitched a 12-page treatment

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.460
to Hollywood, United Artists and
Universal both turned it down.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.520
Twentieth Century Fox
gave it a shot,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.430
and the result was a $7.5
million budget film that ended

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.700
up garnering 513 million and sort

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.340
of capturing the imagination
of generations.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.890
Lucas's dream will
culminate with the opening

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.930
of his space age designed museum
called the George Lucas Museum

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.500
of Narrative Art to open on the
lakeshore of Chicago in 2019,

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.320
which is all a testament
to the power of believing.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.910
And this year, recently a week
ago, at the Academy Awards,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.990
the remarkable story of more
hidden figures, females,

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.000
African-American female
mathematicians who were known

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.620
as computers back then who produced
the hidden mathematical figures

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.290
that would put John
Glenn into space.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.030
Of course, these women were
also hidden figures themselves

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.370
in the history of NASA.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.200
They calculated the mathematical
variables of the NASA wind tunnel,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.050
which by the way, followed the
example of the Wright brothers.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.710
And the Wright brothers also
did not have a formal education

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.020
and taught themselves physics
and aeronautics through trial

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.110
and error, very much like Hutchins.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.950
There was an innate belief that
they could do the impossible.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.610
Unlike the 18th and 19th
century female philosophers,

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.660
unlike the ladies of
the Harvard Observatory

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.860
and unlike the hidden
figures of NASA,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.160
Carleen Maley Hutchins was alone.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.620
She was a singular pioneer who
contributed more to her field

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.170
than any luthier since Andrea Amati
designed the earliest known violin

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.470
in 1560.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.390
And Stradivari perfected
it around 1720.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.710
The stakes in the violin world
may seem inconsequential compared

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.840
to the space program.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.280
Still, Hutchins is
another intriguing example

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.630
of a most unlikely pioneer who
pursued her passion relentlessly.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.310
Hutchins also has a link to NASA.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.740 position:56%
On March 2, 1999, 18 years almost to
the day ago, I accompanied Hutchins

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.070
to NASA Langley Research
Center in Hampton, Virginia.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.560
She gave her last public lecture
called Acoustics and the Violin:

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.860
Past, Present and Future.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.580
And she gave it to 150
acoustical physicists at NASA.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.880
She was the keynote speaker

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.040
for a colloquium they
called What Is Music.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.240
I bring up all this sky talk
because Hutchins is a story.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.910
The Hutchins story
is about the pursuit

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.420
of dreams and never giving up.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.710
It is also a story about the fact
that things are not as they seem.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.840
"American Luthier,"
my book over there,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.080 position:56%
which I just completed this past
spring and was published by ForeEdge

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.600
of the University Press
of New England.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.780
"American Luthier" intertwines
the story of this unlikely pioneer

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.420
with the story the violent itself.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.000
The story reminds us that
music is both art and science.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.080
Without the science of the human
auditory system interacting

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.510
with vibrating soundwaves,
there would be no music.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.090
Music hinges on the
science of acoustics,

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.510
the same science that
put man into space.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.030
The cover of "American Luthier" is
a painting by Walter Tandy Murch.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.200
It first appeared in
November of 1962 as the cover

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.350
of Scientific American,
in conjunction

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.170
with her breakout article that
put her on the map in her field.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.090
It depicts a scientific experiment
that was set up by Hutchins

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.660
in her acoustical laboratory in the
basement of her home at 112 Essex

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.960
in Montclair, New Jersey.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.320
The word "luthier" is a
French word for violin maker,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.800
originally meaning lute maker
because the lute maker made a range

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.210
of stringed instruments, which
included both those plucked

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.630
like the lute and those
bowed like the violin.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.940
Carleen Hutchins, pregnant
with her first child,

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.170
carved her first viola just
to see if she could do it.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.370
She chased her passion for
fiddles for the rest of her life.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:58.280 position:56%
As an only child, Carleen possessed
a self-reliance, born of the sparks,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.840
flying between a nurturing
mother and a difficult father,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.650
fanned by an early passion
for the Girl Scouts.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.580
The Girl Scouts gave Carleen an
escape, an oasis, a direction

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.390
and instilled in her the innate
belief that she could do anything.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.300
As a Girl Scout, Carleen
developed the courage

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.010
to do what she did
not know how to do.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.550
The Carleen Hutchins story
is a story of many hats.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.440
By the time she graduated
from Montclair High School,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.400
she was an accomplished naturalist,
trumpeter and master woodcarver.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.990
At Cornell, she became
a birder and a biologist

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.670
and eventually became
a science teacher.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.250
When her friends invited
her to play chamber music,

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.930
Hutchins gladly traded her
trumpet for a viola because she was

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:46.730
so enamored of the
camaraderie of chamber music.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:53.120
In the two years it took her
to complete her first viola,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.000
she donned the luthier hat.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.960
The same year, she met physicist,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.120
chamber music player
Frederick Saunders.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.600
She apprenticed at the
same time in violin making

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.510
to Karl Berger, a master
German luthier.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.750
And then she began
experiments in the same year

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.620
in violent acoustics with Saunders.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.210
Essentially, she taught
herself acoustical physics

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.720
by carving fiddles in her kitchen.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:22.640
Carleen eventually became an
inventor, an author, a catalyst,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.070
an editor and an international
lecturer.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.640 position:56%
Hutchins and Saunders performed more

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.410
than a hundred different
experiments over a decade.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.970
And why did they begin with
the viola and not the violin?

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.850
Well, unlike the celebrated violin,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.950
the viola is the unsung
stepsister of the quartet.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.820
In three centuries, no
one has ever figured

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.360
out a standard size for the viola.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.720
Too large to play comfortably and
too small for its tonal range.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.760
The viola is forever stuck
between the ergonomics of playing

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.810
and the acoustics of tone.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.680
For these reasons, violists tend

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.160
to suffer the most injuries
among string players.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.470
But the great silver lining
here is that, also an irony,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.620
is that the viola is the
tonal center of the quartet.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.960
The chamber music world and every
quartet generally always is looking

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.180
for a viola, which is a
great thing for a violist.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.980
Saunders was a physicist and a
good amateur violinist and violist.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.990
Before he met Hutchins, he
experimented by playing instruments

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.120
in his own sound chamber
that he developed and also

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.730
by placing small weights on
the bridge of an instrument.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.700
They were delicates because
he loved the instruments

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.210
and didn't want to ruin them.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:39.300
On the day that they met, Saunders
gave Hutchins reprints of some

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.320 position:56%
of his articles on violin acoustics.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.460
Now Hutchins was a biologist,
and she wasn't real familiar

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.220
with the physicist jargon.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.520
But she had a lot of common sense.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.700
And she looked at these
articles and she thought, well,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.170
for some reason he's not doing
very invasive experiments.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.960
So she asked Hutchins, Hutchins
asked Saunders what would you do

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.530
if you had instruments
that could be destroyed.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.270
And Saunders thought
this was a crazy idea

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.380
and said what violin maker would
be crazy enough to make instruments

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.990
that are going to be destroyed.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.290
And Hutchins said, I will.

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.160
When Vermont composer
Henry Brant learned

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.800
of the New Jersey housewife
violin maker who was making news

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.450
in the New York Times, he decided
to stop by Montclair and meet her.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.860
And when he did, on that first
day, he posed the question

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.200
about families of instruments.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.010
We have families of recorders
and families of viols,

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.280
and we have families of saxophones.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.800
Why not a complete
family of violins?

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.270
Hutchins agreed to try
this in five minutes,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.890
but it took her the better part of
a decade, aided by the calculations

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.230
of Bell telephone engineer
John Schelling.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:50.890 position:56%
In 1965, Hutchins designed her first
violin octet, eight instruments

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.700
across the tonal range of a piano
ranging from an 11-inch treble

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.270
to a 7-foot contrabass violin.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:01.160 position:56%
She proceeded then to make about 100
octet instruments, which amounted

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.940
to about six more violin octets

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.410
and about 400 conventional
stringed instruments.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:09.040
She also found an international
community devoted

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.850
to violin acoustics called
the Catgut Acoustical Society

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.480
and published a biannual
journal in the field

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.970
of violin acoustics
for more than 30 years.

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.850
But more important, Carleen
reversed the paradigm,

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.910
almost every paradigm she came
across in the violin world,

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:30.650
beginning with the fact that there
had been centuries of secrecy

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.330
and competition between luthiers.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.570
She asked why not share
information instead of guard it.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.270
She built a bridge where there
had been a wall between luthiers,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.500
and she built a bridge between
the art and science of the violin

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.420
by sharing information about
acoustics, about her experiments,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.310
and about violin making,
rather than hoarding it.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.230
Realistically, Carleen Hutchins
had absolutely no business

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.530
in the string world.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.830
She did not belong.

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.270
She was a total outsider as
a female and a biologist.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:02.240
But like female astronomers,
the female astronomers,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.040
and like the Wright brothers
and those human computers

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.280
who followed them, Hutchins
displayed a curiosity, creativity,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.120
courage and resilience

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.200
that characterized most
successful pioneers.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.320
They have the courage to go
it alone and to be the first,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.530
if no one's done it before them.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.870
For the untrained mind,
there are no dumb questions

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.590
and there is no sacred ground.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.910
The complete disregard for
authority enables the outsider

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.810
to question everything about the
trappings of traditional thinking.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.190
Part of Carleen's investigations
revolved around the study

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.130
of old instruments made
by European masters.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:41.070
In the spring of 1962, Hutchins
visited the Library of Congress

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.980
to view the Cassavetti
viola, which is in this room,

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.350
in the glass case over there.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.580
At this time, the Budapest quartet
was the quartet in residence

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.260
at the Library of Congress.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.640
One morning, Carleen went to
the Budapest quartet rehearsal

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.570
in the Library of Congress
auditorium.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.330 position:56%
She was listening to the Strad cello

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.800
that was being played
by Mischa Schneider.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.120
Afterward, they got to
talking to Hutchins.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.580
And Hutchins dared to
say to Mischa Schneider

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.520
that she thought she had a cello
that might be as good if not better

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.810
than his Strad in her car.

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.830
And Schneider suggested that
perhaps she should bring it

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.010
by his home so he could try it.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.050
Carleen recalled, much
to my delight,

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.050
he found that it was very
similar to his own cello,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:28.680
and he liked it very much.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.580 position:56%
As it happened, the Budapest
quartet was presenting a concert the

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.130
following week at Montclair
High School.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.520
And Schneider, delighted to not
have to bring his cello case along,

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.460
said he would be happy to bring his
bow only if Carleen would meet him

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.630
at the auditorium door
with her cello.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.160
Carleen recalled her excitement.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.170
You can imagine how thrilled
I was to sit in the audience

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:52.950
and listen to the cello sing.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.820
Afterward, I went to
retrieve my cello

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.360 position:56%
and I asked Schneider how did it go.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.230
He said one word, magnifico.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.310
This was, indeed, the thrill
of a lifetime for Carleen.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.360
The violin octet, this is
a photograph that was taken

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.540
in her living room in
Montclair, New Jersey.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.740
The violin octet, the Hutchins
violin octet is a family

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.150
of eight tonally matched
violins, graduated in size

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.990
from the smallest to
largest violins.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:22.120
They are the treble, soprano,
mezzo, alto, tenor, baritone,

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.120
base and contrabass violins.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:28.970 position:56%
The mezzo is the closest to the size
in size the conventional violin.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:32.890
The treble, soprano and
mezzo are played da braccio,

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.580
via outstretched arm.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.130
The tenor and baritone are played
delle gambe, between the legs.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.110
The bass and contra are played
standing in the standing position.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.560
That leaves the enigma in
the middle of the octet.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.740
The alto violin or the vertical
viola played like a cello.

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:53.810
What happens when someone
introduces something new

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.680
in the classical music world?

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.940
There's lots of opposition.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:01.640
The violin octet made waves
Carleen never imagined.

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.870
The new violent family was
controversial from the start.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.570
Understandably, most classical
musicians marry their instrument

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.210
and are reluctant to
retool on a new one.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:16.010
The Wright brothers worked in
total obscurity for several years

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.900
in the vacuum of the interest
from their own government.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.020
They sold their first
flyer to France.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.470
Similarly, after fighting an uphill
battle for more than a decade,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.050
a fight trying to find
interest in America,

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.960
Carleen first found interest
in her violin octet in Europe.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:38.090 position:56%
Her violin octets, first in England,
Scotland, Wales, then in Sweden

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.380
and then in Russia, each have
their own story about what makes

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.780
or breaks a new instrument in
the classical music marketplace.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.420
And here, the Russians in
1995 were the very first

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:52.370
to produce a professional recording
of the Hutchins' violin octet.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.840
In 1995, Yo-Yo Ma won a
Grammy for his performance

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.120
of the difficult Bartok
viola concerto performed

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.010
on Hutchins' vertical viola.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.620
In a recent interview, Ma said
this, "What's interesting is

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.920
that in the last 40 years,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.670
the quality of new instruments
has increased exponentially,

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.400
with the idea that there are
no secrets between makers.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.140
It's the collapse of secrets.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.380
And that's part of
Carleen's legacy."

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:21.450
In 1983, California
bassist, and he is far left,

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.270
Joe McNally first played the
Hutchins' contrabass in a concert

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.320
at the University of
California San Diego.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.580
From that moment on, he dreamed
that he would one day own one.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.890
And in 2000, he made
that dream come true.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.130
And McNally founded
the Hutchins' consort,

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.280
which is the only professional
ensemble in the world that perform

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.640
on a Hutchins' violin octet.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.210
They actually own two.

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.850
The new violin family
rocked the boat

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.020
of people's expectations
about chamber music.

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.840
In 2009, as an example,
following the death of Hutchins,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:55.750
a you New York Times obituary
writer, who was writing about her,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.740
happened to be a former cellist.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.130
She pulled her cello out and
hadn't played it in ten years.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.300 position:56%
And she went and started practicing.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.810
And then when she was
ready, she took her bow

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.110
to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and found it

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.320
on Hutchins' instrument just
because she wanted to play it.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.620
She wanted to try it out.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.490
And she ended up complaining
to me that Hutchins --

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.460
She was upset with Hutchins for
fooling around with the quartet.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.390
The quartet was already perfect.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.300
Is the quartet tonally perfect?

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.080
The idea that the traditional
quartet has tonal gaps is actually

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.500
an old idea.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.800
In a letter dated 1690, the
Marquis Ariberti of Cremona,

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.670
Italy ordered two altos
from Stradivari.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.890
One was to play the contralto, and
the other was to play the tenor.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.490
So there you have the
problem right there.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.750
Other luthiers tried to address
the problem of tonal gaps

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:48.950
in the quartet before Hutchins.

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.660
In the early 1900s, two
French makers by the name

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.960
of Leo Sir Senior [phonetic]

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.400
and Leo Sir Junior [phonetic]
created a true family of violins

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.120 position:56%
by creating six stringed instruments

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.140
that were complementing
the quartet instruments.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.710
So there were ten of them.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.430
Their ten-instrument concert,
which was called [inaudible],

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:11.800
won awards in Liege in 1905 and a
grand prize at Bordeaux in 1907.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.330
Tragically, fire destroyed
this consort of instruments,

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.940
and then the work ended
for both of them

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.580
because the young Sir
died in the war.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:25.610
In 1935 Frederick Dautrich
of Torrington, Connecticut,

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.610
also invented four more instruments
to complement the quartet.

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.170
Dautrich had limited success,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.710
but his instruments gave Hutchins
a head start in figuring the sizes

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.600
and tunings for her violin octet.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.130
In 1965, when Hutchins
debuted her violin octet

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.210
at the 92nd Street YM-YWHA,

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.720
conductor Leopold Stokowski
was in the audience.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.230
He found her the next day raving
about this tone of her alto violin.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:54.340
And he said that was the tone
he'd always wanted in a viola.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.330
For a year, Stokowski tried
to convince his violists

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.600
to play a vertical instrument.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:01.900
It failed.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.040
And when it failed, the
maestro asked Hutchins

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.970 position:56%
to make an ergonomically
successful viola with the same tone.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.290
And this is the result.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.690 position:56%
She ended up calling it the monster.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.460 position:56%
And it was so unbalanced, she just
tried everything she could to figure

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.380
out a way to make it
easier, but that's what --

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.540
It resides today in the collection
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.270
So it's now an artifact
because it couldn't be played.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.960
Carleen Hutchins defied
the odds on every front,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.250
and she did it modestly
and frugally.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.370 position:56%
In 1954, when the Acoustical Society

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.220
of America awarded Frederick
Saunders the Honorary Fellowship,

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.770
which is the highest honor for
the ASA, he said to Carleen,

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.750
who was then his young
apprentice, that she need not come

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:52.370 position:56%
to see him receive the award because
she "may not understand it all."

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.850
Thirty-four years later, in 1998,

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.570
Carleen Hutchins won the
same award as her mentor.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:09.060
In the finale of my book, I like in
violin world to the violin itself.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.530
In choosing one of the 80
parts that make up a violin,

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.850
I like in Carleen Hutchins to
the sound post of the violin.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.440
She was a hidden figure, just

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.320
like the sound post is
hidden inside the violin,

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.820
an invisible component hidden
from view that plays a vital role

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.360
in perfecting the sound
of the violin.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.980
Carleen's life touched every
corner of the violin world,

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.860
and yet she was little
known outside her field.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:39.930
Will her life go unnoticed, as do
so many those of hidden figures,

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:44.330 position:56%
or will it pave the way for the
discovery of new highways and byways

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.330
in the art and science
of the violin?

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.390
Either way, the Carleen Hutchins
story reminds us to reach

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:51.560
for the skies and follow
our passions.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.110
You never know where that
journey will lead us.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.910
Thank you.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:01.490
[ Applause ]

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:04.210
And now I'm very excited to
introduce Shannon Merlino,

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:08.180
who is a viola doctoral
student at Temple University.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:10.170
And she's going to
play a Bach Prelude

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:16.030
on a Hutchins' traditional
viola, which is SUS number 53.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:19.030
And this is the last story
I'll tell you, which is why all

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:23.100
of Hutchins' instruments have
SUS before them in the numbering

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:24.570
of them in the label inside.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:31.230 position:56%
It's going to say SUS 1, SUS 23, SUS
450 because of a story that happened

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.220
in 1945, before she
ever made an instrument.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.230
She was teaching science
at the Brearley School.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.690
She was teaching grade
school science,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.510
and she was a naturalist
by her passion.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.930
So she had all these animals in
her classroom for the children.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.100
She had guinea pigs, rabbits
and, you know, little chicks.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:53.630
So on the first day of school in
1945, she is the science teacher

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.140
and a new music teacher arrives.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:59.380
And that's Helen Rice,
chamber music lady and guru.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.190
And she has to start
a string program.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.520
And she's only got
one string player.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.040
She hears that the science
teacher is an amateur violist.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.670
So she also has a very
pregnant sow on her family farm

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:13.340
in western Massachusetts.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.610
And so, she says to Carleen the
day she meets her, I hear that you

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.910
like animals in the classroom.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.230
And Carleen said yes.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.610
And she said well how
would you like a piglet.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:22.820
And Carleen said I'd
love to have piglet.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.500 position:56%
And she said, well, you can have the
piglet if you come and play viola

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.070
with my students on
Friday afternoons.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:31.800
So when Carleen made her first
instrument, she felt it had

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.360
to be SUS number one because
SUS is the Latin word for pig.

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.830
And they had named the
pig Susy the pig anyway.

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:44.080
So SUS 53 is now what Shannon's
going to tell you about.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.340
You want to -- What's good?

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.640
Over here?

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:55.640
&gt;&gt; Shannon Merlino: Hi.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.820
So before I began, I just want to
mention that the vertical viola

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.410 position:56%
that we have today has been recently
donated by the Carpenter family.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.410
And we are just very
grateful to have that.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.950
I'd also like to thank Wamsley
Violins in Haddonfield, New Jersey,

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.930
who has been generous enough
to loan me the Hutchins' viola

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.800
that I'm going to be playing the
Bach today, and also my mother,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.580
who's in the audience, who
made this all possible.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:30.310
Anyway, when I first started
my doctorate in viola,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.300
we had to take an entrance exam
on the very first day of classes.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:39.730
And the question I was asked was
what is the role of the violist.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:43.410
What exactly do we do with our job?

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.040
And it's kind of hard.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.630
I've spoken with some composers

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.530
who often have told me
we can't really hear you

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.670
when you play in an orchestra.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.340
What is the viola's
job in the orchestra?

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:00.110
As Quincy was saying, our
role as a violist is to kind

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.890
of tie the whole thing together.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.690
There's a little bit
of tonal disagreement

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.760
between the violin and the cello.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:10.090
Our job is to bring them
together somehow with our sound.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.810
So in Carleen's instruments,

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:18.000
they follow a very interesting
tonal range, I think.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.850
Very different than
my own instrument.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:26.040
What I've noticed playing Carleen's
viola for a few days is that,

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.550
as Yo-Yo Ma said in a review in
I believe it was a Baltimore Sun

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.450
of his Bartok performance.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.230
He mentioned that the viola
had a very reedy kind of sound,

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.850
almost like an early
music instrument.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.350
I would have to agree.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:43.680
And there are certain things
about Carleen's traditional viola

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.380
that I found very,
very, very interesting.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.520 position:56%
So to start, I wanted to discuss the
measurements of these instruments.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.030
Standard measurement for
a viola, for, you know,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:26:02.360
an average viola is anywhere
between 38 and 46 centimeters long.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.050
That's about 15 to 18 inches.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:09.140
Interestingly enough, the viola
is the only string instrument

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.100
that does not have a
standard full-size.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.400
So I'll show you.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.920
So this is the size of the
standard Hutchins' viola.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.430
This is SUS number 53.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.950
It was made in 1966 in
Montclair, New Jersey.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.690
It's 41.8 centimeters
long body length.

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:51.440
The lower bout from here to
here is 25.7 centimeters,

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.630
middle bout 14 centimeters exact,
upper bout is 20.4 centimeters.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.150
That's around standard.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.950
The viola that I perform on now,
which was made by Clifford Hoing,

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.640
a British viola maker,
contemporary to Carleen Hutchins,

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.170
is 42.5 centimeters for comparison.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.540
So it's just slightly longer.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:19.260
In comparison, the vertical
viola, which is kind of massive,

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:26.690
as you can see, this is 50.75
centimeters long by length.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:30.680
The upper bout in comparison
to Carleen's other viola

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.900
that is 20.4 centimeters,
24 centimeters.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.640
The lower bout is 30 centimeters.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.520
So the difference of 5
centimeters doesn't seem

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.680
like that big of a deal.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.250
But when considering what our
training as instrumentalists,

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.200
that becomes problematic.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.390
So that's the next thing that
I'd like to address is, you know,

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:56.380
what do we do, what
does the viola do?

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:01.550
Up until about 1930, the
viola was, as Quincy said,

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.340
the ugly stepchild
of the violin family.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:09.820
We had some technical issues owing
to the fact that acoustically,

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:14.910
our instrument is just not in a
good position right from the start.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.410
Yeah, sure.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.470
Thank you.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.670
In order for a viola to have
the same acoustical properties

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.280 position:56%
as the violin or cello, it would
need to be, in fact, 20 inches long,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.640
which is what we have here.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.620
And until about 1930, we
performed primarily on gut strings.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.370
And technology was such that
we really hadn't had a way

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:42.310
to address the tonal issues
that the instrument had.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.200
So a lot of the extended
techniques that you'll see possibly

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.920
in the Shostakovich, which
is being performed tonight,

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.410
wouldn't really be possible
on earlier instrument.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:02.720
So as a violist, one of
the things that, you know,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:07.440
became very interesting to me when
I first spoke with Quincy was that,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.750
you know, how do these issues
translate to the vertical viola.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.660
How do we address the
idea of learning how

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.160
to play this entirely
new instrument?

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.700
So because of the innovations in
viola design and viola techniques

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.290
since about 1960, it
is kind of an issue.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:31.100
So we would love to open this up
to some questions and answers now.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.170
So Quincy, like to join me?

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.640
&gt;&gt; Can I have a microphone coming
for the people with questions?

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.150
&gt;&gt; I guess more to Quincy.

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:49.100
Have there been -- I'd
be interested in knowing

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.040
if there have been works
composed specifically

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.730
for the violin octet
if you have examples.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:57.920
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: There's
probably now about at least 500.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.560
There were 300 maybe ten years ago.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.650
With the Hutchins' consort,
two basses were both composing

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.170
and one bass as we lost one bass

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:11.440
because he died very suddenly
this year or this past year.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.740
So Joe McNally, the founder,

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:14.900
is one of the primary
composers for the octet.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.100
But I know the octet is also open

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.110
to any composers who
would be interested.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.070
Yes.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:29.580
&gt;&gt; I was wondering about the
price of her instruments.

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.220
Have they gone up and all
of that kind of thing?

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.920 position:56%
And also, the acoustical experiments
that Saunders wanted to do

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.080
and that she was willing
to make these instruments

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:45.140
that could be destroyed in the
process, a little more about that.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:46.440
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: Let's see.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.360
When she sold her first sold her
first octet, I believe it was

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.710
like 80,000 for the
8-inch instrument.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:56.850
So 10,000 was dirt
cheap in 1970 something

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.070
when the English group wanted
to purchase them for Edinburgh.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.710
They are now at the
University of Edinburgh.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:07.110
In terms of the kind of acoustics
experiments, I could, you know,

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.460
have a whole talk just on those.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.730
But one of the most interesting
ones with the swiss cheese violin,

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.900
where she punched 64 holes
in the ribs of the instrument

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.410
and then plugged those
holes of cotton.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.240
Then, she would remove the cotton.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.570
And she and Saunders were
exploring really the violin

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.960
as a wind instrument.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.260
You think of them.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.950
They start out studying
the wood modes.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.250
They want to see how
the wood's vibrating.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.910
And then they realized that maybe
the air currents inside the box are

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.420
far more important.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:38.070
So that was one interesting
experiment.

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.370
Yes.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:47.260
&gt;&gt; Are you considering
writing a screen play,

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.230
and who would you consider
[inaudible]?

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.710
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: You know,
after seeing Hidden Figures,

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.890
I am convinced that this is a film.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.300
But I've been convinced
for 20 years.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.250
And I'm not sure who should play
her, but I know it's a story.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.570
I know it's film.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:07.750
I haven't gotten to that point,
but I'm certainly willing to do it

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:09.660
if somebody had some interest.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.010
Yes.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.430
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.730
The acoustic.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.030
&gt;&gt; Shannon Merlino: Sure.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.330
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: Go with that.

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:17.630
&gt;&gt; Shannon Merlino: Okay.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:20.240
So one of the issues with
the acoustics is, as I said,

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:26.590
in order for the instrument to
have the same acoustical properties

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:30.330
as the violin, it would need
to be about 20 inches long.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.630
So one of the things --

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.230
And surprisingly, this
viola doesn't have these.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.430 position:56%
One of the things that we experience

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.470
as string players is
called a wolf tone.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.900
Violins don't often have them.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.070
I was the unfortunate
owner of a violin

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.920
with a very bad wolf
tone for many years.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.880
And my viola that I have
has a wolf tone as well.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.610
In the past few years, a
little device has been invented

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:57.780
that gets rid of these wolf tones.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:02.770 position:56%
But really, when you use a wolf tone
eliminator or something like that,

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.510 position:56%
it does damp the sound a little bit.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.390
So --

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.810
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: And I
would just add to that,

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.160
the wolf tone was also
something that Hutchins

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.720
and Saunders were studying a lot,
what makes them happen and why

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.400
and when they're really bad.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.730
And sometimes you can't
do anything about them.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.030
&gt;&gt; Shannon Merlino: Right.

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:24.010
The sound of the instrument is
produced by two different forces.

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.320
The resonating body of
air inside the instrument

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.660
and also the resonance of
the plates in the back.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:35.610
So, you know, it's just my guess.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.170
I don't have anything
to back this up.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:42.010 position:56%
But because of the shape and the
dimensions of Carleen's instruments,

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.560
they do avoid some of
those issues that come up.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.860
So does that answer?

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.070
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: With
respect to playing them,

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:55.130
I know that she had an experience
many times when a player would come

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.430
to one of her instruments

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:58.460
and immediately start
putting a particular pressure

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:01.070
that a cellist might
put on his cello.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:05.720 position:56%
And she had to pull them all off and
just say go much lighter and listen

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.160
to what the instrument can
do because lots of times,

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.620
you come to an instrument
with an expectation

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.410
about how much pressure
you have to add.

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.390
And she was always trying to get
them to lighten up because she did

00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.840
so much work on the resonance
of both the box and the wood

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.290
that it started to sing
with less pressure.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:27.400
And I also wanted to add one
other thing about the fact

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.110
that someone had asked
me if there are people

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.680
who make these instruments still.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.070
Carleen had about -- She taught
about 50 students and she has

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.530
about nine living students today

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.770
who make these instruments
if they were requested.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.980
There is a luthier in Genoa, Italy.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.180
There's one in Belgium, and there's
about six or seven in the states

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.360
that know Carleen's
work and have made them

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.610
and might even have
them in their inventory.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.450
But as I say, you need to --

00:34:53.450 --> 00:35:01.740
I could get that information
to you if you're interested.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.040
Yes.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:04.610
&gt;&gt; My question's going
to be limited by the fact

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.410
that I've already forgotten
the term that you used.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:10.100
But you mentioned the fact that
you and a colleague cracked one

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.560 position:56%
of these open and saw that there
was a part, that there was a new cut

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.680
in it or an unexpected cut in it.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.140 position:56%
And I'm wondering if you can comment

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:23.130
as to why she might have
constructed it in that way

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:26.450
or what acoustical effect
that was supposed to have had.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.400
&gt;&gt; Shannon Merlino: That's
a really good question.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.550
Unfortunately, my knowledge
of physics

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:35.380
as a music student
is somewhat limited.

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.040
But, you know, one of the things

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.250
that musicians spend hours upon
hours upon hours doing is getting

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:44.510
adjustments made to our sound post.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.390
As the force that carries
the vibrations from the front

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.660
of the instrument to the
back of the instrument,

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:54.070
even a half of a millimeter
adjustment can dramatically change

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.910
the sound of this instrument.

00:35:55.910 --> 00:36:02.100
So I know like my luthier will go
in there with a little tool and tap

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.570
on my sound post when my
viola is having a bad day.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.160
I can only think that to reduce
some of the volume and the bulk

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:15.330
of that sound post may have
a pretty interesting effect.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.410
I do know that this instrument
responds very differently

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:22.830
than anything I've
ever played before.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:26.520
So I do think that there is
something to be said about that.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.990
Thank you.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:32.550
It's been a pleasure to
have it for a few days, so.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.250
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: Yes.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:40.530
&gt;&gt; I noticed in the diagram
here that the bass bar.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:44.810
Is that the bass bar coming
across the back or across the top?

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.610
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: Yes.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:52.080
&gt;&gt; It looks more tapered
than the standard bass bar.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.210
Is that something that you noticed

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:59.870
or is there something she
was experimenting with?

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.270
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: This
particular drawing was

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.810
from the scientific
American article in 1962.

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:07.110
I don't really know that
it's a particular --

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.300
I know that tapering is not unusual
I don't think for the bass bar.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.840
But I couldn't tell you about this
particular one in this drawing.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:24.140
&gt;&gt; Shannon Merlino: Can
I just jump [inaudible]?

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:27.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have to say I'm
a novice about all of this.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.430
I don't really know much
about instrument making.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:34.830
I know the Sitka spruce is
used for pianos sometimes.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.430
I'm just wondering how much
experimentation there was

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:43.540
with materials or if, you know,
if that makes any sense at all

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.470 position:56%
and if there's any new technologies,
you know, discovered and so

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:51.990
on in all of the components,
including the bow?

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.290
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: I don't know.

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:54.590
I can't speak to the bow.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.730
But with respect to materials,
with respect to the instrument,

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:59.990
one of Carleen's experiments,
she tried 35 different kinds

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.600
of wood for the bridge alone.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.100
That was one of her experiments.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.280
Another one was the epoxy
violin that she did,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.210
she made out of epoxy resin.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.580
She made an instrument.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.500
And she found that epoxy actually
was in many ways more uniform,

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.350
and it actually could work.

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:23.550
But many players thought
it was ugly.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:27.420
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one last question.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.720
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: Yes.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.080
&gt;&gt; Did she experiment with bows?

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.380
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: No.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.640
Never touched experimenting
with bows.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.210
&gt;&gt; We can do one more
quick question.

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:44.560
&gt;&gt; Quincy Whitney: And I just want
to remind you that I would love

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.880
to sign a copy for anyone who
would like to read the book.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.450

you Quincy and Shannon.
