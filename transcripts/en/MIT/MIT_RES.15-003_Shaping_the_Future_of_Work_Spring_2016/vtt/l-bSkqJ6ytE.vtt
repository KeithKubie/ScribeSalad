00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.150
Let's talk about the current
opportunities and challenges

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.230
that you'll face as you
enter the labor market.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.880
My first question is,
are these the best

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.670
of times, or the worst of
times to be looking for a job

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.000
and starting your career?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.880
Well, let's take a look at some
of the labor market realities

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.980
that you face.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.770
You all recall what we referred
to as the Great Recession

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.530
of 2007 and 2009?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.390
This chart shows
just how many jobs we

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.760
lost during that time period.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.130
Well, the good news is
that, in fact, 2015--

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.140
finally-- was a great year
for job growth in the US.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.190
We made a big dent in
closing the jobs deficit,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.030
by creating nearly 2
and 1/2 million jobs.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.230
So now we only need
another 3 million more

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.700
to close the full job deficit.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.010
Let's hope we keep making
progress like we did last year.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.850
No guarantees, given the
shaky world economy we're in.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.510
So we have to keep pressing
government and business

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.250
leaders to keep the job
growth going strong.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.370
That's challenge number one.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.880
But that's only the
beginning of the challenge.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.440
Recall what the
Occupy movement said,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.970
that 1% of the top earners
are getting all of the income?

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.510
Well, they were right.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.530
Over 50% of income
growth in the last decade

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.790
has come to the top 1%.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.610
And we have to go way
back here, to 1928,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.530
to have a situation where we get
that much unequal distribution

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.430
of income.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.790
So we do have an income problem.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.810
But it wasn't always this way.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.860
From the end of World War II--

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.270
down here about 1947,
1948-- all the way through

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.310
till about 1980,
we saw an economy

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.380
where wages, and productivity,
and profits moved together.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.260
Later on we're going
to talk about this

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.380
as the era of the post-World
War II social contract.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.830
But something happened here.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.630
Note, after 1980s, productivity
continued to grow by over 80%,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.030
but wages and
compensation flat-lined.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.930
The average worker in
the United States economy

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.000
has only seen about a 9%
wage increase since 1980.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.550
And in fact, if you don't
have a college degree

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.950
your wages have gone down,
relative to the cost of living

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.580
during this time period.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.250
So while in the
early stage, we had

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.630
what President Kennedy said, "a
rising tide lifts all boats."

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.650
Everybody worked hard
and shared in the gains.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.820
We have seen something
happen since 1980

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.730
that has changed that.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.680
Let's now focus a little
bit more carefully on just

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.720
what happens if you
are entering the labor

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.320
market after finishing
high school or college

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.810
at this point in time.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.970
Many of you will start
off as unpaid interns,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.710
or in part time
jobs, or in jobs that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.200
don't use the full
education that you've

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.820
worked so hard to achieve.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.680
You'll be what we
call underemployed.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.850
And it's not surprising that
given that, many of your cohort

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.390
are experiencing very low
levels of job satisfaction.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.620
In fact, the lowest levels that
we have seen in many years.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.960
Back in the 1980s,
this red line shows,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.540
that people under the age
of 25 were like others--

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.320
more than 50% were
satisfied with their wages,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.420
their hours of work,
and their opportunities

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.800
to learn on the job.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.740
But now, these numbers have
declined to a little over 35%.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.050
And so only about one
third of young people

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.330
are satisfied with their jobs.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.880
How does this really affect you?

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.940
Well, the economic
evidence is very clear--

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.660
if you start off as many of
you are experiencing now,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.670
in a low-income jobs that
don't use your full skills that

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.520
you've been educated for, or
you start off as a paid or even

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.290
an unpaid intern, or you start
off in part-time work in hotels

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.270
or restaurants, or
other retail areas,

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.620
you're going to experience
about 10 years-- or even more--

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.220
of suppressed income and lack
of opportunities for growth.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.140
Does it have to be this way?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.230
I don't believe
that for a moment.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.330
There is no iron
law of economics

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.980
that produce these results.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.250
It's the results
of bad policies,

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.880
of our institutions and
the way in which we govern.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.270
We're failing to catch
up with the changing

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.510
workforce, and the
changing nature of work.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.540
And we can do better.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.150
And in fact, many
firms are doing better.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.310
Some companies are way ahead
in providing good jobs.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.650
A lot of innovation is
happening at the local level

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.060
in start-ups, in
nonprofit organizations,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.611
in state and local governments.

00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:58.610
We're going to look at
some of those innovations

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.550
in our next video, and ask how
you can join this process so

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.700
that we can improve the work
life of everyone going forward.
