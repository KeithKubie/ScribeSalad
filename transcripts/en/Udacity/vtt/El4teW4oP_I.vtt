00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.671
Usually, we just add numbers up and take the average. This doesn't work with

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:07.716
frames per second. And that's the problem with 'em. If you add the 4 values

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:12.744
together and divide by 4, you get 27.5 frames per second. That's not correct.

00:00:12.744 --> 00:00:16.952
however. Say we think about this question in terms of miles per hour. Instead

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:21.640
of 400 frames, say you drive 400 miles. If you drive 25 miles per hour for the

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.280
first 100 miles, 50 miles per hour for the next, and so on. How long will the

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.870
trip take you? Divide 400 miles by this number of hours, and you'll get your

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.531
average number of miles per hour. Using this idea, we see that the first set of

00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:37.911
frame takes 4 seconds to view, the second; 2 seconds, third; 4 seconds, and the

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:44.550
fourth; 10 seconds. A total of 20 seconds. 400 frames divided by 20 seconds is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.718
20 frames per second. This answer is a little surprising in that it's lower

00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:53.254
than 3 of the 4 frame values mentioned. The duration of the 10 frames per

00:00:53.254 --> 00:00:57.360
second portion of our test is so long, that it pulls the average down.
