have seen that been there you can't deny

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
have seen that been there you can't deny
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.700
have seen that been there you can't deny
that it's happening but you then have to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710
that it's happening but you then have to
 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.360
that it's happening but you then have to
pretend that it's nothing to do with us

so so therefore nothing so we don't have

so so therefore nothing so we don't have
 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.680
so so therefore nothing so we don't have
to change our behavior that's the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
to change our behavior that's the
 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.710
to change our behavior that's the
thinking around that and that can get

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
