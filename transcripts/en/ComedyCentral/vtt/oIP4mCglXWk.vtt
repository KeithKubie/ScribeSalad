00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:05.538
PETER NORTH POLE?

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.140

[all whistling]

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:12.479
- HI, GUYS.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.449

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.284
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE ALL OF THIS DOWN.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.452
YOU'RE DISTRACTING
THE ENTIRE OFFICE.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.021

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.057

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.633
- WHY'RE YOU BEING
SUCH A SCROOGE McDUCK?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.001
- OH, I'M BEING
A SCROOGE McDUCK?

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.377
BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS HALF-CHRISTMAS.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.613
[kicks trash can]

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.619
- FINE, ALICE.
YOU LEAVE US NO CHOICE.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:54.454
WE'RE GONNA GO ON STRIKE.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.889
- NOBODY DISSES
HALF-CHRISTMAS!
