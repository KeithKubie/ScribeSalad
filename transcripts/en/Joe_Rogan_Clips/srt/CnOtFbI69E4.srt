1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
It's what a lot of people think is
wrong about the trash talk of this era

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,430
because there's, this is, there's
an error right now, right? Is this,

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,230
we're in the trash talk era.
Absolutely.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:13,050
Some people are really good at it
and some people are terrible at it,

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:17,270
but it seems like everybody's
trying Mazda doll. Um,

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,050
recently when he just beat Darren till
it was very interesting because you know

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:26,160
his take on it before the fight
was, why am I, why, why trash talk?

8
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,770
Like what are we doing?
What do you know why we're going to fight?

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,860
Like what is all this bullshit about?
Like he doesn't like it. He was like,

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,610
I don't like where this is going. I don't
like where the sport is going. Yeah.

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,503
I mean it was,

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,370
it's one of those things that I had to
adjust to because I wasn't brought on

13
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:44,430
those principles. I don't, I'm not,
you know, cause I'm not here. Yeah.

14
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:48,720
I wasn't here for a salesman. Like people
ask me all the time, why do you do this?

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,220
And I chose to do this,
like I'm college educated,

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,750
I can get a fucking job.

17
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,350
And him sitting in an office
and punch numbers and all that.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,240
But I chose to do this because of my
burning desire to compete. That's when I,

19
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:07,260
even now when I compete with guys,
I'm not competing angry.

20
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,720
I only to kill this guy. I'm not
Robert. I run all that shit. No,

21
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:16,500
it's competition for me. My mind is I'm
going to beat you. And which is partially,

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,510
which goes to test with the, how I fight
and how I compete. I'm not like that.

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,250
This is not the only thing that I can do.

24
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,070
And so this Eric came about where
now everybody, you gotta Talk Shit,

25
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,160
you gotta sell,
you gotta do this and do that.

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,690
And so do you feel any
pressure to do that? Initially,

27
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,030
at some point I did because it was,
um,

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,180
I was fighting the way I was fighting.

29
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:43,740
I was dominating guys and I was getting
nowhere. It was like no notoriety.

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,060
They were kind of like just kind
of putting you on the wayside.

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,130
They would always tell him, oh, you get a
top 10 guy, you'll get a top thing. Yeah.

32
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,540
But they wouldn't happen.
He was like, Oh, you,

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,500
you fight this guy and you can't really
argue with them because this promotion

34
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:59,490
has given you the opportunity to even
really make money at all for the career

35
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,960
path that you chose. So for I, for a
while I just felt like, man, this is not,

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,710
I guess I just got to do this because
you saw it. The other clown Covington it,

37
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,980
he had to do that.
He actually had,

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,290
nothing has changed with
the way that he fights.

39
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,500
He's done the exact same day
since he'd been in the UFC,

40
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,550
but after the first couple
of fight, no one gave a shit.
So he felt, you know what?

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,020
No, I'm just going to have to start doing
this. Everyone knows it's fake. Right.

42
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,760
Because he just one day woke up
and started doing it. And that's,

43
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,210
that's the thing now you have to do,
people try to say you have to do that,

44
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,100
but for me is when I'm not going to do
is I'm not going to just sell my soul

45
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,750
just to,
Oh yeah,

46
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,750
I'm just trying to earn a couple of
bucks because I'm not going to do that.

47
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,790
I'm going to do it the right way. George
did it the right way and, and, and I,

48
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,110
I'm a firm believer that
when you do it the right way,

49
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,260
you will earn what you deserve.
It will come to you at some point.

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,100
I don't think that you have to, I
really don't. He had something, I mean,

51
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:01,100
Colby Covington does because
I do freaking sot he, he show,

52
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,460
look, you got to give it to
him. He did beat those on Joe's.

53
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,210
That was a big victory. He did beat Damien
Maia. That was a big victory. Those are,

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,240
those are two legit victories
over to very dangerous guys.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,470
He did beat those kinds of, and he's
got skill on top of the trash talking,

56
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,510
but the trash talking bumped him ahead
of you in line and a lot of us were

57
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:23,740
surprised. I was surprised. I was
surprised that he had to, he had to do it.

58
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,900
And I mean it's gotten them where he
has and I mean look what he did like two

59
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:33,160
weeks ago when I fought his whole,
his whole deal with,

60
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,580
for me to create an uproar to
get my name back in the picture.

61
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,490
And he did a wonderful job. This
is one thing that I will, I will,

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,520
I would say is that he has
done a wonderful job at
having people talk about him,

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,690
whether you hate him,
which,

64
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,240
and even the bosses have said the exact
same thing is no one has done what he's

65
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,074
done.

66
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,410
No one has ever created the persona
that is unanimously hated worldwide.

67
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,560
Like unanimously, there's not
even heal. Like literally it,

68
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,690
like those guys, they still had fans,
you know, that wanted to see him succeed.

69
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,480
Like nobody likes it. He's not
safe anywhere. No. You know,

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,860
you don't even have to be, there's
flyweights that want to hurt this guy.

71
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,110
So if you, Nana Nestle has, he's
done a good job of creating that,

72
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:26,320
which I love and I appreciate that it's
going to sell a lot of paper views,

73
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:28,930
but I'm not, yeah, I'm not
a hater. I'm not a hater.

74
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,430
Like I give credit where credit is due.

75
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,100
I appreciate the fact
that he has done that.

76
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,640
And that's one day net Rashad taught
me over the years is that you have to

77
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:40,150
appreciate certain things like that. And
I, and I do, I always wanted this moment,

78
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,590
I always wanted that Connor and
could be that, that, that adversary,

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,500
that Rashad and rampage, that
Hughes and, and George St Pierre,

80
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,920
like I always wanted that. And, and
he's done a good job of creating that.

81
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,600
So you're not just an adversary in terms
of like a legitimate worthy opponent,

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,760
but uh, do that you want to
fuck up. Absolutely. I mean,

83
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,480
I haven't, I haven't been in a fight
yet where it was like a malicious,

84
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:11,920
like I was maliciously trying to hurt
someone. I haven't been in that fight yet.

85
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,800
Yes, I don't. That's the thing, my
amazing with my mind. My mind is strong.

86
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,720
I don't compete.
Oh yeah,

87
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,540
I'm trying to kill this guy and then
you swing five punches. You Miss.

88
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,940
Now you're dead tired.
I don't compete like that.

89
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:26,170
This one I'm still going to compete as
myself but there's going to be a little

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,990
extra on behind these,
these elbows.

91
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:33,370
Now I'm going to fillet your face with
the little longer cuts. I'm trying to,

92
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,430
this one is going to be one that I,
I really enjoy.

93
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,520
Well there was the same with could be
even Connor when he said I want to change

94
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,850
your face. Yes. When he said that
I was like damn, that's deep.

95
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,350
I want to change your face.

96
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:47,680
And you saw that even with when
could be was like that is um,

97
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,130
because he was never out of character
and it can be never was like, oh yeah,

98
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:53,270
I'm just going to go out there
and try to kill this guy. Right.

99
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,520
There's a certain level,

100
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,130
there's a certain mentality then
certain fighters have to add.

101
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,350
It could be was a another guy that I've
seen that competes similarly to the way

102
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:08,090
that I do as far as his mind, where it's
at. Like I don't give a shit what you do,

103
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:11,660
talk about me, do all this. Try
to distract me like they tried me.

104
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,720
This will come leading up to the
tire and fight. They did everything.

105
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,410
What are you going to do?
And then you had his,

106
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,110
his little psychic that
looked like sideshow Bob that
was was talking and doing

107
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,411
this,

108
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:25,520
trying to distract me and this and then
Colby popped up trying to distract me.

109
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,870
Dad didn't change anything.

110
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,350
That's not going to do nothing to
me like my mind is own competing.

111
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:34,460
I'm going to compete to the best of my
abilities and I'm going to embarrass you

112
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,190
and then this guy is going
to be even more worse.

113
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,240
Big Change in your skillset from your
first fight in the UFC to now as you're

114
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:45,880
striking, you're wrestling
has always been outstanding.

115
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,470
Your cardio has always been excellent,

116
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,180
but your striking is much
more fluid and much looser.

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,650
You're you, you're much more efficient
now. You was, you were always powerful,

118
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,560
but it seems like now
everything's phone together.

119
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:02,420
Like you don't have any holes in your
game anymore. It's a different thing.
