00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:18.014
Which is correct: "A dozen eggs is?"
Or "A dozen eggs are?"

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:19.884
I remember being in elementary school,

00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:22.289
and my teachers making
a big deal about the unit.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.674
And I never really got that,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:25.993
until one day, I was in the grocery store,

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:28.835
and I wanted to buy an apple,
but I couldn't buy one apple.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.812
I had to buy a whole bag of apples.

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:32.668
So I did. I bought one bag of apples,

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:35.989
I took it home, I took one apple
out of the bag, and I cut it up.

00:00:36.013 --> 00:00:37.479
And then I ate one slice.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:41.228
One bag, one apple, one slice.

00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:43.000
Which of these is the real "one"?

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:44.880
Well, they all are of course,

00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:47.834
and that's what my elementary
teachers were trying to tell me.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:51.020
Because this is the important idea
behind whole number place value,

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:52.753
decimal place value and fractions.

00:00:52.777 --> 00:00:54.274
Our whole number system depends

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:56.701
on being able to change
what we count as "one".

00:00:56.725 --> 00:01:00.043
Our whole number system
depends on being able to change units.

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:01.789
There are two ways to change units.

00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:03.725
We can compose, and we can partition.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:05.468
When we compose units,

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:08.826
we take a bunch of things, we put them
together to make a bigger thing,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.000
like a dozen eggs.

00:01:10.024 --> 00:01:12.916
We take 12 eggs,
put them together to make a group,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.750
and we call that group a dozen.

00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:17.389
A dozen eggs is a composed unit.

00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:20.543
Other examples of composed units

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:24.196
include a deck of cards,
a pair of shoes, a jazz quartet

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.508
and of course,
Barbie and Ken make a couple.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.937
But think about a loaf of bread.

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.433
That's not a composed unit,

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:33.896
because we don't get a bunch of slices
from a bunch of different bakeries

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.694
and put them together to make a loaf.

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:37.318
No, we start with a loaf of bread

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:39.999
and we cut it into smaller
pieces called slices,

00:01:40.023 --> 00:01:43.408
so each slice of bread
is a partitioned unit.

00:01:43.432 --> 00:01:45.177
Other examples of partitioned units

00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:48.112
include a square of a chocolate bar,
a section of an orange

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:49.473
and a slice of pizza.

00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:53.357
The important thing about units
is that once we've made a new unit,

00:01:53.381 --> 00:01:55.688
we can treat it
just like we did the old unit.

00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:57.470
We can compose composed units,

00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:59.859
and we can partition partitioned units.

00:01:59.883 --> 00:02:01.410
Think about toaster pastries.

00:02:02.742 --> 00:02:04.402
They come in packs of two,

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:06.903
and then those packs
get put together in sets of four

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.265
to make a box.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.491
So when I buy one box of toaster pastries,

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.320
am I buying one thing,

00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:15.290
four things, or eight things?

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:17.174
It depends on the unit.

00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:20.142
One box, four packs, eight pastries.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.440
And when I share
a slice of pizza with a friend,

00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:26.521
we have to cut "it"
into two smaller pieces.

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.648
So a box of toaster pastries
is composed of composed units,

00:02:32.513 --> 00:02:34.133
and when I split a slice of pizza,

00:02:34.157 --> 00:02:36.204
I'm partitioning a partitioned unit.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.917
But what does that have to do with math?

00:02:40.094 --> 00:02:41.729
In math, everything is certain.

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:43.369
Two plus two equals four,

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.758
and one is just one.

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:47.166
But that's not really right.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:48.896
One isn't always one.

00:02:49.342 --> 00:02:51.728
Here's why: we start counting at one,

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:55.169
and we count up to nine:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:57.526
and then we get to 10,
and in order to write 10,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.018
we write a one

00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:00.385
and a zero.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.197
That one means that we have one group,

00:03:04.221 --> 00:03:05.703
and the zero helps us remember

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.727
that it means one group, not one thing.

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:10.898
But 10, just like one,

00:03:10.922 --> 00:03:12.292
just like a dozen eggs,

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:13.574
just like an egg,

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:15.267
10 is a unit.

00:03:16.084 --> 00:03:17.898
And 10 tens make 100.

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:19.741
So when I think about 100,

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:21.575
it's like the box of toaster pastries.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.441
Is 100 one thing,

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:25.636
10 things

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.924
or 100 things?

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:28.645
And that depends on what "one" is,

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:30.278
it depends on what the unit is.

00:03:31.285 --> 00:03:34.735
So think about all the times in math
when you write the number one.

00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:37.592
No matter what place that one is in,

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.854
no matter how many things
that one represents,

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:41.808
one is.
