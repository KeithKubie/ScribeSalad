00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.935
We have been talking about the
properties of transition metal

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:24.294
complexes, coordination
complexes, in the context of a

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:27.008
simple crystal field theory
model.

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.285
And I just wanted to make
reference at the beginning,

00:00:31.285 --> 00:00:34.000
today, to state diagrams.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.960
And, in the context of
octahedral complexes,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.210
you saw that an array of six
ligands surrounding a central

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.552
metal ion would lead to a t two
g and what we are

00:00:54.552 --> 00:00:59.618
calling an eg star
manifold of orbitals on the

00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:05.144
metal in which we can populate
with the number of d electrons

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:10.920
that we have present.
And the graph that I am making

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.053
here is related to the idea that
for a system with only a single

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:20.849
electron, so this could be,
for example,

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:26.300
titanium OH two six times three
plus.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.396
This is a d one system.
And it can go from a ground

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:37.368
state configuration of t two g
one eg star zero.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.741
And then, upon absorption of

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:44.913
light, it can be promoted from
the ground state,

00:01:44.913 --> 00:01:48.464
represented here,
into the excited state.

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:53.613
And the excited state has the
configuration t two g zero eg

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:58.851
star one,
showing that that electron has

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:04.000
been promoted through absorption
of a photon.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.408
And this gap here between t(2g)
and eg star,

00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:12.571
of course, is our delta O
value.

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:19.000
And the axis on the bottom,
here, is ligand field strength.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.897
This is supposed to tell you
that different ligands give rise

00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:39.632
to different values of delta O
accounting for the fact that

00:02:39.632 --> 00:02:44.448
this d one titanium
three ion in a field

00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:47.795
of water molecules has one
color, whereas,

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:51.469
if you, in fact, look at 
Ti Cl six three minus,

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.224
you will be able to tell that

00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:59.632
that also is a titanium three
plus or d one

00:02:59.632 --> 00:03:04.360
system.
But they do not have the same

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.046
color.
And the one absorption band

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:11.360
that you find in the visible
part of the spectrum that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.325
corresponds to promotion of an
electron from t two g

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:21.290
into eg star is just
moving around a little bit in

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.093
energy because these ligands
behave differently with respect

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:30.895
to what we call their ligand
field strength that they exert,

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:35.290
that leads to a particular
energy gap between t(2g) and

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.423
e(g)*.
I will get into this a little

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:46.798
bit further in the moment,
but the point here is that d

00:03:46.798 --> 00:03:54.000
one or d nine
are special electron counts.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.526
And the reason that they are
special is that these have a

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:16.250
single absorption peak due to
what we call d-d transitions.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.000
They have a single d-d
transition.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.416
And that means there is a
ground state and then just one

00:04:29.416 --> 00:04:33.751
excited state that the system
can be promoted to in the

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:37.686
presence of impinging photons of
the right energy.

00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:42.664
And what happens is that if you
have more d electrons than just

00:04:42.664 --> 00:04:47.000
one, or d nine is
special because we treat that

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.416
using a whole formalism,
like there is just one electron

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:55.591
missing from a complete
manifold, a completely full d

00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:59.382
shell minus one.
With d^n systems,

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:02.472
for example,
d two is much more

00:05:02.472 --> 00:05:05.644
complex.
And this is beyond the scope of

00:05:05.644 --> 00:05:10.280
5.112, but it is something that
they are treating in 5.04,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.126
for example.
If you go on in organic

00:05:13.126 --> 00:05:18.087
chemistry, you will learn how
come different states can arise,

00:05:18.087 --> 00:05:22.560
multiple states arise when you
have more than just a one

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.000
electron picture.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.255
For example,
if you have a vanadium three

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:40.000
plus ion,
there are three bands observed.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.945
And so the simple picture that
you have, just a t(2g) level and

00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:52.509
an e(g) level is correct and
maps onto the picture of the

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.945
electronic states that are
available, as long as we are

00:05:55.945 --> 00:05:59.000
just talking about a one
electron picture.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.805
With more electrons in play,
depending on just which of the

00:06:02.805 --> 00:06:06.152
orbitals they go into,
they will have inter-electron

00:06:06.152 --> 00:06:09.826
repulsion terms that come into
play and give rise to more

00:06:09.826 --> 00:06:12.648
excited states.
Here, with three bands being

00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:15.929
observed in the visible,
that means there are three

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:19.997
possible transitions and three
possible excited states that can

00:06:19.997 --> 00:06:22.556
be accessed.
So it is a very complicated

00:06:22.556 --> 00:06:25.631
picture.
And so we are going to be,

00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:28.956
for the purposes of this,
focusing on the one electron

00:06:28.956 --> 00:06:31.152
picture.
But I just wanted you to be

00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:34.792
aware that it does get a lot
more complex as soon as you go

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:38.117
to many electron systems.
Now, let's talk just briefly

00:06:38.117 --> 00:06:40.000
about pairing energy.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.949
In the case of 3d system,
we typically find that the

00:06:53.949 --> 00:07:01.300
pairing energy is around 15,000
to 18,000 reciprocal 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:09.000
centimeters, the typical energy
unit given for pairing energy.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.959
But then if we go to heavier
transition elements,

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:19.643
to the 4d or the 5d elements,
then typically the pairing

00:07:19.643 --> 00:07:25.223
energy is about 8,000 to 12,000
reciprocal centimeters.

00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:31.319
And what that says is that it
is easier to pair up electrons

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:37.829
in 4d or 5d orbitals than it is
to put two electrons in the same

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:42.516
3d orbital.
And the reason for that is just

00:07:42.516 --> 00:07:46.250
what the radial extension is of
these orbitals.

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.876
In effect, these orbitals are
larger than the 3d orbitals.

00:07:50.876 --> 00:07:55.584
And it means that if you put
two electrons into the same 4d

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:59.155
or 5d orbital,
much of the time they can stay

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:03.457
farther apart from each other
than if they are in a 3d

00:08:03.457 --> 00:08:07.866
orbital.
And so this has the practical

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:13.106
consequence that 4d and 5d
systems often are low spin.

00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:19.136
And so this high spin/low spin
issue that we talked about last

00:08:19.136 --> 00:08:24.079
time is mostly focused on
complexes of the 3d ions.

00:08:24.079 --> 00:08:28.726
So then we are talking about
titanium, vanadium,

00:08:28.726 --> 00:08:33.676
chromium, etc.
And, if we come over here,

00:08:33.676 --> 00:08:38.926
we can ask, what is the effect
of charge on delta O?

00:08:38.926 --> 00:08:45.000
This is all pointing back to
the state diagram that I showed

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.529
you over there in this kind of
sliding scale,

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:55.602
where you can change things
like just what type of metal ion

00:08:55.602 --> 00:08:59.000
you have, 3d,
4d, or 5d.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.503
Or you can change the nature of
the ligands.

00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:09.472
Or you can even change the
charge on the metal as a way of

00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:13.557
changing delta O.
And so we can look at,

00:09:13.557 --> 00:09:17.537
for example,
chromium hexaaquo two plus

00:09:17.537 --> 00:09:23.192
versus chromium
hexaaquo three plus.

00:09:23.192 --> 00:09:28.324
The first is a d four ion.

00:09:28.324 --> 00:09:32.932
And then, the second is a d

00:09:32.932 --> 00:09:38.146
three ion.
You should practice going from

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:44.338
a formula into the d^n count.
And then we can look at what

00:09:44.338 --> 00:09:48.683
delta O does.
This is roughly 14,000 wave

00:09:48.683 --> 00:09:52.811
numbers.
And then, when we oxidize from

00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:57.591
2+ to 3+, higher charge on the
central metal,

00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:04.000
delta O shoots up to about
approximately 17,000.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.617
And this is in reciprocal
centimeters.

00:10:07.617 --> 00:10:13.483
We see that putting a higher
charge on the metal center leads

00:10:13.483 --> 00:10:18.958
to a larger value of delta O.
And that is also true if we

00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:23.846
look at some other metal systems
along these lines.

00:10:23.846 --> 00:10:27.561
For example,
there are just a number of

00:10:27.561 --> 00:10:32.743
different metals for which the
hexaaquo systems can be

00:10:32.743 --> 00:10:39.000
generated in both the 2+ and the
3+ state of charge.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.217
And here, we go from about
12,000 and then oxidize,

00:10:45.217 --> 00:10:52.430
and we get up to about 18,000,
so even a larger increase in

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:59.891
the value of delta O on going
from the 2+ to the 3+ oxidation

00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:05.471
state of the metal.
And then in the notes you will

00:11:05.471 --> 00:11:10.085
find that I put in another
example that behaves similarly

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:13.710
based on cobalt.
If you go from cobalt two to

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.911
cobalt three hexaaquo,
you go from about 9,000 up to

00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:22.937
18,000 reciprocal centimeters.
So almost doubling the value of

00:11:22.937 --> 00:11:26.892
delta O by removing one electron
from the system.

00:11:26.892 --> 00:11:32.000
What is going on here is that
the greater charge --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
-- pulls the ligands in closer
to the metal.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.079
And if the ligands are in
closer to the metal,

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:54.912
then what that ends up saying
is you will see in a moment

00:11:54.912 --> 00:11:58.950
because we are going to get to
the MO picture for octahedral

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:02.577
coordination complexes,
is that putting electrons in e

00:12:02.577 --> 00:12:06.000
g star becomes more
difficult.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.071
Delta O is larger.
The ligands come in closer,

00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:12.688
and that is effectively
shrinking that value of r when

00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:16.646
we talked about our spherical
coordinates as applied to the

00:12:16.646 --> 00:12:20.605
angular parts of the d-orbital
wavefunctions and looking at

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.379
that.
So we are changing r.

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:26.065
The ligands are coming in
closer to the more positively

00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:31.222
charged metal ion in that case.
And then we can also look at

00:12:31.222 --> 00:12:34.000
the effect of changing the
ligand.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.645
In the system on the left,
we were looking at pairs of

00:12:51.645 --> 00:12:55.772
metal complexes with the same
ligand and changing the charge.

00:12:55.772 --> 00:12:59.830
And now we are just going to
say, what happens if you change

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.049
the ligand?
And this will be a series of

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:08.405
vanadium complexes.
We have five of them.

00:13:08.405 --> 00:13:12.000
We have the vanadium hexaaquo.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.971
This one is 3+.
We have the vanadium with six

00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:26.721
urea molecules.
And this is also 3+.

00:13:26.721 --> 00:13:35.000
We have vanadium hexafluoride
three minus.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.131
And these are all vanadium in
the +3 oxidation state.

00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:44.572
Then we have vanadium
hexachloride three minus,

00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:49.013
and down here the fifth one

00:13:49.013 --> 00:13:54.539
will be vanadium with six
cyanide ligands and three minus.

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:59.276
So these are all d two

00:13:59.276 --> 00:14:05.000
systems with vanadium in the +3
oxidation state.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:12.845
And here, we are going from
18,000 reciprocal centimeters to

00:14:12.845 --> 00:14:18.696
the hexafluoride.
And we drop down to 16,000.

00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:25.744
And this is all approximate.
And six urea on vanadium,

00:14:25.744 --> 00:14:31.534
we go up to about 17,0000.
And then, with the

00:14:31.534 --> 00:14:35.198
hexachloride,
we are down to about a delta O

00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:37.926
of 12,000 reciprocal
centimeters.

00:14:37.926 --> 00:14:42.698
And then we put cyanides on,
and delta O pops up to about

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:46.875
23,000 wave numbers.
So this is the same metal ion

00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:50.369
but in five different ligand
environments.

00:14:50.369 --> 00:14:54.119
It has five very different
values of delta O.

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.954
And from this,
we can derive a spectrochemical

00:14:57.954 --> 00:15:00.000
series --

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.533
-- for organizing ligands with
respect to the magnitude of

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:11.323
delta O that they exert for a
given metal ion.

00:15:11.323 --> 00:15:14.610
And this one just gives us a
series that contains five

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.594
ligands.
But, as you can imagine,

00:15:16.594 --> 00:15:20.128
many more ligands than just
these five simple ligands have

00:15:20.128 --> 00:15:23.971
been looked at with a variety of
different metal ions to make a

00:15:23.971 --> 00:15:27.940
pretty big overall comprehensive
spectrochemical series that sort

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.597
of allows you to pick out which
ligand you want when you are

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:36.000
interested in generating a
particular value of delta O.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:45.369
And here what you see is that
the weakest one is chloride.

00:15:45.369 --> 00:15:52.602
We have chloride.
And then next was fluoride.

00:15:52.602 --> 00:16:00.000
And then next was urea followed
by water.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.418
And then the strongest in this
small series of five was

00:16:05.418 --> 00:16:09.130
cyanide.
And when we try to understand

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.946
the order that these different
ligands appear in,

00:16:13.946 --> 00:16:19.464
in the spectrochemical series,
we are going to find out,

00:16:19.464 --> 00:16:25.484
as we study the properties of
the molecular orbitals of these

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:30.000
systems, that cyanide is a pi
acid.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.781
And that down here,
chloride is a pi donor.

00:16:33.781 --> 00:16:37.832
And in the middle,
you have systems like water

00:16:37.832 --> 00:16:40.713
which is more or less sigma
only.

00:16:40.713 --> 00:16:45.755
So we can understand where
specific ligands appear in the

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:50.347
spectrochemical series on the
basis of their orbital

00:16:50.347 --> 00:16:54.308
considerations.
And that will be the focus of

00:16:54.308 --> 00:16:58.000
the next part of the lecture.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.991
I would like to talk a little
bit about sigma-only ligands.

00:17:18.991 --> 00:17:23.259
The process in which we are now
about to engage is very similar

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:27.251
to that which we used in class
for generating the molecular

00:17:27.251 --> 00:17:32.000
orbital energy level diagram for
the BH three molecule.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.447
In that case we had a central
boron and three hydrogens around

00:17:36.447 --> 00:17:40.020
it, and we made some hydrogen
linear combinations.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.593
And we saw how they would
interact with the atomic

00:17:43.593 --> 00:17:47.385
orbitals of the boron.
And now we are going to do the

00:17:47.385 --> 00:17:52.052
same thing, except we have a lot
more orbitals in the system as a

00:17:52.052 --> 00:17:55.187
whole, so we are approximating
some of them.

00:17:55.187 --> 00:18:00.000
Here is a typical sigma-only
ligand, NH three.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.157
And for NH three,
we have a lone pair on the

00:18:05.157 --> 00:18:09.303
nitrogen here.
And I am drawing it in very

00:18:09.303 --> 00:18:13.247
simplified fashion,
as you will no doubt

00:18:13.247 --> 00:18:16.685
appreciate.
There is our lone pair.

00:18:16.685 --> 00:18:21.033
And, when this points directly
at the metal,

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:27.000
the lone pair can make a sigma
bond to the metal.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.227
I think you will appreciate
that if we have a metal out here

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:47.311
such that this lone pair of
electrons is directed right at

00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:51.682
the metal, then that results in
a cylindrically symmetric lone

00:18:51.682 --> 00:18:55.121
pair about that metal-nitrogen
internuclear axis.

00:18:55.121 --> 00:18:58.560
And so that would be a
sigma-type of interaction.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.000
So this is called a sigma-only
ligand.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.588
And other ligands,
like cyanide or like chloride,

00:19:08.588 --> 00:19:16.411
we are going to have to add in
pi effects, but this is the

00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:23.549
simple sigma-only case.
And so if you take a molecule

00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:30.000
such as this cobalt hexamine two
plus, --

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.050
-- or, actually,
let's say three plus for

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.708
simplicity here.
Cobalt three plus.

00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:44.379
And we have these NH three
ligands at each of the

00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:47.620
six positions.
And, in each case,

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.987
the orientation of the
hydrogens on these nitrogens is

00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:58.556
such as to promote a sigma
directing effect of that lone

00:19:58.556 --> 00:20:04.303
pair toward the metal.
And so that lone pair of

00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:09.869
electrons on the nitrogen for
each of these ammonia ligands

00:20:09.869 --> 00:20:15.532
directed right at the metal is
providing this repulsion that

00:20:15.532 --> 00:20:19.947
pumps e(g) up in energy.
And you will see that,

00:20:19.947 --> 00:20:25.513
hopefully, very clearly now.
And let me point out that this

00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:29.544
orbital, here,
that I am focusing on is the

00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:34.817
HOMO of NH three.
What we are doing is saying you

00:20:34.817 --> 00:20:37.925
have a central metal ion and
then you have six ammonia

00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:40.858
ligands pointing at it,
each of them pointing their

00:20:40.858 --> 00:20:43.203
HOMO at the metal,
their highest occupied

00:20:43.203 --> 00:20:45.314
molecular orbital.
What does that do?

00:20:45.314 --> 00:20:48.891
What kinds of bonds arise as a
consequence of that between the

00:20:48.891 --> 00:20:52.000
metal ion and these six ammonia
molecules?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.720
And so we will now see what
that is on the basis of some of

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.523
the linear combinations that we
can generate between the six

00:21:01.523 --> 00:21:06.000
HOMOs of the NH three's in this
kind of a geometry.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
I will do the first one over
here.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.509
I would like to use a different
color for that.

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:40.039
I am going to use my blue.
All right.

00:21:40.039 --> 00:21:46.019
I am going to draw for you some
linear combinations of ammonia

00:21:46.019 --> 00:21:49.450
lone pairs.
These are simplistically

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:55.431
representing the homo of each NH
three directed at the

00:21:55.431 --> 00:21:59.689
metal.
That one has the symmetry of a

00:21:59.689 --> 00:22:03.006
cobalt s orbital.
It has the same sign

00:22:03.006 --> 00:22:06.593
everywhere.
And then, we are going to see

00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:10.000
that you can draw three of
these.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
And I will draw them all right
here --

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.178
-- in pairs.
And this one has the symmetry

00:22:30.178 --> 00:22:37.393
of a cobalt pz atomic orbital.
You see it has positive up

00:22:37.393 --> 00:22:39.234
there.
And down here,

00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:42.916
we are taking this to be x,
this to be y,

00:22:42.916 --> 00:22:46.690
and this to be z for each of
our diagrams,

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:52.397
so that the phase properties of
this combination is that of pz.

00:22:52.397 --> 00:22:57.000
This one is like px.
This one is like py.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.753
And the only reason we have to
take these linear combinations

00:23:01.753 --> 00:23:06.349
is because we have multiple
equivalent ammonia molecules in

00:23:06.349 --> 00:23:09.835
this problem.
And then, we have two more that

00:23:09.835 --> 00:23:14.034
are of interest to us.
One of these will have a couple

00:23:14.034 --> 00:23:18.391
of big lobes located on z,
pointed at the metal and then

00:23:18.391 --> 00:23:21.719
four small lobes,
each with negative phase.

00:23:21.719 --> 00:23:25.601
I will shade them to indicate
that negative phase.

00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:30.593
And that one will have the same
phase properties as a cobalt d z

00:23:30.593 --> 00:23:35.929
squared orbital.
Plus above, plus below.

00:23:35.929 --> 00:23:40.625
And then, to match up with the
torus in the center of d z

00:23:40.625 --> 00:23:45.154
squared in the
x,y-plane, the negative phase

00:23:45.154 --> 00:23:47.670
shown there.
And then, finally,

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:52.787
over here we have one where all
four contributions to this one

00:23:52.787 --> 00:23:57.148
are in the x,y-plane,
along the x and y axes and with

00:23:57.148 --> 00:24:01.965
shading as shown there.
And that is of the same

00:24:01.965 --> 00:24:07.008
symmetry as our d x squared
minus y squared

00:24:07.008 --> 00:24:10.341
orbital.
Having written down this set of

00:24:10.341 --> 00:24:15.128
six linear combinations that we
can generate from our six

00:24:15.128 --> 00:24:18.888
ammonia HOMOs,
we are done because the cobalt

00:24:18.888 --> 00:24:22.222
has atomic orbitals of these
symmetries.

00:24:22.222 --> 00:24:26.752
We can now use these to make
bonds between the ammonia

00:24:26.752 --> 00:24:32.076
molecules and the cobalt.
And we can use them to make

00:24:32.076 --> 00:24:34.000
corresponding antibonds.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Here is the MO diagram for the
sigma-only case.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:07.072
What we have is an energy level
diagram that will represent the

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:13.231
interaction of these linear
combinations with the metal

00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:18.479
valance orbitals.
And so I am going to draw the

00:25:18.479 --> 00:25:23.384
metal valance orbitals over here
as follows.

00:25:23.384 --> 00:25:27.604
We have, on the metal,
the 3d, the 4s,

00:25:27.604 --> 00:25:32.172
and the 4p.
And some of you will notice

00:25:32.172 --> 00:25:37.080
that this ordering of energies
is a little different than what

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.264
you saw when you just built up
atomic configurations,

00:25:41.264 --> 00:25:45.931
because what I have drawn here
is the set of five 3d atomic

00:25:45.931 --> 00:25:51.000
orbitals is down lower in energy
than the cobalt 4s and lower in

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.781
energy, that is,
even still, than the cobalt 4p.

00:25:54.781 --> 00:25:59.974
This is our cobalt atom here.
And the reason this energy

00:25:59.974 --> 00:26:03.696
ordering for the valance
orbitals is difference is

00:26:03.696 --> 00:26:06.202
because we have an ionized
cobalt.

00:26:06.202 --> 00:26:10.911
And the energies change around
when you remove an electron from

00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:14.101
the system as compared to the
neutral atom.

00:26:14.101 --> 00:26:18.430
But one thing that will help
you remember this ordering of

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:22.835
energy levels is that it goes in
the order of the principle

00:26:22.835 --> 00:26:25.873
quantum number,
which kind of does make a

00:26:25.873 --> 00:26:29.991
little sense.
In fact, these energies switch

00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:33.643
around, depending on which of
the metals you are talking

00:26:33.643 --> 00:26:35.634
about.
But generally 3d and 4s,

00:26:35.634 --> 00:26:39.352
or alternatively 4d and 5s,
are pretty close in energy to

00:26:39.352 --> 00:26:43.269
each other, depending on the ion
that you are talking about.

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:46.655
And then 4p is usually
energetically a bit separated

00:26:46.655 --> 00:26:49.244
from that.
And then the thing that makes

00:26:49.244 --> 00:26:52.829
us focus our attention so
strongly on the d orbitals is

00:26:52.829 --> 00:26:57.012
that those are the ones closest
in energy to the ligand orbitals

00:26:57.012 --> 00:27:03.461
that can interact with them.
And so let me draw over here a

00:27:03.461 --> 00:27:10.038
bar that represents the six LCs
of NH three HOMOs.

00:27:10.038 --> 00:27:16.615
In essence, this represents
these six drawings that I drew

00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:23.653
over here, linear combinations
that have the right symmetry to

00:27:23.653 --> 00:27:30.000
interact with certain of valance
orbitals on the cobalt,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.147
here on the left.
And what we will find is that--

00:27:36.147 --> 00:27:42.341
And we will start with the 3d,
since that is what we are going

00:27:42.341 --> 00:27:45.996
to be principally interested in
here.

00:27:45.996 --> 00:27:51.683
We come over and find that
three of the d orbitals do not

00:27:51.683 --> 00:27:57.978
match any of these because these
NH three HOMOs all lie

00:27:57.978 --> 00:28:02.344
in nodal surfaces of them.
And that will be,

00:28:02.344 --> 00:28:06.000
of course, our t(2g) set.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.592
Those have the same energy as
in the ion itself.

00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:20.101
They come straight over and
don't get involved in bonding or

00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:24.000
antibonding interactions.
These are nonbonding.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.450
That is t(2g).
And then, what we find is that

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.960
of these six linear
combinations,

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.235
two of them,
shown right here,

00:28:38.235 --> 00:28:42.313
have the correct phase
properties to make bonding and

00:28:42.313 --> 00:28:46.627
antibonding combinations by
interacting with d z squared

00:28:46.627 --> 00:28:51.254
and d x squared minus
y squared.

00:28:51.254 --> 00:28:54.000
We show that down here.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.750
Here is a bonding combination.
This has e(g) symmetry,

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:14.518
and it represents the formation
of two bonds between the metal

00:29:14.518 --> 00:29:18.466
and the ligands.
And, of course,

00:29:18.466 --> 00:29:24.834
we also make an antibonding
combination of the same

00:29:24.834 --> 00:29:29.236
symmetry.
This should just remind you of

00:29:29.236 --> 00:29:33.039
the hydrogen H two
molecule molecular orbital

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:36.394
problem built into this much
larger structure.

00:29:36.394 --> 00:29:39.451
And this one,
this antibonding case is e g

00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:42.956
star.
And let's just quickly look at

00:29:42.956 --> 00:29:44.000
them.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.471
Here, what we have is a d z
squared orbital with

00:30:00.471 --> 00:30:05.849
its torus interacting in an
out-of-phase manner with these

00:30:05.849 --> 00:30:09.905
ammonia lone pairs.
That creates antibonding

00:30:09.905 --> 00:30:14.528
character here and here,
making this a high-energy

00:30:14.528 --> 00:30:18.018
orbital.
And then, we have antibonding

00:30:18.018 --> 00:30:22.358
character, too,
in between each of the ammonias

00:30:22.358 --> 00:30:27.641
located on the x,y-plane and the
torus of the d z squared.

00:30:27.641 --> 00:30:33.570
So that is one of our two e g

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:38.496
star orbitals.
And over here,

00:30:38.496 --> 00:30:46.253
we have our d x squared minus y
squared orbital

00:30:46.253 --> 00:30:52.779
making antibonding interactions
with this other linear

00:30:52.779 --> 00:30:59.552
combination, as shown here,
such that we get antibonding

00:30:59.552 --> 00:31:05.286
all the way around.
That is e g star.

00:31:05.286 --> 00:31:10.094
That is the reason why the e(g)
set, derived from our set of d

00:31:10.094 --> 00:31:12.932
orbitals, is marked with an
asterisk.

00:31:12.932 --> 00:31:16.479
It is antibonding with respect
to these bonds.

00:31:16.479 --> 00:31:20.027
If you start to populate e(g)*
with electrons,

00:31:20.027 --> 00:31:23.968
as you will do in certain cases
that are high-spin,

00:31:23.968 --> 00:31:27.121
for example,
those electrons that go into

00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:31.772
e(g)*, if you reflect back on
the way that we calculate bond

00:31:31.772 --> 00:31:36.186
order, they go in there and
weaken these two metal ligand

00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:40.161
bonds.
And these two bonds look just

00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:43.366
identical to the ones I drew
here for e(g)*,

00:31:43.366 --> 00:31:47.763
just reversing the phase and
making them bonding everywhere.

00:31:47.763 --> 00:31:50.000
Let's just look at those.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.619
Here, we have d z squared
making a nice bonding

00:32:03.619 --> 00:32:05.000
combination.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.925
It is interacting in an
in-phase manner with that linear

00:32:14.925 --> 00:32:19.940
combination, so we have bonding
both in the x,y-plane and

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:25.044
strongly along the z-axis.
That is one of these two bonds.

00:32:25.044 --> 00:32:29.432
And then over here,
we will have x squared minus y

00:32:29.432 --> 00:32:34.000
squared,
making bonds also --

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:45.666
-- like that.
Down here, this is bonding,

00:32:45.666 --> 00:32:50.000
and this is antibonding.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Now, that is not the entire
diagram.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.024
One runs out of space pretty
quickly on these

00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:09.146
horizontally-oriented boards for
putting together tall MO

00:33:09.146 --> 00:33:12.987
diagrams, but there were six LCs
over here.

00:33:12.987 --> 00:33:18.384
And you will see that there
will be another one that makes a

00:33:18.384 --> 00:33:22.500
bond with the 4s orbital.
And so, accordingly,

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:27.439
the 4s orbital comes up here.
There will be an antibond

00:33:27.439 --> 00:33:32.973
derived from 4s.
There will be also a set of

00:33:32.973 --> 00:33:39.140
three that are antibonding
derived from interaction of 4p

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.894
with the other ones,
here.

00:33:41.894 --> 00:33:47.951
And there is a big energy
mismatch between 4p and these,

00:33:47.951 --> 00:33:55.000
so we will draw these as the
least stabilized of the set.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.543
But now, what you can see down
here is that we have found a way

00:34:00.543 --> 00:34:04.209
to form six bonds,
six pairs of electrons,

00:34:04.209 --> 00:34:09.305
each coming from the highest
occupied molecular orbital of

00:34:09.305 --> 00:34:14.312
the six ammonia molecules.
We have formed six bonds using

00:34:14.312 --> 00:34:17.442
these valance orbitals of the
metal.

00:34:17.442 --> 00:34:22.985
And how many more electrons do
we have to put into the diagram?

00:34:22.985 --> 00:34:27.814
We have six because this,
in the case of our cobalt (NH

00:34:27.814 --> 00:34:33.000
three) six three plus --

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.019
This is Group 9.
Minus three for the 3+ charge.

00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:41.126
All the ammonia ligands are
neutral, equals six.

00:34:41.126 --> 00:34:43.834
So this is a d six case.

00:34:43.834 --> 00:34:48.203
The orbitals here that we
called t(2g) and e g star

00:34:48.203 --> 00:34:52.223
can now take up six
more electrons.

00:34:52.223 --> 00:34:57.553
And I am drawing them in here
with the assumption that this is

00:34:57.553 --> 00:35:02.391
a low-spin case.
And that is reasonable based on

00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:06.633
the 3+ charge of this ion.
We have already discussed the

00:35:06.633 --> 00:35:09.796
effective charge.
It draws the ligands in.

00:35:09.796 --> 00:35:14.269
It tends to increase the value
of delta O, as we have seen.

00:35:14.269 --> 00:35:17.972
And so this is how I would
populate that diagram,

00:35:17.972 --> 00:35:21.983
with the 6d electrons going
into the nonbonding t(2g)

00:35:21.983 --> 00:35:26.071
constituting the highest
occupied molecular orbital of

00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:30.182
this system.
And then, stabilize the lone

00:35:30.182 --> 00:35:32.989
pairs.
Down here what is really going

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:37.432
on, you can think about these
six ammonia molecules acting

00:35:37.432 --> 00:35:42.032
simultaneously as six Lewis
bases to a metal that has enough

00:35:42.032 --> 00:35:46.709
empty orbitals to accept six
lone pair donations to that same

00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:49.282
metal.
So it is a Lewis acid times

00:35:49.282 --> 00:35:51.854
six.
And it is positively charged,

00:35:51.854 --> 00:35:57.000
which of course tends to draw
electron density to it.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.875
And that is our simplified
molecular orbital diagram for

00:36:00.875 --> 00:36:04.327
the sigma-only case.
Now, there are a lot of other

00:36:04.327 --> 00:36:07.639
interesting cases.
As you can see here from this

00:36:07.639 --> 00:36:11.655
spectrochemical series where the
ligands in the middle are

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:13.910
basically sigma-only urea,
water.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.574
But then at either end of the
spectrochemical series,

00:36:17.574 --> 00:36:21.449
you get into systems where you
must take pi effects into

00:36:21.449 --> 00:36:23.000
account.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.814
And we will treat,
first, the case of a pi donor.

00:36:43.814 --> 00:36:48.328
Remember that if we are talking
about a donor,

00:36:48.328 --> 00:36:53.945
that means we are effectively
talking about a Lewis base.

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:59.662
And you have to ask yourself
the question in a system that

00:36:59.662 --> 00:37:05.580
has a ligand that can make pi
bonds, are the orbitals on the

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:12.000
metal that have pi symmetry
filled, or are they empty?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.755
And, similarly,
are the pi symmetry orbitals on

00:37:14.755 --> 00:37:17.570
the ligand in question filled or
are they empty?

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.565
And, if you can get all that
right, you will really

00:37:20.565 --> 00:37:24.218
understand what happens in terms
of attenuating t(2g) when you

00:37:24.218 --> 00:37:26.854
add in pi effects.
We have seen that the e(g)

00:37:26.854 --> 00:37:30.268
orbitals of a metal are the d z
squared and d x

00:37:30.268 --> 00:37:33.861
squared minus y squared
that point along the

00:37:33.861 --> 00:37:38.458
axes.
The xz, yz, and xy that point

00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:45.137
between the axes have the
potential to make pi bonds with

00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:49.669
ligands.
And so here is an example of a

00:37:49.669 --> 00:37:55.394
type of ligand that can make pi
bonds to a metal.

00:37:55.394 --> 00:38:01.000
This ligand is NH two minus.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.591
And it can make both sigma and
pi bonds to a metal.

00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:09.045
It is usually the case that if
a ligand is capable of making pi

00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:12.278
bonds to a metal,
it is also capable of making

00:38:12.278 --> 00:38:15.295
sigma bonds.
And so the pi effects are sort

00:38:15.295 --> 00:38:17.738
of mapped onto the sigma
framework.

00:38:17.738 --> 00:38:21.977
And so what we found over here
and here about the sigma only

00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:26.000
case, that will also be true for
pi systems.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.238
But then we are superposing on
that diagram the pi bonds that

00:38:31.238 --> 00:38:35.777
can form in the system.
And the way that NH two minus

00:38:35.777 --> 00:38:41.015
can make both sigma
and pi bonds with a metal is,

00:38:41.015 --> 00:38:44.420
first of all,
it has a lone pair that is

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.000
directed at the metal,
like this.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.097
For forming sigma contacts.
And, if you have six of these

00:38:57.097 --> 00:39:00.463
around a metal,
the situation would be just the

00:39:00.463 --> 00:39:05.000
same as what we derived over
here for the cobalt hexamine.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.023
But this is a planar system.
The sum of the bond angles

00:39:10.023 --> 00:39:15.139
around the nitrogen in systems
like this are 360 degrees

00:39:15.139 --> 00:39:18.395
meaning that,
unlike ammonia itself,

00:39:18.395 --> 00:39:23.232
which is a trigonal pyramid,
this is a planar system.

00:39:23.232 --> 00:39:29.000
And so it has a lone pair
perpendicular to that plane.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.445
I will draw it that way.
It is just a pure p-orbital,

00:39:38.445 --> 00:39:42.976
perpendicular to the plane of
the substituents on that

00:39:42.976 --> 00:39:46.225
nitrogen.
And the way that could make a

00:39:46.225 --> 00:39:50.841
pi bond with the metal is
through simultaneous donation

00:39:50.841 --> 00:39:56.142
above and below the plane of its
substituents on that nitrogen,

00:39:56.142 --> 00:40:00.759
so that this ligand can
interact as a double Lewis base

00:40:00.759 --> 00:40:07.000
with a metal if the metal has
appropriate orbitals available.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.647
And so a situation in which you
might find this would be the

00:40:13.647 --> 00:40:15.000
following.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
An example of such a molecule,
this would be a neutral one.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.948
And what you see is that the
planes of these NH two

00:41:05.948 --> 00:41:10.256
units are lining up with the
coordinate xz,

00:41:10.256 --> 00:41:14.666
yz, and xy Cartesian planes in
the molecule.

00:41:14.666 --> 00:41:20.410
Since each of these ligands is
negatively charged and the

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.333
molecule is neutral,
the chromium is therefore in

00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:31.179
the +6 oxidation state to
balance the six negative charges

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:36.000
on the amido ligands,
we call them.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.487
This is amido.
And so this one,

00:41:38.487 --> 00:41:41.223
in fact, is a d zero case.

00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:45.618
And d zero is an
electron count that is pretty

00:41:45.618 --> 00:41:50.427
typical for the formation of pi
bonds from ligands that can

00:41:50.427 --> 00:41:55.402
donate into the metal center.
If you have d electrons present

00:41:55.402 --> 00:41:59.630
in a system like this,
then you won't have the empty

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:04.937
d-orbitals on the metal that are
necessary to accept bonds formed

00:42:04.937 --> 00:42:09.000
by lone pair donation of this
sort.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.481
The system will become choked
up on itself with too many

00:42:13.481 --> 00:42:15.925
electrons.
Let's see what those

00:42:15.925 --> 00:42:20.000
perturbations will lead to for
our MO diagram.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.195
I am going to focus in on
linear combinations of amide

00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:48.074
lone pair orbitals that,
in fact, have the correct

00:42:48.074 --> 00:42:52.824
symmetry to interact with our
t(2g) set, since that is our pi

00:42:52.824 --> 00:42:56.625
set of orbitals from the d
manifold on the metal.

00:42:56.625 --> 00:42:59.000
So let's look at this.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
This would be d(yz).

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
And then, let me choose --

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.978
We can make a pi bond of this
sort using a linear combination

00:43:45.978 --> 00:43:50.209
that I am mating up together
with the d(yz) orbital.

00:43:50.209 --> 00:43:54.938
And while I have drawn here the
bonding counterpart there,

00:43:54.938 --> 00:43:58.921
of course, will be an
antibonding counterpart for

00:43:58.921 --> 00:44:03.024
that.
Let's draw the one that belongs

00:44:03.024 --> 00:44:04.000
to d(xz).

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
And that will be the one up
top, here.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.916
So what we have is pi bonding
happening here,

00:44:34.916 --> 00:44:39.722
here, here, and here that
corresponds to pi lone paired

00:44:39.722 --> 00:44:42.570
donation into that metal
orbital.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.753
And then, finally,
we have one that involves the

00:44:46.753 --> 00:44:48.000
d(xy).

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.740
And this would be with our
hydrogens up and down,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.548
here and here.
Sorry.

00:45:04.548 --> 00:45:10.446
Up and down in front and in
back like that,

00:45:10.446 --> 00:45:18.310
so that we can make two pi
bonding interactions over here

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:22.523
with this.
There is pi bonding,

00:45:22.523 --> 00:45:28.000
pi bonding, bonding,
bonding.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.333
At this point,
we have gotten to where we can

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:35.727
recognize how there are three
linear combinations of the pi

00:45:35.727 --> 00:45:39.742
lone pairs from these amido
ligands that will have the

00:45:39.742 --> 00:45:43.909
correct symmetry to interact
with the t(2g) set from our

00:45:43.909 --> 00:45:46.636
metal.
There are three more where you

00:45:46.636 --> 00:45:51.106
would just flip one of the two
on each, and those would have

00:45:51.106 --> 00:45:54.742
the correct symmetry to interact
with the px, py,

00:45:54.742 --> 00:45:59.714
and pz orbitals on the metal.
I am not going to draw those

00:45:59.714 --> 00:46:03.387
out since we are focusing on the
d part of our diagram at the

00:46:03.387 --> 00:46:04.000
moment.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.559
And what we will find then,
in the molecular orbital

00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:21.772
diagram for a system of this
sort, is that our d manifold,

00:46:21.772 --> 00:46:25.696
this is our 3d,
4s, 4p, is such that,

00:46:25.696 --> 00:46:33.000
you remember previously t two g
came straight over.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.898
And now, instead,
we are going to see that it

00:46:36.898 --> 00:46:40.708
goes up in energy because what
t(2g) now is,

00:46:40.708 --> 00:46:44.607
it still has a lot of d(xz),
d(yz) and d(xy).

00:46:44.607 --> 00:46:49.746
But now, t two g has
acquired a pi star

00:46:49.746 --> 00:46:54.177
character due to the fact that
we have these linear

00:46:54.177 --> 00:46:58.696
combinations over here.
These are our pi LCs that we

00:46:58.696 --> 00:47:04.278
drew over there that are of the
appropriate symmetry to interact

00:47:04.278 --> 00:47:09.353
with d(xz), d(yz) and d(xy).
And, therefore,

00:47:09.353 --> 00:47:14.317
these that are filled are
stabilized, come down here and

00:47:14.317 --> 00:47:19.552
form a t two g set
that is bonding because those,

00:47:19.552 --> 00:47:24.064
of course, are filled in,
NH two minus.

00:47:24.064 --> 00:47:28.758
And, if the metal has an empty
t two g set,

00:47:28.758 --> 00:47:33.000
you see that we do get three pi
bonds.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.141
t two g now gives us
pi antibonds.

00:47:36.141 --> 00:47:40.452
This is being mapped on the
sigma framework that is the same

00:47:40.452 --> 00:47:44.105
as what we have right here for
the cobalt hexamine,

00:47:44.105 --> 00:47:47.173
so that above t(2g) we will
have the e(g)*.

00:47:47.173 --> 00:47:51.410
And will now recognize that
e(g) is sigma star

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:55.210
rather than pi star,
so it is more strongly

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:59.301
destabilized due to the greater
overlap considerations of

00:47:59.301 --> 00:48:03.392
forming sigma bonds versus the
side to side overlap of pi

00:48:03.392 --> 00:48:10.693
bonds.
And the key observation here is

00:48:10.693 --> 00:48:14.000
that pi donors --

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.180
-- decrease the magnitude of
delta O by raising the energy of

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.198
t(2g), by making t(2g) pi* in
character.

00:48:30.198 --> 00:48:34.628
Antibonding.
We can see, not only that t(2g)

00:48:34.628 --> 00:48:39.778
should be raised up,
but that mapping that onto our

00:48:39.778 --> 00:48:44.929
full sigma framework diagram,
delta O is shrinking.

00:48:44.929 --> 00:48:51.007
We still have our six sigma
bonds between the NH two

00:48:51.007 --> 00:48:55.231
ligands and the metal.
They are down here,

00:48:55.231 --> 00:49:01.000
just not drawn.
It is the same as up here.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.737
And now, we have three
additional pi bonds.

00:49:03.737 --> 00:49:07.321
There are another three
additional pi bonds that you can

00:49:07.321 --> 00:49:11.232
draw because we do have six of
these NH two minus

00:49:11.232 --> 00:49:13.513
ligands.
And then, the corresponding

00:49:13.513 --> 00:49:17.162
antibonding orbitals involve 4p.
And they are way up here

00:49:17.162 --> 00:49:19.378
somewhere in energy and very
empty.

00:49:19.378 --> 00:49:23.354
Since this was a d zero
case, what we have is that you

00:49:23.354 --> 00:49:27.199
have we pairs of electrons on
six NH two minus's

00:49:27.199 --> 00:49:30.849
that are down here in this
manifold of metal ligand sigma

00:49:30.849 --> 00:49:33.000
and pi bonding.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.864
And so we have 12 pairs of
electrons down here that

00:49:40.864 --> 00:49:44.015
describe the sigma plus pi
bonding between the metal and

00:49:44.015 --> 00:49:46.421
the ligands.
And then you come here to your

00:49:46.421 --> 00:49:49.802
d manifold, these are empty
because this is a d zero

00:49:49.802 --> 00:49:53.125
case, because I happened to
choose chromium in the six plus

00:49:53.125 --> 00:49:56.447
oxidation here.
So it is a d zero case,

00:49:56.447 --> 00:50:00.000
and we wouldn't have any
electrons to put in here.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.217
But, under these circumstances,
in order to get color in a

00:50:04.217 --> 00:50:07.695
system like this,
you would have to be promoting

00:50:07.695 --> 00:50:12.356
an electron from down here from
these pi bonds probably into the

00:50:12.356 --> 00:50:16.130
d manifold, for example.
And what we have seen here,

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:20.569
namely that pi donors decrease
delta O should give you a clue

00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:24.195
as to what is going on with
chloride and fluoride.

00:50:24.195 --> 00:50:28.190
Since those have small values
of delta O, they lie at a

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:33.000
position of weakness in the
spectrochemical series.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.641
And in the converse,
that ligands like cyanide and

00:50:36.641 --> 00:50:41.248
especially carbon monoxide are
very high in the spectrochemical

00:50:41.248 --> 00:50:44.146
series because they are pi acid
ligands.

00:50:44.146 --> 00:50:48.382
And this is something you will
be getting more information

00:50:48.382 --> 00:50:52.048
about in recitation this week.
See you all on Wednesday.
