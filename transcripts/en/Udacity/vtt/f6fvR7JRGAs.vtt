00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Okay. So here's our mass hanging from the ceiling on a spring with the spring constant K.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If I started shaking up and down and oscillating, we know it will move with a certain period.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
How do we adjust that period? Well let me first tell you the force law of a spring.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And to do this, it actually may be better to think of the spring being horizontal.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's our spring at its normal happy equilibrium position.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're going to call the equilibrium position x = 0.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now let's see, when we stretched the spring a bit and when we moved the mass

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
back to let's say here to some position x.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well the spring exerts a force backwards back towards the equilibrium.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The force of a spring is somehow negative. If I pulled to the right, it pulls to the left.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And in fact, if I pull further to the right it pulls harder to the left.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you ever pulled on a spring you can tell pulling it a little bit is easy.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Pulling it more is more difficult so actually the force is proportional to how much you stretch it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And what's the constant of proportionality? Well, that's why we have this letter K.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is the force on a spring and we know from our good buddy Newton

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that forces cause accelerations.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In this case, the spring will accelerate this way due to the spring force.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Why don't we replace this F with this -Kx?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Well in the case we get ma = -Kx and so a = -K/m&lt;i&gt;x.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Now I hoped you followed along so far. The acceleration is equal to -K/m&lt;i&gt;x.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The reason why I said I hoped you followed along is because unfortunately now

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I have to do something that I hate to do.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I have to just tell you something and that something is that whenever you can

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
write a force law like this that the acceleration is equal to minus something times x

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
times its displacement from its equilibrium, well it turns out that this something

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is always equal to ω².

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And remember omega is our radians per second, our angular frequency.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now let's say you have a spring with a spring constant of 50 N/m.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And let's say you want your period to be equal to 1 sec, and remember T = 2π/ω.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And why do we want 1 second? Well we're trying to design a clock here.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Of course we want a 1-second period. We want it tick tock, tick tock.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The question is with this spring and this desired period, what mass do we need?

00:02:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer here in kg.
