&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.860
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Hello everyone.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.510
Can you hear me?

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.150
Okay. Hi. I'm Betsy
Peterson and I'm the director

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.340
of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.640
And on behalf of the Library
and the AFC staff I want

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.750
to welcome you here today.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.820
This is the latest in our
Benjamin Botkin lecture series,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.750
and the Benjamin Botkin
lecture series allows the AFC

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.380
to do a number of things.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.040 position:56%
I mean most importantly to highlight
the work of leading folklorists,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.650 position:56%
ethnomusicologists, oral historians,
and other cultural specialists,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.030
enabling them to share their
latest research with all of us.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.360
But for the center and for
the library it also helps us

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.550
in terms of our acquisitions.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.970
These lectures are tape
recorded and do become part

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.780
of our collections here at the
library, and will ultimately be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.730
on the website and be webcasts.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.900
So with all of that said,
and bringing up webcasts,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.330
if you have a cell phone on
right now, please turn it off.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.560
I would appreciate it.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.510
And today I have the honor

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.580
of introducing the distinguished
folklorist and longtime friend

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.680
of the American Folklife
Center, Bert Feintuch.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.130
Doctor Feintuch is a professor of
folklore in English and director

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.370
of the Center for the Humanities
at the University of New Hampshire.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.110
Under his leadership the
center at the University

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.090
of New Hampshire has built
a significant endowment,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.600 position:56%
developed numerous interdisciplinary
programs, supported hundreds

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.910
of faculty research projects,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.760
become home to several
notable undergraduate programs,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.820
and has developed a study
abroad program in Ghana.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.120
And that's not all.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.570
He does more.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.320
As a folklorist, Bert has
published on traditional music,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.710
cultural conservation,
and other numerous topics

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.630
in traditional and
vernacular culture.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.480
From 1990 to 1995 he
served as the editor of the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.580
"Journal of American Folklore."

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.690
He has also done extensive
ethnographic research

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.500
in traditional music
cultures in Great Britain,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.380
the United States, and Canada.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.770
And he is particularly
well known for his research

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.250
on the traditional music and
culture of Northumberland

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.230
and Cape Breton Island, and he is
also a musician in his own right.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.660
With David Waters he published
the critically acclaimed

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.650
"Encyclopedia of New England."

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.930
And his 2010 book "In The
Blood, Cape Breton Conversations

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.200
on Culture" won an independent
publisher book award.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.220
His latest book, "Talking New
Orleans Music" was recently

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.020
published by the university
press of Mississippi.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.250
And there continues to be more.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.480
Bert has also produced
recordings for Smithsonian Folkways

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.320
and for the Rounder label.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.690 position:56%
He serves on the Library of Congress
prestige's national recording

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.320
preservation board.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.410
And for five years he represented
the American Folklorist Society

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.060
at the meeting of the World
Intellectual Property Organization.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.790
He's been awarded numerous
grants and fellowships

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.650
by the National Endowment for the
Humanities, National Endowment

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.550
for the Arts, the American
Council of Learned Societies,

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.060

New Hampshire Humanities Council,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.720
the New Hampshire State
Council on the Arts,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.390
and other agencies
and organizations.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.480
Are you tired yet, Bert?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.810
In addition, in 2012 Bert was
elected as one of the fellows

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.600
of the American Folklore Society.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.850
Today I'm delighted to introduce
Bert who is going to be talking

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.880
about cultural integrity
and local music,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.540
Cape Breton fiddle,
New Orleans funk.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.510
So please give Bert
Feintuch a warm welcome.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.530
[ Applause ]

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.830
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Thank you.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.520
That's -- It's great to see old
friends and colleagues here.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.710
It feels like a real honor to be
-- have been invited to give a talk

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.010
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.170 position:56%
I want to thank Nancy Gross [assumed
spelling] in particular for the --

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.530
all the work that she put
in to the logistics of this.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.150
And again such a treat to see some

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.010
of my fairly old friends
and colleagues too.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.610
I also want to recognize
my significant other,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.110
Jeanie Thomas [assumed
spelling], is here,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.870
a folklorist from the University
of -- from Utah State University.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.480
And Jeanie kind of rode shotgun
on a lot of the fieldwork

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.110
that is the basis of what I'll
be talking about this afternoon.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.290
Speaking of field work, let's see.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.700
Get myself organized here.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.280
Speaking of field work, for me
probably the thing I like best

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.680
about being a folklorist
is doing field work.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.450
It's something I love to do.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.340
I -- Sitting down with a
musician who I admire or,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.820
to use a New Orleans term, a
culture bearer who I admire,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.040
with a recording device on the
table between us, is often sort of,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.810
you know, one of the
highlights of my life.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.550
And I also come to realize
after being in this field

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.550
for a very long time that, you
know, academic ideas come and go,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.760
but the materials that we create
doing field work become part

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.400
of an enduring record and
that seems to me to be,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.630
if I think about any significance
to what I've been doing

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.220
over the years -- That seems
to be what is most significant.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.260 position:56%
I've done field work all over the
place, it feels like for decades now

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.190 position:56%
in the United Kingdom, in the
United States, and various locations

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.820
on sort of both ends of
Canada and British Columbia

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.810
and Canadian Maritimes too.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.220 position:56%
And, as I think back, I realize
that what seems to draw me to places

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.680
where I do ethnographic field work
is that these are often places

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.520
that I've come to think

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.930
of as musical hotspots
or creative hotspots.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.920
There's something that sets these
places off from other places

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.920
when it comes to the vitality
and significance of local music.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.440
They're often places where
music is deeply rooted,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.440
where it's very much valued,
where it's well integrated

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.580
and connected to identity.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.700
You know, for roots music
people, if I say Chicago,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.420
you -- Something comes to mind.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.240
You think blues.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.250
Chicago is a great example of that.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.100
If I say Omaha, maybe less so.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.920
For instance, not that there's
not, I'm sure, terrific local music

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.420
in Omaha, but it never kind
of rose to the kind of level

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.150
of public awareness and
appreciation that some

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.220
of these other sort
of hotspots have done.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.260 position:56%
The more I spend time in these
sorts of places talking to musicians

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.720
and culture bearers and citizens,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.650
the more I see some
commonalities despite all the kinds

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.620
of obvious differences too.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.540
And so today I want to talk
about two musical hotspots,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.800
seemingly very different places
where I've done field work.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.180
I talk about Cape Breton in Nova
Scotia and about New Orleans.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:49.480
Do you know Cape Breton at all?

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.930
Some of you probably do.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.440
Yeah. Good.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.040
Good. So I'm realizing, in fact,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.060
that this year is not
only the 50th anniversary

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.910
of "Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club," man,

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.750
but I think it's the
20th anniversary

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.120
of my first trip to Cape Breton.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.180
And I can't tell you how
many times I've been there.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.460
I'm not hearing about that
as much on NPR, though.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.310
So Cape Breton has been a sort
of long running obsession for me.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:24.630
New Orleans a little bit
less so in that the work

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.880
in New Orleans I've tried to focus
more on control and not allow it

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.450
to become that kind of obsession
that Cape Breton has formed for me.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.510
Both have led to various
publications

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.360
and some sound recordings
and things like that,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.370
and I'm showing you these book
covers really because I want

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.650
to acknowledge the fact that these
have been collaborative projects

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.420
that I've had the privilege
of working

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.490
with a really fine
photographer and an old friend,

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.370
a guy named Gary Sampson
[assumed spelling] who I know

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.990
from New Hampshire who in fact
was just named artist laureate

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:57.000
for the state of New Hampshire.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.590
So, you know, what drew me to
these very different places?

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.390
You know one is just sort
of sheer self indulgence

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.350
in that there are places that
produce music that I love.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.270
And they're also places where
I've come to understand, you know,

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.830
people have the kind of
good fortune to be able

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.600
to dance to their own music.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.900
That is I'd like to say they're
not people who don't know Beyonce

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.820
or whatever, but they're people
too who have the sort of privilege

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.960 position:56%
of having come up in a place where
the local music is still very strong

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:33.980
and vital and somehow lives
alongside the more industrial more

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.920
popular music that
we all experience.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:41.000
These are also places where culture
is in the air, I like to say.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.360
That there's often a kind of
public conversation about the value

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.870
and significance of culture
or music and its importance

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.530
to the integrity of local life.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.990
They're places where
people see music, in fact,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.870
as integral to a good life, where
it stands for a kind of wholeness

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.070
of integrity in local culture.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.970
So I hope you note that I'm using
these words integral, integrity,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.310
and so forth, and this is in
part because I want to try

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.290
to develop an idea that
I've been thinking about,

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:19.040
this idea of cultural integrity
which I work my way toward.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.030
But first let me talk to
you about Cape Breton.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.050
Cape Breton is an island
that is part

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.500
of the Canadian province
of Nova Scotia.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.930
I feel very accomplished in
PowerPoint that I managed to get

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.260
that arrow on this
screen, by the way.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.070
That was a first for me.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.310
So it's an island just
about 4,000 square miles.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.720
That makes it like times --

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.760
almost three times the
size of Rhode Island,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.220
but 130,000 people there
now and steadily declining.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:52.570
The population has been declining
precipitously for decades now.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:59.070
It was settled -- The largest group
of people to move to that island,

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:01.760
the largest sort of contingent
of settlers, were people who came

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.100
from the highlands and
western islands of Scotland.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.360
They came in the late
1700s through about 1847

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:15.000
or so when the population
movement ended.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.500
They got there and they found a
thin scattering of native people

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.560
or first nations people, as
Canadians say, a thin scattering

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.820
of francophones, French
speaking people who were there

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.350
as a consequence of early
French fishing and exploration.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.160
And some Anglophones too
who were also there in part

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.350
because of the fishing and
in part because loyalists

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.600
from New England tended
to move north and east

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.220
when things weren't
going so well for them.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.270
And it is a musical hotbed.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:54.910
It is centered on the fiddle.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.860
The fiddle is often accompanied

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.340
by [inaudible] a very
distinctive style.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.930
And these days too we're
seeing a resurgence of interest

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.930
in the highland pipes too which
is a very different scene.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.710
If you think of highland pipes you
think of people in kilts marching

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.430
in formation or in a
kind of military way.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.070
At Cape Breton the pipers sit down
and they play them for dancing

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:19.960
and it's a much different way of
approaching the instrument too.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.620
And it's dance music.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.980
People dance to the
music in local halls.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.880
When I first came to
Cape Breton 20 years ago,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.130
especially on the western
side of the island

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.490
which is Inverness
County it seemed to me

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.070 position:56%
that the music was just every place.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:43.240
I felt really astonished at
how present and vital it was.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.300
There were dances just about
every night of the week.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.400
This was summer when things
are more active there.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.430
You could sit in a fast food
place and the radio would be on

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:55.730
and you'd heard a country song

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.030
and then you'd hear a
local fiddle player.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.680
I mean hear another country song.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.980
Something like that.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.250
You'd -- There were
festivals every weekend.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.160
If you got lucky you got invited
to a house party where people sat

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.230
and took turns playing for
the assembled crew of people.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:14.150 position:56%
The local newspaper which on that
side of the island is a weekly paper

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.440
in the summer devoted more pages to
coverage of music than to sports.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.990
It was really quite astonishing.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.450
I think I like this crowd.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:32.400 position:56%
At one time I went to an event early
on where people bought tickets.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.200
They actually paid for tickets

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.830
to hear an ethnomusicologist
interview two older musicians,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.880
and that's when I realized
I'd found paradise.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.980
I want to show you a kind
of blurry video from one

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.390
of those community dances.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.600
Going to try to link to YouTube.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.660
I'll tell you that this is in the
community of [inaudible] Village

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:01.490
and this is a kind of
typical venue for a dance.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:06.130
It is -- There are two kinds of
community dances in Cape Breton,

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:08.220
and that has to do
with the liquor laws.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.040
In Nova Scotia you have to
be 19 to be able to drink.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.200
The dances where they sell
beer or other alcohol rather

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.640
than just share it in the parking
lot are called adult dances.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.890
And then there are also family
dances where no alcohol is sold.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:27.080
This is an adult dance, but I
think you'll notice that even

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.250
in this case it's sort

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.070
of a multigenerational
sort of experience as well.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.420
In fact, you're just
going to see the dancing.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.850
You're not going to
see the musician.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.740
I don't have time to
find a good clip,

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.980
but I should tell you
about the musician.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.070
The fiddle player is named Rodney
McDonald who's a step dancer

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:48.730
and a fiddle player and a member
of a musical dynasty, a family --

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.590
His first recording, which
he did with a cousin,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:57.680
they did a family tribute on 44
other musicians in the family tree.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.340 position:56%
And at 34 Rodney was elected premier
of the province of Nova Scotia

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.090
which is equivalent to governor
so they had a fiddle player

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.900
and step dancer as governor.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.190
This is post his time.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.850
[Inaudible] he came home, and
plays music and works in culture.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.520
So assuming this link will
work, we'll just take a --

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:21.700
We'll look briefly at a dance.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.790
[ Music ]

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.630
Worked fine when we tested it.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.510
Stop and start it.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.950
[ Music ]

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.390
One more.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.920
I hope you're liking it so far.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.330
John Divvy [assumed
spelling] thoughts?

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:14.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's just
the internet connection.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.120
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Just [inaudible].

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.920
Why don't I talk --

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:29.220
[ Music ]

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:35.120
Well, let's say you get the idea.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:43.530
Okay? The -- Cape Bretoners like
to tell a story about their music.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:50.750 position:56%
They like to say that because of
the history of Scottish immigration,

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.520
thousands of Scotts, many
of them Gaelic speakers,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.190
many of them Catholics,
coming to Cape Breton,

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:01.920
and then in the history the island
having been relatively isolated

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:07.990
for a very long time, the story
is that the music there --

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.750
that the island became a
kind of archive or museum

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.030
of older Scottish repertoire
and performance practice.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.830
Even today you get
this thing where people

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.630
in Scotland invite Cape Breton
fiddlers to come to Scotland

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.830
to teach them to play
Scottish music.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.030
It's really -- The story is, at
best, you know, partially true

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.240
because I mean it's living,
breathing music, and it has changed

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.000
and grown and expanded and
adapted and so forth to stay vital.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.480
I don't think it sounds today like
it would have sounded in, you know,

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.920
1780 when people arrived at all.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.710 position:56%
But it still is striking in its
connection to the old Scottish music

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.790
and the genres of tunes that are
played and the style and so forth.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.650
And it's also striking to
me that this is a place

00:17:56.650 --> 00:18:00.130
where local music is
locked in to community life

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.420
and community memory too.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:08.460
So it really is a kind of paradise
for someone of my interests.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.860
It's a place where people
come together around music.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.530
It's a place where music is part of
a glue that holds people together

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:21.960
in the community, connects them to
each other as well as to a sense

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.380
of the past that's still
very present there too.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.250
Now it's not an easy place.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.420
The economy has been
lousy for decades.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.760
It was once actually an industrial
powerhouse thanks to coal fields

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.880
and iron mills, but
that's long gone.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.380
And the economy has really
been bad for decades.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.100
High unemployment.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.910
Significant out migration.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.050
Especially a generation ago
there tended to be a lot

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.670 position:56%
of really big families there because
of the Catholic culture and the --

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.600 position:56%
I've met any number of people who've
said, you know, "I was 1 of 11 kids

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.310
and I'm the lucky one
who got to stay home.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.940
Everybody else is in Alberta."

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.050
They used to come to Boston,
but things change, you know.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.400
Seem to go to western Canada too.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.250 position:56%
But, you know, the interesting thing
is survey after survey there shows

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:15.410
that people who stay talk about
how satisfied they are with life,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.120
that there's a kind of unusually
high degree of satisfaction

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.010
with life in this place
where things are not so easy.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:29.180
So, you know, I have done some
thinking about how to think

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.810
about this and what to call it.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.790
And I want to talk a
little bit about that too.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:41.660
I kept thinking there about how
integral the music is to life.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.760
And to a sort of understanding
of identity

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.940
and of cultural distinctiveness.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.690
And I started to myself
and now a little bit more

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.640
in public using the
term cultural integrity.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:20:00.260
Another way to say this is I
eventually came to the idea --

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.700
I'm getting a little
out of sequence here.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.000
Let's go there.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.840
Eventually came to the idea that
all of this, that is the music,

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.960 position:56%
its historical and cultural context,
the role it plays in communities --

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.000
And what I lately hear is a kind
of anxiety about culture too.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.120
That is a fear that the music is
going away, that it's in decline.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:25.160
That all of it can be embraced by
this idea of cultural integrity.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.570
I like the sound of that.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.500
You know, I like the sound
of saying cultural integrity.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.350
And for a while I thought maybe
I'd made it up, but it's not so.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.350 position:56%
I mean you know Google tells me that
I'm not the first, but it also shows

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.280
that nobody has really kind of
written about that term and thought

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:47.420 position:56%
about it very much, but it's used
sometimes to imply that to be secure

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.150
in one's culture and in one's
community is a good thing.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.290
My friend, the ethnomusicologist
Jeff Titan, pointed out to me

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.650
when we were talking about this

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:01.640
that some environmental
scholars use the term integrity.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.630
And I want to look at
something here with you.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:09.090 position:56%
This is from a retired
environmentalist from the University

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.840
of Toronto named Henry
Regier who's written

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.840
about what he calls
ecological integrity.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.230
I guess I should read it.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.830
He says, "A living system
exhibits integrity if when subject

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.410
to disturbance it sustains
an organizing self correcting

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.430
capability to recover toward
an end state that's normal

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.300
and good for that system."

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.660
And that really got me thinking.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.470 position:56%
Culture is of course a living system

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.340
in which components
interact with each other.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:47.530
And it seems to me that one way
of thinking about this is thanks

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:51.510
to Regier that culture integrity
involves a kind of resilience

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:58.220 position:56%
and an ability to sustain what local
people think of as normal and good.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.410
So I think when I use this term
cultural integrity I'm talking

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:09.480
about the desire to maintain what a
community values, the local desire

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.500 position:56%
to maintain what a community values.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.340
I think it's about the sort of
wholeness and interconnectedness

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.020
of life in places like this

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.000
and I don't think every
place is like this.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.200
And also about what I think of as
a sort of ethic of community life,

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.450
the idea, the local idea, that
there's something very good

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.480
and that life is good
in our relationships

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.510
to each other in this community.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.870 position:56%
Yet another way to think about it is

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.300
when I say cultural integrity
then I'm talking about continuity

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.020
and cohesion and resilience.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.810
So I want to talk about how
these play out in Cape Breton,

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:55.280
and then I'll move to talk
about New Orleans as well.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.580
So I want to talk first

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.710
about maintaining what
the community values.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:04.630
The first example I want to
use is to talk a little bit

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:08.130
about language revitalization
in Cape Breton.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:13.580
All these Scotts who arrived
who were 70 years or so,

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.950
many of them were Gaelic speakers
and Gaelic was once the language

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.340
of community life in some
Cape Breton communities

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.590
up through the 1960s or so.

00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:24.940
Some of these places were
primarily Gaelic speaking.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.220
In 1900 there were 85,000
first language Gaelic speakers

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.520
in Cape Breton.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.680
Now there are maybe 200, if that.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.980
There actually was a time

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.890
when Gaelic was Canada's
third most common language,

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.860
most commonly spoken
language, as well.

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.020
And these days we're
seeing a lot of interest

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.870
in language revitalization
in Cape Breton.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.170
Government programs.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.470
Local programs.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.780
Local people teaching
music -- I'm sorry.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.080
Teaching language.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.380
And so forth.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.890
A lot of interest in trying
to bring back the language.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.910
And when you hear people
talk about language,

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:02.590
talk about Gaelic language,
they're often talking about music

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:04.850
in the same breath as
well because music is seen

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.970
as somehow carrying
some of the same values

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.590
that the language carried too,
the same sort of cultural values

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:15.810
as well, and is seen as
standing for a way of life.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.340
So we're beginning to see
programs to sort of maintain

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.770
and encourage the language as well.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.140
By the way, in the French community

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.100
in Cape Breton they've done a great
job bringing the language back

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:31.200
in the most densely
populated francophone area.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.620
You can now choose to go to
school in French or in English.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.450
They raised the funds and
built a community radio station

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:39.750
that broadcasts in French,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.590
and they've done pretty
remarkable things.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:48.460
So as part of this maintaining what
the community values we see the

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.950
development of institutions
and venues and so forth,

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.920
including what you see here, the
Celtic Music Interpretive Center

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.440
and the small community
of [inaudible]

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:06.860
which is supported locally by
golf tournaments and more formally

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.630
by government funds, by provincial
government funds as well.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.000
And has a mission that
sounds a little bit

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.640
like the American Folklife
Center in that it's to preserve

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:21.980
and to present the Celtic music
traditions of Cape Breton Island.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.400
And, you know, these days
scholars tend to write

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.260
about institutionalizing as a
kind of distancing and as a kind

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.580
of disturbance and
find sort of ironies

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.050
in the ways it doesn't entirely
reflect older ways of doing things.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:37.500
I don't think that's
true in Cape Breton.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.450
I think in Cape Breton people

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.500
in the local communities
have embraced these efforts

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.620
and sort of made them their own.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.470
It's amazing that this place
that you see here which has a bar

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.660 position:56%
and restaurant in it is just viewed
as a kind of community resource now.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.610
It hasn't really been seen as sort
of changing anything or disturbing

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:06.150
or pulling away from the
local ways of doing things.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:09.050
It's more a sort of
response to the worry

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:11.730
about losing things that matter.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.930
And one thing that I think is
really striking in Cape Breton is

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:20.460
that people have somehow made
clear to each other what matters

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.220
when it comes to community life.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:28.740
And they've figured out in some
examples, as in this one, I think,

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.030
ways to begin to make
that happen too.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:36.720
I want to play you an audio
clip from an interview I did

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.080
with a CBC radio journalist
based in Cape Breton.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.430
She does a five day
a week local program.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:49.270
The website describes her program
as a lively and informative blend

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.850
of news designed to put Cape
Breton listeners back in touch

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.600
with their communities at
the end of the work day

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.750 position:56%
which I think is a very sort of Cape
Breton way of expressing things.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:02.080
She'll talk a little bit
about this sort of sense

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:04.710
of community in Cape Breton.

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:11.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That might
be if community's a thing

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:17.900
that really I think defines the
Cape Breton experience right now.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:26.250
There's a social -- There's a
glue that ties people together,

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:31.140
people who have been here for
five or six generations and people

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.270
who have come in very recently.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:40.850
And it has to do with
I think declaring

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.750
to one another what's
unique and what's important.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:48.050
And that seems to be
defined very clearly here.

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:55.270
It might be because this has been
a have not region for so long

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:59.450
that people really know the value
of gathering in a fire hall.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.450
They really know the value of
being pleasant to the person

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.350
across the counter
at the post office.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.160
It manifests itself in a thousand
different ways, but at the end

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:16.940
of the day it's just in the air.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.290
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: So talk a
little bit about the wholeness

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.010
and interconnectedness part too.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.310
Think about this.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:25.690
People in these little
communities get together for music.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:28.450
At the very least,
they're entertained by it.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.290 position:56%
Sometimes they're transported by it.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.590
But they're also building
connection when they're doing this,

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.860
and there's kind of a
complex reciprocity involved.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.650
I'm thinking now about
another community dance,

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.240
this one in a little town
called West [inaudible]

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.290
which locally is viewed
as kind of the heart

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:51.140
of Gaelic speaking Cape Breton,
of Gaelic culture in Cape Breton.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:55.200
So this is a weekly dance
that goes year round.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.050
It helps musicians.

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:01.880
It -- The revenue supports
the community recreation hall.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.920
And it also supports a
community softball team as well.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.950
So you go to this dance
and there's this kind

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.240
of physical connection
with your neighbors.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.930
I mean I can't think of other
times when I put my arms

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.840
around my neighbors, for instance.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:22.070
Musicians are paid well so they're
able to continue in their art.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.780 position:56%
This is the first generation, by the
way, where we're really seeing a lot

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.450
of younger musicians thinking they
can make a living as a musician.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.610
Before that everyone had a day job.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:34.260
But so the musicians are paid
well to continue in their art.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.270
The hall gets fixed
up and maintained.

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.360
And the ball players get
to travel to tournaments.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.130
So music helps integrate
the culture.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.600
It unites disparate elements.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.900
Music and sports.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.200
Music and identity.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.500
Music and history.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.040
For the community's benefit.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.210 position:56%
I'll speak briefly about the last of
those three points that I mentioned

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.130 position:56%
in talking about cultural integrity,
about the goodness of life

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.010
or this ethic of community.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.550
Culture matters to
people in Cape Breton.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:10.740
The language revival is in
part because people believe

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.070 position:56%
that Gaelic stands for a way of life

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.710
that is slipping away not
only for a language itself.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:21.350
And, as I say, people see the
music as being the heart of that.

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:24.880
One way to compliment a fiddle
player is to say she has a lot

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.980
of Gaelic in her playing because
the local story is Gaelic is --

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.110
has a kind of guttural
sound and the style

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.600
of playing the fiddle
there likes a lot of kind

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.090
of roughness in the music as well.

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:43.150
And what we're seeing now is to
the creation of organizations

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:47.010
to transmit culture
to younger people.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:53.460
Often trying to involve their
families as well and often trying

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.570
to talk about not only
how to play music,

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.140
but sort of what it means
culturally, what it means for life.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.940
And I'll play you, with a
luck, a bit of a video clip

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.010
about one of those organizations.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:25.450
[ Music ]

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.120 position:56%
It was so good when we tried it out.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:34.570
This is an organization that is --

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:40.030
runs out of the Celtic [inaudible]
Center and runs on the other side

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.670
of the island out of
another facility

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.170
and puts young people
with master musicians.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.630
For a time they're making
the parents come as well.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.490
I think the parents needed to
participate in these events,

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.780
that that was a way of sort

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.210
of reinforcing the cultural
transmission aspect of this.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:06.510
I guess you wouldn't expect our
Library of Congress to have --

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:25.320
[ Music ]

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:32.870
Well, I hope you get the idea.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:38.030
So Cape Breton is a place
that faces serious challenges,

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.450
economic and cultural.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.270
And I'd like to suggest that
it's the cultural integrity

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:47.170
of community life there that's
the foundation of the idea

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.390
that life is somehow better there
which many people will tell you,

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.930
and point out that music is at
the heart of the good life in some

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.760
of those communities if
you talk to local people.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.930
And finally tell you that I can't
tell you how many tourists I've met

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:05.690
who come there because the
scenery is spectacular.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.720
It's a place that keeps being
named by travel magazines as one

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.260
of the most beautiful
places in the world.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.980
But so people come for
scenery, happen on a dance,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:21.710
and leave talking much more about
culture than about scenery as well.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:28.220
So the really weird thing, though,
is that the more time I spend

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:32.530
in New Orleans the more I
think about Cape Breton.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.820
And my friend Andy Wallace
is nodding his head.

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.920
So I can't be too crazy,
I guess, but --

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.440
And thinking about that clip you
heard from the radio announcer,

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.870
I want to play you a clip to get us
started thinking about New Orleans,

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.320
a clip from an interview
with Charmaine Neville.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.920
Charmaine, a member of one of the
musical dynasties in New Orleans.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.350
Some of you will know the Neville
brothers as one of the major bands

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.600
that kind of broke out of New
Orleans, and she is the daughter

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.500
of Charles Neville the saxophone
player with the Neville brothers.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.590
And she is a very highly regarded
jazz singer in New Orleans

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.970
who also kind of describes
herself as --

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:19.840
says, "I don't like
the label jazz singer.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.800
I'm an eclectic singer."

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.640
But here she is talking a
little bit about New Orleans

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.840
and you tell me if
you hear -- Whoops.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:30.240
Any parallels to Wendy [inaudible].

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:35.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I tell you, you knew
everybody because it wasn't just --

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:45.180
You know, I have to tell people all
the time New Orleans is the biggest

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:48.060
little neighborhood in the world.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.670
And everybody knew everybody.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:35:03.300
You knew everybody's mama, and
they had their dogs, their cats,

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.660
you know, their [inaudible].

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.720
You knew everybody.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:17.900
So -- And if you did anything,
everybody knew what you did,

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.200
and people would [inaudible]
the policemen would whip you,

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.500
the [inaudible] would whip you.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:36.040
You know, and then you got home
and you got another whipping.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.340
So, you know.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:45.050
And you knew that you had
to speak to everybody.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:49.230
Like I remember one time I
walked past Ms [inaudible] house

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:54.130
and I didn't say, "Good
afternoon" or whatever.

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:59.450
By the time I got home everybody
in the neighborhood knew

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:03.350
that I hadn't spoken to her, and
I had to go -- I got a whipping.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.570
I had to go back to her house and
say, "Good evening, Ms [inaudible].

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.870
How are you doing?"

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.250
You know, so that's
how we were raised.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.100
You know? Everybody looked out
for everybody else, you know.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:17.570
You knew if somebody was
having problems or, you know.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.190
So it was always like that.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.740 position:56%
That's just, you know -- I mean
things are different now with the --

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:25.040
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: So, you know,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.120
New Orleans is a place
that's famous for its music.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:33.330 position:56%
Talking about musical hotspots in
the United States it's hard to think

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:37.640
of a place more famous
for its music.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:42.330
It's famous, everyone knows,
for its role historically

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.680
in the development of jazz.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.250
It's also very significant --

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:53.100
a very significant player in the
development of rhythm and blues,

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.790
in rock and roll and funk,

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.930
and it just keeps kind
of churning out music.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:04.550
You know, the contemporary brass
band scene there is remarkable.

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:11.670
Contemporary forms of hip hop,
distinctively New Orleans forms

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:15.620
of hip hop where you can
hear echoes of brass bands,

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.650
for instance, quite amazing.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.150
People call it the Big Easy, but
it's not an easy place really.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:25.690 position:56%
It's a place that has deep problems
with poverty, with an infrastructure

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.790 position:56%
that doesn't work very well, with --

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.710
It's still in recovery
from when the levees broke,

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:35.110
some parts more than
others in recovery.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.410
High crime.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:42.700
And more and more big issues having
to do with gentrification too.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:48.090
I originally thought, "What could
be more different from Cape Breton

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:50.900
than this large black
majority city?"

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:56.930
And I was remembering, you know,
one of my Cape Breton interviewees

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:02.880
about my age telling me that she
had not seen a person of color

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.720
in her life until she was 17.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:11.120
These seem like quite different
kinds of places, but the more I go

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.880
to New Orleans the more I
start hearing parallels.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:20.080
I start hearing people talk about
how much they value community.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.820
I hear about how much
culture is valued.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.150
I hear about valuing heritage.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:29.260
I hear an anxiety about
maintaining those things.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:35.520
And more and more if you go
and pay attention you realize

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.570
that there's a public conversation
kind of raging about maintaining

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.970
that music and that culture.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:47.130
What I want to do now is actually
read to you some interview clips

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.760
from interviews I've
done with people

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:55.730
that are short interview clips,
and I want to start with someone

00:38:55.730 --> 00:39:02.090 position:56%
who I bet has spoken in this room or
performed next door in the Coolidge

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:03.390
with Doctor Michael White.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:06.540
Michael is a leading traditional
jazz player, clarinetist,

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.860
and a researcher on New Orleans
music, has a PhD in Spanish,

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:17.380
but actually holds an endowed share
in black music and black culture

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.980
at one of the universities
in New Orleans.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.190
And he said to me, "If you
look at New Orleans culture,

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:27.280
its branches are the same tree.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.550
We're doing the same
things for the same reasons.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.500
It's just that they come
out in different ways.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.800
Which is beautiful.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.720
I mean it's hard to
believe that an urban area

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.550
in America even today can have
unique traditions like we have.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.860
Social parades.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.160
Jazz funerals.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.460
Brass bands."

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.200
[Inaudible] still have meaning
and vitality in the community,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.800
although that meaning
may have changed

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:59.050
and outside influences have
altered the course or direction

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:00.670
of some of them somewhat.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.490
But they're still very important
parts of New Orleans culture today.

00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:04.840
It's incredible.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.230
Charmaine Neville talking about
growing up in the Ninth Ward --

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.250
The Ninth Ward in her childhood
was a working class African

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.550
American community.

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:12.850
It's one of the two
parts of the city

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.150
that has come back least
of all from Katrina.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.450
Said succinctly, "Growing up in
the Lower Ninth was fabulous.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:16.750
I mean everybody was a musician."

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.050
And from Deacon John
Moore -- Deacon John.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.350
Interesting character.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.650
I don't -- Andy will know him.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:21.950
I don't know if anyone else does.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.250
Deacon started as a session guitar
player playing on some classic rock

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.550
and roll and R&amp;B releases
from New Orleans produced

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.850
by Allen Toussaint and
[inaudible] studio.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.150
He played on Aaron Neville's
"Tell it Like it Is."

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.450
And Lee Dorsey's "Working
in a Coal Mine."

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.750
And Ernie K-Doe's "Mother-in-Law."

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.050
So you may know some
of those songs as well.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.350
And since then he's made a
career playing with a big band,

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.650
including three backup singers.

00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:34.950
Playing private functions.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:37.160
The hunger for music there is such
that he's been able to do that,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.200
and you always meet people
there who say, "Oh, yeah.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.510
He played for my graduation."

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:44.810
Or, "My debutante ball."

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.680
Or the Mardi Gras crew or whatever.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.490
He very rarely plays in public,

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.020
but he's made a fairly
good living doing that.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:57.910
Sometimes he goes out in disguise

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.650
because people stop him
so much to say, "Oh.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:07.190
You played my daughter's wedding
and my next daughter -- It's time."

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.020
You know, that sort
of thing as well.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.260
He wears these sort of old
gas station attendant shirts

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.610
with different names on them.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.470 position:56%
And he's also president of the local
musician's union there as well,

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:23.260 position:56%
and he said, "Being from New Orleans
you're exposed to the culture.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.400
You come up in the culture
with the second line parades,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.700
the Mardi Gras, all that.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.720
You're exposed to that ever
since you were a little kid.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.970
Your parents bring you to
Mardi Gras in your costume

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:36.230
and you see the Mardi Gras Indians,
the brass bands, the jazz funerals,

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.800
and it becomes part of you."

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.910
Let's hear some music
from Deacon John

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.910
since we haven't heard
anything from New Orleans.

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:44.620
This is from a concert that was
kind of a celebration of him.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.210
So it's with an even bigger
sort of all star band and it's

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.010
with a big house, and he's singing
kind of anthemic New Orleans songs

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.310
with Tricia Boutte also
known as Teedy Boutte.

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:50.610
We'll with luck hear a little
bit of this and you'll --

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:51.910
At least if you're of a certain
age you'll know this song, right?

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:53.710
I think.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:42:23.810
[ Music ]

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.340
Could this have anything to
do with the hearings tomorrow?

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:30.430
Do you think we've been blocked?

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:35.970
Try once -- My partner Jeanie I
think calls this spinning thing the

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.420
beach ball of death.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:44.510
Let's try one more.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:43:49.030
[ Music ]

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.470
I think that's a message
that it's time to keep going.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:56.190
This is actually helpful in that,
you know, I kept telling myself,

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.720
"You can't -- You don't have
time to play all these clips

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:03.000
as long -- for their full length."

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:14.470
So, on the other hand, it would be
nice if we could get out of this.

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:23.740
Yeah. Oh. I'm at the
wrong end of the keyboard.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:25.040
Thank you.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.340
Actually, why not just
play another little clip

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.840
since we seem to be
having some luck?

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:32.070
I don't know if you know the Mardi
Gras Indian tradition at all.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.060
Mardi Gras Indians dating to the
late 19th century in New Orleans,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.850
mostly working class
African American men,

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:41.790
would spend a year sewing costumes

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.190
that are inspired by
plains Indian garb.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:49.620
And parade a few times a
year wearing that costume

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.410
and then next year they
start another costume.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.350
Increasingly now we're seeing women
and children as part of this too.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.470
They're -- They organize in
what used to be called gangs.

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.290
Now they call themselves tribes.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.150
And they have names like the Yellow
Pocahontas or the Wild [inaudible]

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:11.370
and these sort of great
fanciful names that are

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:15.790
in some ways evocative anyway
of Native American culture.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.530
And they say they're doing it
in tribute or in appreciation

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.640
for the role that Native
American communities played

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.710
for people in slavery.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.780
There are all sorts of attempts
to try to figure this out,

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.530
where it really comes from, and
so it's inspired in part it looks

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:34.780
like by the Buffalo
Bill Cody Wild West show

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.510
which [inaudible] New Orleans
in the 1880s, for instance.

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:41.470
But they have developed this
distinctive body of music.

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:42.770
They parade.

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:44.880
They have tribal ranks.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.110
There's a spy boy who marches
ahead looking for the other tribes

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:51.820
because they used to have
violent confrontations.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.790
Now when they have
confrontations they argue

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:58.460
about who's the prettiest, talking
about their elaborate suits.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.010 position:56%
And this is not a very great YouTube
clip of something very recent

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.720
from some Mardi Gras
Indians out on the streets.

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.990
I think it's worth seeing,
though, because so much

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:15.510
of New Orleans music has
to do with the streets.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:47:15.950
[ Music ]

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:20.770
It is a visually spectacular thing.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:25.850 position:56%
I had someone from one of the
[inaudible] clubs, black benevolent,

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:28.070
organizations that have been
so much a part of New Orleans

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.240
for a long time said
to me, "You know,

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.730
committing to be a
Mardi Gras Indian,"

00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:34.880
which means you sew a
new costume every year --

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.640
And these are elaborately
beaded, tiny beads

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.220
and so forth, all done by hand.

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:42.250
He said, "It's a form
of self incarceration."

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.720
So kept going to New Orleans.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.700
Kept going to music events.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.970
Kept listening to people talk
about music, culture, and life.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.280
And the more I do that,
the more parallels

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.980
with Cape Breton come to mind.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:04.740
Some of those are the importance
of smaller social configurations

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.400
in New Orleans communities.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.700
I'm sorry.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.000
In Cape Breton it's communities.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.230
In New Orleans it's neighborhoods.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:16.700
The importance of these things in
supporting and sustaining the kind

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.740
of cultural creativity
and continuity

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.380
that seemed necessary
to cultural integrity.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:27.060
And I point out too that
New Orleans neighborhoods,

00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.870
especially the musical ones,

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.330
are sort of like the
Cape Breton communities

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:39.130 position:56%
in that they are comprised of people
left out of economic opportunity.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:45.220
Both places music is very
much in the public realm.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.450 position:56%
In Cape Breton it's halls and in New
Orleans it really is the streets.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:52.570
The best theater in
America, I think,

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.340
is going to a second line
parade or a jazz funeral

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.720
or Mardi Gras Indian super
Sunday which is when they parade

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:02.020
for the broader community.

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.920
It's also striking to me that
almost everybody talks about music

00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.600
and family in both of
these places as well.

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.230
You know, as [inaudible]
mentioned, the Cape Breton book

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.520
that we did we called
"In the Blood."

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.310
But I hear people in New Orleans
saying, "Music is in the blood."

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:19.430
And they're both places
that are characterized

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.940
by these family dynasties.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.880
In Cape Breton it's
Beatons and McMasters

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.000
and in New Orleans it's
Nevilles and [inaudible]

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.610
and many, many others as well.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:37.940
Also in New Orleans the
music is very much part

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.920
of the public realm just
as it is in Cape Breton.

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:45.360
It's in some ways at the
center of public life.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.670
In some of these communities too.

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:50.210
And also, as I mentioned,
there's this ongoing kind

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:51.690
of public conversation about --

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:55.580
especially about threats to
those neighborhoods' integrity.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.110
Often meaning gentrification.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:49:59.830
Formerly it was urban renewal,

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:01.920
although they've tended
to back down from that.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.650
And other sorts of
disruptive forces.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.680
So, as in Cape Breton, New Orleans
is a place where there's a lot

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.190
of kind of cultural
anxiety too, I think.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.550
And, as in Cape Breton, there's
this development of a kind

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.750
of institutionalized
infrastructure to teach

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:19.490
and sustain and present the music.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.940
That is to maintain
cultural integrity.

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:25.710
I'm thinking New Orleans of,
oh, the Tipitina's Foundation

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.990
and Ellis Marsalis Center
for Music which some

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.390
of these were built
after Hurricane Katrina.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.960
Some predate them.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.430
The Marsalis Center which is an
after school center for children --

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.540
They come mostly middle school
and I think high school kids come.

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.990
They have tutors who insist
that they do their homework

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.420
and then they get music lessons.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.450
I asked the director there,
"What's the instrument that most

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.820
of these young kids want
to play in New Orleans?"

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:53.400
Thinking that if you ask that
where I live, what would it be?

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.700
Maybe guitar?

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.000
Maybe flute or whatever.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.910
Trumpet. Trumpet.

00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.750
New Orleans.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:04.460
There's a New Orleans
[inaudible] alliance, for instance.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:11.820 position:56%
And these are all about protecting
or restoring what's normal and good.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.540
And, as I said, it's
important to realize that some

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:16.320
of these are the results of
the levees breaking in 2005,

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.110
but some of them predate this.

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.220
These are long running
concerns, long running issues.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:30.670
I looked at a 2010 study about
civic engagement and the recovery

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:37.780
from the hurricane, and they looked
at various kinds of social groups

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:41.840
in New Orleans and graded them
in terms of civic engagement.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.290
And some of those constituencies
were high income groups,

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:50.300
high education groups,
whites, church members.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:52.510
The groups that scored highest

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:59.270
on civic engagement were the
social [inaudible] club members.

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.050
These, as I said, are
benevolent societies

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:07.130
that were established early in
New Orleans to provide benefits

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.600
that weren't available in African
American communities [inaudible]

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:14.750
benefits and so forth, but
also played a key role in kind

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:16.880
of cultural preservation as well.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.350
They sponsor the parades
that pay the brass bands

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:22.390
to keep going and things
of that sort.

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:24.790
So in a sense I see
these organizations

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:29.430
as having been formed
originally to create

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:32.280 position:56%
and help sustain cultural
integrity, and that's not surprising

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:38.870
that they stepped up right
away after the 2005 storm.

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:41.310
I talked about conversations.

00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:45.650 position:56%
I want to mention that they're
fighting all the time in New Orleans

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:50.890
about whether music should
be regulated on the streets.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:56.570 position:56%
The Mardi Gras Indians have resisted
parade permits historically.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:57.870
The city says, "No.

00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:59.170
You need parade permits."

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:00.790
They are fighting about that.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:03.190
And culture is the rationale there.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.510
It's not expense or whatever.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.580
Noise ordinances have
become a big issue.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.700
This is especially in
gentrifying neighborhoods

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:15.200 position:56%
where you have the kind of familiar
irony of people moving in to an area

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.930
from outside saying they, you
know, they love the culture,

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:23.510
and then not wanting it
up close very much at all.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:27.100
So, to use the terminology
I'm trying to develop --

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:31.480
So what's normal and good in
some New Orleans neighborhoods is

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.930
under fire typically because
of socioeconomic factors.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.060 position:56%
The pushback is that these new rules

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.780
and regulations will
damage cultural integrity.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:46.060
So I don't mean to imply that
cultural integrity is measurable

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:51.140
or finite or objective, but in
my field I don't know what is.

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.440
So that doesn't really disturb me.

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.040
We know that from sustainability
studies

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.950
that change is part
of natural systems.

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:04.940
We also know that environmentalists
believe that there are states

00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:08.430
of being in a natural world that
are more successful which is

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:13.320
to say more integrated than
other more disruptive states.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.670
Some environmentalists use
terms such as stewardship

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:21.140
to describe their work to help
places recover from disruption.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:24.910
As I think about Cape Breton,
and as I think about New Orleans,

00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:29.350
and I think about culture being in
the air and about local anxieties

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:33.280
about culture, I wonder if we
might say that what's at stake

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.330
in these places is a desire to
hold on to cultural integrity.

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:42.290
And of course I'd like to think
that scholars and institutions

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:45.350
such as the American Folklife
Center are helping play a role

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.190
in that stewardship, the
stewardship of that integrity.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:50.490
Thank you.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:57.530
[ Applause ]

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:58.830
What do you think, Nancy?

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.130
Should we take a few questions?

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.430
Do we have time?

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:03.140
Are there questions?

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.440
Yes?

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I have two,
one for each [inaudible].

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:11.380
I wonder if how -- You made
them [inaudible] really great.

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:14.270
I was there 45 years ago.

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.800
I'm sure nothing has
changed [inaudible]

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.910
but are the local communities
welcoming of people coming

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:25.960
from the outside who are
interested in being involved

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:29.400
in their cultural integrity?

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:34.340
And then as far as New
Orleans is concerned,

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:38.490 position:56%
did I understand you correctly in
saying that the ninth ward wasn't --

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.380
didn't come back as well?

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:41.680
And, if so, why?

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:47.570
If they were part of that
potential sustainability you were

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:48.870
talking about?

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:50.170
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Those
are two good questions.

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:55.790
I -- Are Cape Breton
communities welcoming outsiders?

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:57.400
I would say often yes.

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:00.360
I mean I think people
go and are often struck

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.240
by how much people approach
them and are curious,

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.540
say, "Where are you from?"

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.840
And so forth.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.310
I mean there's been a great deal
of tourism development there

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:10.350
that predates the interest in
music, in fact, and a great deal

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:13.550
of intentional work to
kind of create the idea

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:17.400
that it's a Celtic place
or a Scottish place.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.220
And, you know, Nova Scotia
itself has seen a huge amount

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.010
of tourist development
with special roots plotted

00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.370
that are thematic and so forth.

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:29.350
I have found Cape Bretoners
are often very friendly,

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:32.830
but may be a little slow to,
say, invite you to their house.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:36.990
So friendly in public spaces,
in the kind of public arena,

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:40.100
and often curious about you,
and often very welcoming.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.700
I felt in doing field work
that when I finally get invited

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:48.800 position:56%
in to someone's kitchen to drink tea
that I know I've kind of made it.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.750
And that feels like
more of a privilege

00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:53.210
than some other people I
know who go just to kind

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:56.080
of enjoy the music have had.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.030
New Orleans Lower Ninth
ward, you know, it --

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:01.530
I don't have an answer for this.

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.610
People in the Lower Ninth --

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:06.330
The Lower Ninth is where the
industrial canal levee broke,

00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:12.150
and it's where some of the most
devastating flooding happened.

00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:14.500
I mean 18 feet of water and stuff.

00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.430
And you could go and you'd
see the only thing left

00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:20.480
of a house was the concrete
front steps that went up to --

00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:21.870
a few steps to the porch.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:24.550
So a lot of those houses were
built on concrete blocks.

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:27.400
You know, they were barely
anchored to the earth.

00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.370
People there will tell
you that it's not so much

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.500
in the city's economic
interest because there's not

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:35.450 position:56%
that much industry or business there

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:38.590
and that poor people get
the short end of the deal.

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.440
And that's what you hear often.

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.760 position:56%
I -- I'm sure there are -- If you go
to city hall there are other kinds

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.680
of explanations, but
actually I don't know them

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:47.530
and can't tell you this.

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:51.770
But both the Lower Ninth
and New Orleans East

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.710
which was also a working class

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:57.200
or in some ways more middle class
black neighborhood are the two

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:02.480
places that have been slowest to
come back and have gotten less

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.150
in the way of outside funding
and so forth to bring them back.

00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:09.590
There are still swaths
of the Lower Ninth ward

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:14.350
that the physical buildings
are gone, for instance.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:15.650
Yes? In the back.

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:16.950
And then Andy.

00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:18.250
You please.

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:19.550
Yeah.

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:21.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I'm not sure if I
have a question or observation,

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.830
but when you showed the
clips of the tribes --

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:27.140
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: The
Mardi Gras Indians?

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:32.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I saw a
pretty African influence

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.790
in that too [inaudible]
just curious [inaudible].

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:36.090
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Sure.

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:38.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: The African
[inaudible] culture and --

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:42.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Well, you know, it
is African American culture and much

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.010
of African American
music includes that call

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:48.690
and response no matter
what the genre is.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:50.690
It's also, I think --

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.970
You can understand the Mardi
Gras Indians too as part

00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:57.260 position:56%
of this really spectacular tradition
of masking and parading that runs

00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:01.060 position:56%
through a lot of the black Caribbean
and in other places as well.

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.910
If you go to -- I live near Boston.

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:04.930
There's a Caribbean
parade every year.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:08.130
People are wearing huge
feathered costumes and so forth.

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:10.380
Here because of historical
circumstances here

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.580
in New Orleans they
connected to Indians and talk

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:18.060
about Indian culture, but you can
also see it as part of a long kind

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:21.990
of continuity that has to
do with parading, masking,

00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:24.230
elaborate costuming and so forth.

00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:25.530
Andy?

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:26.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: One comment.

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:29.700
The other thing I found in common

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.590
between those two cultures
was the caliber

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:35.830
of [inaudible] in both of them.

00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:45.790
I don't encounter communities that
have that level of great musicians,

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:49.410 position:56%
but the great Cape Breton musicians,

00:59:49.410 --> 00:59:53.370
the [inaudible] are popular
music stars in addition

00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:56.160
to being traditional musicians.

00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:01.310 position:56%
And I wonder if you can comment on
-- But they integrated the trappings

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.610
of a lot of popular
culture in to their acts.

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:08.990
And yet that's perfectly
accepted there and I wanted you

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.040
to -- that whole phenomenon --

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.360
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Do you know
Natalie McMasters' music?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.660
Some of you will, of course.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.510
Yeah. There was a time when
Natalie was Canada's busiest

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:19.940
performing artist.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:23.770
When I first went to Cape Breton
Natalie McMaster who had been --

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:27.840
then may not have even
been out of her teens.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.270
And Ashley [inaudible]
were just huge sensations.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:36.510
Ashley -- Both came out of
family traditions of music.

01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:39.340
Both are remarkably good players.

01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:41.490
Both share the same teacher.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.850
And both were doing really well.

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.240
Ashley had done a recording that
integrated traditional fiddle music

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.300
with very aggressive rock and roll.

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.580
And had gotten the equivalent
of a Grammy in Canada

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:56.980
and was getting a lot of college
radio play in the United States

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:03.070 position:56%
and sort of applying to or appealing
to sort of hip young people.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:05.340
Natalie was playing
more traditionally,

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:08.500
but over time she sort of turned
in to what I think of as someone

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.880
who could do her act on a -- in
a Las Vegas casino or something.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.370
There's a lot of glitz
and a lot of choreography

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:17.280
and wonderful musicianship.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.880
And both are loved
at home and admired.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.480
And they really kind of paved
the way to the idea for a bunch

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.880 position:56%
of other young musicians that,
"Maybe I can make a living at this."

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:31.290
I remember when I was there in the
late '90s you would see, you know,

01:01:31.290 --> 01:01:34.440
quarter mile long lines to get
in to the Brook Village Hall

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.350
because Ashley was
playing, for instance,

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:37.650
and it was all young people.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.220
So it brought a lot of young
people back to the music.

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:44.100
And there was something
else I want to say

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.970
and I've just -- I
just blanked on it.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.060
Oh yeah. I did an interview
with someone

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:52.130
who was a very fine fiddle player.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:56.530
She's in her 40s now so she
was in her 20s then I guess.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:02:00.850
Who said there was a time
-- This was late '90s.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.410
There was a time when parents
used to send their kids

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:07.200
to play hockey thinking that was --

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.560
could be an economic
way out of the island.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.880
And she said now they
have fiddle lessons.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.200
Yeah. And that moment
is somewhat gone,

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.220
but they're still revered figures.

01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:20.520
Yes?

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:30.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: I was thinking that
the Cape Breton people, you know,

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:39.700
tell a story about how a community
responded to economic challenges.

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:52.870
So the first thing was they had
[inaudible] but a whole bunch

01:02:52.870 --> 01:03:04.340
of [inaudible] you know ended
up moving to the same place,

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:15.260
and so they were able to bring the
culture with them, keep it going.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:21.950
And then once again, you
know [inaudible] started to,

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.810
you know [inaudible].

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:31.710
In New Orleans it was
with a disaster

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:36.750
that especially affected
the communities

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:43.730
where there had been a
tremendous stability in terms

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:51.020
of the people living in those
neighborhoods and their --

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:57.500 position:56%
They had very high home ownership
rates even [inaudible] homes were --

01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:04.180
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: So you're
talking about Katrina.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:05.480
Yes.

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: But what
happened was that a lot

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:16.010
of those people were
scattered around.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.230
People went to Atlanta.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.860
They went to Houston.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:21.160
They went to Denver.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.310
Wherever. And I think
in those circumstances,

01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:24.610
especially [inaudible]
cultural identity.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:28.040 position:56%
So I think these institutions of --
that, you know, have been reinforced

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:32.000
or sprung up, say, in
New Orleans, you know,

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.900
those need to become spread
around if the people want to try

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.570
to keep connecting back and
then, you know, bring it forward

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:39.970
to where they're probably going to
be living the rest of their lives

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.270 position:56%
and probably their children as well.

01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:42.570
And I was just thinking
about my own father who grew

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:43.870
up in an Irish American
dock worker's neighborhood.

01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:45.170
There's probably not a single
person left in the neighborhood

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.470
because the economy changed
over, you know, decades.

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:48.100
But there are certain institutions
that you can connect to if you want

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.420
to go back to some of the
music, go back to some

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.720
of the traditions and [inaudible].

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.020
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Oh, I agree.

01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.320
I don't really know
what to say beyond that.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.620 position:56%
You know, there's been a fair amount
of work, especially around Houston,

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.920
by some folklorists kind of
documenting the stories of people

01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:57.220
who were displaced
by the storm and had

01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:58.520 position:56%
to create new lives in other places.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.820
You often hear when people
are interviewed in, you know,

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:01.120
Salt Lake City or Houston
or wherever they ended

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.420
up that they miss the food
and they miss the music.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:03.720
That those are -- They're
so emblematic

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.020
of life in that community.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.320
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson:
Thank you very much.

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.620
&gt;&gt; Bert Feintuch: Thank you.

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:08.920

of the Library of Congress.
