So if you could

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:01.761
Turning lounges.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:04.964
I did a show in a arcade bar.

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.666

one-- no one there

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.867 line:0%

it's getting a chance to shine.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.401
And people really look
at this as putting

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:43.636
you up on that upper echelon.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:45.238
Listen, just go up
