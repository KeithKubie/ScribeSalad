00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.650
For each of these numbers
there is a number line.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.960
Please plot each number
on the number line.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.110
You should notice that each number
line has zero at the center, but

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.630
the scales are not all the same.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.240
Also notice that negative numbers
go on the left hand side, and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.950
positive numbers go on
the right hand side.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.550
Also note that I've labeled all
the whole numbers positive and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.270
negative on each of these number lines.
