00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660
extermination of the natives so it's
 

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.050

even if it's not a security state so we
 

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.830
even if it's not a security state so we
need to ask also these questions and I

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:03.840
need to ask also these questions and I
 

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.140
need to ask also these questions and I
don't have any other thing to say but

all when we talk about disability we

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700
all when we talk about disability we
 

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.980
all when we talk about disability we
have to talk about disabilities that are

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:18.990
have to talk about disabilities that are
 

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.520
have to talk about disabilities that are
produced through violent treatment and

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:22.530
produced through violent treatment and
 

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.050
produced through violent treatment and
torture and then we can talk about

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060
torture and then we can talk about
 

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:29.750
torture and then we can talk about
disabilities that pre-exists that so my

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760
disabilities that pre-exists that so my
 

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.170
disabilities that pre-exists that so my
sense is that there are two different

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180
sense is that there are two different
 

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.420
sense is that there are two different
questions one or one has to do with

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.430
questions one or one has to do with
 

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:41.420
questions one or one has to do with
physical restrictions that emerged as a

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:41.430
physical restrictions that emerged as a
 

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.940
physical restrictions that emerged as a
as a result of torture or violent

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:43.950
as a result of torture or violent
 

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.860
as a result of torture or violent
treatment and the second one has to do

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:45.870
treatment and the second one has to do
 

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.750
treatment and the second one has to do
with whether appropriate health care is

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760
with whether appropriate health care is
 

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.030
with whether appropriate health care is
provided and at least in my readings

crimes we have to think about how the

couple of words I of course there are

00:26:27.239 --> 00:26:27.249
couple of words I of course there are
 

00:26:27.249 --> 00:26:28.469
couple of words I of course there are
many ways in which one could approach

00:26:28.469 --> 00:26:28.479
many ways in which one could approach
 

00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:32.879
many ways in which one could approach
your question but I'm i'm going to say

00:26:32.879 --> 00:26:32.889
your question but I'm i'm going to say
 

00:26:32.889 --> 00:26:34.799
your question but I'm i'm going to say
something that's that's sort of hard to

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:34.809
something that's that's sort of hard to
 

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:40.909
something that's that's sort of hard to
say particularly in the context of of

00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919
say particularly in the context of of
 

00:26:40.919 --> 00:26:46.069
say particularly in the context of of
palestine and that is you know how do we

00:26:46.069 --> 00:26:46.079
palestine and that is you know how do we
 

00:26:46.079 --> 00:26:53.969
palestine and that is you know how do we
recognize the gendered violence both in

00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:53.979
recognize the gendered violence both in
 

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:58.499
recognize the gendered violence both in
terms of the state violence and in terms

00:26:58.499 --> 00:26:58.509
terms of the state violence and in terms
 

00:26:58.509 --> 00:27:02.309
terms of the state violence and in terms
of violence that happens in intimate

00:27:02.309 --> 00:27:02.319
of violence that happens in intimate
 

00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:04.789
of violence that happens in intimate
relationships often perpetrated

00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799
relationships often perpetrated
 

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:07.610
relationships often perpetrated
precisely by

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620
precisely by
 

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.830
precisely by
those who have played such an important

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840
those who have played such an important
 

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.250
those who have played such an important
role in the struggle for freedom and I

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260
role in the struggle for freedom and I
 

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.900
role in the struggle for freedom and I
mean I think that's an important

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:17.910
mean I think that's an important
 

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.080
mean I think that's an important
question about gender it's related to

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.090
question about gender it's related to
 

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:27.350
question about gender it's related to
the issue of the gendered character of

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360
the issue of the gendered character of
 

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.310
the issue of the gendered character of
imprisonment precisely because when we

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320
imprisonment precisely because when we
 

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.820
imprisonment precisely because when we
look at prison populations political

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:34.830
look at prison populations political
 

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.740
look at prison populations political
prisoners and other prisoners all over

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:36.750
prisoners and other prisoners all over
 

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.140
prisoners and other prisoners all over
the world they're overwhelmingly male

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:39.150
the world they're overwhelmingly male
 

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.160
the world they're overwhelmingly male
and we often assume that it's simply

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:43.170
and we often assume that it's simply
 

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:47.230
and we often assume that it's simply
because women don't do the things that

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:47.240
because women don't do the things that
 

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.540
because women don't do the things that
cause them to end up in prison whether

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:50.550
cause them to end up in prison whether
 

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.370
cause them to end up in prison whether
it's a political act or whether it's a

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380
it's a political act or whether it's a
 

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.410
it's a political act or whether it's a
criminal act but I think that if we if

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:57.420
criminal act but I think that if we if
 

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.360
criminal act but I think that if we if
we again dis articulate the crime and

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:02.370
we again dis articulate the crime and
 

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.940
we again dis articulate the crime and
punishment or political acts and

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:04.950
punishment or political acts and
 

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.490
punishment or political acts and
punishment we begin to see that there

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:07.500
punishment we begin to see that there
 

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.450
punishment we begin to see that there
are other reasons why people end up the

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:10.460
are other reasons why people end up the
 

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.770
are other reasons why people end up the
behind bars some people do and some

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:12.780
behind bars some people do and some
 

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:16.370
behind bars some people do and some
people don't and that that as a matter

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:16.380
people don't and that that as a matter
 

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.540
people don't and that that as a matter
of fact there's a kind of punishment

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:17.550
of fact there's a kind of punishment
 

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:22.480
of fact there's a kind of punishment
that's inflicted on women in a way that

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:22.490
that's inflicted on women in a way that
 

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:27.140
that's inflicted on women in a way that
represents a kind of delegation by the

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:27.150
represents a kind of delegation by the
 

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:32.890
represents a kind of delegation by the
state to punish women within private

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:32.900
state to punish women within private
 

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.870
state to punish women within private
context so I think it's important to

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880
context so I think it's important to
 

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.150
context so I think it's important to
look at violence against women which we

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:38.160
look at violence against women which we
 

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.730
look at violence against women which we
tend to think we can eradicate simply by

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740
tend to think we can eradicate simply by
 

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.640
tend to think we can eradicate simply by
criminalizing it and the fact is that

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:43.650
criminalizing it and the fact is that
 

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.730
criminalizing it and the fact is that
over the last 30 years or so the

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740
over the last 30 years or so the
 

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.470
over the last 30 years or so the
criminalization of violence against

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480
criminalization of violence against
 

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.310
criminalization of violence against
women has led to many many more

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:51.320
women has led to many many more
 

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.570
women has led to many many more
perpetrators of violence against women

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580
perpetrators of violence against women
 

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.110
perpetrators of violence against women
and landing in prison but it is not at

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120
and landing in prison but it is not at
 

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.680
and landing in prison but it is not at
all had an impact on the incidence of

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:00.690
all had an impact on the incidence of
 

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.140
all had an impact on the incidence of
violence against women so I think it

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.150
violence against women so I think it
 

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.930
violence against women so I think it
would be really important especially

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:04.940
would be really important especially
 

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.340
would be really important especially
especially within a context like

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:07.350
especially within a context like
 

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:10.280
especially within a context like
Palestine I think to try to address some

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:10.290
Palestine I think to try to address some
 

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.130
Palestine I think to try to address some
of those really hard questions and

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140
of those really hard questions and
 

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:16.730
of those really hard questions and
develop modes of activism that allow us

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740
develop modes of activism that allow us
 

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.380
develop modes of activism that allow us
to be attentive

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:20.390
 

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:25.430
22 both expressions of violence and then

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440
22 both expressions of violence and then
 

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.930
22 both expressions of violence and then
the other question about accountability

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940
the other question about accountability
 

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.530
the other question about accountability
I totally agree with you Judith about

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:30.540
I totally agree with you Judith about
 

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:36.890
I totally agree with you Judith about
the soccer team approach but at the same

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:36.900
the soccer team approach but at the same
 

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.970
the soccer team approach but at the same
time I think we can think about

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980
time I think we can think about
 

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.210
time I think we can think about
accountability and there is there's

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.220
accountability and there is there's
 

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.919
accountability and there is there's
accountability that doesn't necessarily

00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:42.929
accountability that doesn't necessarily
 

00:29:42.929 --> 00:29:47.720
accountability that doesn't necessarily
