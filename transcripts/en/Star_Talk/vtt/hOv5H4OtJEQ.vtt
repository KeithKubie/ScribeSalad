radio this is the how tweeted is segment

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
Bill Nye joining me here so good to have
you in you tweet at Bill Nye I do it's

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.090
very nice so here we analyze tweets I've

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.940
and people's reactions and there's one
bill

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.180
Neil: It is the most retweeted tweet I've ever posted.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.700
Bill: The most retweeted tweet?
Neil: People went bananas. Ape bananas, okay?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.040
Christmas Day, here is my tweet.
Bill: Oh, the 25th of December.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.340
Neil: On this day long ago, a child was born who,
by age 30, would transform the world.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.220
Happy Birthday Isaac Newton, born December 25, 1642.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.270
I thought people might want to know!

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.520
Bill: He's reck'n in Britain.
Neil: Yeah in England he's born on December 25th. Have

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.940
you told me over the years you're born
on the day that your mother thinks you

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.700
were born on.
Bill: Well that's one way of looking at it.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.660
The Catholic Church is crazy to tell everybody, they
just love telling everybody, but it was the 4th of January.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.580
Neil: Well yeah, because England had
not yet... not a big fan of the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.869
Church, the Catholic Church.
Bill: They had their own deal.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.630
Neil: Yeah, they stayed with the Julian
calendar a little longer than others did.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.520
Bill: A little longer - 150 years longer. 
Imagine everybody what it's like if

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119
you're trying to do commerce and you
don't agree on the calendars.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.850
Imagine, everybody, a guy so powerful, Pope Gregory the 13th, was so

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.430
powerful he declared October 5th shall
be followed by October 15th in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.479
1572, no, 1582. Yeah excuse me 1582,
and so you're a landlord This is great.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.000
"Hey you owe me another month's rent!"
Neil: No, I know how to amortize.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.840
Yeah, I know how to do the math on that one.
Bill: But I gotta think that Newton's mom

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.580
thought it was Christmas day.
Neil: So we got that, and then hence I posted this tweet

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.180
but people reacted. There was some newspaper
headline that said, "Tyson trolls Christians on

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.060
Christmas Day" and I'm thinking, don't
people want to know that there's this

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.270
guy who was actually born that day? We
don't really know when Jesus was born.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.680
Bill: Apparently he was born four years before.
They even they lied about his age even back then.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.380
Neil: 4 BC is probably the better date for you.
Bill: There were some comments.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.500
Neil: There's some alignment of planets that...
people trying to find what the Wise Men

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.800
we're looking at. My point is I thought
people be enchanted by learning about

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.459
Isaac Newton and his significance in
shaping modern culture being that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.090
basically the founder of the knowable universe.
Bill: You had somebody else in mind.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.070
An historic figure.
Neil: I'd had other tweets that day too.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.489
Can I tell you my favorite one from that day?
It's about Santa. I said Santa

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.500
knows physics. Red light penetrates fog
better any other color.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.340
Bill: No matter whether the dress
is black and blue or white and gold.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.860
Neil: So Benny the Blue-Nosed
Reindeer didn't get the gig.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.250
I worked hard on that one.
Bill: It was good. People say, well, how do

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.160
you see Santa at
this store and at that shopping mall?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.620
Because he's magic.
Neil: That's the answer.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.100
Bill: Okay so what then, like, you can do that.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.220
Neil: Oh by the people who said I was
trolling Christians, they must have

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.690
missed two days before where I
photographed the Christmas windows at

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.660
Macy's Herald Square.
Bill: Which were cool. I Tweeted a couple.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.360
Neil: You Tweeted a couple. They're great!
Little Alex is on an interplanetary sleigh.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.640
Bill: Yes he's intra-cosmotic.
Neil: He's visiting the planets. He's good.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.420
