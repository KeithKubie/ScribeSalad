GREG HUTKO: Welcome
back to the 14.01

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.250
problem-solving videos.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.830
Today we're going to work on
Fall 2010 Problem Set 4,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.640
Problem Number 3.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.220
And this problem is really
going to take

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.490
us through two scenarios.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.660
We're dealing with producer
decisions.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.780
So now instead of dealing with
utilities, we're going to be

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.690
working with cost functions.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.790
And we're going to
first go through

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.510
the short-run scenario.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.790
And then we're going to talk
about the long-run scenario

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.440
and the implications of
both of these cases.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.670
Problem Number 3 says, suppose
the process of producing corn

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.050
on a farm is described by the
function q equals 8k to the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.230
1/3 times quantity L minus 40
raised to the 2/3, where q is

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.430
the number of units of corn
produced, k is the number of

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.920
machine hours used, and
L is the number of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.010
person-hours of labor.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.940
In addition to capital and
labor, the farmer needs to pay

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.690
a $15 transportation fee to
deliver corn to downtown.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.300
So the cost can be written as
total cost equals 15 times the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.550
quantity produced plus the
rental cost of capital plus

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.740
the wage rate times the
quantity of labor.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.980
Part A says, suppose in the
short-run the machine hours

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.670
rented are fixed at k equals 8,
and its rental rate equals

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.220
64, and the wage
rate equals 16.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.510
Derive the short-run total cost
and the average costs as

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.010
a function of output level q.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.560
So to start off this problem,
we're going to start by

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.025
working with the short-run
scenario.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.110
And typically, the only
difference between the

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.530
short-run scenario and the
long-run scenario in economics

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.880
problems is that in the
short-run, the amount of

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.600
capital that a firm can use
is going to be fixed.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.660
It means that because machines
are a fixed cost in the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.230
short-run, you can't actually
change how many machines or

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.340
how often you use
the machines.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.850
So we're going to set that equal
to 8 for this scenario.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.830
And we also know that each hour
that we use this machine

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.510
is going to cost us 64.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.210
And we know that for each hour
that we're using labor, it's

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.600
going to cost us 16.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.140
We also know that in addition to
the cost of the capital and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.340
the cost of the labor, which
is represented in our total

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.500
cost function here, for each
unit q that we produce, we

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.490
have to transport
it to market.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.370
So we also have this 15 times
q added into our total cost

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.810
function, which is something
that we might not always see

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.100
in all of our cost functions.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.150
So let's start off by solving
for the total cost function.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.090
And to do this, the first thing
that we're going to do

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.050
is we're going to plug in to our
production function here

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.680
what we know the capital
is fixed at.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.150
And we're going to solve for
labor, or L, in terms of q.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:35.570
So plugging in for k
we're going to be

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.290
left with this equation.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.370
And from here, we can solve
for L in terms of q.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.080
And this is going to be useful
for us because what we're

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.930
going to do is we're going to
take this L and we're going to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.400
plug it into the total cost
function, so that our cost

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.270
function is no longer in terms
of k and L. But it's only

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.750
going to be in terms of q.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.060
So isolating L in this equation,
we're going to have

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:15.220
that L equals 40 plus q/16
raised to the 3/2.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.935
So now let's go to our
total cost function.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:25.690
We're going to plug
in for k and r.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.180
So we know that r is
64 and k is 8.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.970
We're going to plug
in for w 16.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.140
And now for L we're going to
plug in what we solved for

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.870
using our production function.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.500
So from this equation when we do
the algebraic manipulation,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.620
we're going to get the total
cost function in

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.720
terms of only q.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.750
And solving out for this, we
find that the total cost--

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.360
and I'm going to denote that
this is in the short-run with

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.520
the capital fixed by a little
sr as a subscript.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:34.070
The total cost is going to be
equal to 1,152 plus 15q plus

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.600
16 times quantity q/16
raised to the 3/2.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.370
Now to find the average cost,
all the average cost is it's

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.750
the total cost divided by q.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.290
So it's per unit, how much on
average does the producer have

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.500
to spend to actually
produce one unit?

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.300
So to find the average cost,
we're going to divide this

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.540
whole thing through by q.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:07.600
And we're going to find the
average cost in the short-run

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:32.460
is going to be equal to 1,152
divided by q plus 15 divided

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:40.370
by q/16 raised to the 1/2.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.130
In part B, what we're going to
do is we're going to take the

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.120
total cost function, we're
going to plug in a fixed

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.010
quantity, and we're going to
find, what is the actual

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.460
amount of money that a producer
would have to pay to

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.010
produce a fixed quantity?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.500
Part B says, suppose
the farm wants to

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.300
produce 64 units of corn.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.330
Based on the answer to
part A, what is the

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.715
total short-run cost?

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:16.080
So using our solution from part
A, all you have to do now

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:24.040
for part B is you're going to
plug in for q the number 64.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:52.340
So for part B, plugging in for
q, you're going to find that

00:07:52.340 --> 00:08:00.670
the total cost in the
short-run is going

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:06.140
to be equal to 2,240.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.640
Now the more interesting part
of this problem is what

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.520
actually happens when instead
of having to fix the capital

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.650
at 8, what happens when the
producer can change the amount

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:15.900
of capital that they're
producing?

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.820
Part D says, in the long-run,
the farm can change its

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.810
capital level by minimizing
the cost subject to the

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.080
production function, derive the
cost-minimizing demands

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:34.220
for k and L as a function of
output q, the wage rates w,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.820
and the rental rates
of machine r.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:43.470
So now we're going to go back
to a similar problem like we

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.430
saw with consumer theory where
we saw the marginal rate of

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.510
substitution had to be equal
to the price ratio.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.480
In this case, we're going to
use something called the

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.690
marginal rate of technical
substitution.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:02.340
Simply put, the marginal rate of
technical substitution asks

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.440
us, how many machines or how
many people would we be

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.350
willing to basically lay off
for one additional machine?

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:15.540
And we call that the marginal
product of capital, or how

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.500
much we're actually getting
from each unit of capital,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.080
divided by the marginal
product of labor.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.070
We're going to set that equal
to the price of the capital

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:32.620
and the price of the labor.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.960
To find these marginal products
of capital and the

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.360
margin marginal product of
labor, what we're going to do

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.780
is we're going to take the
derivative of our production

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.510
function with respect to q, or
with respect to k, and with

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.560
respect to L. And when we do
that, we find that the

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:55.300
marginal product of capital
is going to be equal to.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.810
And we can also solve for the
marginal product of labor.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.170
And we're simply going to divide
here and we can find

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:40.490
that L minus 40 over 2k
is going to equal r/w.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.400
And finally, the last thing
we're going to do here is

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.370
we're going to solve for the
amount of labor and the amount

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.620
of capital rented in terms
of the other variables.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.660
We're going to plug this back
into our production function

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.370
that we have over here in
the middle of the board.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.560
And then we can solve for how
much capital and how much

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:08.490
labor is demanded in terms
of w and in terms of r.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.830
So I'll go through this process
first for solving for

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.350
the demand function
for capital.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.820
To start off, we're going to get
this equation in terms of

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:33.990
L. So we have that L is equal
to 2rk over w plus 40.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.090
And then we're going to take
this L and we're going to plug

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:40.090
it back into our production
function.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:59.630
And when we do this, we're going
to have that 8k to the

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:06.170
1/3 times quantity 2rk over
w raised to the 2/3.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.570
And now we're just going to
solve through for rk.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.670
And when we solve through for k,
we're going to find that k

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:29.540
equals q/8 w over 2r
raised to the 2/3.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.020
This is our conditional
demand for capital.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.030
And we call it the conditional
demand because it's dependent

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.360
on the price that we're going
to pay for labor, the price

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.690
that we're going to pay for
labor, the price we're going

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.050
to pay for capital, and
the quantity that

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.160
we're going to produce.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.330
Now to do this same process
only solving for the

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.230
conditional demand for labor,
you're going to go back to

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:59.040
this equation right here.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.070
And instead of solving through
for L, you're going to solve

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.630
through for k.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:23.200
And when you solve through for
k, you're going to find that k

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.240
equals quantity L minus
40 times w over 2r.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:33.930
You're going to take this k,
just like we did for labor

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.630
you're going to plug it back
into the production function.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.900
And you can solve
through for the

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.710
conditional demand for labor.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.050
And when you do that, you're
going to find that labor is

00:13:44.050 --> 00:14:06.140
just going to equal q/8 times
quantity 2rw raised to

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.090
the 1/3 plus 40.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.130
So again, to summarize this
problem, we started off with

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.700
the short-run scenario.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.240
And what we found with the
short-run scenario, we were

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.870
able to plug-in for the capital
that was fixed at 8.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.250
We were able to find the
total cost and the

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.590
average cost functions.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.410
Given a fixed quantity that
they wanted to produce, we

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.510
solved for the total cost
in the short-run.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.900
And then finally we said, let's
let the producer change

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.840
how much capital they
are actually using.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:41.500
And let's figure out based on
letting the wage rate and the

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.660
rental rate of capital change,
let's get a conditional demand

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.400
that lets those variables change
that would let us then

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.700
solve for the amount of capital
and the amount of

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.690
labor that would be needed
to produce a

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.940
certain amount of quantity.
