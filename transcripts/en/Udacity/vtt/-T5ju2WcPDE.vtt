Hi! In this unit, it's time to get Apollo 13 to the moon and back.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Doing so requires quite some accuracy in our computations.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is why we look into some better tricks to solve differential equations on the computer

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but eventually we can fire the rocket boosters to save the crew.
