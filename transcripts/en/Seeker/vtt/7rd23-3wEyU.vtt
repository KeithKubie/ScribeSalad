00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.260
Which is better a tiny rolled and filtered
menthol cigarette, or a tall water-filled

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.480
mint strawberry tobacco stuffed hookah?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.780
One sure tastes better.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.660
But which is HEALTHIER?

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.189
Hey smokers and friends Trace here for DNews
to shatter your hookah dreams.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.710
Sorry to say it, but hookah is real bad.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.710
REAL bad.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.599
A new review published in Respiratory Medicine
says the health impact of smoking hookah is

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.909
akin to enjoying 100 cigarettes.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.010
One.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.110
Hundred.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.140
Hookah comes from Persia and India and dates
to the 15th Century.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.070
It was spread throughout the world by the
Ottoman Empire.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.950
In case you've never seen one, the hookah
is also known as a water pipe, shisha, narghile

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.040
(NARG-YE-LAY) or hubble bubble.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.540
It has tobacco at the top under a hot coal.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.510
As the heat burns the tobacco, the smoke is
sucked down, through water and a tube, to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.010
the user.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.750
The American Lung Association sees hookah
smoking as a growing problem with youth due

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.239
to the misconceptions about it's safety -- their
2007 study of Michigan teens found those who'd

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.179
smoked a water pipe were 8-times more likely
to try cigarettes too.

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:13.749
Stats from the CDC show 16 percent of high
schoolers, and 25-40 percent of college students

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:18.420
have tried a hookah -- this is in comparison
to 26 percent of high schoolers who've smoked

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.719
cigarettes or cigars.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.450
People believe the water in a hookah filters
the tobacco, but they're wrong...

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.280
Sure, the smoke "feels smoother," because
the temperature is lower and has higher humidity,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.110
but the smoke itself is just as bad as -- actually
worse -- any other tobacco-smoking product.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.939
The University of Maryland says hookah smoke
contains HIGHER levels of arsenic, lead, and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.679
nickel, 36 TIMES MORE tar, and 15 TIMES MORE
carbon monoxide than cigarettes.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.069
A study in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers
and Prevention tested if water pipes were

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.420
a good alternative to cigarettes -- for people
wanting to kick the habit; when testing the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.619
urine of both, they found chemicals which
damage the nervous system, red blood cells

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.749
and eye, throat and nose.

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.560
Some levels in hookah-smokers were double
those of the cigarette-smokers.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.479
When it comes to the addictive chemical nicotine
-- cigarettes and hookah are the same.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.780
So YES, it's JUST AS ADDICTIVE, but it gets
worse...

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.330
The World Health Organization found the average
hookah session lasts between 20 and 80 minutes.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.530
While you inhale 50-100 mL of smoke in a cigarette,
puffing on hookah for a session net 90,000

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.070
mL of smoke!

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.870
That's where the 100 individual cigarettes
number comes from.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.950
According to a study in Nicotine &amp; Tobacco
Research: hookah smoking has been shown to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.860
cause stunted lung production, and the CDC
says, smoking hookah while pregnant produces

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.390
lower birthweight babies.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.100
Hookah smokers are at risk for cancers of
the mouth, lung, esophagus and stomach too...

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.450
Does all this sound familiar?

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.430
That's because it's the same thing you've
been hearing about REGULAR smoking.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.730
There ARE non-tobacco products you can smoke
from a hookah which claim to be safer â€” they're

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:56.880
not.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.320
Smoke from the heat source and the carbon-monoxide
you inhale will still screw up your lungs.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.570
Smoking is smoking, regardless of HOW we inhale
smoke, the lungs aren't all about it.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.200
Do facts like this surprise you?

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.950
Who told you hookah was safer?
