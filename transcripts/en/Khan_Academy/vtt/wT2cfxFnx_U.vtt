00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:01.481
- [Instructor] In the last video,

00:00:01.481 --> 00:00:03.872
we discussed why it took England

00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:07.701
another 100 years to start colonizing

00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:10.545
the New World after Christopher Columbus

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:13.255
first set foot in Hispaniola.

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:17.422
Among those reasons was conflict
within the United Kingdom,

00:00:18.474 --> 00:00:20.727
colonial projects closer to home,

00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:22.312
specifically Ireland,

00:00:22.312 --> 00:00:25.979
and economic depression
that prevented England

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:29.185
from taking much time to
look outside its borders

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:31.106
to the broader world.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.868
In this video, I'm gonna walk about

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:37.003
what led England to finally
get in the colonial game.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.865
So what changes that allows England

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:41.316
to become a premier colonial empire

00:00:41.316 --> 00:00:43.772
and go on to found what will be

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:45.664
the United States of America,

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:48.501
today even an English speaking country?

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:49.827
Well, some of these factors kind of

00:00:49.827 --> 00:00:51.822
turn to their advantage.

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.424
Once the internal religious conflict

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:56.268
has been sorted out,

00:00:56.268 --> 00:00:59.083
turning England into a Protestant nation,

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.442
they turn some of that animus outward

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:03.978
to Spain, a Catholic nation,

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:08.803
and they feel that they
have to compete with Spain

00:01:08.803 --> 00:01:09.636
for riches

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.172
and for souls.

00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:20.278
So certainly, the
Protestant nation of England

00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:21.777
doesn't wanna be left behind

00:01:21.777 --> 00:01:24.713
anymore than it already has been by Spain,

00:01:24.713 --> 00:01:27.884
which has clearly been
reaping great riches

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:31.051
from the New World in the form of gold

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:36.143
down here in Mexico and Central America

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:38.560
and sugar, the Sugar Islands,

00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:42.925
and they also don't wanna be one upped

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:45.118
by the Catholic nation of France,

00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:48.868
which has been reaping
some excellent profits

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:52.410
trading with Native
Americans up in the region

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.954
which is today New York and Canada,

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:58.685
and they're getting furs.

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.808
So there's clearly a lot to be had

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:02.906
in the new world

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:07.399
and a lot of Catholics to
triumph over in having it.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.847
Another thing that allows England to join

00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:12.976
the imperial game in the New World

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:16.643
is the invention of the
Joint Stock Company.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.221
Now, Joint Stock Companies
were kind of the precursor,

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:25.899
I mean, more than kind of the precursor,

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:30.066
really the precursor to
the modern day corporation,

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.835
and like modern day corporations,

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:35.091
what they did was kind of

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.547
spread both the riches and also the risk

00:02:38.547 --> 00:02:42.331
of any kind of
entrepreneurial undertaking.

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.184
And what I mean by this is that

00:02:44.184 --> 00:02:46.478
people could buy shares

00:02:46.478 --> 00:02:48.803
in a Joint Stock Company,

00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:50.872
and those shares were kind of divested

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:52.931
from your personal wealth.

00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:55.156
So you could invest in something that,

00:02:55.156 --> 00:02:56.500
if it went belly up,

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.053
wouldn't necessarily ruin you

00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.818
'cause you just had a few shares.

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:03.015
So it's, you know, similar
to the stock market today,

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:04.874
a very early version of that.

00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:07.492
So these Joint Stock Companies meant that

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:10.409
adventurers, people seeking wealth,

00:03:11.514 --> 00:03:15.083
could go out to the
New World, for example,

00:03:15.083 --> 00:03:16.867
with many different backers,

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.276
the risk spread across all of them,

00:03:19.276 --> 00:03:22.859
and try to make profit
for their investors.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.312
So many what we would call promoters

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:29.645
of the New World

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:36.006
tried to drum up interest in expeditions

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:37.246
to the New World.

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:40.580
Now, everybody knows that
Spain is making a killing

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.333
from gold and sugar,

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.055
and so they're saying, "Well,
maybe private individuals

00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:48.144
"with the blessing,
though not the sponsorship

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:51.226
"of the crown can go to the New World

00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:53.798
"and start extracting
some of these resources

00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:56.408
"and start creating wealth
for their investors."

00:03:56.408 --> 00:03:59.278
And so England issues several charters

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:02.050
to Joint Stock Companies that are still

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.300
familiar names to us today.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.500
For example, the East India Company,

00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.403
which Americans know best as the company

00:04:12.403 --> 00:04:16.070
that supplied the tea
that Bostonians dumped

00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:20.762
into Boston Harbor slightly
before the American Revolution,

00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:22.858
but the one that plays the most role

00:04:22.858 --> 00:04:25.470
in the early founding of the United States

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.470
is the Virginia Company,

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.484
and it's under the auspices
of the Virginia Company

00:04:31.484 --> 00:04:36.056
that explorers like John
Smith head to Virginia

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:39.889
and Virginia is named
for Elizabeth the First,

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:42.725
Henry the Eighth's daughter,

00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:45.300
who never married, and
therefore was said to be

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.765
the Virgin Queen,

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:50.283
so a new land named
after her was Virginia.

00:04:50.283 --> 00:04:52.564
Now, we'll talk more
about the Virginia Company

00:04:52.564 --> 00:04:53.655
in the next video,

00:04:53.655 --> 00:04:57.207
but the last thing I wanna
say about what prompted

00:04:57.207 --> 00:05:01.672
England to join the imperial
game in the New World

00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:06.299
was that England was having
a serious economic depression

00:05:06.299 --> 00:05:08.132
and some real poverty.

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:14.426
Now remember that England
was a highly classed society

00:05:14.426 --> 00:05:16.759
with aristocracy and gentry,

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.373
and these were inherited roles, right?

00:05:22.373 --> 00:05:24.166
You couldn't rise

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:26.883
to be among these ranks, generally.

00:05:26.883 --> 00:05:30.418
So, you know, about 95% of the population

00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:32.984
didn't belong to either of these groups,

00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:35.202
and a strong majority of those

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:38.145
were in dire poverty in the 1500s

00:05:38.145 --> 00:05:39.548
and early 1600s,

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.474
and there were a number
of reasons for this.

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:45.424
The market for wool, which England,

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:49.257
being a major textile
producer, had collapsed,

00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:54.224
so many people who had been

00:05:54.224 --> 00:05:57.933
wool producers were in dire straits.

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.540
In fact, many of them were Puritans,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.886
and we'll see more about
what happens to the Puritans

00:06:02.886 --> 00:06:05.212
who leave England in another video,

00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:08.348
and there's a process going
on in this time period

00:06:08.348 --> 00:06:09.931
known as enclosure,

00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:15.053
the Enclosure Movement.

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:18.536
And what enclosure meant is
kind of what it sounds like,

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:21.444
which is that early English towns

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:24.833
and manor houses were
kind of set up to have,

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:27.180
you know, the house.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.012
That's the big manor house,

00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:32.165
so just bear with me and imagine here,

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.165
and then they might have some forest

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.277
filled with a nice deer to hunt,

00:06:41.751 --> 00:06:45.918
and then they might have
some nice fields, just grass,

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:52.428
and these were kind of
considered common lands.

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:54.753
So if you were a peasant, for example,

00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:57.333
you might graze your cows

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:58.758
on these common lands.

00:06:58.758 --> 00:07:01.397
You might go hunting in the forest.

00:07:01.397 --> 00:07:03.495
Well, in this time period,

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:07.741
these great English lords
started to close off,

00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:09.991
enclose these common lands.

00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.598
So they'd fence them off.

00:07:13.598 --> 00:07:16.901
This kind of makes
sense to our modern idea

00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:19.954
of property holding, right?

00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:23.721
It makes us understand who owns what thing

00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.153
and how it gets deeded, et cetera,

00:07:26.153 --> 00:07:27.789
but for very poor people,

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:30.338
this was a huge transition

00:07:30.338 --> 00:07:32.305
because now they didn't have a place

00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:34.623
to raise their livestock.

00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:39.011
They didn't have a source
of hunting, protein,

00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.018
so it made people who
were already on the edge

00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:44.091
of poverty extremely poor.

00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:45.746
It was a very difficult time

00:07:45.746 --> 00:07:48.242
if you were already kind of living

00:07:48.242 --> 00:07:52.002
in the foraging or small farming aspect

00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:53.285
of English life.

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:57.697
And so, because of this Enclosure
Movement and depression,

00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:00.697
crime rates are going up in England,

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.934
and this is a time when theft
is still a capital crime.

00:08:05.934 --> 00:08:08.472
So if you're starving and
you steal something to eat,

00:08:08.472 --> 00:08:10.104
you could be hanged,

00:08:10.104 --> 00:08:12.993
and so many of the English gentry,

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:14.445
the people in Parliament,

00:08:14.445 --> 00:08:15.641
are looking around and saying,

00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:16.529
"Alright, what's going on?

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.565
"Are we having a moral crisis?"

00:08:18.565 --> 00:08:20.454
Because they don't think in terms

00:08:20.454 --> 00:08:22.137
that say, "Alright, many people are poor.

00:08:22.137 --> 00:08:23.456
"Maybe they're going to steal."

00:08:23.456 --> 00:08:25.585
Instead, they're saying,
"Why are people stealing?

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:26.863
"What's wrong with people?"

00:08:26.863 --> 00:08:30.577
And so they think of this
as surplus population,

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:33.928
say there are too many people in England.

00:08:33.928 --> 00:08:36.592
Now this is patently untrue

00:08:36.592 --> 00:08:38.658
because there are way more people

00:08:38.658 --> 00:08:40.139
living in London today

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:43.145
than there were in all of
England at that time period,

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:44.921
but the English Parliament,

00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:47.297
sort of major thinkers in England,

00:08:47.297 --> 00:08:50.094
start to think that there are
too many people in England.

00:08:50.094 --> 00:08:51.639
There are just too many people

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:54.121
for having enough stuff to go around,

00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:55.789
and so they start wondering.

00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:57.769
Maybe these people should go elsewhere.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:00.352
Maybe they should go to colonies

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:02.708
where maybe they can buy more goods,

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.902
produce more raw materials,

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:08.636
and find a different place
in the social structure

00:09:08.636 --> 00:09:10.244
and economy of England,

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:11.839
and that starts to come true

00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:16.635
when the Virginia Company
sets off for Jamestown,

00:09:16.635 --> 00:09:18.968
which they'll reach in 1607,

00:09:21.436 --> 00:09:23.591
and we'll talk about
that in the next video.
