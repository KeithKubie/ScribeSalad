00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.970
The highwheelers are kind of fascinating.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.980
High wheelers were sort of this thrill seeking
technology ridden mostly by athletic young

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.610
men and the bigger the wheel, the faster you
could go.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.590
There are stories of practices where when
they started going down hill, the pedals were

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.250
directly connected to the front wheel, and
so as fast as the wheels spinnig, so are the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.160
pedals and when they are going down hill and
going too fast, it can be hard to keep your

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.090
feet on there and so some of the young men
would throw their legs over the handlebars

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.230
and they could sort of leap off the bike if
it was crashing so that they wouldn't get

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
all tangled up.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.860
The types of bicycles we ride today, something
like this, when that was invented that became

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.580
known as the safety bicycle since it was much
safer.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.890
Prior to the invention of mountain biking,
there was a bike boom in the early 1970s.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.920
More people came to see bicycles as a potential
viable mode of transportation especially in

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.860
the face of rising concerns about the environment.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.970
I interviewed a lot of the early mountain
bikers and I also went riding with a lot of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.750
them, which was actually really crucial.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.760
I learned as much going riding with them as
I did sitting down talking with them.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.110
Mountain biking as we know it today really
did start in Marin County, just north of San

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.160
Francisco.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.440
It was begun by a group of people that were
more into biking for adventures and what they

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.610
would do is they would take old pre World
War II Schwinn Cruiser bikes and get a ride

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.270
in a pick-up truck to the top of Mt. Tamalpais
and then proceed to rocket down it down this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.840
mountain on the dirt trails as fast as they
could and race to the bottom.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.960
Parts often broke on them as they were riding
and so they would learn well this type of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.530
hub tends to break sooner than this other
type of hub so we're all going to try and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.000
have the good hub.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
Essentially it was an iterative process such
that they found eventually the best parts

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.509
to put on a bike.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.670
So what is fascinating about this bike is
that its very well traveled you could say.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.360
The frame was built in Marin County, but then
we have the Brooks Saddle from the UK, we

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.620
have the derailleur from Suntour in Japan,
we have the TA Crank set from France, we have

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.129
a seat post from Italy just to produce this
one bike.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.099
Bikers started to have more tension with hikers
and horseback riders in Marin.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.900
It did subsequently lead to the shutting down
of most single track trails to mountain bikes

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.200
in Marin County.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.280
Other factions in the area built their own
trails and so people have actually built really

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.480
fascinating trails that are built for riding
in a pleasing fashion to create what they

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.200
call a flow experience.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.790
A trail becomes for a trained mountain biker,
a line moving through that tells you where

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.559
your bicycle is supposed to go.

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:07.029
All these sort of experiences were all inter-meshed.

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.819
Gary Fisher knew the Grateful Dead because
he had encountered them when he had raced

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.870
in the Tour Del Mar bike race.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.989
Which was both a road biking race and a folk
rock festival.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.870
I mean today, how often would you expect a
band like the Grateful Dead to play at a bike

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.010
race?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.980
These aren't the sort of connections you'd
make today, but in that moment in that place

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.540
that made sense, because bikes and the music
scene were seen as a sort of groovy thing

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:55.290
that was going to help make the world into
the place we wanted 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:03.459
it to be.
