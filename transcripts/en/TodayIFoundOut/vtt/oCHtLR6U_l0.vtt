00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.060
You Actually Use All of Your Brain, Not 10%

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.779
Over the years, the myth that you only use
about 10% of your brain has been widely spread

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.980
with the source of this myth often falsely
attributed to Albert Einstein.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.879
It turns out though, that every part of the
brain gets used, despite what Hollywood; snake-oil

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.990
type self help peddlers; and many others would
have you believe.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.170
All other evidence aside, intuitively, if
90% of the brain wasn’t used for anything,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.929
then damage to those parts of the brain that
comprise that 90% wouldn’t affect a person

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.039
at all.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.200
In reality though, damage to just about any
part of the brain, even tiny amounts of damage,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.000
tends to have profound effects on the person
who suffers that damage, at least in the short

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
term.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.560
Further, given the amount of your body’s
resources your brain uses, if 90% of it were

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.410
worthless, it would be an incredible waste
of those resources.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.100
For more concrete evidence, brain scans, courtesy
of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.450
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
technologies, show us that even while we are

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.219
sleeping every part of the brain shows at
least a small amount of activity and most

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.990
areas of the brain are active at any given
moment, assuming the person being scanned

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.880
hasn’t ever suffered some form of brain
damage.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.109
Amazing amounts of research have gone into
mapping the brain, in terms of figuring out

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.350
the function of various parts of the brain,
and, to date, no area has been found that

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.420
doesn’t have some function, even though
that function may not be yet wholly understood.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.400
So where did this myth really come from?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.009
There are a few potential sources, though
no one knows for sure.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.159
Probably the most popularly cited source is
Harvard psychologists William James and Boris

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.189
Sidis with their “reserve energy” theories
in the late 19th/early 20th century.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.359
“We are making use of only a small part
of our possible mental and physical resources”.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.959
Sidis even put the theories to practice raising
his son, William Sidis, who was a child prodigy

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.979
and for a time considered the smartest human
alive, by IQ anyways; though Boris Sidis dismissed

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.060
tests trying to measure intelligence as “silly,
pedantic, absurd, and grossly misleading”.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.390
The “reserve energy” theory was later
summarized, by Lowell Thomas, down to “the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.610
average person develops only 10% of their
latent mental ability,” which of course

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.709
at some point could well have evolved in popular
culture into “you only use 10% of your brain.”

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.349
Another theory is that it lies in misinterpretation
of neurological research, for instance, research

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.720
in the early 20th century indicated that only
10% of the neurons in the brain are firing

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.319
at any given instant.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.530
Alternatively, research indicating only about
10% of the brain is composed of neurons, with

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.970
the rest being glial cells, which support
and regulate neurons in various ways.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.299
As to why the myth became popular, it’s
easy to see why people would be drawn to such

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.310
a notion.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.220
Everybody would love to have it be the case
that they naturally only use 10% of their

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.550
potential brain power.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.099
Thus, if they could just magically unlock
even a little of the other 90%, they could

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.780
be the next Albert Einstein or perhaps even
develop telekinetic or psychic powers, as

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.750
is often pushed by Hollywood and others when
this myth is mentioned.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.450
Even today, numerous self help books and seminars
are devoted to trying to help you unlock that

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.560
mythical other 90%.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.530
In the end, we’re better off using that
time and money to try to further develop the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:39.049
supposed “10%” we already use.
