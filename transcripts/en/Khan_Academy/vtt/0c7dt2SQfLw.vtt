00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.019
In the last video we defined the
notion of a determinant of

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.160
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.490
So if I have some matrix-- let's
just call it B-- if my

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.710
matrix B looks like this, if
its entries are a, b, c, d,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.490
we've defined to determinant
of B.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.910
Which could also be written as
B with these lines around it,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
which could also be written as
the entries of the matrix with

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.690
those lines around
it, a, b, c, d.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.250
And I don't want you to
get these confused.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.420
This is the matrix when
you have the brackets.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.930
This is the determinant of the
matrix, when you just have

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.360
these straight lines.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.760
And this, by definition, was
equal to ad minus bc.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.270
And you saw in the last video,
or maybe you saw in the last

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.195
video, what the motivation
for this came from.

00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:53.010
When we figured out the inverse
of B, we determined

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:02.500
that it was equal to 1 over ad
minus bc times another matrix,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.110
which was essentially these
two entry swaps, you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.340
got a d and an a.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.190
And then these two entries
made negative, so

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.140
minus c and minus b.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.930
This was the inverse of b.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.560
And we said, well, when
is this defined?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.690
This is defined as long as this
character right here does

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.850
not equal 0.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.150
So you said hey, this looks
pretty important.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.005
Let's call this thing right
there the determinant.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.000
And then we could say that B is
invertible, if and only if,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.010
the determinant of B
does not equal 0.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.230
Because if it equals 0, then
this formula for your inverse

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.080
won't be well defined.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.970
And we just got this from our
technique of creating an

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.870
augmented matrix whatnot.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.530
But the big take away is we
defined this notion of a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.120
determinant it for
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.120
Now the next question is, well
that's just a 2 by 2,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.950
everything we do in linear
algebra, we like to generalize

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.930
it to higher numbers of
rows and columns.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.980
So the next step, at least--
let's just do baby steps--

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.470
let's start with a 3 by 3.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.870
Let's define what its
determinant is.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.750
So let me construct a
3 by 3 matrix here.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.160
Let's say my matrix A is equal
to-- let me just write its

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.100
entries-- first row, first
column, first row, second

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.460
column, first row,
third column.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.920
Then you have a2
1, a2 2, a2 3.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.880
Then you have a3 1, third
row first column, a3

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.570
2, and then a3 3.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.730
That is a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.280
Three rows and three columns.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.660
This is 3 by 3.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.110
I am going to define the
determinant of A.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.630
So this is a definition.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.720
I'm going to define the
determinant of this 3 by 3

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.010
matrix A as being equal to--
and this is a little bit

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.110
convoluted, but you'll get the
hang of it eventually.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.890
In the next several videos we're
just going to do a ton

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.350
of determinants.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.155
So it just becomes a bit of
second nature to you.

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:13.770
It's a little computationally
intensive sometimes.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.600
But it equals this first row.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.080
It equals a1 1 times the
determinant of the matrix you

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.020
get, if you get rid of this
guy's column and row.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.650
So if you get rid of this guy's
column and row, you're

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.040
left with this matrix here.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:39.040
So times the determinant of the
matrix a2 2, a2 3, a3 2,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.140
and then a3 3.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.010
Just like that.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.490
So that's our first entry
and that's a plus this.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.680
And then I said it's a plus
this, because the next entry's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.330
going to be a minus.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.610
You have a minus this
guy right here.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.580
So then you're going to have
minus a1 2 times the matrix

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.200
you get if you eliminate
his column and his row.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.210
So times, you're going to get
these entries right there.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:18.660
So a2 1, a2 3, a3 1, and
then you have a3 3.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.089
We're not quite done.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:21.839
You could probably guess with
the next one's going to be.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.550
Then you're going to have a
plus-- let me switch to a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.430
better color-- plus this guy.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.210
Plus a1 3 times the determinant
of its-- I guess

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.850
you could call it--
its sub-matrix.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.930
We'll call it that for now.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.750
So this matrix right here.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.680
So a2 1, a2 2, a3 1, a3 2.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.130
This is our definition of the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.860
determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.870
And the motivation is, because
when you take the determinant

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.240
of a 3 by 3 it turns out-- I
haven't shown it to you yet--

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.590
that the property is the same.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.410
That if the determinant of this
is 0, you will not be

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.190
able to find an inverse.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.370
And when I defined determinant
in this way.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.590
If the determinant does not
equal 0, you will be able to

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.210
find an inverse.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.200
So that's where this
came from.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.820
And I haven't shown
you that yet.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.540
And I might not show you
because it's super

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.230
computational.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.580
It'll take a long time.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.260
It'll be very hairy and I'll
make careless mistakes.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.220
But the motivation comes from
the exact same place as the 2

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.430
by 2 version.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.660
But I think what you probably
want to see right now is at

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.050
least just this thing applied
to an actual matrix, because

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.480
this looks all abstract
right now.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.790
But if we do it with an actual
matrix, you'll actually see

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.490
it's not too bad.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.430
So let's leave the definition up
there, and let's say that I

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:52.820
have the matrix 1, 2, 4, 2, 2,
minus 1, 3, and 4, 0, 1.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.070
So by our definition of a
determinant, the determinant

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.410
of this guy right here-- so
let's say I call that matrix

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.230
C-- C is equal to that.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.140
So if we want to figure out
the determinant of C, the

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.690
determinant of C is equal to--
I take this guy right here,

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.260
let me take that 1-- times the
determinant of-- let's just

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.180
call it the submatrix,
right here.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:24.990
So we have a minus 1, we
have a 3, we have a 0,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.570
and we have a 1.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.520
Just like that.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.010
Notice, I got rid of
this guy's column

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.690
and this guy's row.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.865
And I was just left with
minus 1, 3, 0, 1.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.460
Next, I take this guy.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.930
And this is the trick.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.160
You have to alternate signs.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.550
If you start with a positive
here, this next one's going to

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.690
be a minus.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.710
So you're going to have minus 2
times the submatrix-- we can

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.250
call it-- if we get rid
of this guy's column

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.000
and this guy's row.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.630
So 2, 3, 4, 1.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.970
I just blanked this out.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.310
If I could videotape my finger,
I would cover my

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.700
finger over this column right
here and over that row, and

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.640
you'd just see a 2,
a 3, a 4, and a 1.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.280
And that's what I
put right there.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.720
And then finally, we went
plus, minus, plus.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.810
So finally, we'll have plus 4
times the determinant of the

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.200
submatrix, if you get rid of
that row in that column.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.260
So 2, minus 1, 4, 0.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.660
Now, these are pretty
straightforward.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.660
These are not too
bad to compute.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.350
Let's actually do it.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.030
So this is going to be equal
to 1 times what?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.460
Minus 1 times 1.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.130
Let me just write it out.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:44.240
Minus 1 times 1, minus
0 times 3.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.330
This just comes from the
definition of a 2 by 2

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:46.820
determinant.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.360
We've already defined that.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:55.300
And then we're going to have
a minus 2 times 2 times 1,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.260
minus 4 times 3.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:03.120
And then finally, we're going to
have a plus 4 times 2 times

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:10.165
0 minus minus 1 times 4.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.410
I wrote it all out
so you can see.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.320
This thing right here is just
this thing right here.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.560
And then you have
the 4 out front.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.910
This thing right here was just
this thing right here.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.380
So it's the determinant of the
2 by 2 submatrix for each of

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.350
these guys.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.910
And if we compute this, this is
equal to-- minus 1 times 1

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.230
is minus 1.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.630
Minus 0, that's 0.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:38.440
So this is a minus 1 times
1, so that's a minus 1.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.950
And then we get-- what
is this equal to?

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.580
This right here is 12.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.040
So you get 2 minus 12.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.530
Right?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.280
You get 2 times 1
minus 4 times 3.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.200
So it's minus 10.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.300
So that is equal to minus 10.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.000
And then you have a minus
10 times a minus 2.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.400
So that becomes a
plus 20, right?

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.450
Minus 2 times minus 10.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.340
And then finally, in the green,
we have 2 times 0,

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.770
that's just a 0.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.340
And then you have minus 1 times
4, which is minus 4.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.800
Then you have a minus sign
here, so it's plus 4.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.630
So this all becomes a plus 4.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.290
Plus 4 times 4 is
16, so plus 16.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.320
And what do we get when
we add this up?

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:29.830
We get 20 plus 16 minus 1.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.430
It is equal to 35.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.030
We're done.

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.570
We found the determinant
of our 3 by 3 matrix.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.380
Not too bad.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:47.450
Right there, so that is equal
to the determinant of C.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.040
So the fact that this isn't
0 tells you that C is

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.290
invertible.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.950
In the next video, we'll try
to extend this to n by n

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.200
square matrices.
