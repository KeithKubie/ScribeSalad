00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
beech piece wood of course I didn't know
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240
beech piece wood of course I didn't know
but it was raving you're interesting it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
but it was raving you're interesting it
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.089
but it was raving you're interesting it
was wonderful in this team you were the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
was wonderful in this team you were the
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009
was wonderful in this team you were the
constructor you've been working on this

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
constructor you've been working on this
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.490
constructor you've been working on this
experiment for decades did you ever have

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
experiment for decades did you ever have
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220
experiment for decades did you ever have
moments of doubts yeah yeah everybody

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
moments of doubts yeah yeah everybody
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290
moments of doubts yeah yeah everybody
asked me that yeah no no no that has

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
asked me that yeah no no no that has
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299
asked me that yeah no no no that has
nothing to do with doubts it's the wrong

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
nothing to do with doubts it's the wrong
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.630
nothing to do with doubts it's the wrong
question I will tell you what I'll tell

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640
question I will tell you what I'll tell
 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.569
question I will tell you what I'll tell
you it no no I'll give you the an answer

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
you it no no I'll give you the an answer
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.090
you it no no I'll give you the an answer
but you will I hope accept and that is

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
but you will I hope accept and that is
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.880
but you will I hope accept and that is
that what we do and I'm an experimenter

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
that what we do and I'm an experimenter
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.110
that what we do and I'm an experimenter
and most of the people who worked on

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
and most of the people who worked on
 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.340
and most of the people who worked on
this thing that were theorists as well

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
this thing that were theorists as well
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.619
this thing that were theorists as well
every day is an interesting day

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
every day is an interesting day
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.529
every day is an interesting day
in other words you're not always

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
in other words you're not always
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.750
in other words you're not always
thinking about you know what's going on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
thinking about you know what's going on
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.160
thinking about you know what's going on
in the future and you certainly don't

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
in the future and you certainly don't
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320
in the future and you certainly don't
sit there saying oh my god we haven't

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
sit there saying oh my god we haven't
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.090
sit there saying oh my god we haven't
detected gravitational waves yet that's

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
detected gravitational waves yet that's
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160
detected gravitational waves yet that's
not what you're thinking about what

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
not what you're thinking about what
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.570
not what you're thinking about what
you're thinking about is here's this

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
you're thinking about is here's this
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.800
you're thinking about is here's this
wonderful circuit that you've just

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
wonderful circuit that you've just
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.750
wonderful circuit that you've just
designed it doesn't work today but you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
designed it doesn't work today but you
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.160
designed it doesn't work today but you
do a little fixing and it works and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
do a little fixing and it works and
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.420
do a little fixing and it works and
everybody is very happy with that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
everybody is very happy with that
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160
everybody is very happy with that
and the next day there's another thing

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
and the next day there's another thing
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.469
and the next day there's another thing
that you have to have trying to make it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
that you have to have trying to make it
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.890
that you have to have trying to make it
work and again you're continually busy

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
work and again you're continually busy
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450
work and again you're continually busy
with the business of making the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
with the business of making the
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.520
with the business of making the
experiment go and making it better and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
experiment go and making it better and
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.219
experiment go and making it better and
that's an enormous pleasure and the fact

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229
that's an enormous pleasure and the fact
 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.590
that's an enormous pleasure and the fact
is that you that keeps you going you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
is that you that keeps you going you
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.480
is that you that keeps you going you
don't think about the end result and the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
don't think about the end result and the
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100
don't think about the end result and the
other piece of it is as long as the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
other piece of it is as long as the
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.510
other piece of it is as long as the
group of people you're working with are

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
group of people you're working with are
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609
group of people you're working with are
convivial which they are in this case

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
convivial which they are in this case
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.760
convivial which they are in this case
it's it is a wonderful prospect that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
it's it is a wonderful prospect that
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.530
it's it is a wonderful prospect that
you're working with people you enjoy you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
you're working with people you enjoy you
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.760
you're working with people you enjoy you
go out when something really works you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
go out when something really works you
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350
go out when something really works you
go out and have a beer you know I mean

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
go out and have a beer you know I mean
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389
go out and have a beer you know I mean
it's a thing you don't think about the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
it's a thing you don't think about the
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920
it's a thing you don't think about the
end point and then of course when the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
end point and then of course when the
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.090
end point and then of course when the
end point happened it was really

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
end point happened it was really
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.609
end point happened it was really
wonderful but it wasn't the whole reason

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
wonderful but it wasn't the whole reason
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.289
wonderful but it wasn't the whole reason
we were doing this we were having fun

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
we were doing this we were having fun
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.649
we were doing this we were having fun

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
and you've got to recognize that I mean
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.050
and you've got to recognize that I mean
are you familiar with the characteristic

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
are you familiar with the characteristic
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.300

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969
yeah I don't give up I'd rather have
that they have fun with the grid yeah

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
that they have fun with the grid yeah
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.290
that they have fun with the grid yeah
but you yeah but how - how

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
but you yeah but how - how
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.660
but you yeah but how - how
how do you do that very good what you do

how do you do that very good what you do
 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910
how do you do that very good what you do
is you teach them you know you find out

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920
is you teach them you know you find out
 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.670
is you teach them you know you find out
very quickly if they want to be somebody

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
very quickly if they want to be somebody
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.680
very quickly if they want to be somebody
who builds things you make help them

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
who builds things you make help them
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.510
who builds things you make help them
build things you help them design things

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520
build things you help them design things
 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.000
build things you help them design things
so that their inventiveness and their

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
so that their inventiveness and their
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.730
so that their inventiveness and their
interest is maintained I mean I'm

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740
interest is maintained I mean I'm
 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.170
interest is maintained I mean I'm
talking about experimenters I mean have

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
talking about experimenters I mean have
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.760
talking about experimenters I mean have
a much easier time than people who do

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770
a much easier time than people who do
 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.340
a much easier time than people who do
theory theory have a harder time with so

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350
theory theory have a harder time with so
 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.660
theory theory have a harder time with so
there is this thing that you have built

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
there is this thing that you have built
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.820
there is this thing that you have built
it's in front of you the children love

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
it's in front of you the children love
 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.040
it's in front of you the children love
that children as the young people love

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050
that children as the young people love
 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.360
that children as the young people love
it in today and it's an accomplishment

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370
it in today and it's an accomplishment
 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.060
it in today and it's an accomplishment
and so you know they live with that and

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070
and so you know they live with that and
 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.770
and so you know they live with that and
for the next accomplishment and the next

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
for the next accomplishment and the next
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.190
for the next accomplishment and the next
one it's not great it has to be done

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200
one it's not great it has to be done
 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.540
one it's not great it has to be done
through that yes there's of course some

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
through that yes there's of course some
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.060
through that yes there's of course some
stick to witness yeah but the pact fact

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070
stick to witness yeah but the pact fact
 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.770
stick to witness yeah but the pact fact
is that if it isn't fun and it isn't

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780
is that if it isn't fun and it isn't
 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.780
is that if it isn't fun and it isn't
pleasure to do and it isn't interesting

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
pleasure to do and it isn't interesting
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.340
pleasure to do and it isn't interesting
with the other people around you you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350
with the other people around you you
 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.950
with the other people around you you
tend not to do it and that's the key

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960
tend not to do it and that's the key
 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.050
tend not to do it and that's the key
thing you see like oh must be like a

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
thing you see like oh must be like a
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.240
thing you see like oh must be like a
second home to you isn't it oh very much

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
second home to you isn't it oh very much
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.730
second home to you isn't it oh very much
so yeah yeah I'm you made a huge

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740
so yeah yeah I'm you made a huge
 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.160
so yeah yeah I'm you made a huge
construction and I am made a small one

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170
