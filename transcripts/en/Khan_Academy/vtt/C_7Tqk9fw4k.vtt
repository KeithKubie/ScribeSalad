00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.746
- [Voiceover] "Ksenia
wants to chop broccoli

00:00:01.746 --> 00:00:03.471
"and carrots for a competition.

00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:05.294
"It takes her the same number of seconds

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:08.231
"to chop each carrot, and
it takes her the same number

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:11.216
"of seconds to chop each broccoli head.

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:14.430
"Her goal is to chop
at least 20 vegetables

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.430
"with a time limit of
540 seconds," all right.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.821
"The graph below represents the set

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:25.814
"of all combinations of
carrots and broccoli.

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:29.436
"Inequality A," let's see,
"Inequality A represents

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:33.094
"the range of all combinations
Ksenia wants to chop."

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:36.363
Because she wants to chop
at least 20 vegetables.

00:00:36.363 --> 00:00:38.466
So, that's what Inequality
A is representing,

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.718
that she wants to chop
at least 20 vegetables.

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:43.133
So, all this blue shaded
area and even the line,

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.926
is a solid line so it
includes point on the line.

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:47.169
These are all of the scenarios

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:49.830
where she's chopping
at least 20 vegetables,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.697
all this blue area
including the blue line.

00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:55.716
And it says, "Inequality
B represents the range

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:59.478
of all combinations she can
chop with her time limit."

00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:03.634
So, Inequality B, this is
all of the combinations

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:05.968
where she is within her time limit,

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:10.968
where she is not spending
any more than 540 seconds.

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:13.582
"What is the least number of carrots

00:01:13.582 --> 00:01:17.202
Ksenia can chop while achieving her goal?"

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.619
Well, her goal, remember she wants to chop

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.255
at least 20 vegetables.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:22.241
So, you want to be in the blue area.

00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:24.435
You want to be in the solution set

00:01:24.435 --> 00:01:26.315
for Inequality A, which
would be the blue area

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.836
or on the blue line.

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:30.738
And she wants to achieve her goal

00:01:30.738 --> 00:01:32.364
of meeting the time limit.

00:01:32.364 --> 00:01:35.521
So, she needs to also
be in the solution set

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.564
for Inequality B so she also has to be in

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.651
the green area or on the green line.

00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.030
And so the overlap of the two,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.886
if she's meeting both constraints,

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:47.661
it's going to be all of this area.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.586
This is the overlap

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:58.208
of the two solution sets.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:02.307
So, in this overlap where is
the least number of carrots.

00:02:02.307 --> 00:02:03.932
"What is the least
number of carrots Ksenia

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:06.016
can chop while achieving her goal."

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:07.873
So, if we see here, the
least number of carrots,

00:02:07.873 --> 00:02:10.253
you might tempted to
say, "Okay, 20 carrots,

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:12.425
that is in the solution set."

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:16.629
That would be 20 carrots
and zero broccoli heads

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.310
but you can actually find a combination

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.133
that has even fewer carrots.

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:22.596
You can go all the way to this point

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:25.230
because remember the points on the lines

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.390
are also included in the solution sets,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.991
because they are solid
lines not dash lines.

00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.708
So, this point right over here,

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:34.843
10 carrots and 10 broccoli heads

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.491
actually meets her goal.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.368
So, let me write that down.

00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:42.328
10 carrots and

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:46.594
10 broccoli, 10 broccoli heads.

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:56.765
Let me just write that, 10 broccoli heads.

00:02:56.765 --> 00:02:58.123
So, that's the least amount.

00:02:58.123 --> 00:03:00.120
If you wanted to somehow figure out

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.836
less than 10 carrots, in
any of those scenarios

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:04.322
there's no overlap.

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:05.151
You know, if you say,
"Oh, is there any way

00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.649
"to do nine carrots?"

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.948
If you look over here there's no overlap

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:13.286
at c equals nine between
the two solution sets.

00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:14.749
So, the minimum right over here

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:15.767
is actually the point of intersection

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.067
of these two lines.

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:18.774
10 carrots, 10 broccoli heads

00:03:18.774 --> 00:03:21.490
that's the combination
that has her chopping

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.615
the minimum number of carrots

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:27.794
while achieving, frankly, her goals,

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:28.580
both of her goals.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.277
Being under time and chopping
at least 20 vegetables.
