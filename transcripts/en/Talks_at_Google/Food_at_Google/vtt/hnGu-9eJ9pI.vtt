[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.596
SPEAKER: Huge, warm
applause for Chef Mourad.

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.470
Thank you for coming.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.511
MOURAD LAHLOU: Thank you.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.400
First of all, before we start,
thank you for having me again.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.120
It's always nice to come
here and make the drive

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.290
and see the beautiful campus
and the beautiful people here.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.950
How many Moroccan
people are in here?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.470
None.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.750
So this is so
awesome because I can

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.249
say whatever the
fuck I want to say,

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.930
and nobody is going to
hold me accountable.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.650
No.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.650
But before we start, Marty
is one of my best friends.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.445
And I've known him for a long
time, and he works at Google.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:41.820
So I've been
getting the insights

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.450
on what goes on on
the campus and how

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.900
life is for a chef on
the campus as opposed

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.120
to the restaurant world.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.790
He's been with me on Iron Chef.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.160
He's been with me
when I wrote the book.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.890
He was very instrumental
in recipe development

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.420
and recipe testing.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.560
So thank you, Marty.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.690
And it's so fitting
that you're here today.

00:01:06.684 --> 00:01:08.850
And also I want to give
thanks to Chef [? DeMare. ?]

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.760
He's the fellow in the back.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.370
He was responsible for putting
this whole demo together

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.980
and all the ingredients,
and he did a great job.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.390
So thank you, [? DeMare. ?]

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.060
So to start off, I just
want to talk a little bit

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.110
about Moroccan food.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.190
When I was growing
up, I had no intention

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.010
of becoming a cook or a chef.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.330
I had no idea how to cook.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.960
And I grew up in a regular
family, traditional family,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.020
with a lot of people
living in the same house.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.290
We were, I think,
12 or 13 people.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.180
And basically, the women
did all the cooking.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.350
The men did all the talking.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.140
And it seems like it
worked for a while.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.630
But when I came
here, it turned out

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.950
that there was a lot of
reasons why that was going on,

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.600
and I started to understand
the importance of food

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.140
to these women that I
grew up watching cooking.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.970
My parents got divorced, and my
mom was living with my grandpa,

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.080
so she spent a lot of
time in the kitchen,

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.370
and she did a lot of cooking.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.530
And I felt really bad
for her growing up,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.720
so I spent a lot of time
sitting next to her.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.330
But I had absolutely
no desire to cook,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
or I never understood
the importance of what

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.100
she was doing to my family.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.340
I grew up in one of the
most dysfunctional families,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.990
but it was the
food that actually

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.820
made us stick together.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.310
It was the glue that made
everybody in the family,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.440
no matter how much
they hated each other,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.750
come together to the same
table, the same round table,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.400
every day, three times a day.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.150
And that was the best therapy
that we could have asked for.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.910
But when I came to the
States, I came here

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.860
to become an economist
and work for a bank

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.131
and make a lot of money and
go back home and support

00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:49.630
everybody.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.140
[CHUCKLES] But that
didn't pan out.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.830
So when I came here,
I was really homesick.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.990
And I started calling
my family almost

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.580
on a daily basis until one
day, a few weeks later, when.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.260
I got the phone bill
from AT&amp;T. And it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.130
was so humongous, I was
like, fuck this shit.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.660
I'm not going to
call them everyday.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.550
So I had to come up
with a better way

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.960
of connecting with my family.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.612
Because I was really homesick.

00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:15.570
I didn't speak English.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.730
I didn't know anybody.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.870
I didn't have Marty
in my life back then.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.897
So it was pretty lonely.

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:23.730
But the best thing that
I could come up with

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.190
was reconnect with my
roots through foods.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.430
And that's when I started
to pay attention to food.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.610
And I was really
weirded out when

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.590
I saw people eating
in their cars

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.380
while driving to work,
people sipping coffee

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.900
and walking to wherever they--

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.700
nobody took the time.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.370
I realized that food
in America was mostly--

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.990
I'm not generalizing, here--
but it was mostly fuel.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.760
You put it in your body,
and it keeps you going.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.190
If you're tired,
you drink coffee.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.349
It gives you the impression
that you're not tired.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.640
And then when you eat, you
just put a bunch of calories

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.348
in your body, and it
gives you the energy

00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:02.410
to burn while you're working or
doing whatever you want to do.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.290
But I realized that in Morocco,
it was a little bit different.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.040
It was actually a social event.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.540
You go, and you eat
because you want

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.790
to connect with people, even
if you feel like arguing.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.630
And we used to argue a
lot around the table.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.279
And it was a ritual where in
the morning, we would wake up.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.500
It was frantic, chaotic.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.000
My mom, my grandma,
my aunt, would

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.740
go to the kitchen earlier.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.040
Make breakfast, pancakes,
coffee, tea, butter

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.120
and all that shit.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.820
Put it on a big table, and then
we would all gather around it.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.530
But we were arguing
like a Jewish family,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.420
like you guys have
seen them in movies.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.340
We argued during breakfast.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.980
And what we'd do
is we'd decide what

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.990
we were going to have
for lunch every day

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.490
while we were having breakfast.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.180
And then when breakfast is
over, the kids go to school,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.270
the grownups go to work,
people stay at home to cook,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.310
and then grandpa
will go to the market

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.610
and get the vegetables and
the meats and all of that.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.930
And every day is the same
story, where people debate

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.205
what they want to have for
lunch, and then he listens,

00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:02.580
and he goes to
the market, and he

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.663
gets whatever the fuck he
wants and brings it back

00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:05.610
and dumps it.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.650
And he goes away, and
they have to cook it.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.010
So in a way, it was the
ritual that we had every day.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.510
But I never understood
how important

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.718
that was, those interactions.

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:17.310
No matter how dysfunctional,
brutal, combative

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.630
it can be sometimes.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.590
It was really important that
we would go through that.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.480
And that's why I
got into cooking.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.890
So I finished my master's
degree in economics.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.820
And by the time I was done,
I had this really huge fear

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.650
that if I went on to go get
a PhD or go work for a bank

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.680
immediately, I would be
forced not to cook anymore.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.020
And that's when the fear
settled in, and I said,

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.190
well, I'm going to just open
a restaurant for three months.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.700
Open it.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.860
At least I'm going to
have a place to go eat.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.740
And then I'll go back to
doing the big boy things

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.490
that I was supposed to do.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.550
Opened my first restaurant
with about $3,000.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.580
$3,700 that I had on my account.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.950
And that was in '96.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.340
And I never left.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.864
So I stumbled on
this thing, and it's

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.530
been the best thing
that happened to me.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.280
And as Scott said, I have never
worked for any chef before.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.170
I've never worked in
any kitchen before.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.300
And you can see from
the way I dress,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.480
I'm not the conventional
chef with the white and the--

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.400
I mean, you've known
me for a long time.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.460
So I just try to
have fun with food.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.130
I don't try to take
it too seriously.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.600
What we do is very technical.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.210
And the process that I went
through to get to this point

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.620
is teaching myself from memory.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.470
So I never had the
guts or the courage

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.320
to call my mom or call
anybody in Morocco

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.850
and ask them how
to make something,

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.560
because they will be
pretty much saying,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.880
why the hell did
you go to America

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.379
to learn how to make pancakes
or learn how to make couscous?

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.170
You could have stayed here, and
we would have made it for you,

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.378
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:06:46.378 --> 00:06:49.690
So I would literally sit
there and relive the moments

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.420
that I spent in the kitchen,
watching them make stuff.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.370
And that was a
double-edged sword.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.380
Because on one hand, it
allowed me to make stuff

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.210
from my own perspective, from my
own vision and my memory of it.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.399
And you literally-- I realized,
you can taste food in your head

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.940
before you even put
it in your mouth.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.795
You literally can taste it.

00:07:11.795 --> 00:07:13.420
And I would sit there,
I was like, yes.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.670
She was telling me
about my fucked aunt

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.216
and how she got divorced and
the kids were blah, blah, blah.

00:07:18.216 --> 00:07:19.840
And then she put the
onions in the pot.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.520
Then she added some spices.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.042
It looked kind of yellow, so
it must be turmeric or saffron

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:25.000
or something like that.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.810
So I would relive those
moments, and from there, I

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.680
would make the food.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.370
Obviously, the first couple
of times, it was disastrous.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.010
It literally was awful.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:37.240
But I just kept on going.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.460
Because first of
all, I was so broke

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.800
that I couldn't go to
restaurants and eat.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.050
And second of all, it
was the only way for me

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.490
to really stay connected.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.000
And that's how the
journey started.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.340
But obviously, you guys
are interested in food.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.070
And I hope that
somehow, when you cook,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.250
you have some connection to
wherever you're coming from

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.540
and wherever you're going
and things like that.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.740
So the food that
I end up making--

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.362
so I came here when I was 17.

00:08:05.362 --> 00:08:06.820
And I've been here
for a lot longer

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.944
than when I was in Morocco.

00:08:07.944 --> 00:08:11.230
So the food that I make now
is a reflection of who I am.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.840
So the roots are in Morocco.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.610
So I use a lot of ingredients
or techniques from Morocco,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.500
but obviously, I use a lot
of things from the Bay Area,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.480
especially from the
Bay Area in California.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.600
And as Marty can attest
to it, sometimes when

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.250
we cook together,
really, the line

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.301
is so blurry as to
what's really Moroccan

00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:30.300
and what's not Moroccan.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.280
But once we find that
spot, that sweet spot,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.890
where the two cultures
or the two cuisines

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.130
merge harmoniously,
then it becomes

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.320
something that is bigger
and better than both ends.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:42.820
Yes.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.810
AUDIENCE: Has your
family tasted your food?

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.750
MOURAD LAHLOU: Yes.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:47.680
It was really cool.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.620
Because after I started
cooking, I finally

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.600
brought my mom from Morocco.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.690
And for three months,
I was telling my staff,

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:57.340
this little Moroccan
woman is going

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:58.720
to come and kick your asses.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.920
She is so good.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.650
I mean, she's an
unbelievable cook.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.010
And then when she came,
she refused to cook.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.790
Because I served her dinner
the first day she came in.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.630
She tasted the food.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.220
She goes, I can taste
that it's Moroccan,

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.300
but I don't recognize it.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.690
I don't know how you did it.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.080
So that was the best compliment.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.480
Because to me the
fear has always

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.240
been am I getting too
far away from my roots.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.229
Am I just making food that
everybody else is making.

00:09:26.229 --> 00:09:27.520
And there was a struggle there.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.340
Because initially, when you
start thinking about food

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.380
and asking why is
it made this way

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.620
rather than just let's just
make food that tastes good.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.160
In Morocco, the
best chefs are those

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.890
who can make you taste
food, and it takes you back

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.200
in time to when you
were a little kid,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.320
or you were growing up with
your grandma, and you can say,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.110
oh, it tastes exactly like
that person used to make it.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.410
That's success for a great chef.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.020
When I came to America, I
realized that a lot of people

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.050
are more interested in
what's going to be done.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.770
Who's doing the most
innovative things.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.389
Who's mixing this with that.

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:03.430
Who's doing something that
I've never had before.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:08.270
That aspect of discovery
is really huge in America,

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.580
especially on the coasts,
California and New York.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.530
In Morocco, they
don't care about that.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.210
What they care about,
make me something

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.793
that is going to
take me back in time.

00:10:17.793 --> 00:10:22.120
That is the epitome of a
great chef or a great dish.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.410
So when she came, she was
able to taste those flavors,

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.210
but she had no idea
how it was made.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.930
And to me, that was
the best compliment.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.140
And obviously, she did not
do anything for three months.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:32.910
When she was staying
with me, she did not

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:34.690
cook anything whatsoever.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.390
She deserved it, because she
cooked for me for 17 years.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.280
So let's get on to some cooking.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.290
The first thing I'm
going to show you

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.170
is how to make preserved lemons
and how to make couscous.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.780
Couscous, I think, to me, is
one of the greatest dishes

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.760
that I brought from Morocco.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.410
When I first came
to the States, I

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.510
was petrified when I saw the
little boxes in the rice aisle,

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.134
at Safeway and Whole Foods.

00:11:02.134 --> 00:11:04.300
And you just-- you pick it
up, and I was so excited.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.799
I always liked
hand-rolled couscous,

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.260
but then you read
the directions,

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.764
and it literally says add
boiling water, and that it.

00:11:10.764 --> 00:11:11.430
That's couscous.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.210
So I was excited.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.670
Like, Americans are so smart.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.260
They figured this shit out.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.790
And then I followed
the directions,

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:18.930
and it was so awful.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.990
It was like it had absolutely
nothing to do with the couscous

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.929
that I grew up with.

00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:23.970
I thought I messed it up.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.130
And we got other boxes,
and I stopped making it.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.320
It never worked.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.270
So obviously, that
was frustrating.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.140
And hand rolling couscous
is almost like making pasta.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.680
And it was the hardest
chapter to write in the book.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.130
Because it's one of those things
where it's so simple when you

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.200
make it from start to finish.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:43.974
It's so simple.

00:11:43.974 --> 00:11:45.140
Once you get it, you get it.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.270
It's like riding a bicycle.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:46.920
You don't even think about it.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.290
You get on the bicycle,
you don't even say OK.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:50.520
These are the dynamics.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.020
This is the physics of it.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.353
You don't even think about that.

00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:55.090
You get on the
bicycle, and you roll.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.130
Couscous is like that.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.950
You will fail, fail, fail, fail,
and you will fall on your ass.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.460
You have to get up
again and do it again.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.210
It would be clumpy, it would
be mushy, it would be this,

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.918
it would be that.

00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:05.460
It would be so inconsistent,
but eventually, you will get it.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.500
And it just happens like that.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.790
I can't explain it.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.951
So to put that into words,
it was the hardest chapter

00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:12.450
to write.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.067
Because it has a
lot to do with feel.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.650
It has a lot to do
with understanding.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.870
And you talk to yourself
when you make couscous.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.050
It's virtually
impossible to be engaged

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.860
in a lot of conversation
and discussion

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.085
with other people around you.

00:12:24.085 --> 00:12:24.960
You have to be talk--

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.170
Like, you're making
it, and you're rolling

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.280
couscous in this big clay pot.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.620
And then you have to--

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.530
the granules from the semolina
are touching your hand,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.910
and you feel the edges.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.520
So do you guys know
about coarse semolina?

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.510
It comes from durum wheat.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.620
So it's basically a
really hard wheat.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.020
And you crack it, and
it has to be coarse.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.820
So when he's crushed--

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.440
I wish we had some visuals--

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.120
you have pieces of
semolina that have

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.400
all these angles and a lot of
surfaces, like little diamonds.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.170
And when you see
couscous, you want

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.690
to avoid the contact
between the semolina.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.640
So if you have two
pieces of semolina that

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.520
have surfaces like this,
and there's touching,

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.290
there's a lot of
contact, and that's

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.780
what makes semolina and
couscous stick together,

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.660
and they become clumpy.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.600
So the idea of
rolling couscous is

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.450
to get the biggest
pieces of semolina.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.230
And then you roll them
with flour and water,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.330
and you keep rolling them
and making these spheres

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.990
to basically even out the edges.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.750
And when you have two
spheres, the point of contact

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.660
is just one instead of
the pieces, all the pieces

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.020
connecting like this.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.867
You have the couscous basically
touching on only one point,

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:40.200
and that's what keeps it fluffy.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:43.530
That's what makes the steam go
through all the little spheres

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.330
and cook it without having
to glue it together.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.497
So there's a lot of science in
it, but we don't understand.

00:13:49.497 --> 00:13:50.830
I mean, we don't think about it.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.590
But when I start
cooking that stuff,

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.430
I am asking myself why
certain things happen.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.160
Rather than just making them
the way we used to make them,

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.570
I want to understand
what was going on.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.697
So basically, we started
with coarse semolina.

00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:05.280
We're not going to
do the demo for how

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.192
to make couscous from scratch.

00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:08.650
But you start with
coarse semolina.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:09.150
You roll it.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.432
You dry it overnight.

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:11.640
And then that's what you get.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.598
You get something that
is very similar to this.

00:14:13.598 --> 00:14:16.500
And if you're really,
really good at it,

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.760
all the spheres should be
approximately the same size,

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.670
so when you steam
them, you don't end up

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.110
with some that are bigger,
that will take longer,

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:25.068
and some that are smaller,
that will get mushy.

00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:27.690
So it's just a scale, and it
takes a little bit of time.

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:29.490
And you have the
book, so please,

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.000
just take the time to
read it, and don't give up

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.860
if you fail the first time.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:35.726
It's a fun thing.

00:14:35.726 --> 00:14:38.100
You can do it and laugh at
yourself and with your friends

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:38.970
and whatever.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.400
And you can always turn
it into polenta, you know?

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.730
If it gets mushy or clumpy,
just add water or stock

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.820
and make it into polenta,
and nobody will even notice.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.050
So just go at it.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.790
So we figured out a
way at the restaurant

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.430
to make it just a
little bit faster.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.370
So you can see here, this
is the hand-rolled couscous.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.450
And what we do is we use
a little bit of stock.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.800
This is vegetable stock.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.220
And depending on
what you're going

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.670
to use the couscous with,
the couscous in itself,

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:14.480
every little grain, every little
sphere, it's so insignificant.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.182
It's nothing.

00:15:15.182 --> 00:15:16.390
You can put it in your mouth.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.000
It doesn't taste like
anything by itself.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.750
You can't tell
the texture of it.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.210
But together, it comes
together as being this really

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:24.880
great thing.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.840
And we eat couscous once a
week in Morocco, on Fridays.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.990
Because everybody goes to
the mosque before lunch.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.309
Everybody comes back home.

00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:33.600
And then you eat this couscous.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.380
And there's this story
where every single grain

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.660
is a step closer to heaven.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.000
So people on Friday, they
really want to go to heaven.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.430
So they just go pray,
come back home on time,

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.490
and just sit together,
and then they eat.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.650
And for each grain
that you consume,

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.240
it's one step further to heaven.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.320
For each grain that somebody
else consumes that you made.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.820
So we'd make two platters,
one for us at the house,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.300
and one to give away at
the mosque for poor people.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:03.230
For each grain that they
consume, it's two steps closer.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.060
So people tend to be more
giving than what they actually

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:07.300
keep at home.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:10.080
So there's a lot
of intellectualism

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.460
behind the couscous.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.002
It's not just like it's a side
dish or anything like that.

00:16:14.002 --> 00:16:15.960
There's a lot of stories
and a lot of mythology

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.080
that goes into it.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.450
So this is the couscous.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.150
And as I said, if you
want to make couscous

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.550
with some seafood,
then what I do

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:28.290
is this is a coucoussier, which
is basically a two-part vessel.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.370
The bottom part is
just like any pot.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.880
It basically has
liquid, vegetables,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.270
or any meat that you want
to cook with the couscous.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.500
On the top part is where
you steam the couscous.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.390
So basically, the steam--

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.245
we don't make a stock,
per se, in Morocco.

00:16:41.245 --> 00:16:42.120
We don't make stocks.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.390
We always cook-- we
start with water.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.957
But the bottom
part is the braise.

00:16:46.957 --> 00:16:48.165
So basically, the vegetables.

00:16:48.165 --> 00:16:50.190
So you make your own
stock as you cook.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.680
Then the meat goes in
there, and all the things

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.780
that are going to be
mounded on the couscous

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.180
will basically be at the
lower part, the wet stuff.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.520
And then the couscous
will be on top.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.464
And the idea is to
cook the couscous

00:17:01.464 --> 00:17:03.880
and flavor it with whatever
you're going to serve it with.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.660
So if it's seafood,
I tend to put--

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.599
so if I break down a fish,
I'll put the bones and the tail

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.614
and the fins in there.

00:17:10.614 --> 00:17:12.780
If I'm doing chicken, I'll
do the wings and the feet

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.390
and the head and all the scraps
and trim from the chicken.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.069
If it's lamb, I'll do the
bones and the fat and all that.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.970
It will be here at the bottom.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.270
The one thing in Morocco that
we do, and I've always question

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.270
this, is when you cook
couscous in Morocco,

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.770
it's not about the
meat or the vegetables.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.360
So people are so poor in
Morocco that the main thing

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.680
on the plate is never the meat.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.950
It's always the vegetable,
the sauce, and the bread

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.180
that you eat it with.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.090
So here in America, it's
the other way around.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.340
Where you go to a
restaurant, and you

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.130
get a plate that is probably
bigger than this, and half of

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.510
it is protein.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.890
It's a 28 ounce steak.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:55.570
It's a whole chicken.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.090
It's this and that.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:00.239
So for us, we don't like
to eat a lot of-- well,

00:18:00.239 --> 00:18:02.280
it's not like we don't
like to eat a lot of meat.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.840
We can't afford a lot of
meat, to buy a lot of meat.

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.580
So we take the meat, and we try
to extract as much flavor as

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.680
possible out of it.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.990
We like the hard parts,
like the shoulder

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.180
and the leg and the
knuckles and all of that.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.550
Nobody cares about
the rack of lamb.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.280
So for me, when I came here,
and I saw that the rack of lamb

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.070
was like $25 a pound, I
was like, this is crazy.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.870
It has the least
amount of flavor.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.330
It's tender, it's
clean, it looks pretty.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.440
It looks-- you know, it's
like perfect for Instagram.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.330
But it's literally like--

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.472
the shoulder has so
much more flavor,

00:18:35.472 --> 00:18:37.680
because of the connective
tissue, because of the fat,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.130
because of the bones,
because of the kind of meat.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.280
It's so gelatinous.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.250
And the ratio of fat and
skin and connective tissue

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:44.960
is so perfect.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.490
So if you go to a
butcher in Morocco,

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.580
you actually have to be
a really good customer

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.950
to get the shoulder.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.430
And if you're a bad
customer, you're

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.050
going end up with the
rack of lamb or the chops.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:03.030
So the one thing is we try to
extract as much as possible

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.639
from the proteins,
and to do that,

00:19:04.639 --> 00:19:06.180
we cook it for a
long period of time,

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:09.030
which is something that people
cannot afford to do in America,

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.050
because everybody works.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.970
You have 30 minutes to
make your food and eat it

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.107
and all of that stuff.

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:15.690
But in Morocco, we
have a lot of time,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.365
and it takes three hours
to extract the flavor.

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:20.490
So what we're going to do
is I'm going to show you,

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.620
first of all, how to
do the couscous the way

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.090
we do it at the restaurant.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.370
And for this simple
preparation, I'm

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.980
just going to start with
the vegetable stock.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.010
It's just made with water
and aromatics and vegetables.

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.350
You've got carrots,
celery, and onions.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.840
And basically what
I'm going to do--

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.180
so this is already made.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.290
And this is the
hand-rolled couscous.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.440
I'm going to take one of these.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:51.450
And you just put the hand-rolled
couscous in a mixing bowl.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.057
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any brands you trust?

00:19:54.057 --> 00:19:55.890
MOURAD LAHLOU: You know,
[? Justeau's ?] has

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.360
really good couscous.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.360
I would buy [? Justeau's ?] if
I were to buy it from the store.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.470
Anson Mills also has
really good couscous,

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.110
and they use really good
products, which is really cool.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:10.090
So yeah, those are
the two that I would--

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.400
Mideast.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.490
I think there's a brand in
the market called Mideast.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.180
They tend to be really bad.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:18.390
So I would avoid those.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:23.670
So we heat up the veg
stock to a slow simmer,

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.860
then we'll let it rest.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.350
I'm going to add a
little bit of saffron,

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.060
for the color and the flavor.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:32.910
Olive oil.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:36.300
And some salt.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.680
And you can see that
the recipe is so exact.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.350
All the grams are in my head.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.510
And you can also--

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.240
for people in Morocco
that use saffron,

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.650
it's a sign of affluence.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:51.134
That means that
you're really rich,

00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:52.300
and you make a lot of money.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.150
So even poor people
will kill themselves

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.400
when they have guests
to go get saffron.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.160
For most people, what
we use is turmeric.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.010
It has some flavor, but
it's not the same flavor.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.180
And I actually prefer it.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.950
So you can use a
combination of both,

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.850
or you can use just the saffron
if you want to impress anybody,

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:09.770
or you can just
use the turmeric.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.400
And turmeric right
now is really hot

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.210
because of the new discovered
health benefits to it.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:16.710
Yeah.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.270
So everybody is
fucking using turmeric.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.430
So once it gets to a little
simmer, and you can see it,

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:26.730
ideally, you want to
let it sit for about--

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.470
you can see a little
steam coming out.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:31.860
You want to let it sit for
about half an hour to infuse it

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.490
and get the flavor
out of the saffron.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.600
So we're just going to
accelerate this process.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.100
Then I'm going to
add the couscous

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.710
and the infusion together
and literally just

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.207
give them a little stir.

00:21:49.207 --> 00:21:51.540
And when Chef [? DeMare ?]
makes this at the restaurant,

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.850
he always uses a spoon,
and he never, ever

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.650
puts his hands in the couscous.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:59.105
Right, Chef [? DeMare? ?]

00:21:59.105 --> 00:21:59.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.600
MOURAD LAHLOU: Yeah.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.640
So you can see the couscous
is really like-- it's fluffy.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.780
It's not clumped up.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:11.400
It's not sticking together.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.050
And I'm going to let this
sit for about 15 minutes, 20

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.820
minutes, just so
that the couscous can

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.800
absorb all the moisture.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.740
And one thing about
gluten, it's very sticky.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.090
It's very starchy.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:28.530
So when people just use a
tremendous amount of liquid

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.140
with the couscous, that starch
is going to come out really

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:31.830
quickly.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.200
And the heat helps it come out.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.810
If you do the steaming
part instead of just adding

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.330
boiling water, if you
steam it, the starch

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.090
does not get out
all at once, and you

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:43.920
can contain it a little bit.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.870
So at this point,
we're just going

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.980
to pretend that the couscous
has been sitting there

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.980
for a few minutes.

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.920
And obviously, in Morocco,
we don't have plastic gloves.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.390
So I just want to be sanitary.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:22:59.530
But fuck it, man.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:00.050
No.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:01.740
That's how we do it.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.180
That's how we do it.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:06.780
So basically, all
you do is you go in,

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.070
and you literally
separate all the grains.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.900
And this takes a little minute.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.050
And if you can have--

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.750
if there's little clumps
that really are difficult,

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.700
and you don't have time
to-- just put them aside.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:21.720
Get rid of them.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.120
Until the whole
thing is pretty much

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.640
loose and ready to
go into the steamer.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.130
The steamer, over there at the
bottom, we just have water.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.440
And I'm just going to add some
carrots, celery, and onions.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.290
So it's going to be a very
clean tasting couscous.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.110
AUDIENCE: What's the general
gluten development goal?

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.660
Is it like there's gluten,
you have to deal with it.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.200
You want to try to minimize it.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.415
You're trying to not
worry about overworking

00:23:49.415 --> 00:23:50.457
it to create more gluten?

00:23:50.457 --> 00:23:51.831
MOURAD LAHLOU:
You can't really--

00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:53.410
I mean, this is what I'm saying.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:54.920
It's a feel thing.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.370
So if you really squeeze it
together, it will clump up.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.859
But if you just literally just
rub it between your hands,

00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:03.650
everything will fall
down back to the bowl,

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.600
but you're going to
be left with these.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.990
I usually will work these
to get them smaller.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:11.240
But now I'm just going to
do it a little bit quicker,

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.120
so that we can
expedite this process.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.090
But the idea is-- the
whole thing is gluten.

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.640
I mean, we tried to
make buckwheat couscous.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.370
It was disgusting.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.600
I think David Kinch, who
worked with Marty as well, he

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.890
was from [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.740
He called me about
five or six years ago,

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.490
and he was really
interested in developing

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.260
some sorts of couscous
that doesn't have gluten.

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.830
But I don't think
he was successful.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.570
I mean, shit happens
for some reason,

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.160
and this is what it
works the best way.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.330
And we tried a couple
of things, but we always

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.780
end up going back to this.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.537
So as you can see,
I'm just going

00:24:47.537 --> 00:24:48.620
to take a little bit here.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.830
That is pretty cool.

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.620
You can see, it's really loose.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.170
It's not like what you
would get if you were just

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.730
to pour boiling water on it.

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:02.330
So we're going to pretend that
this whole thing is loose,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.690
and then we're going to
go into the second part.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:10.930
So for the water, we have water.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:11.555
We have celery.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.570
And again, you can see
how precise this is.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.750
And another thing
that I want to talk

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.290
about, you guys
can all see this,

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.770
I'm sure you guys have
these two components

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.000
in your kitchen somehow.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.180
This is just a strainer,
and this is a pot.

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.210
And you just want to make sure
that the bottom of this steamer

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:40.470
does not touch the water.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.970
So there's plenty
of water in there.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:48.520
I'm just going to add the
carrots, celery, and onions.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.775
Bring it to a boil.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.330
And then once it
comes to a boil,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:06.860
I will just take the couscous
and put it in the steamer.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.247
And this will steam for about--

00:26:09.247 --> 00:26:11.330
the way we do it, it will
steam for about an hour.

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.699
And we'll take it out.

00:26:16.699 --> 00:26:18.990
So this is going to look like
shit on video, because it

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.190
has all these clumps.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.450
But we're just going to
pretend that they're not here.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:30.970
So this will steam
for about an hour.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.480
Once it's steamed, we'll take
it into a big mixing bowl,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.430
and we're going to fluff
it again and get rid

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.410
of the clumps, and then
put it back in there.

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:41.980
So you get rid of all the
heat from it, you put it back,

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.400
and you restart again
for another 15 minutes.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.050
Take it out.

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:46.589
And you do it four times.

00:26:46.589 --> 00:26:48.130
And after four times,
four steamings,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.380
that's when you get
the right couscous.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:56.250
This is couscous that has been
steamed three times already.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.150
And you can see it
doubles in size.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:03.100
So from the little grains
that we had, these.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.700
From the little spheres
to this is double in size.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.400
So it absorbed all the
liquid and all the moisture

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.490
that we wanted it to absorb.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:17.359
And basically, it's all loose.

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:19.150
And Chef [? DeMare ?]
did a really good job

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.024
at separating all of these.

00:27:21.024 --> 00:27:23.440
So what I'm going to do, I'm
going to put it back in here,

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.280
in the big steamer.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.260
This is the traditional
Moroccan steamer.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:30.059
And this will steam for
another 15, 20 minutes.

00:27:30.059 --> 00:27:31.600
And this will be
part of the couscous

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.820
we're going to serve you.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.840
So couscous in itself does
not have a lot of flavor,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:45.470
but it becomes a vehicle for
adding a lot of flavor to food.

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.250
So whatever you
serve couscous with,

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.230
that's what's going
to be emphasized.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:52.270
One of my favorite
ways to eat couscous

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.000
is basically with brown
butter and preserved lemons.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.876
That is the simplest way to
eat couscous and enjoy it.

00:27:58.876 --> 00:28:01.000
We get a little bit too
technical at the restaurant

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.290
with preparations and dishes.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.880
We change them seasonally.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.010
I'm going to show you
a way that we do it

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.480
right now for a tasting menu,
where we do it with pumpkin

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.760
because of the season.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.000
And sea urchin and roe.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.170
So we'll do that
in a little bit.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:18.410
But we're just going to wait
for this couscous to come up.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.380
But as you can see, it's
really a cool process.

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.550
It's very meditative.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.340
And when you do it, it
takes a couple hours,

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.840
but it's really
worth it at the end.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.440
Because once you get into
eating really good couscous,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.046
it's really hard and impossible
to go to the box stuff.

00:28:33.046 --> 00:28:34.270
AUDIENCE: You don't cover it?

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:35.020
MOURAD LAHLOU: No.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.220
I don't cover it.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.080
A lot of people do
cover it, or they

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:44.119
do cheese cloth, like this
little thing, at the bottom.

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:46.160
Because they're afraid
that the couscous is going

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.670
to make it through the holes.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.030
I don't worry about that.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.740
The weight of the
couscous will basically

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.480
keep it from going down.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.580
A couple of grains might--
a couple of spheres

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.000
might go down to the
water, but who cares.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.780
Any questions, you guys?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.010
AUDIENCE: Is the general
goal of the steaming,

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.891
really are you just
trying to cook the starch?

00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:06.640
MOURAD LAHLOU: So the
goal of the steaming

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.960
is basically to
give it the moisture

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.770
that it needs to fluff
up without giving it

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.030
the liquid itself.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.540
So it's a gradual
addition of moisture.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.970
So you have this hard piece of--

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:21.420
it's almost like a pasta.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.340
It is a pasta.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.960
So you have this sphere.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.060
You want to give
it as much moisture

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.372
as it needs to fluff
up to the fullest,

00:29:30.372 --> 00:29:32.580
but you don't want to pour
the liquid directly on it.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.406
So that's why we steam it.

00:29:33.406 --> 00:29:34.256
It gets trapped.

00:29:34.256 --> 00:29:35.630
So all the steam
that's coming up

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.450
is the excess that would have
otherwise gone into the grains

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:41.660
if you were to pour the
water or the liquid in it.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.424
So it's really a cool process.

00:29:43.424 --> 00:29:44.840
And I think it's
really ingenious.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.650
I don't know who
invented couscous.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.590
It's very popular
in North Africa.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.710
It's very popular in Europe.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:57.320
When the Moors invaded Europe,
they took with them couscous.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.760
And that is one
of the things that

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.950
stayed with Europe
when the Moors were

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.250
kicked back out of Europe.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.406
Hi.

00:30:05.406 --> 00:30:11.330
AUDIENCE: What's the purpose
of the third [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:12.620
MOURAD LAHLOU: It's ready.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.570
It's cold, so we need
just to heat it up.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.070
Yes.

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.280
So I would rather give
it to you warm than cold.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.170
So we're just heating it up.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:24.340
And it's just we figured out the
timing that it needs to cook,

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.260
and we just split it,
so that we would never

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.865
give it too much steaming at
one time and make it mushy.

00:30:30.865 --> 00:30:34.532
So the more periods that
you do it, the better.

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:35.490
It's like with risotto.

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:38.870
You keep adding little by little
rather than just giving it

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.292
everything in one shot.

00:30:40.292 --> 00:30:40.828
AUDIENCE: And what's the bottom.

00:30:40.828 --> 00:30:41.900
It's just water or?

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.890
MOURAD LAHLOU: Water, carrots,
onions, bay leaves, thyme.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:49.010
You can do a lot of aromatics
that you have in the kitchen.

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.850
I'll tell you what, if you
don't have to warm it up,

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.933
you can just put it in a
pint container like this,

00:30:56.933 --> 00:30:59.170
and put it in the microwave,
and it would be awesome.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.830
So this last step, literally,
it's the same couscous,

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.780
and you can literally just add
a little bit of stock or water,

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:10.689
put it in the microwave, and
zip it for maybe a minute,

00:31:10.689 --> 00:31:12.230
depending on your
microwave, and then

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.550
it will be nice and fluffy.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:17.420
Because I don't know if you
guys use microwaves here,

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.330
but it's one of the greatest
inventions of all times.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:22.850
I have absolutely no
probably using microwaves.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.680
I think they're great.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.410
But when I discovered
that I could use it

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:31.010
to steam couscous for the
last steaming, it was like--

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.630
I felt like Einstein.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:34.460
I really did.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.300
And it comes out
really perfectly.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.695
And the fact that the
pint container is sealed,

00:31:39.695 --> 00:31:41.070
there's liquid in
there, and it's

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.650
steamed because
of the microwave,

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.810
because of the mechanics of it.

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.880
And then it steams within
this contained container,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.710
and it's magic.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.440
It's really one of the
greatest inventions.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.560
So while the couscous is going
on, I'm going to move on.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:59.286
How much time do we have?

00:31:59.286 --> 00:32:00.750
AUDIENCE: 20 plus minutes.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:01.920
MOURAD LAHLOU: OK.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.850
So we're going to move on
to the second greatest thing

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:08.040
that Moroccans have contributed
to the world of food,

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.010
and that is preserved lemons.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.190
Growing up in Morocco,
I came from Marrakesh,

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.210
where we have a lot of citrus.

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.170
And when we have that
must citrus coming out,

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.710
and the trees are full, we
don't know what to do with it.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.880
We're not into lemonade, so we
don't make a lot of lemonade.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.790
We don't use lemon
juice, necessarily,

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:31.070
to season stuff, salads
and things like that.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.740
We like vinegars because
they're more fermented,

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:40.410
and they have a deeper
flavor than just lemon juice.

00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.730
So what we do with
it is we preserve it.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.786
So we harvested the
lemons, took them home,

00:32:47.786 --> 00:32:49.160
and the ladies
would get together

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.060
around this big container with
all these lemons and a lot

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.650
of salt and just big jars, clay
jars, and we preserved lemons.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:02.690
And the funny thing is I
think the preserved lemon is

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:04.340
one of the most amazing things.

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.400
And literally, it
starts from this.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.560
And you get it to this.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.415
What do you think
about preserved lemons?

00:33:11.415 --> 00:33:13.206
AUDIENCE: When we
started working together,

00:33:13.206 --> 00:33:15.672
it was kind of like
a game changer.

00:33:15.672 --> 00:33:17.130
MOURAD LAHLOU: It's
a game changer.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.310
AUDIENCE: Totally
unique, different flavor.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.350
MOURAD LAHLOU: Yeah.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:25.160
MOURAD LAHLOU: But
the cool part is

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:27.530
when you juice a lemon, a
regular lemon, when you use it

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.897
for dressing or whatever, you
get rid of the pit, the skin.

00:33:30.897 --> 00:33:31.730
So that's discarded.

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:34.066
You just-- you're
interested in the juice.

00:33:34.066 --> 00:33:35.690
Moroccans, we get
everything backwards.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.815
So we're interested in the
pit, but we don't really

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:39.230
care about the juice.

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:43.700
So the way to make
it, it's really cool.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.428
So let me show you
how to do that.

00:33:45.428 --> 00:33:47.139
AUDIENCE: Is this
lacto-fermented?

00:33:47.139 --> 00:33:47.930
MOURAD LAHLOU: Yes.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.300
And basically, you can either--

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:54.620
sometimes you can take the
syrup from the previous batch

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.690
and re--

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:56.326
yes.

00:33:56.326 --> 00:33:57.200
And it's really cool.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.900
And it takes a
little bit longer,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.360
but the results are much better.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.260
So I have just
kosher salt, here.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.250
And you can see,
there's a lot of it.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.774
If you really want
to cheat, and you

00:34:09.774 --> 00:34:11.190
think that it's
too salty for you,

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.315
and I'm going to give you--

00:34:12.315 --> 00:34:14.040
Chef [? DeMare, ?]
can we give everybody

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.706
a little sample of
the preserved lemons,

00:34:15.706 --> 00:34:17.410
so they can taste it by itself?

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:17.909
Yes.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.409
Here.

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.839
Why don't you take this?

00:34:20.839 --> 00:34:22.630
Maybe you can just give
them little spoons.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:24.713
Because I really think
it's one of the best things

00:34:24.713 --> 00:34:26.920
that came out of Morocco.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.310
So we use a lot of salt.
And then with a knife, you--

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.370
and I don't like to
use Meyer lemons.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.110
To me, they don't have enough
acid to cure the lemons,

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.170
and they're sweeter.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:40.210
So it doesn't work
for me at all.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.560
I do a quick preserve
cure for Meyer lemons,

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.290
but it's just like
a day, overnight.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.840
And I slice them really
thin, and I sprinkle them

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.935
with salt and sugar.

00:34:50.935 --> 00:34:52.810
And the next day, they're
perfect for salads.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.020
But to get the best
preserved lemons,

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.870
you use Eureka lemons or Lisbon.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:59.840
They're really good.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.810
So you can see, you
send it on its butt,

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:05.410
and you make two
cuts lengthwise.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.510
But you don't cut them
all the way through.

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.560
Because what you need is to
be able to stuff as much salt

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.400
as possible.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.290
It's never enough.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.580
And then we take a jar--

00:35:18.412 --> 00:35:21.519
AUDIENCE: But you're not
aiming for 2% or 3% salt?

00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:22.560
MOURAD LAHLOU: Pardon me?

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.851
AUDIENCE: You're not aiming
for a certain percent salt?

00:35:24.851 --> 00:35:25.840
MOURAD LAHLOU: No.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.320
And that's what's really
cool about Moroccan cooking.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.920
It's never-- there's no recipes.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.510
There's just a way of
cooking that is handed down

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:35.470
from one generation to another.

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:38.430
And some of the best
cooks in Morocco

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.610
are these ladies who work in
very affluent homes, where

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:42.970
they can get paid.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.041
And basically, they have
recipes in their heads

00:35:45.041 --> 00:35:46.290
of how to cook certain things.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.520
And they're the best chefs.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.140
There's no doubt about it.

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.660
They're called dadas.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.217
Big ladies.

00:35:52.217 --> 00:35:54.300
You know, they spend a lot
of time in the kitchen.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.350
And they're so seasoned.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:56.850
But they love what they do.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.530
And basically, those
ladies would never

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.050
give recipes to anybody, no
matter who they are, except

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:02.160
for their daughters.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.590
Because they want to make sure
that one of their daughters

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.810
will get the job
after they pass.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:10.140
And it just stays in the family
from generation to generation.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.210
And most of them, when
you ask them for recipes,

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.710
they'll always give
you the wrong stuff.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:14.210
Always.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.900
So nobody even asks.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.015
So we're going to shove as many
lemons as possible in there.

00:36:21.015 --> 00:36:22.500
That sounds like my restaurants.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.315
I always freak out
when I hear that sound.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.610
And once you put the lemons
with the salt in there,

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:41.320
you can leave the jar
sealed for about a day.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.920
And a lot of the juice from
the lemons will be extracted,

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.190
and this jar will probably
be half full of juice.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.190
And that's what we want.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.790
So I just seal it.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:53.520
Put it away for a day.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.210
The juice will come up to here.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.840
You shake it really well,
and then after one day,

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.810
I'll squeeze some lemon
juice, and I will fill it

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.354
all the way to the top.

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:05.020
So we're just going
to pretend that this

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.534
is all the way to the top.

00:37:07.534 --> 00:37:10.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:10.830
MOURAD LAHLOU: No.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:12.230
No.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:16.240
And you're putting it away for
about three months, at least.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.740
You can use it after one month.

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.260
It will not taste
anything like lemon.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.710
But the most important
ingredient in this preparation

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:24.382
is time.

00:37:24.382 --> 00:37:25.840
You need to have
the time to do it.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.710
You can't rush it.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.060
There's no way you can--

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.820
we tried to do a
sous vide, where you

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:32.404
expedite the process of cure--

00:37:32.404 --> 00:37:33.070
it doesn't work.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.426
It really doesn't work.

00:37:34.426 --> 00:37:37.085
AUDIENCE: What's the longest
you've kept lemons [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:37.085 --> 00:37:38.710
MOURAD LAHLOU: We
have preserved lemons

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:40.810
right now that are
five years old.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.970
And they look
black, almost black.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.550
They go from yellow to
orange, and they start

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:46.750
getting darker and darker.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.940
They literally
turn almost black.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.640
They're intense.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.670
I'll give you some
when you come up.

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:58.972
So this stays somewhere cold
and dark for about a month.

00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:00.180
You can use it after a month.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.320
I don't recommend it.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.380
Anywhere between three months
to six months is ideal.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.330
And then when you're
done, you end up

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.460
with something like this.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.430
So you can't juice these.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:15.740
And you can see, it's all soft.

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.480
The most important
part is the pit.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.870
So basically, you
clean the core.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.100
And I use the whole thing.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.180
I use the whole thing.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.360
Once you make these,
they're the best presence.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.284
You can make them
now for Christmas,

00:38:28.284 --> 00:38:29.450
and people will be so happy.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:31.370
They will think you love them so
much because you took the time

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:32.250
to do this.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.910
So the most important part
of this preserved lemon

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.030
is this part.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.510
So this is what we
use at the restaurant.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.820
You can slice it and
put it in salads.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.590
You can put it on top of steaks.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.820
You can dice it and mix
it in with couscous.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.880
It is literally something
that you will never

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.140
be able to live without.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:52.130
It's that simple.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:53.330
It's that cheap.

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.439
And you can make it when
lemons are really cheap

00:38:56.439 --> 00:38:58.980
and not have to worry about it
for a whole year or two years.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.870
So if there's anything you guys
can get away from this class,

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.420
it's go home and make some
fucking preserved lemons.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.490
It is so delicious.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.060
And I'm going to give you
some little bit to taste.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.240
I think Chef [? DeMare ?]
is doing that.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.570
And then the other
part is, you can see,

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:15.920
we don't throw this away.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.510
This is the core.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:21.926
So what I do with these, they're
salty, as you can imagine.

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:22.550
They're acidic.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.810
They have some tartness.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:25.730
You put them in stews.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.320
So you just take
a couple of these,

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.314
put them in stews or braises or
your pasta sauce or whatever.

00:39:30.314 --> 00:39:31.730
People will think
you're a genius.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:32.240
Oh my god.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.100
What did you do?

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.433
Iron Chef is like, it's a
Japanese technique that I came

00:39:35.433 --> 00:39:36.790
across when I went to Japan.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:37.910
But it's fucking
preserved lemons.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.034
It's like plain and simple.

00:39:39.034 --> 00:39:40.040
It's preserved lemons.

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:43.130
And then the last part that
is really important, this

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.010
is lemon juice that's
been sitting there

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.310
for a couple of months.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:48.724
It's going to get salty.

00:39:48.724 --> 00:39:50.390
It's going to get
really thick, and it's

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:51.431
going to change in color.

00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:52.670
It's going to become clearer.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:54.630
It's not going to be as cloudy.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.330
And it's delicious.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:59.570
So instead of using
salt, straight up salt,

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:02.280
you can use that liquid
to season your salads.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.050
So you can see how you
can use the whole thing.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.706
And I literally
cannot emphasize this.

00:40:07.706 --> 00:40:09.580
And Marty has worked
with me for a long time.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.163
We've known each
other for many years.

00:40:11.163 --> 00:40:13.040
If there is one thing
that I want anybody

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.010
to take away from this,
it's this little thing here.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.600
And the hardest part about it--

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.350
anybody can do it.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:19.130
It's not couscous.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.650
It's not hand rolling couscous.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.465
That is really hard
to get to a point

00:40:23.465 --> 00:40:26.090
where you're comfortable with it
and it works out all the time.

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.470
This is so simple.

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.330
So you have
absolutely-- you have

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:31.820
zero-- if you guys work at
Google, you can do this shit.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.500
I'm telling you.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:36.702
So it's not that hard.

00:40:36.702 --> 00:40:39.042
AUDIENCE: And keeping them
intact to be able to use them

00:40:39.042 --> 00:40:41.460
decoratively, maybe, or
why not just break them

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.300
down smaller so [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.462
MOURAD LAHLOU: So once
they get to a point--

00:40:45.462 --> 00:40:46.670
and that is a great question.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:49.660
Once they get to a point when
I'm really happy with them,

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.080
if the purpose is to use
them on a daily basis,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.159
I would let them
get to this point.

00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:57.700
So what I do at that
point, if I just

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.170
let them sit in
the syrup longer,

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.130
they'll get darker
and more intense.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.300
So I take them out, rinse
them off in cold water,

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:09.130
and then I will get this
part and just slice it,

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:10.540
or I can chop it.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.565
And I think we have a
little sample somewhere.

00:41:12.565 --> 00:41:14.440
Chef [? DeMare, ?] can
I have the chopped up,

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.370
preserved lemons?

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:20.440
And then we stop the curing
part by adding the olive oil.

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.020
So the oil will stop everything.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.820
And they will stay the
way-- at this stage,

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.900
they will stay like
that for a few months.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:27.080
There's no problem.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.200
So rinsing them off and
taking them off of the liquid

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.286
will stop that curing
process, and then you

00:41:33.286 --> 00:41:34.660
end up with
preserved lemons that

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.030
will be the same
consistency, the same flavor.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:40.384
And the oil that you put in to
mix them with, it's amazing.

00:41:40.384 --> 00:41:42.300
So once you're done with
the preserved lemons,

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.190
you're left with a
really flavorful--

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.739
literally, some of
the best olive oil.

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:49.030
So I'm going to give you guys--

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:51.030
the ones that are
sitting up front--

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:52.780
you get to taste some
of this stuff, here.

00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:57.470
Is it legal to do this?

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:58.752
AUDIENCE: Go for it.

00:41:58.752 --> 00:42:00.335
MOURAD LAHLOU: The
health department--

00:42:00.335 --> 00:42:01.960
AUDIENCE: The audience
questions, we'll

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.570
just fire away at you.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.660
MOURAD LAHLOU: --I can
just take one of these.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.383
Yeah?

00:42:06.383 --> 00:42:08.424
AUDIENCE: How has
refrigeration changed the taste

00:42:08.424 --> 00:42:09.560
of of preserved lemons.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.310
MOURAD LAHLOU: We don't
like refrigeration

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.110
with this process.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.610
It needs to be at room temp.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:15.170
If you put it in
the refrigerator,

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.680
the temperature is so
low, it literally almost

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.040
stops that whole
process of curing.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.540
So.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.900
AUDIENCE: Have you
tried the same technique

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.439
with grapefruits or
other types of citrus?

00:42:29.439 --> 00:42:31.730
MOURAD LAHLOU: We tried to
be creative with this stuff,

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:32.420
but it doesn't work.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.503
AUDIENCE: It doesn't work.

00:42:33.503 --> 00:42:34.700
MOURAD LAHLOU: No.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.150
Limes don't work, because
the pith is not thick enough.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.360
A grapefruit is too thick, and
it just becomes spongy and not

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.740
very flavorful.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.240
I think it's the acid and the
level of tartness and acidity

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.146
in the lemons that
makes them so perfect.

00:42:49.146 --> 00:42:52.469
AUDIENCE: Do you ever
measure the PH for--

00:42:52.469 --> 00:42:54.260
MOURAD LAHLOU: That's
too complicated, man.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.332
That's like Google stuff.

00:42:56.332 --> 00:42:57.790
SPEAKER: You are
at Google, though.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.264
Other audience questions?

00:42:59.264 --> 00:43:00.180
We have a few minutes.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.520
I've got plenty of
questions for Chef,

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.311
but I'd love to open
it up to the audience.

00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:04.850
So if you have a
question, we'll ask

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:06.810
Chef Mourad to
repeat the question

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.260
so we can get this
on the video end.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.146
So any burning questions?

00:43:11.146 --> 00:43:12.521
AUDIENCE: Just
one last question.

00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:15.244
So you talked about [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:16.910
MOURAD LAHLOU: We get
up in the morning,

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:19.670
we stuff our faces at 7:30.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:21.500
Then we go to work or to school.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:23.930
We literally don't eat
anything until 12:30,

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:25.460
when we come back for lunch.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:29.030
And then people take a nap
then go back to work or school.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.620
And then they come
back for dinner.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.050
But the main meal is lunch.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:34.070
It's never dinner.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:38.240
So dinner is like leftover
from lunch or a little snack.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.470
So no, there's no snacks.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:41.870
And I just came back from
Morocco three weeks ago.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.570
I went there for nine days.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.635
And I ate so much.

00:43:48.635 --> 00:43:50.010
And sometimes we
had two dinners,

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.551
because there's so
many people to see

00:43:51.551 --> 00:43:53.790
that I have an early
dinner about 7 o'clock,

00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:55.950
and a late dinner at 10
o'clock, because I just

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:57.825
want to see all my family
members and friends

00:43:57.825 --> 00:43:59.350
and make everybody happy.

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.370
And when I came
back, I was like, oh.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:02.870
OK.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.345
Mourad from America.

00:44:04.345 --> 00:44:05.970
I came back, and I
was like, oh my god.

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:07.380
I've gotta get on a
scale, because I probably

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.520
gained 10 pounds.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.820
I lost weight when I was
eating all that food.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.409
And I literally think it's
the quality of the food.

00:44:14.409 --> 00:44:16.950
When I first came to America,
people were freaking out about,

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.980
like, OK, we go to the farmer's
market as if it's some luxury.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.750
Like, the whole world goes to
the farmer's market every day.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.430
That's the way it is.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.321
So now going to the farmer's
market is the weird part.

00:44:27.321 --> 00:44:28.570
It's not the other way around.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:31.380
So when people go to the
farmer's market on Saturday,

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.020
and they buy a peach for
like $5.00, oh my god,

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:36.000
that's like a crazy idea.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.970
That's what happens.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:38.345
And usually, the
farmer's markets

00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:40.200
all over the world,
most of the world,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.480
is cheaper than the
market, because you're

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.710
eliminating the middleman.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.001
For some reason, in America,
it's the other way around,

00:44:46.001 --> 00:44:48.630
where you can buy a peach that
is really healthy for $5.00

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:53.610
at the market, but you can
buy a lot of food from a store

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.510
for a lot less.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.780
But that's the mass
production of food.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.920
It's all screwed up.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.300
The whole thing is screwed up.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:04.390
So we've got to rethink
the whole process.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.890
OK.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.340
So we've got to rush a
little bit through this.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.230
The last thing I want
to do for you guys

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:16.500
is show you how to make
couscous in the simplest way.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.800
What I do-- and if
I were to die today,

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.710
the last thing I
would love to eat

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.260
is couscous with brown butter.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.500
For all of you who are
really health conscious

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.420
and think that fat
is bad, maybe this

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:35.940
is not the part you
should be looking at.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.800
So I have a pot here, and
I have some brown butter.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.370
And I'm not going to lie to you.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:42.350
We put a lot of brown--

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.660
I mean, let's just do it right.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.830
So that is for
probably one portion.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.859
We heat up the brown butter.

00:45:51.859 --> 00:45:53.400
If you make brown
butter from scratch

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.540
while you are making
this, you can just

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.240
put the butter in a pot,
bring it up, let it cook off.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.900
The milk solids will brown.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:03.640
The liquid will evaporate,
and the whey will evaporate.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.826
So you're left with
fat and milk solids

00:46:06.826 --> 00:46:07.950
that are browning in there.

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.420
So it's the most
delicious thing.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.080
Do you like brown butter?

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:10.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:11.609
MOURAD LAHLOU: OK.

00:46:11.609 --> 00:46:13.351
You're lying.

00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:13.850
So--

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:15.815 --> 00:46:16.940
MOURAD LAHLOU: Just butter.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.460
Yeah.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.970
So I'm going to add a little
bit of the preserved lemons,

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:23.100
just to infuse it.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:27.027
A little bit of
salt. And you need

00:46:27.027 --> 00:46:28.860
to be careful with this
stuff with the salt,

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.050
because the preserved
lemons are salty.

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.250
So you've just got
to play it off.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:40.450
And as soon as it starts to
foam, I'll take the couscous,

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:41.250
add it in.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.780
And then guess what's
going to happen?

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.790
The couscous is going to
absorb all that butter,

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.840
and nobody would know.

00:46:58.932 --> 00:47:01.120
AUDIENCE: What kind
of butter do you use?

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.081
MOURAD LAHLOU: Just
unsalted butter.

00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:05.080
Because you need to be--

00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.240
I mean, every time
you buy salted butter,

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.260
you're basically paying $8.00
for salt. $8.00 a pound.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.979
Because every gram is added
to the weight of the butter

00:47:14.979 --> 00:47:15.520
that you buy.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.099
So you can just
add your own salt,

00:47:17.099 --> 00:47:18.890
and you don't have to
pay that much for it.

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:22.540
So this is pretty
much ready to go.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.810
And at the restaurant, what
we do to keep it seasonal,

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.286
we have some pumpkin that's
been roasted and diced.

00:47:28.286 --> 00:47:29.910
So we're going to
add that to couscous.

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.370
Take it off the heat.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:45.040
We have a small plate, here.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.890
And at the restaurant, we use--

00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:51.250
right now we're using
uni and roe, smoked roe.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:59.390
AUDIENCE: Where do you look for
inspiration for how you enhance

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:02.050
the couscous? the couscous?

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.470
[INAUDIBLE] roe and uni
and traditional Moroccan?

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:07.060
MOURAD LAHLOU: Absolutely not.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:07.709
Absolutely not.

00:48:07.709 --> 00:48:09.250
I mean, the way we
eat couscous, as I

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:10.416
was saying at the beginning.

00:48:10.416 --> 00:48:12.560
I don't know if I
emphasized that point.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.590
The way we use it in
Morocco is literally

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.780
overcooked meat, overcooked
vegetables, but the grain,

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.100
the couscous is the
most important part,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.709
and people just eat it by hand.

00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:25.000
You would [INAUDIBLE],, make
a little bowl, and flip it

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.840
in your mouth.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.310
But at the restaurants, we try--

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.350
whenever we use
couscous as an entree,

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:31.334
we try to cook the
vegetables separately.

00:48:31.334 --> 00:48:33.250
The proteins are cooked
separately, if we ever

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:34.610
use proteins with it.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:37.460
But for this, it's
just an idea of--

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.940
to me, it's almost
like rice in Japan,

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.670
where you have a vehicle.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:45.040
If you talk to a
lot of sushi chefs,

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.540
they'll say that
cooking the rice

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.749
is the most important
part of sushi.

00:48:48.749 --> 00:48:50.540
And most people don't
think of it that way.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.456
They think about the
fish and how unique it is

00:48:52.456 --> 00:48:54.830
and how scarce it is and
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:58.780
But most chefs in
Japan will literally

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.489
tell you the most
important part is the rice.

00:49:01.489 --> 00:49:02.780
I felt the same way about this.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.510
So I can put uni.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.380
I can put roe.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.630
I can put merguez,
which is a lamb sausage.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:11.140
I can put beef stew,
a piece of fish,

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:12.450
it doesn't really matter to me.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:14.140
The couscous is the
most important part.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.300
But it's such a clean
vehicle for anything,

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.550
that you can literally use it.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:20.440
But I think the most
important part is

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:22.550
the grain, but also the butter.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:23.050
The butter.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.090
And nobody will complain
about the butter.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.405
So we'll use some uni with this.

00:49:29.405 --> 00:49:32.070
This is Japanese
uni from Hokkaido.

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:35.319
And just sprinkle it
all over the place.

00:49:35.319 --> 00:49:37.360
And just to impress you
guys, this is not as much

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.526
as we use at the restaurant.

00:49:38.526 --> 00:49:40.112
So if you come to
the restaurant,

00:49:40.112 --> 00:49:42.750
and you see two
little tongues on it,

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.320
that's because it's
really expensive.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:53.505
And then the roe.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.500
And just to finish
it off, and this

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.890
is what makes us justify
charging people what we charge,

00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:11.725
we just put a lot of blossoms.

00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:21.780
Here we go.

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:25.700
And flowers.

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.462
And there's your
$30.00 couscous.

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:35.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:37.764 --> 00:50:40.174
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:44.605
Any questions, you guys?

00:50:47.202 --> 00:50:49.160
SPEAKER: So I'll start
with the first question.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.326
And we've got a few for
questions, if you have them.

00:50:51.326 --> 00:50:53.164
So Chef, you've been on TV.

00:50:53.164 --> 00:50:54.080
You've written a book.

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.360
You've got restaurants
that you're running.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:00.050
What is your proudest moment,
that you could think back,

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:02.760
that you want to share
with the audience today?

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.600
MOURAD LAHLOU: The proudest
from a professional level

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.724
or from a personal level?

00:51:06.724 --> 00:51:07.640
SPEAKER: Why not both?

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.270
One of each.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:11.100
MOURAD LAHLOU: Personal
level is when my mom came,

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.430
and I was really
expecting her to school us

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:15.260
on how to make Moroccan food.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.230
And the biggest fear that
I had was for her to say,

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.490
this is not Moroccan food.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:22.400
That was like the biggest
nightmare that I was imagining.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.730
But when she said, my god,
this tastes like back home.

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:28.910
This reminds me of back home,
that was the first moment when

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:31.040
I felt that food
is really like-- it

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.870
has to have a sense of place.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:36.037
If you were to go to Morocco,
to where I grew up, Marrakesh,

00:51:36.037 --> 00:51:38.120
and go to the night market,
called [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.270
which is all this sweet food,
and you would eat a bite

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:44.960
of anything there, it will taste
so much better and so much more

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.690
delicious than if you were
to take the same exact bite

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.860
and eat it in San Francisco
near the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:53.570
It just doesn't add.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.850
So for me, food has to
have a sense of place.

00:51:56.850 --> 00:51:58.790
So when she said
that, it allowed

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.750
me to think that I brought
something from Morocco,

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:04.520
and I made it fit this
environment, where

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.700
it had a sense of place.

00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.550
So that was a very proud moment.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:10.850
Professionally, I
think when we first

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:16.410
got the Michelin star at Aziza,
it was very sweet for me.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:19.631
But it just happened
to be on the same year

00:52:19.631 --> 00:52:22.130
that two of my best friends,
James Syhabout was from Commis,

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:24.830
and Jeremy Fox from
Ubuntu at the time,

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:26.330
got it also at the same time.

00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.057
And Marty was working
at Ubuntu at the time.

00:52:29.057 --> 00:52:30.890
So he was responsible
for that star as well.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.740
So when we all get that
star the same year,

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.410
it was the sweetest moment
of my professional career.

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.980
To this day.

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.188
SPEAKER: That's very special.

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.380
Thank you.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.134
Any audience questions?

00:52:41.134 --> 00:52:42.800
MOURAD LAHLOU: How
many people are going

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.554
to go back and make couscous?

00:52:45.554 --> 00:52:46.970
SPEAKER: How many
people are going

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:48.840
to try to grab that
plate in front?

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:52.060
MOURAD LAHLOU: How
about preserved lemons?

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.060
All right.

00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:54.740
Well then, I did my job.

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:55.310
Anyways.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.510
SPEAKER: Chef,
one last question.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:58.640
So you have a new restaurant
coming on board tomorrow.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:52:59.780
Can you talk a
little bit about that

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:01.010
and how that will be
different from what

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:01.850
you've done in the past?

00:53:01.850 --> 00:53:02.683
MOURAD LAHLOU: Yeah.

00:53:02.683 --> 00:53:05.240
So we had Aziza for
18 years, and it

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.670
was one of the most special
restaurants in the country.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:10.610
It started out as
this idea of me just

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:12.710
making a place for
myself to go eat

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.520
when I'm going to conquer the
world and make a lot of money.

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.600
And it turned into--

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.020
It was so organic, and it went
through so many phases, where

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.420
initially it was a place
where I would recreate

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:26.060
the dishes that I
grew up on and I was

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.500
eating when I was a little boy.

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:30.277
And then when I saw the
limitations of that,

00:53:30.277 --> 00:53:31.860
we started to
experiment a little bit.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.151
We started to ask, why are
we making couscous this way?

00:53:34.151 --> 00:53:36.254
Why are we making this
stew with this sauce?

00:53:36.254 --> 00:53:37.670
[INAUDIBLE] sauce,
blah blah blah.

00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:42.800
But we start to peel away all
those mysteries of why Moroccan

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.426
food was the way it was.

00:53:44.426 --> 00:53:46.050
And then when we
started to experiment,

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.050
that's when I met Marty.

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:50.330
And we started to add stuff from
California, from the Bay Area,

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:54.110
to my food and take
it to a new direction.

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:56.600
And then eventually,
as Mourad, we

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.720
ended up summing up all
those experiences and journey

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.890
into that one spot.

00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.000
So Aziza became this place
that was really unique.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.340
It was selected as
one of the 30 most

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:12.080
important restaurants in the
country over the last 30 years.

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.350
And people had a really strong
connection with that place.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:18.740
It was not just the food,
but for some reason, people

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.240
when they go to
Aziza, they really

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.120
have a soft spot for
where they used to sit,

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:26.510
or where the bar was, or I
proposed to my girlfriend

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:30.260
on that table, I had
my 18th birthday here.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.580
So people had stories.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:33.790
They did not just
go there to eat.

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:34.760
And I was not--

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.580
I mean, I heard about that
shit, but I really didn't--

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.170
it didn't add up in my head.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:41.270
But when we opened the Mourad.

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:44.330
And the Mourad was a
really expensive project,

00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.070
people started to
compare the two.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.280
Aziza is neglected.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.919
Mourad is the new fancy place.

00:54:49.919 --> 00:54:51.710
And I really want to
do something for Aziza

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:53.210
so it doesn't get forgotten.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.770
So we decided to remodel it.

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.311
And we thought it was going to
cost a couple hundred thousand

00:54:57.311 --> 00:54:58.280
dollars and two months.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:00.950
Now it's two and a half years
later and a few million dollars

00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:02.240
later.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.910
But the reason
why it's not going

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:06.480
to be called Aziza anymore,
it's not going to be Aziza,

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:09.590
is because the city made
us change so many things.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:11.300
Because it was such
an old building.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.790
There were six elevations
everywhere, steps, ramps,

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.404
and all of the EDA
and the new code,

00:55:16.404 --> 00:55:17.820
we could not do
any of that stuff.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.280
So a lot of walls
needed to move.

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.660
The bar needed to move.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.190
I really felt like
people, if they

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.580
were to come into that
building and know it as Aziza,

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:28.730
it would never have a
chance to be successful,

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:31.522
because people are going to
be upset that they don't have

00:55:31.522 --> 00:55:33.230
their favorite table
where it used to be,

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:34.580
and blah, blah, blah.

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:39.350
So we decided to come up with
a concept that made more sense.

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:43.290
I worked with a lot of
Guatemalans when I had Aziza.

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:46.640
And I remember, every time
I would make something new,

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.690
they would taste it,
and they would say,

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:50.355
oh, we used to have
this in Guatemala,

00:55:50.355 --> 00:55:52.034
or we used to have
this in the Yucatan.

00:55:52.034 --> 00:55:54.450
I was like, you're full of
shit, because this is typically

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:55.980
Moroccan food.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.370
But there was a lot
of intersections,

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:01.810
but I never paid
attention to them.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:06.630
So finally, one of my sous
chefs and CDCs from Aziza,

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.070
he's half Mexican.

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:10.290
And he worked with me
for a while at Aziza.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:12.810
But when he came back,
after he got divorced,

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.754
he came back to
work with me again.

00:56:14.754 --> 00:56:16.170
We were talking
about the concept.

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:19.650
And the initial idea was
to make Aziza come back,

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:21.310
but it just didn't feel right.

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:24.180
I really lost a lot
of sleep over it.

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.570
And I decided, OK.

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.150
What we can do is explore
that moment in time

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:33.540
when the Moors invaded Europe.

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.274
And that happened in 711.

00:56:36.274 --> 00:56:38.440
It has nothing to do with
the Middle Eastern stores,

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.960
like the 7-Eleven stores.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:43.260
711, the year 711, the
Moors invaded Europe.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.610
They were there for 800 years.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.070
So they brought with them a
lot of food, a lot of art,

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.940
a lot of literature, all
of that stuff stayed there

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:52.170
for 800 years.

00:56:52.170 --> 00:56:54.390
When they were
kicked out in 1492,

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:59.460
that was the same year that the
Europeans discovered America.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:02.910
And when America, the New
World, was discovered,

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:05.520
a lot of the Moors
that were kicked out

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.820
of the country and the
ones that stayed in Europe,

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:13.470
they were made into slaves that
were brought to Latin America

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:18.960
to work the land and basically
push away the natives.

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.760
But the slaves that were
brought to the New World

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.180
brought a lot of
spices with them,

00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:29.140
a lot of technique from
the Moorish culture.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:33.030
And I want to explore that
one moment in time in 1492

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:35.960
when those two
cultures intersected,

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.330
and I just want to put a
little bit of light on that

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.480
and see how the spices,
and the act of frying

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:44.380
was foreign to Latin America.

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.600
It was brought-- you know.

00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:51.180
And if you think about Al
pastor, taco al pastor,

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:54.660
it's meat that is cooked
vertically on a stick.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:57.130
And it rotates,
and they slice it.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.191
That's a gyro.

00:57:58.191 --> 00:57:58.940
I mean, I'm sorry.

00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:59.680
It's a gyro.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.610
So if you take the two,
there's a lot of similarities.

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:05.100
So that's what we
want to explore.

00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:07.980
I'm not-- I mean, don't expect
to have a couscous burrito,

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.870
because it's not
going to happen.

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:13.170
But we just want to explore
that idea of where the two

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:16.260
cultures intersected
and put an emphasis

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.710
on the spices, the
technique, and the harmony

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:20.986
in those two things.

00:58:20.986 --> 00:58:22.360
SPEAKER: Chef,
thank you so much.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.401
MOURAD LAHLOU: Thank you.

00:58:23.401 --> 00:58:25.010
SPEAKER: Give him a
round of applause.
