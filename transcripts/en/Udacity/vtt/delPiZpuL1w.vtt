00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
So it's pretty clear that if you were raising around to capital, going to friends and family

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.580
or crowdfunding like Kickstarter or angel capital or venture capital or corporate partners,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.290
all kind of make sense for financing.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.700
Also, going to the small business administration or getting SBIR grants

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.810
also fit into the financing column.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.600
But for operating capital that is money you need when your company is an ongoing concern

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.740
in generating revenue--well, lease lines make sense, factoring, vendor financing.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.010
And what's really interesting is you might also get operating capital from government grants as well

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490
and corporate partners that are also fit there.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.530
So there's two actually went into the correct category.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.880
Well, surprisingly of course venture capital always does follow on rounds

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.980
so this was kind of a trick question.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.350
You could always get more operating capital in subsequent rounds

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.450
from venture capitalist, not on the corporate partners.

00:01:00.450 --> 99:59:59.000
Just remember that VCs will invest more money to get more ownership of your company.
