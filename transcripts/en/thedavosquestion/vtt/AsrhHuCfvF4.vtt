00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.880
MALLIKA: First of all you have to look at
the economy and our own happiness and the

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.820
environment as competing for it as a no-no,
and while the going was good, a lot of business

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.580
was looking at it that way, that they could
make a profit and it didn't matter that the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.990
environment was being destroyed. And it's
only after this downturn that people are even

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.990
asking these questions, it is [ INAUDIBLE
 ] asking these questions. I agree with this

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.789
that it has to be something that goes side-by-side
and not something that is if this wins, this

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.930
looses, because it can't be. However much
money [ INAUDIBLE ] the Midas touch bit, that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.320
you touch a piece of earth and it disappears.
And yes, more action is required from all

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.780
of us. Every drop of water we save every tree
we don't break down is going to make a difference,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.920
so let's make it now, today and every moment.
