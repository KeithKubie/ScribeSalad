RICHARD EBERHARDT: Hi, Pablo.

00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:23.350
PABLO SUAREZ: Good to be back.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.016
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
Nice having you here.

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:28.880
So we wanted to
talk about a number

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.940
of high-level postmortemy
things for how the class went.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.110
So we've got some high-level
things we wanted to talk about.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.160
We want to talk about the
collaboration between MIT

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.790
and the Red Cross/Red Crescent
group and your folks--

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.960
how student preparedness
went, in particular, comparing

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.750
those teams that got a lot of
support, like client support,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.687
like Snap, of course.

00:00:50.687 --> 00:00:53.020
But also, some of the other
teams got a little bit more,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.690
and then the
unsupported teams, which

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.250
aren't exactly unsupported,
but they got less,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.250
so that's largely
the Heatwave Team,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.350
I think was the main one that
we want to talk about there.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.770
So collaboration what do
you all think about how

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.934
we talked to each other?

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.850
How we met with each
other-- things like that?

00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:15.130
PHILIP TAN: I like
the way how we

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.150
started in the beginning
of the semester.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.280
We had to talk-- and we
had some Skype issues.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.470
But I think the idea of
kicking off the entire class

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.210
with the initial
presentation of this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.960
is what your final
project is going to be.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.751
It's going to take us
a while to get there,

00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.620
but you come into
class understanding

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.870
this is what it's going to be.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.074
And Pablo being the
person to describe

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:39.490
why this is going
to be important,

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.690
I think, set lot of
expectations well.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:51.310
So I think later on, when we
actually got to that project,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.590
the degree to which
each team actually

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.770
could have been
supported actually

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.256
became more of an issue.

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:00.130
The teams that you could
directly talk with--

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.460
and you were going to be the
primary user of the game--

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.456
clearly benefited.

00:02:07.456 --> 00:02:09.289
But you were right there
from the beginning.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.050
These are the teams that,
maybe, they did receive support,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.570
or some of them didn't
receive support,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.420
but weren't talking
with people who

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.366
had been there right from
the start, I think maybe

00:02:23.366 --> 00:02:24.990
had felt a little
bit more disconnected

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.480
from the main
thrust of the class.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.190
At least when they got
to that final assignment.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.190
So something I like to think
about for future classes

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.080
is the extent to
which-- if we're

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.030
going to repeat this format--
where the primary client comes

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.870
in right at the beginning to set
the tone for the entire class.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.120
How do we represent more of
the variety of different things

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.745
that you can do right
at the beginning?

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.760
So that when students
think about what they're

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.590
going to be doing throughout
the entire semester,

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.350
they are actually keeping full
scope of the project in mind,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.400
not just the one example that
might be presented to them

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.544
on the first day of class.

00:03:07.544 --> 00:03:08.960
PABLO SUAREZ: And
we also may want

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.170
to have something like
an engagement meter.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.330
Because I wasn't
aware of the fact

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.420
that some teams were
feeling disengaged.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.430
I would show up, some
people have questions,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.440
some other have less questions.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.550
And from my perspective, those
who have questions I spent time

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.820
and it was about the same
chronometric time per group.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.540
I could see that
some were more lost,

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.262
but I wasn't aware
that what was needed

00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:34.470
was more fire in their belly.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.240
So if we could--

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.960
RICHARD EBERHARDT: I
couldn't see that either.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.350
PABLO SUAREZ: Right.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.683
RICHARD EBERHARDT: The students
never reported it to us.

00:03:38.683 --> 00:03:40.480
SARA VERRILLI: Yeah,
I was going to say,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.230
when we asked the students
to do their postmortems,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.070
they were really clear about how
this had been a big motivation,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.140
and interest had been
a big problem for them.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.170
But they never mentioned it
to us during check-in meetings

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.150
when we were doing play testing,
when we were working with them.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.420
So that's the sort
of thing that we

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.420
need to-- probably
one of the things

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.920
you do is probably to
warn them about that.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.570
These are hard topics, and
they can become boring topics

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.850
very quickly.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.010
And they need to step up and
let us know when they think

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.020
they're facing a brick wall.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.960
RICHARD EBERHARDT: I think
the clues were there.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.649
If we had means and a
way to remind ourselves,

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.160
like a checklist or something
simple like that, just to say,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.210
are you engaged?

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.604
What's your motivation?

00:04:23.604 --> 00:04:25.270
And, again, that's
assuming that we even

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.070
want that to be our job.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.540
I think for anything
client based,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.037
it has be our,
probably, our job.

00:04:30.037 --> 00:04:31.620
SARA VERRILLI: I
think that when we're

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.250
asking them to work on projects
where they have relatively

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.587
little control over the topic,
I think we actually do need to.

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:40.170
Because I think part
of it was I don't

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.050
think the teams knew
how much freedom they

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.622
had to deviate from the
topic they had chosen

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:47.330
and the specific.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.996
They thought they had
chosen this thing,

00:04:48.996 --> 00:04:50.900
and now they were stuck with it.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.180
Even though one
team was like, we

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.060
chose a topic that just
wasn't deep enough.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.490
There wasn't enough there.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.320
And if they had come
and talked to us,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.820
we could have given
them the freedom

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.110
to well, go change to a new
topic, or how can we go--

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.330
RICHARD EBERHARDT: Go deeper.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.600
SARA VERRILLI: --how
can we go deeper in it?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.340
Right.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.010
But we were not
sufficiently warned.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.840
PHILIP TAN: But
that's where rapport

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.450
with someone who knows a lot
about the domain can help.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.720
And if they don't feel like they
have that rapport or someone

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.140
who they can readily contact
to ask even seemingly

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.522
silly questions,
then we're not going

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.105
to be able to get
down to actually ask

00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:25.270
the important questions.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.686
Because sometimes
they can't tell.

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:30.190
They can't necessarily tell what
looks like flagging motivation

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.600
on a part of the
team or what just

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.911
seems like end-of-semester
pressures on the students,

00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:36.410
right?

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.460
They haven't been working
on enough projects

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.690
to be able to tell
the difference.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.490
And so we do need to help
them through that, I think.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.870
SARA VERRILLI: By that you
mean the students, then?

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.575
PHILIP TAN: The students.

00:05:48.575 --> 00:05:48.920
I mean the students.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.420
PABLO SUAREZ: And one of the
things you may want to consider

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.950
is we know that both in the
real life-- in the future,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.800
in their future, as well
as in future courses--

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.950
there will be limited
ability of those

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.600
who are experts to interact
with the game design team.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.781
The game design team,
you took the effort--

00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:06.030
and I thought it was very
well-balanced-- to have some

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.640
who know programming, some
who know narrative, some who

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.340
know user interface, and so on.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.480
They will, by default,
not have expertise

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.780
on heatwaves or cholera
or etc or climate science.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.740
They cannot assume that
all they need to know--

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.650
including the appetite
for engagement--

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.730
will be only in the client.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.530
MIT is a bubbling powerhouse
of engaging stuff.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.825
And if they could, as part
of what they are told-- they

00:06:35.825 --> 00:06:37.450
will have to do in
the future, and what

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.620
they have to do in this
course, to reach out

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.350
to engaging people, fellow
students, and junior faculty

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.430
or whoever may give them some
time-- to just go and say,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.910
what is exciting about this?

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.500
What are the cutting-edge areas?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.120
What are the
institutional challenges.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.355
So that they also have to
fuel their own appetite.

00:06:56.355 --> 00:06:57.980
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
Having an assignment

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.000
or having part of that final
project being like here's

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.650
the research component
that we expect you to do,

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.076
but we didn't put an
underline over it.

00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:08.700
SARA VERRILLI: We didn't make it
explicit that they needed to--

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.741
RICHARD EBERHARDT: We did
when it was in trouble.

00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:14.080
Like for Saving Gora Gora,
they were in big trouble.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.750
We told them a number-- you
told them, we told them.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.220
I think you'd be surprised
what they came up with.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.672
Because they actually, I
think, they took the baton

00:07:21.672 --> 00:07:22.380
and went with it.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:23.190
SARA VERRILLI: They
did that [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.490
PHILIP TAN: Nice.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.609
RICHARD EBERHARDT: The
other cholera team did not,

00:07:25.609 --> 00:07:27.150
and they were given
the same-- almost

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.580
the exact same-- feedback.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.330
That is the thing.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.970
PHILIP TAN: I think there
is a huge social barrier

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.360
between the undergraduates
and the rest of the institute.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.620
The noble laureates, and
even the post-docs here,

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.070
that's a lot of social
pressure keeping students away

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.650
from that kind of interaction.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.660
You're all right.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.086
All of these things do exist
here at MIT, but some of this

00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:51.970
is reinforced by
professors themselves--

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.553
professors who keep
their doors closed

00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:56.120
when they in their
office, things like that.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.680
And so I do think we have
to do give them the license,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.014
and sometimes that's pointing
them to specific people.

00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:06.430
RICHARD EBERHARDT: Yeah, giving
them resources like here's

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.220
a list.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.710
One of these might
pan out for you.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.585
The others might not.

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:13.950
And that's OK, just do what you
can, kind of prime them for it.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.724
PHILIP TAN: It's hard to be
a teenager in this space.

00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:19.390
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
Actually, since we're

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.973
talking about the
student preparedness

00:08:20.973 --> 00:08:24.880
in that research like what we
saw between what we consider

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.152
the supported teams versus
the unsupported teams, which

00:08:28.152 --> 00:08:30.110
may or may not be fair--
could be the motivated

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.150
teams versus the
unmotivated teams.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.826
Snap, in particular, really--

00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:35.409
PABLO SUAREZ:
[INAUDIBLE] correlation.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.809
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
--really well-supported.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.977
They actually reached out to
you all for help with the game.

00:08:41.977 --> 00:08:44.310
You actually even did testing
for them that was actually

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.780
coming from you and
Jana, yeah, because you

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:47.800
were running workshops.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.633
PABLO SUAREZ: Right.

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:51.140
RICHARD EBERHARDT: How did those
workshops run-- how did you

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.980
interact with the team?

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.570
PABLO SUAREZ: So,
first of all, I

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:58.070
think it's important to
distinguish not only what you

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.990
are calling supportive
versus unsupportive,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.950
but also Snap versus
everything else.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.660
Because Snap was a
game concept that

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.750
preexisted the course
that needed refinement

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.815
and digital interface.

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:11.690
So from that perspective,
it's not surprising

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.150
that they have something
clearly defined that they

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.710
could run faster and deeper.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.040
And the group was a group
that engaged and went

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.890
deep and went fast.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.970
The interaction
we had with them,

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.450
also, very importantly,
we have events

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.250
that we could use the product.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.930
So it was much easier
to give feedback

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.445
saying when we do
this, we expect

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:33.070
people that would get bored, why
don't we try this other thing.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.528
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
It's milestones,

00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:35.950
which we give them milestones.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.630
But there is no
weight behind them.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.620
These ones have an actual,
if it doesn't work by then,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.670
someone's going to have
egg on their face, right?

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.000
PABLO SUAREZ: And from that
perspective, we know this,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.820
but we can try to do
more of giving students

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.170
more proportion of work that
we know-- that we, the clients

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.800
know-- that we have milestones.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.570
And that is limited by
how much of the real world

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.630
gives us milestones to abide by.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.310
But we can try that.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.360
I do not feel comfortable with
the label supportive versus

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.150
unsupportive because it sounds
like some got time and support

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.660
and some others didn't.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.520
I think it's more about the
form of the relationship

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.640
and how the time was used or
the opportunity to use the time

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.510
was used.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.990
Because I have no doubt that
you supported the team when

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.110
you knew support was needed.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.280
And as far as I know, the
same was true on our part.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.520
I think it's more
about having sensors

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.340
about when support is needed
that is not being delivered.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.673
RICHARD EBERHARDT: I think
when we're talking about them

00:10:35.673 --> 00:10:38.150
in this way, I'm
using it based on how

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.050
they describe their
own relationship

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.480
and their own experience.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.515
So that the teams who we
are calling unsupported

00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:45.140
are the ones who, in
their postmortems,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.598
called out and
said, we didn't feel

00:10:46.598 --> 00:10:48.240
like we got client support.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.660
They got the same amount.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.000
It was a different
way, different quality,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.110
different quantity.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.693
SARA VERRILLI: The way to put
it is the same amount of support

00:10:55.693 --> 00:10:58.199
was there for them.

00:10:58.199 --> 00:10:59.990
One other way to put
it is they didn't know

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.590
how to reach out and get it.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.170
They didn't use
the resources that

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.810
were there because,
at some level,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:08.470
we weren't pushing them at them.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:11.950
And a lot of MIT courses tend
to encourage students to solve

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.454
all their problems themselves.

00:11:13.454 --> 00:11:14.870
They don't want
them reaching out.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.430
They want them--
figure this out.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.315
And so it may come
as more of a second--

00:11:20.315 --> 00:11:22.440
it may not come to them as
first nature to go, hey,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.065
we need to go and reach out
for more help and grab that--

00:11:25.065 --> 00:11:27.440
RICHARD EBERHARDT: And so
that's actually the same thing.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.020
So what we saw with
the Snap team is

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.360
we wanted-- the feedback
they were getting from us

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.615
was look at your front
end, look at your UI.

00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:37.370
We wanted to see a lot
of changes on the UI.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.365
Because they were working
on these milestones,

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.250
they were really worried
about the back end

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.291
so they were doing a lot
of work in the back end.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.980
They were getting two
different messages,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.970
and they chose client message
rather than instructor message.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:52.275
Totally OK and totally viable.

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:56.080
We took that into account.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.260
But I think the
main issues we had

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.150
with them is when
they got our message,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.317
it was, they heard it early on.

00:12:02.317 --> 00:12:04.650
They didn't react to it until
it was too late-- had they

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.220
done a little bit
extra in the beginning.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.770
So one thing I think we need
to think about with the class

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.410
is thinking about how are
we helping them understand

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.570
how to prioritize feedback?

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.880
Right?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.500
What's more important?

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.350
Could be because
here's something that's

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:23.474
actually going to get used.

00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:26.230
It could also be here's a lesson
we want to make sure they get.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.396
I think they got the lesson.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:29.314
They just got it
in a harder way.

00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:31.730
PHILIP TAN: Sometimes they get
a lesson at a point of time

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.880
that they can't
actually execute on it.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.120
But hopefully they can do it for
their next project after class.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.580
Something I want to
suggest, actually,

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.120
because we've been talking
about how it's been difficult

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.040
for us to figure out what's
going on inside the teams.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.410
We can see the games
and the testing,

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.100
but the team dynamics, we
don't find out about that

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.950
until near the end of the class.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:02.010
And something that we used
to do outside of this class,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.640
but in our research
work, was to get all off

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.540
the scrum masters together
on a regular basis

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.497
to just do an exchange of
information with each other.

00:13:11.497 --> 00:13:13.830
They don't even have to be
necessarily reporting to us--

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.020
although we can
moderate those sessions.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.270
It's more about them sharing
their experiences with each

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.970
other, and then it may make
it more obvious that there are

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.849
resources out there that some
teams are taking advantage

00:13:25.849 --> 00:13:26.890
of and some teams aren't.

00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:32.260
Of course, we can use those
situations for teaching,

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.640
but also for
teaching each other.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.225
SARA VERRILLI: Creating
some group, group support.

00:13:40.225 --> 00:13:41.850
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
We talked about that

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.590
before this semester started,
but we couldn't figure out

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.860
a way to do that fairly.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.900
I already feel
producers bear the brunt

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.419
of the work in the class.

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:53.960
They're the ones we
see all the time.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.480
We don't see the students
working on programming

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.530
or design as much.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.980
Design a little bit
more, but programming,

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.230
we just almost never see them.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.230
SARA VERRILLI: And we let
the teams use the producers

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.110
as their face-- so giving
all the presentations,

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.750
giving all the reports,
answering questions when

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:12.640
we ask questions in class.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.720
Think about how we convince the
teams to share out that work

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.370
a little bit more evenly.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.870
PHILIP TAN: Well,
perhaps, maybe, we

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.735
can reduce the extent
that we require

00:14:23.735 --> 00:14:26.480
these producers to do
presentations in class,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.666
and replace that with these
more closed-off sessions

00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:32.790
where they don't feel like
they have to be on stage

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.510
and put on the best
face for their team.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.080
They can actually just talk
about this is the problem

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.079
I'm having with my team.

00:14:38.597 --> 00:14:40.180
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
So one thing I also

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.596
wanted to make
sure that we talked

00:14:41.596 --> 00:14:43.230
about what was it like for you?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.670
How much of your
time did we demand?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.640
Was it a lot compared
to other projects?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.620
Was it a little bit?

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.625
Was it about moderate?

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:53.000
PABLO SUAREZ: I want to start
by saying one of the things

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.760
that I really appreciated
was the time we spent--

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.700
both face-to-face
and emailing and so

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.550
on-- before the
beginning of the course,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.100
to have understanding of
what you and your students

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.320
can offer, what we
need and can offer,

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.160
and to manage
expectations, as you said.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.990
I think that was very well done.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.590
And it's not always the case.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:16.620
So with the students and
professors and Red Cross,

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.480
in general, we
[INAUDIBLE], so thank you.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.030
That was really appreciated.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:27.135
I think that amount of time
that I personally had to give

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:30.290
was about as much as I
anticipated, about as much

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.880
as I think is reasonable
to expect for the future.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.770
We do have Jana, in particular,
and a few other members

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.120
of the team-- of
the Red Cross team--

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.900
who were available
to give a hand.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.460
And I think we needed
to improve because I

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.150
did make it very
clear that I couldn't

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.430
get five emails per
day asking questions.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:53.460
But to have some kind of ability
for the right contact when

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:57.220
either engagement levels are
too low or mega confusion

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.380
levels are too high or sense of
purpose is diluted and so on.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.570
So to refine that.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:09.730
I think it would be
better to think of times

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:15.050
when there can be slots
of decided interaction

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.110
between each team, and someone
from the client organization

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:22.050
that doesn't have
to be during class.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.494
Because I would always
interfere with your plan.

00:16:24.494 --> 00:16:25.910
You gave us one
opportunity that I

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.550
thought was very useful,
but a little bit late

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.346
in the development process
and also very crammed.

00:16:32.346 --> 00:16:33.762
By the time we
said, OK, these are

00:16:33.762 --> 00:16:35.760
the kind of things you
can do, there was no time

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.135
for them to think
and reflect on,

00:16:37.135 --> 00:16:40.440
OK, we can do A or B
or C. Show that to us,

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.960
and then us providing feedback.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.940
So even if it were one
more chance via Skype

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.960
but scheduled, planned, and if--
it is in the nature of our work

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.440
to have to travel, and it
is in the nature of our work

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.616
that travel timing changes
outside of our control.

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:57.740
So where there's a default
date, and if things have

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.020
to be changed, it is changed.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.420
So to know that there's going to
be an instance of feedback that

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.830
may be too little, too late,
still but to anticipate that.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.079
RICHARD EBERHARDT: Yeah,
part of that is the students,

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.240
we don't always know
the student's schedules.

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:14.130
So it could possibly be
planned in the beginning

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:14.910
of the semester.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.500
But planning it
before the semester

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.910
would be really difficult.
Unless we just say it--

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.810
this is the time that
you're going to have.

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.976
If you don't take advantage
of it, you don't get it.

00:17:21.976 --> 00:17:24.099
PABLO SUAREZ: Right.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.260
It has to be we
propose it's this week.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.540
This is the default time slot.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.036
If not, that time slot, agree
on a different time slot.

00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:32.410
And then it's up
to the students.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.060
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
So you're actually

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.450
saying you would have talked
to them a little bit more.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.230
PABLO SUAREZ: If
the problem was lack

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.410
of engagement or perception
of lack of support.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:40.720
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
So it's really

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.770
that planning and scheduling.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.310
So as long as that's
in place, then the time

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.810
is there, because
it's been planned.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:45.460
OK.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.835
PABLO SUAREZ: And
also I think it

00:17:46.835 --> 00:17:50.160
would have been nice for them
to have access to, say, someone

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.030
from the Ghana Team to
look at the color, someone

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:57.180
from the Heatwave Team in
Buenos Aires-- to at least

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.690
to get a flavor, there's
another human being there that

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.300
eventually can use their game.

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.630
And I didn't do enough
to help them envision

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.730
the user-- either
the Red Cross user

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.190
or the community level or
policy or government user.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.591
PHILIP TAN: I think we
need to state that strongly

00:18:14.591 --> 00:18:17.410
that it's not just the
information that you're

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:18.000
providing.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.240
It's the fact that there is
a real person who can really

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.830
benefit from the work
you're doing is much more

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.855
powerful than some sort
of abstracted audience.

00:18:25.855 --> 00:18:27.230
RICHARD EBERHARDT:
So we provided

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.990
plenty of documentation,
but that's not

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.130
the same as a human being.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.472
PHILIP TAN: That's not
the emotional drive

00:18:34.472 --> 00:18:36.180
that you're going to
get-- oh, someone is

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.472
counting on me doing good work.

00:18:37.472 --> 00:18:39.180
RICHARD EBERHARDT: So
maybe it might just

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.200
be something for us to talk
to the Terrascope folks

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.362
to see how they do that.

00:18:43.362 --> 00:18:44.820
PHILIP TAN: Well,
they specifically

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:50.140
get people who can commit
on regular meetings.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.350
And the idea is--
my understanding

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.070
is that it's for the
domain knowledge primarily.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.890
But you get that
side benefit of here

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:00.610
is a real human being who's
excited about this problem,

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:06.600
or maybe really concerned
about this problem,

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.266
and that can influence
the motivation of a team.

00:19:09.266 --> 00:19:11.390
PABLO SUAREZ: And also, I
don't know to what extent

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.040
we can keep cramming
what students have

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:15.400
to do-- I know they already
have to do way too much--

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.790
but to look at how
that kind of field

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:22.360
is currently being communicated
in the game universe

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.210
and outside of that.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:27.320
So PowerPoints or documents,
they're, across the board,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.520
generally boring
and unsuccessful--

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.530
even if they have
the right content.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.030
So for them to get a sense
that if someone really

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.770
needs to create
awareness on that topic,

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.650
and this is the best
they have in what

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.500
exists in the real world, how
about trying to give something

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.860
that makes people want to
do more through their game?

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.740
PHILIP TAN: I think saying, this
is how low the bar is, can we

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.616
get it slightly better, is
less motivating than saying,

00:19:53.616 --> 00:19:54.740
what's the best you can do?

00:19:58.995 --> 00:20:01.120
RICHARD EBERHARDT: But it's
also choosing something

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:02.620
that's going to get used.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.809
Why go in a direction that's--
if this is what those people

00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:09.350
are thinking about, if you give
them something completely not

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.724
like that at all, they're
probably not going to know what

00:20:11.724 --> 00:20:12.930
to do with it.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.970
PHILIP TAN: But I mean,
I can imagine things

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:17.360
like evaluating current
methods of teaching

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.930
about a certain concept, to be
part of that research process

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.590
that we've been talking about--
it's understanding the problem.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.590
RICHARD EBERHARDT: Cool.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.760
All right, so I think it's
about time to let you go.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.490
But thanks so much
for coming in.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.690
PHILIP TAN: We thank you.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.240
Huge gratitude.
