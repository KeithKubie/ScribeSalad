00:00:01.325 --> 00:00:02.772
- [Voiceover] Let's look
at this clock and see

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:06.388
if we can tell what time is shown on it.

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:07.812
First thing, when we look at a clock,

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:10.452
we have two hands and that's because time

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:12.268
is told in two parts.

00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:14.101
Time is told in hours,

00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:17.491
that's part.

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.881
And on a clock the hours are represented

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.528
by the short hand,

00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:24.445
and then the other part is minutes.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.443
And on an analog clock like this one,

00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:31.322
minutes are represented by the long hand.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:32.842
So let's look first at hours.

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.339
We have the short hand,

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.555
and it's between the six and the seven.

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:40.381
What that means is it's after 6 o'clock,

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.566
but not quite seven,

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.325
'cause the hour hand started at the top

00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:46.015
and worked its way around and it's gone

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:47.230
past 6 o'clock,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.158
but it's not seven.

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:51.661
So it's six something.

00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:52.935
Six something.

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.165
It might be 6:15, might be 6:45.

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:57.029
We'll figure out the minutes next,

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:58.753
but we know it's after 6 o'clock

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:00.017
but not a seven.

00:01:00.017 --> 00:01:03.079
So we'll put a six in our hours place.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.989
Then for minutes we have this longer hand

00:01:05.989 --> 00:01:09.711
which is pointing right here at this mark.

00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:12.222
And minutes, again, start at the top

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:13.832
and work their way around.

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:17.878
But now each of these
little spaces is one minute.

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:21.453
So we can go one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.327
and when we get to this first square,

00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:24.758
this first where this one is,

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:26.790
we've gone five minutes.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.159
Let's keep going like that.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.780
Six, seven, eight, nine,

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.503
10 at this next one,

00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.782
and maybe you see a pattern here.

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:36.744
Every time we get to one of these numbers

00:01:36.744 --> 00:01:38.324
or the squares, the bigger marks,

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:40.635
we've gone five more minutes.

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:45.108
So if we keep going this will
be 15 minutes past the hour.

00:01:45.108 --> 00:01:46.685
Keep going.

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:47.518
20.

00:01:48.398 --> 00:01:49.478
Keep going.

00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:50.311
25.

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:52.796
Now we can't go all the way to the six

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:54.484
because our minute hand stopped here.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:56.413
It hasn't reached this part.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:58.840
So after 25, we'll go
back to counting by one,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.691
is the one minute.

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.274
We have 25, 26, 27.

00:02:03.933 --> 00:02:07.199
The minute hand has gone
past 27 of these marks,

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:10.866
meaning that it is 27
minutes past the hour.

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:14.589
Let's try another one.

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:18.147
The hour hand is between
the four and the five,

00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:20.201
which means it's after 4 o'clock.

00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:22.290
It's some amount of minutes after four,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.834
but it is not yet five.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.705
And now let's look at our minute hand.

00:02:26.705 --> 00:02:29.555
The longer hand represents minutes.

00:02:29.555 --> 00:02:31.634
So the minute hand started at the top

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:33.884
and it's gone five, 10, 15,

00:02:35.775 --> 00:02:37.186
not quite to 20,

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:40.395
so let's go back to 15
and then count by ones.

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:41.645
16, 17, 18, 19.

00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:47.019
Our minute hand lines up to 19.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:51.329
So it is 19 minutes after four, or 4:19.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:56.916
On this one I encourage
you to pause the video

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.593
and see if you can figure out the time.

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:03.202
Okay, let's try it together now.

00:03:03.202 --> 00:03:07.034
So the hour hand, between
the seven and the eight.

00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:10.145
So it's after seven, but not quite eight,

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:12.699
and by looking at the hour hand we can see

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.346
it's quite a bit after seven 'cause

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:16.122
it's almost eight.

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:17.436
And looking at the minute hand,

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:18.987
confirms that the minute hand's gone

00:03:18.987 --> 00:03:20.195
all the way to here.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.586
It's almost back to the top.

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:25.706
And that minute hand, starting at the top,

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.873
has gone five, 10, 15, 20,

00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:30.951
25, 30, 35, 40,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.943
45, and one more, 46 minutes past.

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:40.688
46 minutes past seven.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.016
The time is 7:46.
