00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:01.872
- [Instructor] This over here is a picture

00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:03.499
of the Constitutional Convention,

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.130
which we mentioned happened in 1787.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.562
The original intent of the
Constitutional Convention

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:11.755
was to revise the
Articles of Confederation,

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:15.093
but folks like Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:17.987
really wanted to replace the
Articles of Confederation.

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:21.697
You can see it's being presided
over by George Washington.

00:00:21.697 --> 00:00:23.737
And it starts, the preamble says:

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.998
"We the People of the United States,

00:00:25.998 --> 00:00:28.509
"in Order to form a more perfect Union,

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.059
"establish Justice, insure
domestic Tranquility,

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.989
"provide for the common defense,

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.051
"promote the general Welfare,

00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:38.031
"and secure the Blessings of Liberty

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:41.757
"to ourselves and our Posterity,
do ordain and establish

00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:46.037
"this Constitution for the
United States of America."

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:49.241
Once again, pause this video,
and think about whether

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.626
you see ideas of popular
sovereignty, limited government,

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:56.006
social contract, natural rights,

00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:57.548
going on even in this preamble,

00:00:57.548 --> 00:01:00.194
or even from the fact
that they took the trouble

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.761
to create this Constitution.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.490
Let's start at the beginning.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.675
It starts with "We the People."

00:01:06.675 --> 00:01:07.892
We, the people, are the ones

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:10.285
that are creating this Constitution.

00:01:10.285 --> 00:01:12.643
And not only does it start
with "We the People,"

00:01:12.643 --> 00:01:14.508
but "We the People" is
intentionally written

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:17.152
in this very, very large
writing right over here.

00:01:17.152 --> 00:01:19.638
This is a picture of the Constitution.

00:01:19.638 --> 00:01:21.516
It's really all about "We the People."

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:23.331
The people are sovereign.

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.999
This idea of popular sovereignty
comes out loud and clear

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.121
in not just the Declaration
of Independence,

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:33.802
but also the US Constitution.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.609
The fact that "We the People"

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.265
are setting up this government,

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.187
this is all about social contract.

00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:42.444
They are forming a government.

00:01:42.444 --> 00:01:45.525
They're forming a social
contract with a government

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:48.333
that is going to protect,

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.638
that is going to establish justice,

00:01:50.638 --> 00:01:52.593
provide for the common defense,

00:01:52.593 --> 00:01:54.615
promote the general welfare.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:55.703
Let me make this clear.

00:01:55.703 --> 00:01:57.722
That is this, this is all social contract.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.527
This is what we expect this government

00:01:59.527 --> 00:02:01.204
that we're creating to do.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:02.812
"Promote the general welfare,

00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:06.061
"and secure the Blessings of Liberty

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.886
"to ourselves and our Posterity."

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:11.809
Now what about things
like limited government?

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:15.976
Well, just the very fact
that we have a Constitution

00:02:16.862 --> 00:02:20.186
is a sign of limited government,

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:22.490
that it isn't just a pure democracy,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.619
that whoever is governing
is going to be constrained.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:28.296
There, the rights of the government

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:31.817
are going to be described
by this constitution.

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:34.531
We also talk about the
Blessings of Liberty,

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.587
so this is another
reference to natural rights.

00:02:37.587 --> 00:02:38.881
The Declaration of Independence is

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.860
a little bit more clear
about natural rights,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.198
or a little bit more explicit,

00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:45.288
but the Blessings of
Liberty does talk about,

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:49.642
or that's maybe in reference
to, natural rights.

00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:51.660
I will leave you there.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.821
As we study US Government,

00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:55.470
both the Declaration of Independence

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.633
and even more so the US Constitution

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.755
are going to be things
that we keep going back to

00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:04.128
to understand how we are trying to form

00:03:04.128 --> 00:03:07.266
a more perfect Union, and what is in line

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:11.259
with the vision of our Founding
Fathers, and what isn't?
