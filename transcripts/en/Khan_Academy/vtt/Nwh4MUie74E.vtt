00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:02.357
- [Voiceover] The graph
above shows a number

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:06.850
of George's unsold candy
bars over a 10-day period.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.498
The points on the graph all lie

00:00:08.498 --> 00:00:10.167
on which of the following lines?

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.891
Let's see, as the days go
by he has fewer and fewer

00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:16.568
unsold candy bars, all the
way until we get to day 10,

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:18.187
and he sold all of his candy bars,

00:00:18.187 --> 00:00:20.507
'cause he has no unsold candy bars left.

00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.257
But anyway, they want us to figure out

00:00:22.257 --> 00:00:24.530
what could be the graph of the line,

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.467
or the points on the graph all lie

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:28.908
on which of the following lines?

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:32.949
Let's just think about
this line a little bit.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.844
Let's just think about
this line a little bit.

00:00:35.844 --> 00:00:37.678
So when we're thinking about
any line, we could think about,

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:42.182
"Well, what's the slope
of this line going to be?"

00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:45.215
So, let's see, our slope.

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:48.853
Our slope is our change
in our vertical-axis

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:51.872
for a given change in our horizontal-axis.

00:00:51.872 --> 00:00:53.787
And so let's say that we pick the change

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:58.319
in our horizontal-axis
to be 10, 10 days go by.

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.263
So our change in our
horizontal-axis is 10 days,

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:03.226
and so what was the
change in our vertical?

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:04.402
Well, the change in our vertical

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:08.182
was 120 candy bars, or negative 120.

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:11.630
So we went down, when number
of days increased by 10,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.612
positive 10, our candy
bars decreased by 120.

00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:18.549
Decreased by 120, and so
what's that going to be?

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.714
That's going to be negative 12.

00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:25.858
So we want to align with
a slope of negative 12,

00:01:25.858 --> 00:01:28.770
and immediately when you look over here...

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890
we could already start to
think about the y-intercept,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.372
but immediately when you look over here,

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:35.289
the slope is going to be
the coefficient on the x.

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.925
So here this is a slope of
positive 10, that's not right.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.930
Slope of positive 10, that's not right.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.683
Slope of positive 12, not
negative 12, that's not right.

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:46.724
Slope of negative 10, that's not right.

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:48.749
And right over here, we
have our last choice,

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:52.041
slope of negative 12, so our choice is E.

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.665
But we could keep going even
if this was a free answer,

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:57.625
we could still figure
this out, because we know

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.168
that the slope of a line,
or the equation of a line,

00:02:00.168 --> 00:02:03.462
is y is equal to your slope...

00:02:03.462 --> 00:02:05.580
your slope times x,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.866
plus your y-intercept.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:11.518
Now we already figured out
that the slope right over here

00:02:11.518 --> 00:02:14.316
is negative 12, and
what's our y-intercept?

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:16.825
Well, that's what y is equal
to when x is equal to zero.

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:20.318
When x is equal to zero,
when no days have gone by,

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:22.837
George has got 120 candy bars.

00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:26.041
So this right over here
is going to be 120.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.151
So the equation of our line is
going to be, y is equal to...

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.353
even if we didn't have these choices,

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:35.993
y is equal to negative 12 times x,

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:38.298
plus 120.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:40.386
Or, you could obviously
swap these two around,

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:42.878
and write it as 120 minus 12x,

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:46.106
which is exactly what
they did right over here.
