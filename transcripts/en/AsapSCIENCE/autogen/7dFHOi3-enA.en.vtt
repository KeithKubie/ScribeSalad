00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.689
 Our lip volume will be because 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.879
 Increased age or minor bruise 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.280
 Narrowing with a variety of genetic factors 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.900
 So by injecting fillers into the lips in the US, the process 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.030
 Become quite common 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.799
 Thank you, kylie, what is the trend of this rising trend? 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.150
 Question? 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.190
 What happens when you inject lip fillings? 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.230
 Lip filler is often made up of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.720
 Made of hyaluronic acid, hyaluronic acid may be 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.010
 The safest choice today 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 Hyaluronic acid in our natural presence in our skin 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.480
 It is responsible for managing nutrients, hormones 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.070
 And the movement of cells. Is unlikely to say 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.140
 After the injection of hyaluronic acid 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 There will be an allergic reaction. But how does hyaluronic acid work? 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.410
 Although this process will be because 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.270
 Human face structure 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.040
 Related to their own goals 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.780
 The common process is to deal with deflated 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.450
 Vermilion or sagging of the upper lip 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.610
 Once injected with hyaluronic acid 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.350
 (Hyaluronic acid is a polar sugar), physically 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.149
 Filled up with lips but also absorbed 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.649
 Naturally stored moisture in the body 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.809
 To create more plump lips 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.730
 Doctors are very likely to use injection hyaluronic acid 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.370
 To repair your original asymmetrical lips 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.870
 Or make the shape of the lips like the bow of Cupid 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.609
 That is, the middle of the upper lip is a little concave. 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 This shape is considered very young and attractive 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.329
 Are you afraid of a syringe? 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.860
 Usually anesthesia is like 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.720
 You go to the dentist, the doctor uses the same kind of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.240
 Or mixing the lip filler itself 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 To reduce pain. After injection 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.600
 Within 4~6 months 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.640
 Lip filler is metabolized by the body 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.470
 Will follow the individual 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.270
 Physiological conditions and metabolism vary. But there is any 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.619
 Side effects? Even with the best 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.240
 Technology, there will still be a lot in 2 days to 2 weeks 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 Swollen and indigo 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 Appeared near the injection site 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119
 Short-term complications like a lump can 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.130
 Being massaged or 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.840
 Treated with hyaluroidase (this is an enzyme) 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.570
 It will safely break down the lip filling 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.009
 And it is done quickly. This enzyme can also be injected 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.110
 To the lips, if the guests are not satisfied 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.150
 The result of the operation. In other words, this enzyme can make the surgery not happen. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.009
 Long-term or late onset 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.020
 Impact, like infection, chronic 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.579
 Inflammation and allergic reactions 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.509
 It will happen too. But these symptoms 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.740
 Very rare 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.420
 They usually follow 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 Unlicensed person 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 Surgery related and may only be 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.780
 Oral medication. The only downside may be 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.369
 Will spend you 500~2000 dollars 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.229
 The price is related to the amount you need to inject 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.759
 So if you are willing to spend your 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.290
 Money on your lips 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.630
 Lip surgery may be a safe procedure 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.310
 And its risk can be minimized 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.049
 When you give surgery to a licensed doctor 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.489
