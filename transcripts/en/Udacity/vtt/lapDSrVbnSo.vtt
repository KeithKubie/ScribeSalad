00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.078
At the beginning of this course we enumerated seven major principles of

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:07.280
knowledge based AI agents that we'll cover in CS 7637.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.600
Now let's wrap up this course by revisiting each of the seven principles.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.090
Here is the first one. Knowledge based AI agents represent in

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.000
organize knowledge into knowledge structures to guide and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.910
support reasoning. So the basic paradigm here is represent and reason.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.042
Represent and reason. If you want to reason about the world,

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:31.190
you'd have to represent knowledge about the world in some way. You not only want

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.140
to represent knowledge to support reasoning, you also want to organize this

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.440
knowledge into knowledge structures to guide, to focus the reasoning.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.760
Let us look at a few examples that we covered in this course about dispensing.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.310
Semantic networks not only allow us to represent knowledge about the world,

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.870
they also allows us to organize that knowledge in the form of a network. We use

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.900
semantic networks to address the problem of the guards and prisoners dilemma.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.592
The advantage of the semantic network was that they expose the constraints of

00:01:01.592 --> 00:01:05.970
this problems so clearly, so that we can in fact reason about it. And notice

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
that the organization helps us focus the reasoning. Because of the organization,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.870
there's so many other choices we don't have even have to reason about them.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.110
Frames were on to the knowledge structure that organize knowledge, and

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.000
guided and supported reasoning. Given frames for things like earthquakes,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
we could reason about sentences like, a serious earthquake killed 25 people in

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.470
a particular country. We'll also use frames to support common sense reasoning.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.900
Here, Ashok is moving his body part to a sitting position. Here,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.090
Ashok is moving himself into a sitting position. Here, Andrew sees Ashok.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.240
Now Andrew moves to the same place as Ashok, and Andrew then moves in

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.910
menu to Ashok. This is about a story about visiting a restaurant. Once again,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.250
there are knowledge structures here. These knowledge structures are not

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.910
only representing knowledge, they are organizing knowledge into a sequence of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.400
actions. These knowledge structures help generate expectations. So

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.830
we know what Ashok expects to happen next in any of these situations.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.839
We also know how Ashok can detect surprises. When the non-obvious thing happens,

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.945
Ashok knows that it has warranted the expectations of the scripts, and

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:22.060
can do something about it. This is how the script support in guided reasoning.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.622
We also saw this principle in action, when we were talking what explanation

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:30.310
based learning. In order to show that an instance was an example of a particular

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.870
concept, cup, we constructed complex explanations. In this case,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.830
we were constructing the complex knowledge structure on the fly out of smaller

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.770
knowledge structures. The smallest knowledge structures came out of precedents,

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.610
or examples we had already known.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.978
Then we composed the knowledge of these various knowledge structures, into

00:02:49.978 --> 00:02:54.360
a complex explanation to doable reasoning, to guide and support their reasoning.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.170
You've seen this principle in action in several other places in this course.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.110
This is one of the fundamental principles. Represent, organize, reason.
