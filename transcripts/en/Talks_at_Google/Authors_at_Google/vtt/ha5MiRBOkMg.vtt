[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:06.050
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Please
welcome to the Talks at Google

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.887
stage, Mr. Jerry Buting.

00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:10.715
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:12.340
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.131
JERRY BUTING: Sure.

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:14.740
Thank you.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.890
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So the book
is "Illusion of Justice--

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.360
Inside Making a Murder and
America's Broken System."

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.600
I'd like to start by asking you,
if you could, in your words,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.740
define for us justice
and how you think

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.920
that the system in
America has strayed

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.402
from what is actually justice.

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:37.110
JERRY BUTING: Well,
it's a good question.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.443
We could probably spend the
whole day talking about what

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:41.280
justice is and isn't.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.400
The one thing that sometimes
people lose sight of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.740
is that this is
a human endeavor.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.010
And whenever there are
human beings involved,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.370
there are going to be differing
opinions about what's just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.420
and what's not.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.000
Certainly somebody who's
the victim of a crime

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.520
is going to have one view.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.270
The person who's accused of a
crime is going to have another.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.099
But real justice
should be somewhere

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:11.250
in the middle where the people
as a whole feel like justice

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.770
has been served by--

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.620
and that's why in our country,
we have so many processes.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.190
And due process is
such an important thing

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.130
so that if somebody is allowed
to fully present a defense,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.220
and if the jury is
really fair, justice

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.980
should be served in most cases.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.620
Now there are times where
juries make mistakes,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.050
and innocent people
get convicted.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.630
And one of the
fallacies is that, well,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.390
if a jury gets it wrong,
then all you've got to do

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.430
is wait for the appeal.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.464
The appellate court
will correct it.

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:50.880
And unfortunately, that's not
the way the system's set up.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.320
The system is set
up really to ensure

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.210
that judgments are final.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.060
And they make it
very, very difficult

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.450
for you to reopen
a case if there has

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.760
been a miscarriage of justice.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.444
It's interesting, in the
UK, they call it that.

00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:09.110
They don't call it
wrongful convictions.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.090
They call it a
miscarriage of justice.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.000
They have commissions that are
called miscarriage of justice

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.610
commissions where the train
sort of goes off the tracks,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.670
something happens, and the
wrong person is convicted,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.470
or there's corruption
that's allowed

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.430
to seep into the system.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.780
And ultimately, there
are so many things

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.740
tugging and pulling at
justice, whether it's

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.194
the media that has one agenda
that they're trying to sell.

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:44.030
They used to be trying
to sell newspapers.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.529
Most people don't
buy those anymore.

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.740
So it's clickbait where
they're trying to get somebody

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.375
to click on their article.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.900
But that may not
really be the truth.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.990
And certainly it
wouldn't be just

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.010
if that was what the whole
system was designed to protect.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.900
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So
if it does come down

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.080
to justice being about--

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.580
it's almost the greatest
good for the greatest number.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.160
Everybody sort of
feels good that justice

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.360
was served in that.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.820
How does that
align with the rule

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.470
of law, which is a much more
black and white situation?

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.580
There's not a lot of room for
opinion if the law is the law.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.500
JERRY BUTING: Well,
again, part of it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.710
comes down to you
have to first start

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.360
with the fundamental
understanding

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.200
that these are human beings
that are running the system

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.270
and that there will be mistakes.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.060
And I have a quote in
my book from John Adams

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.730
before the Revolutionary
War actually

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.660
when he defended-- he
was a defense attorney,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.900
and he defended British
soldiers who were accused

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.710
of massacre of colonists.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.820
And in his closing argument, he
sort of paraphrased something

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.480
that goes even long back
before him to black men

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.320
and been traced even far enough
back in the English common law

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.090
than that.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.960
And it's the idea that
it really is better

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.640
that 10 guilty people go free
than that one innocent person

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.019
be convicted.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.100
Why?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.920
Well, as John Adams put it, it's
because the crimes and misdeeds

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.510
are so numerous
that you can never

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.050
prosecute every single one
of them and get a conviction.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.620
But if you convict
the innocent--

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.420
and particularly in
a death penalty case,

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.360
if you convict the innocent
and the innocent person

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.420
is executed or faces
the death penalty--

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.600
then that really
upsets all of society,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.960
because then the innocent
person will say, well,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.570
if innocence isn't
enough to protect me

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.970
from being executed
or being imprisoned

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.360
for the rest of my life, why
should I obey the law at all?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.810
And once that idea
takes root in society,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.810
you have a complete
disrespect for the law.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.480
And the rule of law
will not exist at all.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.220
So those are some of the
fundamental principles

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.110
that even though the rule of
law is very, very important,

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:22.040
it's supposed to err on the
side of protecting the innocent,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.690
rather than what I think all
too often nowadays people

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.800
think is, well, if an innocent
person is convicted here there

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.920
and gets 20 years or 30 years
or whatever, that's just kind

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.570
of the cost of doing business.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.170
We'd rather have that than have
some terrorist running free.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.840
So things have sort of
flipped upside down.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.290
And part of that may
also be why there

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.890
is such a mistrust in certain
communities in this country--

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.520
people of color or
recent immigrants

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.980
who feel that the law
isn't fair to them

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.110
and doesn't apply to them.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.760
The rule of law
doesn't apply to them.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.810
There is this growing distrust
in the community of the police

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.090
and the law as a whole.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.100
And there's a lot
of reasons for that.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.480
But some of it, I
think, comes down

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.220
to the loss of
this understanding

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.490
that we really do need to err
on the side of the innocent.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.600
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: We
touched on the fallibility

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.720
of the human element and then
the shift and the change.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.590
The very sort of
definitive statement

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.360
of "America's
Broken System," I'd

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.085
like to dive into that
a little bit more.

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:37.876
JERRY BUTING: Sure.

00:06:37.876 --> 00:06:40.640
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: What are some
of the major ways that elements

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.250
of the justice system have
just fallen apart and failed

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.577
inside the United States?

00:06:45.577 --> 00:06:47.160
JERRY BUTING: Well,
one of the biggest

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.950
is the chronic underfunding
of indigent defense.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.280
The vast majority of people--
you can go even beyond that

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.190
and say, why is it that 80% of
the people who are prosecuted

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.370
can't afford their own lawyers?

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.560
Is it because poor people commit
crimes, and rich people don't?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.060
No.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.620
Why is it that we focus
so much of our resources

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.540
on prosecuting poor people?

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.210
They're the grist of
the conviction mill

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.890
in our criminal justice system.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.680
We lock them up for
ridiculously long times.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.090
We have 5% of the world's
population in America

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.490
but 20% of the incarcerated
people in the world--

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.580
an incredible imbalance,
shocking statistic.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.600
And that includes North
Korea and Russia, China--

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.760
any kind of repressive regimes.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.010
And partly, it's the length
of sentences that we have.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.900
And that gets disproportionately
applied to the poor.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:59.220
So when 80%, 85% of the people
who are charged and processed

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.540
in our criminal justice system
can't afford their own lawyer,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.200
you have to ask why that is.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:07.920
Secondly--

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.780
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Well, I
want to ask now why that is.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.760
JERRY BUTING: Well, there's
a whole lot of things.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.870
Part of it is sort of
almost a vicious circle--

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.790
a self-fulfilling prophecy
that happens where--

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:28.770
you see it in Steven
Avery's case, quite frankly,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.530
and other small towns
all over the world

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.539
and certainly all
of our country--

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.240
where you often
will get somebody

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.179
who the police look at as
sort of on the wrong side

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.169
of the tracks.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:44.010
Maybe he's sort of a
smart mouth teenager.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.600
And if you've ever seen
a cop with an attitude,

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.490
they don't like that.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.800
And so then that
kid gets hauled in.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.890
And he gets his
first minor record.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.700
And then that
happens repeatedly.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.750
And then there's an
engendering of disrespect.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.470
So then maybe he's
kicked out of school.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.420
Or even go before that,
you've got poor people

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.310
who are evicted from homes.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.127
And then they pull
them out of the school

00:09:14.127 --> 00:09:15.960
that they're comfortable
in, and now they're

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960
into a different school.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.590
And maybe they're going to fail
academically because of that,

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.410
because they're constantly
being evicted and moved

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.430
into different schools.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.470
And they don't have
that kind of support.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.170
And then that's going to make
it more difficult for them

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.810
to get the education,
to get the jobs.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:38.920
And it's more complicated
than I'm getting into

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.900
and that we can
talk about today.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.050
But back to your
first question, which

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.800
is, what's the
single biggest issue?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.390
If there is one
single big issue,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.820
I would say it's the
lack of resources

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.510
given to people who need to
have somebody defend them.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:00.329
So it's not entirely
just the defense side.

00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:01.620
The prosecutors are overworked.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.630
The prosecutors are underfunded.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.810
Courts are underfunded as well.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.760
But just to give
you one example,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.120
in Wisconsin, if
you're appointed

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.750
a staff-salaried
public defender,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.540
like I started off
as, you will get

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.910
one level of care
and representation,

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.540
generally better than if you
don't get one of those lawyers

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.550
and you're instead appointed
a private attorney on a list,

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.345
because those people only
get paid $40 an hour.

00:10:35.345 --> 00:10:36.720
And out of that,
they're supposed

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.770
to pay their rent, their
utilities, their staffs--

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.950
secretaries, assistants,
if they have any--

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.750
when the average
overhead, and not

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.000
in a place like New York
City where it's a lot higher,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.910
but the average overhead is
probably somewhere $50 to $60

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.320
an hour.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.620
So the quality of
lawyers that you

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.995
get willing to take those
cases, you get what you pay for.

00:10:58.995 --> 00:11:00.870
You can't get a plumber
to come to your house

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.760
for less than $100.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.090
And to pay lawyers
only $40 an hour--

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:11.100
when I started in 1981 in
Wisconsin, it was $45 an hour.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:16.140
1981 dollars-- that's about
$5 or $6 now after inflation.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:21.570
So you end up with people
like poor Brendan Dassey had

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.400
who are just trying
to cut a deal

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.520
and think their client's guilty.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.830
But there's a story in the book
where I fell prey to that, too.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.660
I was a staffed lawyer.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.070
And sometimes the pressures
that public defenders have

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.530
of having to continually
open new cases,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.010
whether you close them or
not, you make snap judgments.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.820
And in one particular story--

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.000
I won't get into it right
now, but it's in the book--

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.220
I made the snap judgment
that a client was guilty,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.120
and I was wrong.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.520
And my later wife
proved me wrong.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.220
And what that told
me was that I needed

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.710
to get out of that
kind of a rat race

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.230
where I could practice
law in a better way, where

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.435
I could control my workflow.

00:12:11.435 --> 00:12:12.310
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Yeah.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.520
It seems interesting
to note, as we

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.600
spoke about earlier,
the black and whiteness

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.550
of the rule of law.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.290
But we've moved into justice
kind of as a business,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.930
it sounds like you're
saying, to where

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.600
the quality next to a price
tag is actually relevant.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.330
So instead of a
situation where we're

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.300
taking the evidence that we
have, the evidence as it's

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.600
presented, and applying
that to the law

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.350
and coming to the
correct answer,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.041
the quality has skewed the
justice system away from that.

00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:46.540
JERRY BUTING: Well, it's partly
because our system is set up

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.030
to be-- it's an
adversary system.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.640
The idea is that if you
have-- and this goes way,

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.590
way way back into the
English common law--

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.740
that if you have reasonably
equal, competent advocates

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.430
on both sides as
adversaries advocating

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.160
for one side or the
other and then there's

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.490
a neutral jury or
judge in the middle,

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.530
the truth will come out that
way, because you can always--

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.180
think about when somebody tells
you their side of the story.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.899
And you hear it, and
it sounds believable

00:13:20.899 --> 00:13:22.940
until you hear maybe the
other side of the story.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.180
You start thinking,
well, maybe not.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:32.050
And if you have advocates for
both sides and they're equal,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.980
then that's the best
way to get at the truth.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.734
At least, that's the
English and American system.

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:40.150
There are other
parts of the world

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.760
that use different inquisitorial
types of techniques.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:50.120
But what's happened is there
is a huge imbalance where

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.410
the prosecutors, even
though they're underfunded,

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.410
they still have
vastly more resources

00:13:56.410 --> 00:14:02.270
and money to put to a
case than the defense.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.850
The Avery case is
another example

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.160
where the prosecution
can just call up

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.860
the FBI, multimillion dollar
budget, and stop everything

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.720
and focus on that one case.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.680
Defense can't do that.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:19.120
And in the majority
of cases, there's

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.550
this really huge imbalance
where the defense

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:29.954
is no longer an equal party
in that adversary system.

00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:31.120
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Interesting.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.590
JERRY BUTING: And even if
you've got the dream team,

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.960
you're still not ever going
to be completely match

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:41.020
the resources of the
government, because after all,

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.330
they're just using your
money-- taxpayers' money.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.995
There's no end to that, right?

00:14:45.995 --> 00:14:48.620
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Or they just go
print some more, and it's fine.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.540
JERRY BUTING: Yeah, right.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.081
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So it does bring
up another interesting thing

00:14:52.081 --> 00:14:54.820
that I would like to talk, about
which is judges and juries.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.370
And I think I want to start
with the judges' side of it.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:00.760
In the ideal presentation
of the system,

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.710
you have a neutral judge.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.720
But you've talked before
in other appearances

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:08.170
about jaded judges
or judges who are

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.900
beholden to an electorate,
especially state judges.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.347
They're all elected positions.

00:15:12.347 --> 00:15:13.180
JERRY BUTING: Right.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:16.690
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: When we
get into elected judges,

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.150
how much does the
popularity contest

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.570
affect justice being served?

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.460
And then when I say
that, what I mean

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.830
is, are we accurately
applying the rule of law

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.030
through the eyes of the judges,
or are the judges bending more

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.220
toward the will of the people?

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.384
And if that's the
case, because they

00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:36.800
don't want to lose
their elected--

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.670
aren't they applying what
the people in that area

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.894
want as their laws?

00:15:41.894 --> 00:15:43.060
JERRY BUTING: They might be.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:47.050
But the system is set up
with the understanding

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:50.200
that the people,
the populace might

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.760
be swayed by whatever is
the politically correct lens

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.150
of the time or the
passions of the moment,

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:02.290
rather than dispassionately
applying the rule of law.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.290
So this case-- another example--

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.850
when the Steven Avery case
was in the pretrial setting,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.730
because of the special
prosecutor's press

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.630
conference and the way
the media was covering it,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:22.270
he was easily the most hated
man in the state, easily,

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:26.260
at least as much as
Jeffrey Dahmer ever was--

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.190
more so probably, because
even after Jeffrey Dahmer,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.640
they tried to get a
ballot, a referendum

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.310
to reinstate the death
penalty in Wisconsin, which

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.710
hadn't happened since 1853--

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.357
the longest continuous
period of time without it.

00:16:41.357 --> 00:16:42.940
They had never had
a referendum on it.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.050
It was just they had
tried a number of times,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.210
after Jeffrey Dahmer
in particular.

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.500
Didn't work-- but after the
press conference in this case

00:16:53.500 --> 00:17:00.880
where Mr. Avery was portrayed
as this monster who did this

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.290
horrible, brutal rape,
murder, mutilation,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.880
torture of this woman--

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.150
all of which was
totally unsupported

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:12.160
by the evidence--
in fact, disproven

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.290
by the physical evidence.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.599
He became so hated
that the legislature

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.920
put a referendum on the ballot.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.050
It passed.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:27.099
55% people voted to
reinstate the death penalty

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.230
three months before his trial.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.030
Now the legislature
still had to act.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.705
It wasn't a binding referendum
like you see in California.

00:17:34.705 --> 00:17:36.610
And cooler heads
finally prevailed.

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:44.120
But that's an idea of what a
public sentiment and passions

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.620
can be.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.090
Now, people who have watched the
documentary, even if you're not

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.900
convinced of Steven
Avery's innocence,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.060
they recognize that there's
some real questions--

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.260
unanswered questions.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:59.410
And they don't feel about
it the same way as they did.

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:05.920
And I use that as an example,
because now if judges only

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.570
acted as the conduits for that
kind of public passion, then

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.130
there would be no rule of law.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.410
It would sway back and
forth with the winds as they

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:19.270
blow, rather than judges
applying the law as it should

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.090
be applied, notwithstanding
the pressures that they

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.389
get from the populace.

00:18:24.389 --> 00:18:25.930
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Just
to sidetrack off

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.810
of something you said
there, you mentioned

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.500
about the conversation and the
death penalty being brought up.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.640
And I am curious, do
you think that that

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.270
was a motivating factor,
even prior to the case

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.880
seeing the courtroom, prior
to the press conference?

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.580
Did they look at this as, hey,
this is an opportunity where

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.440
we can get this
guy, and we can use

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.620
this to motivate this political
whirlwind around the death

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.584
penalty in Wisconsin?

00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:50.750
JERRY BUTING: I don't know
that I would go that far.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.920
I think it was a more
personal animus about him,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.910
between him and the
Manitowoc County authorities.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:05.980
I think once it hit
the media and became

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.200
a big, high publicity
case, the people

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.560
who had wanted all along to
bring back the death penalty

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.540
saw that as an
opportunity and seized

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.164
on it as an opportunistic
chance to try and do that.

00:19:18.164 --> 00:19:19.330
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Interesting.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.940
To get back on track of what
we were talking about before,

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.732
you talked about the
populace and the winds

00:19:23.732 --> 00:19:25.023
and the change of the populace.

00:19:25.023 --> 00:19:27.080
That leads us right into
talking about juries,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.170
which you've alluded before
that juries are a problem.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.940
Jurors can become jaded.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:37.550
And that can affect the
ability to make fair judgment

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:38.950
of justice in the room.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.260
And I think we all
know in this audience

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.890
that sequestration from
information in today's age

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.320
is nearly impossible.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:52.570
Are our peers still capable
of forming juries that

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:56.000
can deliver justice for us?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.610
JERRY BUTING: Well,
I think that's been

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.850
a question for the ages.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.960
If you go back at the
founding of our country,

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.070
we had all kinds of
pamphlets and many newspapers

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.990
that were scurrilous gossip
and unfounded rumors,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.670
not unlike what you see on the
internet sometimes these days.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.700
But it wasn't
electronically shared,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:29.330
but it was still shared
pretty widely with people

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:32.330
who are potential jurors.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.860
In small towns, you've always
had the gossip in the town

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.990
or at the beauty parlor or
the fence between the yard

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.540
where there's
things that are said

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:51.110
about somebody who then they may
later have to judge as jurors.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.580
And that could
influence them, too.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:57.530
So it's more widespread now
with the information age

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.020
and the digital age.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.770
But does that mean
that we can't still

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.000
deal with it in our system?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.680
And I think we still can.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.940
But I think it takes more effort
by judges to ferret out people

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.110
who can't.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.880
Not everybody can
be a good juror.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.460
And even if you could be a
good juror in one kind of case,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.310
you may not be well-suited
for this particular case

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.700
that you're brought in on.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.590
And what you can't
do is just say,

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.570
I'll take the first
12 people who walk in,

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.515
and those are going
to be the jurors.

00:21:31.515 --> 00:21:33.390
And no, we're not going
to ask any questions.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.790
And some judges rush that whole
jury selection process through

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.530
so fast that you
end up with jurors

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:44.070
who really can't set aside.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.450
The law has never
been that a juror

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:49.642
has to come in completely
ignorant of everything.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.100
But what they have
to be able to do

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.420
is, whatever pretrial
information they've received,

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.290
they've got to be able to
truly and fairly set it

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.390
aside and understand
that what they heard

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.950
outside the courtroom
may not be true

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:06.040
and that what they have
to base their judgment on

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.750
is what's in the courtroom.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.040
Now if you can't do
that, then you've

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.110
got to be honest about it
and say, I can't do that.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:20.520
And a judge has to be
careful to try and ferret out

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.550
those people who really
aren't able to do it.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.590
So in this case, for instance,
it came up late in the trial

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.360
that every day the judge
would tell-- the jury

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.090
was not sequestered
until deliberations.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.500
And you can still do that.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.270
You take away their
cell phones and when

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.765
they're in deliberations,
they're supposed to be cut off.

00:22:39.765 --> 00:22:43.920
But in a long trial, it's
very hard to do that.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.060
But they were told every day,
don't go on the internet,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.110
don't do any computer
searches, don't watch any TV

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.900
or talk to anybody who's
trying to give you information.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:23:00.630
And it came out, as the trial
went on, that one woman--

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.200
it turns out, her husband
was watching television

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.060
and telling her
everything that happened

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.690
after they left the courtroom
when the jury was supposed

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.230
to be out.

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.490
And there were legal issues.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.569
And some evidence was excluded.

00:23:14.569 --> 00:23:15.610
Some would later come in.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.276
But all those things
that usually jurors

00:23:17.276 --> 00:23:19.180
aren't supposed
to be focused on,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.120
this juror's husband
was telling her.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:27.250
Another one was saying
something like, yeah,

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.940
the judge always tells
us, don't search anything

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.820
on your computer, don't
do any internet searches.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.640
But you can just
delete whatever you do.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.390
They'd never know.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.777
How would they ever know?

00:23:38.777 --> 00:23:41.110
And another juror spoke up
and said, oh, no, no, no, you

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.860
don't understand, it's
never really deleted.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:45.730
They can find it.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.220
And then the guy
just turned ashen

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:54.050
and continued to deny it when
he was brought into the judge

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.820
and questioned by the judge.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.470
One of the other jurors kind
of ratted that person out.

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:03.800
But we took a long
time searching

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.080
for jurors in that case.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.600
But most of the
time, they don't.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.420
And so if that
happens in our case--

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.110
if it happened in our
case, although our case was

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.990
higher publicity than a lot--

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.610
and that's the other thing
is the run of the mill trial

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.500
is not going to have
that much information

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.580
available on the internet or
social media talking about it.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.920
So it is easier, I
think, to still get

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:35.050
jurors who are
uninfluenced and unexposed

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.420
to the kinds of information
that shouldn't be coming in

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.885
until they hear it in court.

00:24:38.885 --> 00:24:40.510
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Well,
it's interesting,

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.590
because that causes me to
think about "Making a Murder,"

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:48.130
this docudrama that was put
together after the fact.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.490
And I question then,
is this helping

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:56.290
because it is showing us
the flaws and the cracks

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.940
in the system?

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.150
Or knowing now,
seeing the fallout

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.940
from this, seeing the
feedback that's come back in,

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.340
questions about items that
were omitted from the series,

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.410
is it a net positive,
because it's

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.840
bringing these things to light?

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.000
Or is it doing more
harm than good,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.110
because now we're also
using another device that

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.330
is influencing the way
people are thinking,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.880
influencing the way
people are interacting

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:29.150
with this particular case but
other cases that are similar?

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:30.790
JERRY BUTING: That's
a good question.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.300
But I think on balance,
transparency is good.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.870
And I think that
"Making a Murderer"

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:42.140
has done something really that
nothing else has ever done.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.570
And it's really caused--

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.510
we have people here today
who are interested in justice

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.910
and what happens in
their courtrooms who

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.360
really didn't know anything
or care about it before.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.620
Half the states don't
even allow, approximately,

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.300
cameras in the courtrooms.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:02.284
And the federal courts don't
have cameras in the courtrooms.

00:26:02.284 --> 00:26:03.700
I've been a big
advocate for them,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.950
because it's transparency.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.940
People need to see what goes on.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.600
Those are
representatives of them.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.410
Whether it's judges, whether
they elect them or not,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:18.940
they're still
representing the people.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:28.220
And corruption sort of
seeps in in the shadows.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.290
If people are watching--

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.890
and that's one of the
reasons that we've

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:37.250
cherished a free press,
a free media for so long

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.710
is that they can expose
that kind of corruption.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.850
So a documentary that sheds
light on how the justice

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.840
system works and doesn't work
and the kinds of things that

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.250
go on, I think is always
going to be positive.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.320
There will be some naysayers.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.720
And there'll be some potential
fallout that could potentially,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.320
let's say, make people
lose faith in their system

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.460
altogether and cause
them to just despair.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:13.140
It could unravel
things even further.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.970
But I don't think anybody's can
say that this documentary was

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.700
done in an exploitative way.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.150
There weren't any
reenactments of a crime.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.605
And you can see the
difference between

00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:28.760
a exploitative documentary
and something that's

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:34.830
just showing what happens
in a particular case.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.420
And then thoughtful
people can take that

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.130
and discuss what
kinds of lessons

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:46.790
we can learn to apply in other
cases, in order to try and get

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:49.070
back to where justice should be.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:54.620
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: How do we
then address the omissions?

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.882
It is a finite amount of
time that you can actually

00:27:56.882 --> 00:27:58.340
have in this
documentary, and there

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.540
were over 200 hours of
activity in the courtroom.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.100
How do we address
then the things

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.610
that were not on there
that, whether intentional or

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.450
unintentional, still affect,
from certain perspectives,

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.780
a bias about what that
documentary is presenting?

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.390
JERRY BUTING:
Well, first of all,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.250
any documentary still
comes from a point of view.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.050
There's going to be
bias of some sort.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:24.110
We're human beings, and
they're human beings.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.000
I think they've been
unfairly portrayed

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.260
as being more biased than they
were by deliberately leaving

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:36.530
out very powerful pieces of
the prosecution's evidence.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.240
That's simply not the case.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.030
And the way I know that
is I had a front row seat.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.730
I saw what was at issue.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:49.010
Yeah, there's defense evidence
that wasn't in there, too.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:55.410
But if you're sitting on
that jury, for instance,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.920
the way you know what's really
important to the parties

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.860
is, how much time do they spend
in closing argument talking

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.240
about it?

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.260
And if you spend half a page--

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.720
which is all Ken Kratz
spent on his closing

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.690
argument on the sweaty
hood latch DNA thing--

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:18.350
then that tells you that really
wasn't that powerful piece

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:22.787
of evidence, or he would
have used it more and so

00:29:22.787 --> 00:29:24.620
the same thing with
some of the other things

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.380
that he's been critical
about being left out.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.810
I can tell you that the major
issues that the parties were

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:35.690
fighting about-- the bones, the
blood, the bullet, the key--

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.360
those are covered in the
documentary pretty well.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.920
In fact, when I saw them do
that in a total of about 3

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.040
and 1/2 hours, I was thinking,
why do we take six weeks?

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.250
I could have been
home a lot earlier.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.240
So they do try to
present the issues that

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.310
were most in dispute in as fair
and balanced way as possible.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.740
The one way that you do
get a little bit more

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.510
of a defense flavor to it
is because we cooperated.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:07.730
And they interviewed
us behind the scenes.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.100
And they interviewed the Averys.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.610
But the same opportunity
was given to the prosecutors

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.500
and to the police.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.367
The victim's family, I
certainly don't fault them

00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:19.950
for not wanting to
participate at all.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:23.300
But they haven't been
critical of it either.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.310
But for somebody who
had the opportunity

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:27.650
to participate and give
that other perspective,

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:30.990
we thought all along
that they were.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:35.030
To then say, this is biased, you
left all this stuff out-- well,

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:37.762
you had a chance to try
and participate and give

00:30:37.762 --> 00:30:38.720
some behind the scenes.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.130
I think it would have been
interesting to see what

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:43.160
it was like for prosecutors
brainstorming and working on,

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.070
how are we going to present
this issue and that issue?

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.152
They chose not to do that.

00:30:48.152 --> 00:30:49.580
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
Interesting stuff.

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.500
I want to go back
to the core of what

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.350
we've been talking about so
far and by way of the Brendan

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.170
Dassey case.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.670
And one of the things that you
had said in another interview

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.510
was that you were surprised to
the lengths which they would

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:05.030
go to get this conviction
out of this kid

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:08.330
and just bury him,
completely and totally.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.400
My question is not about
those links necessarily,

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.041
but at the root of it, why?

00:31:15.041 --> 00:31:19.520
Why are there prosecutors
and law enforcement officials

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.670
and people embedded in
the justice system that

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:27.110
are willing to go beyond
what even the law allows

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.250
to get that conviction?

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.340
Because that seems to be
a major source behind the

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.039
breaks that you talk
about in the book.

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:34.830
JERRY BUTING: Yeah.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:40.380
And again, every case
is a little different.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.940
But there is, I think, a little
bit more personal animus that

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.840
was motivating some of the
things that were done here.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:57.230
Steven Avery had the audacity to
sue Manitowoc County officials

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.670
who he believed wrongly
convicted him and made him sit,

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.060
stole 18 years of his
life and, while doing so,

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:10.550
allowed the real rapist to go
off and rape somebody else.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:15.230
And again, he's suing
them for $36 million.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.490
And that's a huge sum of money
for a county of that size.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.070
But it wasn't just the money
that was motivating this.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.930
Again, if you think
about the cop,

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:26.660
we've all probably had some
kind of encounter with a police

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.200
officer who's cops
an attitude with you.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:36.740
And if you mouth back to
them, you get their dander up.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.960
They get really pissed.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:44.165
And he was in the process of
doing much more than that.

00:32:44.165 --> 00:32:46.970
He was in the process of
embarrassing these people--

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:50.300
not just the money, but to
embarrass them and expose

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:56.690
what they had done to public
view in a small community.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:03.050
And they were going to do
anything that they could,

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.920
I think, to prevent that.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.310
And that's kind of
the motivating thing

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.100
that I think was going on
in this particular case.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.620
And in other cases,
it's less so.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.150
One of the things that
the Dean talks about--

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.040
you see police.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.900
There's a whole
spectrum of misconduct

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:29.960
from actually planting evidence
against somebody or planting

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.930
drugs on somebody
that you arrest.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.460
And by the way, we
know it happens,

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:36.024
because there are
documented cases

00:33:36.024 --> 00:33:37.940
all over the country,
all over the world where

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.190
police manufacture evidence.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.060
That's the far extreme end.

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:47.240
Another might be just where they
come into court and they fudge.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.165
Or they lie, and they say, Yeah,
I saw him throw those drugs--

00:33:52.165 --> 00:33:53.790
throw something from
his body, and then

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.300
we went over and picked it up--

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.080
what we used to
call dropsy cases.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.340
It's like, come on.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:02.311
And he looked you in the eye,
he sees you're in uniform,

00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:04.310
you're coming at him, and
right in front of you,

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:07.699
he takes drugs out and
drops them on the ground?

00:34:07.699 --> 00:34:09.199
And yet, this is
what officers would

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:12.710
testify about all the time.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.960
Now not all police
are like this.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.179
Most of them,
thankfully, are not.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.790
But in those kinds
of cases, they

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:24.860
think it's "the ends justify the
means" mentality that seeps in.

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.650
And they may think that the
person is a drug dealer.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.767
And therefore, they
are going to bust them.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:31.850
They don't think he's a
completely innocent person

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.370
that they're going after.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:39.920
And so probably the majority of
these police misconduct cases

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.860
are ones where they
become convinced

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.739
that they know whether the
person is guilty or not.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:51.610
And therefore, they're
going to help things along.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.340
And that's easier
for most people

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.610
to understand than
the ones where

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:59.730
they have such a personal animus
that they're actually going

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:02.370
after somebody to get him.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:06.020
And in this case, we wanted
them to call Brendan Dassey

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.040
as a witness at our trial.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.266
We were ready for
that, because we

00:35:10.266 --> 00:35:11.640
were convinced
that we could show

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.350
that jury that this
kid was subjected

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:23.040
to deliberate, coercive,
leading questions, feeding him

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.510
the facts, none of which fit.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:27.360
And you can see
why they don't fit,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.220
because he's trying
to guess at what

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.870
it is they want him to say.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:31.830
And he guesses wrong.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:32.870
But it's there.

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:36.690
That, by the way, is another
important transparency thing.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:40.500
Just six months before
this Dassey interrogation,

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.380
the law was changed in
Wisconsin to make it mandatory

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.670
that all custodial
interrogations be videotaped

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.040
from beginning to
end with no breaks.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.400
If there had not been
videotape of what happened,

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.530
those officers would
have come into court

00:35:55.530 --> 00:36:00.090
and testified, the same way
that Ken Kratz did at the press

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.710
conference, giving a narrative
as if this kid had just--

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:08.820
it all flowed out of him from
being unburdened by guilt,

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.314
when you could actually
look at the videotape.

00:36:11.314 --> 00:36:13.230
You could see that it
was nothing of the sort.

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.630
It's just these little
monosyllabic utterances.

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:20.610
And he's confused and
long, pregnant pauses.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:26.130
So we were convinced that
we could persuade the jury

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.980
that the confession was
false and that the techniques

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.920
that they used were
coercive and took advantage

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.820
of a young, inexperienced, quiet
kid who had mental limitations

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:43.330
and that if they were willing to
go that far to try and turn him

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.300
against Steven Avery,
then everything else

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.565
was fair game, too.

00:36:48.565 --> 00:36:50.940
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: We do want to
leave time for the audience

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.870
to ask questions.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.203
So if you guys can make your
way to the microphones now,

00:36:54.203 --> 00:36:56.770
that'd be great and
get those prepared.

00:36:56.770 --> 00:36:58.850
One of the best
parts about the book

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.930
is that it tells a grander
story outside of the story

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.420
that the Netflix
documentary tells.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:07.970
And a lot of that is your story.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:10.610
And you've prepared a piece
that you'd like to read for us.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:12.760
So I would welcome
you to do that now.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.960
JERRY BUTING: Yeah,
because I guess authors

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960
are supposed to do that.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.700
So I guess I have
to read something.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.670
But I'm going to pick something
that is very personal to me.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.760
It's not legal at all.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.030
But it's in the book
for a number of reasons.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:32.120
It's partly because I went
through this very serious

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:38.240
illness just a few years before
the Avery case came to me.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.910
And part of the decision
on whether I would even

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:46.310
take the case hinged
on, how clear was I

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:50.000
from this very serious cancer?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.400
And so I'm going to read
a little section about how

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.850
I discovered it and
learned about it,

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:59.560
and then I'll wrap up
quickly thereafter.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.660
So this is in the
summer of 2001.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.490
I noticed there was a lump
on my leg-- very small,

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.640
about the size of your knuckle--

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.720
painless, no reason to think
there was anything going on.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.220
And it turned out to be a
tumor the size of my hand--

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.790
literally the tip of an iceberg.

00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:22.710
And my wife persuaded me to
go to the doctor's office.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.940
And I ended up in this
specialist's office.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.974
We'd had the CT scan.

00:38:27.974 --> 00:38:29.640
And I knew there was
something in there,

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.900
but I was still
hoping it was benign.

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.310
And so this is what happened.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:36.720
"So I called the specialist
Dr. Hackbarth first thing

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.360
on Tuesday, but the next
available appointment

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.940
was on Tuesday of
the following week.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.670
At home, I pulled out the
films and tried to read them.

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:47.220
Cross sections of
tissue in each leg--

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.604
dozens of thumbnail images
impossible to make sense of.

00:38:50.604 --> 00:38:52.020
I was pretty sure
that I could see

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.650
some form in the right leg that
was not visible in the left.

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.230
Kathy and I scoured
websites for information."

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.840
Kathy's my wife.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.030
"Sometimes these
growths were benign,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:04.840
and surely, that would
be the case with me.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.204
I felt fine.

00:39:06.204 --> 00:39:07.620
As a matter of
fact, I was feeling

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.410
more fit and trim
after a beach vacation

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.630
than I'd had in a long time.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.310
We were in modestly
hopeful state

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.190
as the appointment with
Dr. Hackbarth approached.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.190
Even so, this time
Kathy was coming along.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:24.480
As I'd learned before working
alongside her in court,

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.180
having her there
would do me good.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.740
We arrived at the
orthopedic clinic

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.290
at Froedtert Hospital
in Milwaukee early.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:34.260
Dr. Hackbarth took a quick
look at the lump on my leg,

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.480
then stuck the images
into the light box,

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.150
scanning them for a moment.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.600
'We'll need to get a biopsy,
probably tomorrow,' he said.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.170
'I can tell you right now, this
is almost certainly malignant.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.240
It's a soft tissue sarcoma.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.490
I'm guessing it's
one of two types,

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.670
and they're both
quite rare and lethal.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.790
We used to just take people's
legs with amputation,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:58.140
but we've gotten better at this.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.960
We will try to save
your life and your leg,

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.690
but you will definitely have
a long year ahead of you with

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.330
various kinds of treatments.'

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.890
As I stood over his
shoulder, he went

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:11.250
through the individual images
that showed the abnormality.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.500
And he pulled up a full-length
picture of both legs

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.570
that I hadn't noticed before.

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:17.580
The difference was stark.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.710
I couldn't tell what was
me and what was tumor.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.660
The growth ran so high up
my leg that an amputation

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.620
might involve not just
the leg but my hip, too.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.300
In any event, Dr.
Hackbarth said he

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:33.960
was going to do everything
he could to avoid that.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.319
Just then, he got paged
and gently excused himself.

00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:40.110
'I'll let you guys talk
about it,' he said.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.900
'I'll come back
in a few minutes.'

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.020
A sinkhole had opened
beneath our lives.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:48.240
Our son Steven was nine.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.955
Grace, our daughter, was seven.

00:40:50.955 --> 00:40:54.090
'Don't panic,' I told Kathy.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.630
'It's not definite
until the biopsy.'

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.825
Clear-eyed Kathy would have none
of my whistling in the dark.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:03.150
'He knows already,' she said.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:06.680
'That's why he's telling
us the other stuff.'

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.350
Then Dr. Hackbarth opened
the door with an expression

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.530
on his face that hadn't been
there a few minutes earlier.

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:16.350
It was now about 10:30
AM Milwaukee time.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:19.720
'That page was from my
wife,' he said slowly.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.810
'A plane has hit the World Trade
Center, and it's collapsed.'

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.780
At first, Kathy and I gave
each other a look that said,

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.660
this guy's nuts,
let's get out of here.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:33.390
But as we talked
further, it became clear

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.910
that Dr. Hackbarth
was telling the truth.

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:39.170
In the car on the way
home, the radio broadcasts

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:41.540
were full of one alarming
piece of news after another.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.510
A second plane had hit
the other Twin Tower.

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.000
The Pentagon had also been hit.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.370
Nobody knew where the
president's plane was.

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:51.020
People were in bunkers.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.910
A plane had gone
down in Pennsylvania.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.770
The government had
ordered all airliners

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:58.970
to land and not to fly
again until further notice.

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.850
This was a horrible
national tragedy.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.490
I felt awful for everybody.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.950
Kathy and I had been in New
York less than a year earlier

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:09.747
for another NACDL conference.

00:42:09.747 --> 00:42:12.080
We went to the World Trade
Center and ate at the Windows

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.220
on the World.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:16.610
And yet, I couldn't
help but think

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.870
that I was going to be
dead in a few months.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.810
I was 45 years old, and
until now, I had not

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:26.690
given mortality much thought.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.440
I was absorbed by Kathy, by the
two little kids in our lives,

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:32.540
and by work.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.000
What had I done to leave
my mark on the world?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.670
My life had been a
meaningless blip."

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.570
So I often sometimes wonder--

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.380
I'm a person of faith.

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.390
I believe in God.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:53.140
I'm Catholic, born and raised.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:58.440
I sometimes wonder, why did
I make it through illness?

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:03.690
And maybe it was so that I
could do a case like this,

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.110
have all of these
things develop,

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.960
and become a
spokesperson for justice.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.800
And who knows?

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.380
And I had a long,
hard year and two

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.590
years of learning how to walk
again with physical therapy.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.360
And ultimately, I took the case.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.490
Kathy convinced me I was ready.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:23.550
Dean was confident
I could do it.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.792
And I never regretted that.

00:43:25.792 --> 00:43:27.480
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Fantastic.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480
JERRY BUTING: All right.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.620
So--

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:30.300
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I'd
like to open it up

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:31.591
to questions from the audience.

00:43:31.591 --> 00:43:33.330
Why don't we begin over?

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.530
AUDIENCE: Wow, heavy stuff.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.470
But let me try my
question out anyway.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.520
So in the case you
described with Steven Avery,

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.103
it does sound like
there was certainly

00:43:41.103 --> 00:43:44.720
a degree of actual
malicious prosecution.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.730
But the other half of the broken
justice system you described

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:53.350
seems to be more broad
strokes, like the overworking,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.870
overburdening of the court
system, disenfranchisement

00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:59.670
of minorities, over
populated prisons--

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.880
stuff like that.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.400
And I'm certainly sympathetic
to that point of view.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.500
I feel it's broken as well.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.210
But I was wondering
if you could perhaps

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.990
take your lawyerly skills
to advocate for what

00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:14.420
seems to be
indefensible, and maybe

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.170
describe some of the
good intentions that

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:22.172
brought our justice
system to this place.

00:44:22.172 --> 00:44:23.630
What are the
motivations that might

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:27.710
have created these super
long sentences or the changes

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:33.450
in how prosecutors treat the
courtroom and stuff like that?

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.180
JERRY BUTING: Well, OK.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:39.950
It's certainly
understandable why

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:44.400
people feel like we need to
have these real long sentences.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.970
Let's take that one
first for a second here.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:56.900
What happens is
there is something

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.510
that's been documented in the
literature-- something called

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:01.520
a moral panic.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:06.500
And in this context, you see
it when there's a particularly

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.680
heinous crime that happens--

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.315
some young girl is
murdered brutally

00:45:12.315 --> 00:45:16.640
and killed by somebody, and
maybe he's been in prison

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.610
and gotten out.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:22.880
And he's like a serial killer
or a serial rapist or something.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.900
And we then react
with moral outrage

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:32.767
and want to increase
penalties and make--

00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:34.850
well, how did this guy get
out in the first place?

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:36.407
And if he would
have been locked up,

00:45:36.407 --> 00:45:38.490
this never would have
happened, and we should just

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.020
have longer sentences,
and we should

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.980
make it mandatory so judges
don't have any discretion.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.130
And the problem is, it's
a one-size-fits-all type

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:51.270
of remedy that's based on cases
that are really pretty rare.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:56.450
There were something like
20 million new charges

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:58.652
filed last year alone.

00:45:58.652 --> 00:46:00.110
And the percentage
of them that are

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:06.380
those types of cases that really
cause and deserve moral outrage

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:08.300
are very, very small.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.480
So to try and apply what
you need in those few cases

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:16.820
to everything, it may
start off well-intentioned,

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.340
but then it ends up screwing
up the whole system when

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.780
you do that.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:26.960
Another example is sex
offender registration.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.440
The idea of registering
people as sex offenders, which

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.230
is like the Scarlet
Letter of 21st century--

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:38.270
the idea was that,
well, if there's

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:42.870
a person that's living down
the block from my children who

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.840
is a sex offender,
I should know that.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:50.900
And in theory, that's
fine, except for it ignores

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:57.920
the reality, which is that
95% of child sex offenses

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.220
occur from not a
stranger down the block

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.860
that you don't know
about but from somebody

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.750
that you know very well--

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.300
the uncle or the neighbor--
the next door neighbor

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:11.840
who's close to the
family, not a stranger,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.886
or the stepdad or whatever.

00:47:13.886 --> 00:47:15.260
And so having
somebody registered

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.840
as a sex offender does
nothing to protect you

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.830
in those situations.

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:25.550
So they started off
with a good idea

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.190
that, yeah, for the most
serious kinds of sex offenders,

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.820
we're going to
have them register.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.650
And then you can know
if somebody really

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:38.729
is a potential-- one of
the stranger abduction-type

00:47:38.729 --> 00:47:40.020
offenders in your neighborhood.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.420
You should know that, right?

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:46.100
But then politicians, in
order to try and act tougher

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.830
and tougher and get
elected and re-elected,

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:51.560
they started expanding the
kinds of crimes that fit

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.340
the definition of a sex offender
for registration purposes,

00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:59.210
to the point where even two
teenagers who are having

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:04.040
consensual sex but under
age, therefore illegal--

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.432
and usually, it's the guy
who gets convicted-- now

00:48:06.432 --> 00:48:07.640
is a registered sex offender.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.990
The people that you should
really care about and be

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.210
afraid of are just a handful.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:21.470
But when you go on the website,
there's something like--

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:27.830
it's between 25,000 and 50,000
people on that registry now,

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.860
the vast, vast majority
of whom are not a risk

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.840
to the public as a whole.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.660
So what happens to them?

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.510
Now the hysteria has
gotten even worse.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:41.750
And now we don't even want
them living in neighborhoods

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:43.310
or in communities.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:47.060
So towns are passing ordinances
saying, you can't live,

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:50.270
if you are on that
list, within 2,000

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:53.240
feet of a school or a
park or a shopping center

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.940
or any place where
kids can congregate.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:59.240
And as you started drawing
the radiuses around that,

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.040
the city of Milwaukee--

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:06.170
almost the entire city limits
are off-limits for anybody who

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:12.740
is on that list, to the point
where there are now over 300

00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:17.169
homeless people who are on that
list who cannot live any place

00:49:17.169 --> 00:49:18.210
in the city of Milwaukee.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.810
You're not allowed to
move anywhere else either.

00:49:20.810 --> 00:49:23.310
Other counties say, oh, if you
were convicted in Milwaukee,

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:25.450
you got to come
back to Milwaukee.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:28.970
And it's so insane that--

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.470
this is a story.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:33.050
It was in the newspaper
just a couple of months ago.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:38.750
Parole agents are
saying that you're not

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.970
allowed to reside
in the city, so

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.600
go stay with your
mother for a few days.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.320
Don't live there.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.790
Don't put your clothes there.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:51.800
And then go park your car
in the park-and-ride lot

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:54.470
and live out of your
car for a few days.

00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:58.370
And then drive, and go stay at
your sister's for a few days.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:02.900
It's just this shell game
that, again, started off

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.730
with an idea that
maybe was valid

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:10.000
but then got exploded out
of all sense of reason

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.710
by politicians,
really, who were just

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:15.090
trying to act tough on crime.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.090
I don't know if that
answered all your question,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.299
but it gives you a few ideas.

00:50:18.299 --> 00:50:20.673
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: And I think
we have time for another one.

00:50:20.673 --> 00:50:21.440
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:25.400
As a defense attorney,
how far do you

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.990
go to try to understand if your
client is guilty or innocent?

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:34.970
And how does your belief
in their guilt or innocence

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:37.870
change your defense strategy?

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.880
JERRY BUTING: Good
questions, both.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.710
It shouldn't change your
defense strategy, because most

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:47.540
of the time, you don't know.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:50.900
Well, first of all, the
vast majority of people,

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.180
if they're guilty, they
tell you they're guilty.

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:56.900
And they want you to help them.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.300
They admit they screwed up.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.196
Whatever their
wrongdoing was, but can--

00:51:03.196 --> 00:51:04.820
so it's the job of
the defense attorney

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:07.430
to humanize that person
and let the judge know

00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.620
that whatever they did,
it's a snapshot of them.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.259
It's not the whole person.

00:51:12.259 --> 00:51:13.550
You've got to look beyond that.

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:16.010
Look at all the other things
they've done in their lives.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:19.990
They've been a good father,
or they pay child support--

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:23.180
whatever it might be.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:27.200
But the role of a
defense attorney

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.220
is not really to make the
judgment about whether or not

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:32.840
somebody is guilty.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.862
And I'm just going
to tell the story.

00:51:34.862 --> 00:51:35.570
It's in the book.

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:38.040
But I alluded to earlier.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.020
And since you brought it up,
here's the perfect example.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.870
When I was a public defender, I
had been there for about eight,

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.660
almost nine years.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.120
We were under so
much pressure, we

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.000
had to open 15 new
felony cases a month.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.137
And there was no case
waiting at that time.

00:51:55.137 --> 00:51:56.720
We had to open those
cases, whether we

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.790
had closed a single one or not.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.040
And my caseload was enormous.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:06.110
And a first degree
homicide that was

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.030
going to take a month
to try or longer,

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.910
like the Avery case,
counted as one felony,

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:15.740
just the same as a garage
burglary where a bike is stolen

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.840
and the kid's going
to get probation.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:21.670
And he's what we would
call an easy case.

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:26.060
And so I started
triaging these cases

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.970
when we would get them by
going through intake court

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.076
and meeting them
for the first time.

00:52:31.076 --> 00:52:32.450
Really, all you're
supposed to do

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:39.950
is figure out what the
bail is and give the judge

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:42.530
some information
for setting up bail.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:43.864
But I would read the complaints.

00:52:43.864 --> 00:52:46.280
And I would try and see, OK,
this one is going to be easy.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.579
This one is going to be hard.

00:52:47.579 --> 00:52:49.370
I can only take a few
hard ones this month,

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.740
because I've got these other
big cases set for trial.

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:55.400
And I needed to fill my
quota of some easy ones.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.780
So I'm reading
this one, and this

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:58.370
looks like a piece of cake.

00:52:58.370 --> 00:52:59.720
It's a burglary.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.920
He's caught red-handed.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.030
He's inside this
apartment building.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.800
And so I read it over
real quick to him.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.750
And is this true?

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.430
He's like, no, man, it's not
true, I'm completely innocent.

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:14.780
And he tells me this story
that's a ridiculous story.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:16.400
It's a complete cock and ball.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.220
There's no way.

00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:22.232
And I'm thinking, OK, so this is
going to be a pain in the ass.

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.690
I'm going to have
to try this case.

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.540
It's going to take
me several days.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.160
So I come back to the office.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.170
And I was real tired.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:33.450
I'd had like 25
or 30 cases I ran.

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.840
So some of them weren't
going to have to keep.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.500
And my friend at that
time-- later, wife--

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.740
Kathy said, how was your day?

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.490
And I said, well, it sucked.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:46.317
And there's this
guy, for instance.

00:53:46.317 --> 00:53:47.900
And he tells me this
ridiculous story.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:49.550
And I told it to her.

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:53.260
And she said, well,
I'll take that case.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.730
I said, well, go ahead,
knock yourself out.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:56.630
So she did.

00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.980
She got an investigator.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:00.680
She determined he was
telling the absolute truth.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:02.840
His cock and bull
story was true.

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.640
He was innocent, 100%.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.100
Case was dismissed.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:08.870
And that taught me a lesson.

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:12.680
That kind of thing happens
thousands of times a day

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:16.760
all over the country with
overworked defense attorneys.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.440
And I started
thinking, if that's

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.169
the way I feel about
a client-- if I'm

00:54:20.169 --> 00:54:22.460
making those kinds of snap
judgments in the first three

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.254
minutes, is that going to
affect the way I can really--

00:54:25.254 --> 00:54:27.170
the effort I'm going to
put in and the way I'm

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:30.140
going to defend him or her?

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:31.700
And so that
ultimately taught me I

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.658
had to get out of the
public defender's office.

00:54:33.658 --> 00:54:37.460
But it was also a lesson
in why you can't--

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.200
as a defense attorney,
it's not your role

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:42.530
to make those judgments,
particularly early on,

00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:45.650
because it could shade the
way you investigate or not.

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.050
Maybe I wouldn't even have
gotten an investigator,

00:54:48.050 --> 00:54:50.873
because the story was so absurd.

00:54:50.873 --> 00:54:52.491
Anybody else?

00:54:52.491 --> 00:54:54.740
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: We are running
a little short on time,

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:56.070
so we do need to wrap up.

00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.590
But before, I just
have one last question.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.490
We've touched a lot on all
the breaks in the system.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.031
And unfortunately, this is going
to be one of those questions

00:55:04.031 --> 00:55:05.840
that we could talk for
another hour about.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.910
But I want to ask, what
are some of the fixes

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:13.990
that we should be looking
for or that are in process--

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:15.857
things like the
Innocence Project, things

00:55:15.857 --> 00:55:17.940
that are looking into these
breaks in the system--

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.610
what are some of the things
that we need to be aware of,

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.032
of how we can fix
what's going on?

00:55:21.032 --> 00:55:21.740
JERRY BUTING: OK.

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.535
And I do spend some time
in the book towards the end

00:55:24.535 --> 00:55:27.420
and talking about some
solutions and things we can do.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:30.530
One of the things we can do that
everybody can do individually

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.560
is really start to take
ownership of your own court

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.370
system.

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:39.400
Don't just be worried about
what happened in a distant state

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.300
10 years ago or the Avery case.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.590
But care about what goes on
in your own court system.

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.464
Now that's not easy,
because everybody works.

00:55:45.464 --> 00:55:48.650
And you can't go sit
down in a court house

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:52.590
and look at who's doing
a fair job and who's not.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:55.640
But if you have a chance
to vote for a judge

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.360
or a sheriff or a
prosecutor, often those

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.250
are in off elections.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:03.170
So many people don't vote.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:06.230
Maybe 10% or 20%,
at most, end up

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:08.180
voting for judges
and prosecutors

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:11.210
and sheriffs who have an
enormous amount of power

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.210
in the system.

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:15.710
And you can make a difference.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:19.010
Just in the last
year, voters threw out

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:23.150
prosecutors in Cleveland,
Chicago, Jacksonville who

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.427
had run traditionally
on, I'm just

00:56:26.427 --> 00:56:28.010
going to get tough
on crime, I'm going

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:31.300
to lock people up and
throw away the keys--

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:35.210
the clanging cell
door kind of TV ads.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:40.100
When you see those kinds of
appeals, don't fall for it.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.190
If anything, maybe vote for
somebody who's not doing that.

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:46.410
That's enough alone if you
don't even know the two people.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:48.410
But if you can educate
yourself by talking

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:53.060
to people who are lawyers
and then exercise your right

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.970
to vote, you should, because
that's your way to, other

00:56:55.970 --> 00:56:57.140
than a jury--

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.520
well, here's one other thing.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.270
If you get a jury
summons, don't just think

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:05.630
it's like a root canal
that you have to do.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.580
It's the one chance
you have a way

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:12.600
to actually participate directly
in your judicial system.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.060
But be honest when you're
going through jury selection.

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.100
If it's a case that's
troubling you--

00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:21.320
your best friend was
sexually assaulted

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.680
and you just can't put that
aside if it's a sexual assault

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:28.370
case, then be honest
about it and just say,

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:32.750
I'd like to be fair,
but I don't think I can.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:35.540
And you'll see other things.

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.990
If there are legislators
who are championing things

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:44.060
like mandatory videotape
recordings of interrogations,

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:45.650
you need to get behind that.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:47.870
There are organizations,
by the way,

00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:51.360
that work on all different
little issues that

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.660
are a problem in the
criminal justice system.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.090
And those are just
a few of them.

00:57:56.090 --> 00:58:00.950
Crime labs, lack of independence
is another serious one.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:03.830
The city of Austin,
Texas just discovered

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.540
that their crime
lab, for years, had

00:58:05.540 --> 00:58:09.380
been using wrong data and
unscientific procedures.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.420
They shut down the whole thing.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.690
The police wanted to reopen it.

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:17.720
And they had to send
their four DNA--

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:23.150
or I'm sorry-- six DNA analysts
to this state-run re-training

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.690
program.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.330
And four of them were
kicked out they were so bad.

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:27.830
They failed.

00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:31.070
So ultimately,
now there's a move

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:33.600
to make the crime
labs more independent

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.890
so that they can do real science
and not just get the results

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:38.592
that the police want.

00:58:38.592 --> 00:58:40.800
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Well, there's
a lot more in the book.

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.810
Unfortunately, we
are out of time.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:43.518
The book is called
"Illusion of Justice."

00:58:43.518 --> 00:58:47.450
It's a great expansion on to the
story of "Making a Murderer."

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.580
Thank you so much for
being with us here today.

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:50.210
JERRY BUTING:
You're very welcome.

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:51.110
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I really
appreciate it, Jerry.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:51.710
JERRY BUTING: Thank you.

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:52.460
Thanks for coming.
