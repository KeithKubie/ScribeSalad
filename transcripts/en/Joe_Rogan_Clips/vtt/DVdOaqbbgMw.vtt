1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.300
Right.
Do I want to know?
I want to know the whole thing.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.330
I want to know as far into this as you can tell me why you think this,

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.830
right.
Like instead of me just saying no,
you're wrong.

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:12.720
I wanna I want you to explain it to me.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.120
I want to know whether or not I trust your process.

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.410
Do you bring that skill home with you?
I mean,
you're surrounded by women.

7
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:22.500
It's tough.
It's tough,
bro.
I,
I,
I'm serious,

8
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.240
like said times cause I even see it with my own husband.
We have three daughters.

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.690
But I mean,
especially,
you know,

10
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:32.850
when you have a pretty masculine male,

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.500
I'm always fascinated to watch them navigate their home when they're surrounded

12
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:42.330
by women.
I just give up.
Most of the time I lose every argument.

13
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
Um,
I think,
um,
you know,
I tried to,
we communicate a lot,

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.670
loved talking,

15
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.020
a lot of failing with girls.

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.070
It's always those things they're crying about and like,
okay,
okay,
okay,

17
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.970
we're going to be fine.
And you know,
I don't want them to be like me.

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.310
I want them to be themselves and I want him to be girls.

19
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.660
I want it to be able to be themselves.
I don't want them to mirror my resilience,

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.100
you know,
I want them to be vulnerable if they want to be vulnerable.
But it's a,

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.180
in terms of like how I decorate the house or,
oh,
I have no say,
oh no.
Nothing.

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.590
You know,
that's why you have,
you know,
I have this place I was going to say,

23
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:23.710
you have your,
your cave here at Laird has a barn.
Perfect.
And He,
you know,

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.400
when he meets young guys getting married,
he goes,
here,
I'm going to teach you.

25
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.030
Okay,
you're right honey.
I'm sorry.
And Oh yes.

26
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.080
Whatever color you choose,
you know,
always work.
Some people it's never enough,

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.320
but if you have the right relationships,
sometimes it'll work that way.

28
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.260
Cause I don't give a fuck what my house looks like.
I really don't know.

29
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:45.210
I have a good view.
Where's the coffee?
Yeah.
Okay.
It's like real work.
Yeah.
Okay.

30
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.020
How's the bed?
That's a good bed.
Do we have a TV?
Where's the TV?
Is it a good one?

31
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.170
That's a good TV.
All right.
We're good.
We're good.
I have a laptop.
Okay.

32
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:55.380
We're good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't need that much.
You know,

33
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.600
so like when my wife was like,
I'm going to put this here,
I'm like,
okay,

34
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.750
put it there.
Fantastic.
I want to get that painting.
Okay.
Get the painting.

35
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:02.880
I don't know.
I don't know where you want to put it.
Yeah,

36
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.290
put it where it feels right.
I don't give a fuck.
I think it's smart.
I mean,

37
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.620
you know,
like sometimes if I am fringe on,
if it's functional,

38
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:13.680
then layered steps in like w you know,
that's not really functional.

39
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.900
But otherwise he's like,

40
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.840
I'm tearing some stuff out of my house right now and he just gives me a look and

41
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:23.100
I'm like,
I'm this age if I want to do this,

42
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.360
support me.
And he just laughs and walks out.
Like he just probably doesn't care.

43
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.350
Go ahead.
Just,
just,
it's in the way,
whatever it is,
whatever.
Have Fun with it.

44
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.490
Yeah.
What Time's dinner?
You know,
love to decorate things.

45
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.400
I get nervous if a guy's really into it.
Well,
yeah,

46
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:43.401
it's a nesting trek guys are like really into like the design in,

47
00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:46.590
in their own house.
Like really,
really into it.

48
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.590
Like constantly obsessing about where things are and where they're supposed to

49
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:54.000
be policed.
Homosexuals.
Yeah.
I can't play out there.
What do you mean?

50
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.530
Is that a stereotypical thing that is outrageous?
That might be,

51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.880
he might've showed your whites or privacy.
I'm not exactly sure.
Yeah.

52
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.290
It's a funny thing.
Right.
But,
uh,
if I didn't have this place though,

53
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.370
I don't know if I,
like traditionally men had pool halls they can hang out at,

54
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:16.030
or gyms that they would hang out in and they would get their dose of toxic

55
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:18.580
masculinity.
Yeah.
Her basement or a basement.
Yeah.

56
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.630
You can create a place where nobody's touching your stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,

57
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.230
if you live in a house,
like I do with all girls too.
It's,

58
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.020
it's just everything's girly.
I just,
whatever.
I'm fine.
Laird said he,

59
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.400
he's like,
I need it to be more specific.

60
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.280
I said I wanted to be surrounded by women.
I was like,

61
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.010
I didn't mean to be related to all of them.

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.560
That's hilarious.
You know,
it's,

63
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.130
I think it's a nature or God's way of balancing off.

64
00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:50.600
They say if guys have elevated body temperature,
so athletes,

65
00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:51.590
people who train a lot,

66
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.600
that they're statistically have a greater chance of having daughters because I

67
00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:59.940
think they hot,
we call it hot balls basically,

68
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:03.860
if he kills off the male sperm.
That's hilarious.
And if you look around,

69
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.760
I think so they did a thing on a,
a bunch of guys,
either in the NFL or whatever,

70
00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:09.820
and statistically they just have a lot more daughters.

71
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.040
And I think it's like nature's way of going,
oh,

72
00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:17.150
you're going to be all like moving and active and raw and all this stuff.

73
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.463
Guess what?

74
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.700
We're just gonna put a bunch of girls around you and for you,

75
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.260
because my daughter say things to my husband,
I could never say as a wife,

76
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.190
you know,
it's like I see it and I just go,
oh yeah,

77
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.540
well they know that for sure.
He loves them so they can get away with it.

78
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.810
They're in.
Yeah.
They can't get fired.
No,
I always say that to them.

79
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.810
Like my youngest daughter when she was really little,
like five or six,
she'd say,

80
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.710
okay,
so I'm not really clear with this.
Um,

81
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.540
when I have alone time I'm by myself.
And when you and dad need alone time,

82
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:54.210
like you're together.
And I try to like,
well you know,

83
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.700
it's important for moms and dads cause you know,
we have to work at it.
I go,

84
00:04:56.701 --> 00:05:00.090
you know,
you're,
you're always going to be dad's daughter.
I,
you know,
I'm,

85
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.790
we're working at being a husband and wife and then she'd keep going with it.

86
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.570
And I finally would just say like,
Hey,

87
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.880
do you want to have Christmas in separate houses?

88
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.790
And I'd see her think for a second like,
well maybe,
you know,
and I'm like,

89
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.550
we need a long time.
I took it to present.

90
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.360
That's what I told that she's processing that.
She's like,
well I'd miss you,

91
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:24.310
but I don't know.
You know,
so it's all that dance,
you know,

92
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.691
cause daughters,
man,

93
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.080
they don't miss a trick and they're on you and they're on their dad like

94
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.710
nobody's business.
While my friends would have sons,
the way they say it is,

95
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.510
it's like you can take one of two things.

96
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:38.200
Either you have this wild animal that's tearing things apart or you have someone

97
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.770
who's screaming and crying about something you don't understand.
Yeah.

98
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.000
Take your pick.
You went to judo?
Yeah,
a mental destroyer or a physical destroyer.

99
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.100
Yeah.
Walls with holes and broken.
Broken bones
and girls.

100
00:05:50.101 --> 00:05:54.180
It's like I have learned so much being a mother,
two daughters,

101
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.500
and I've been around women my whole life.

102
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:58.070
You figure playing volleyball and being tons of women.

103
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.070
It's very different as a parent.
I mean I've learned the most,

104
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.330
especially teenagers.
Watching them grow so strange.

105
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.130
It's such a strange experience watching a person figure out the world from,

106
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.820
from jump,
you know,
like out the womb,
figure out the world.

107
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.990
It's so educational.
I feel.

108
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.820
I don't think everyone should have children.

109
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.560
I'm not one of those zealots that tells everybody,
Hey,

110
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.150
you're not alive until you have a kid.
No,

111
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:25.700
I think it's unfair to say that to people.
That is unfair.
I think it's,

112
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.091
first of all,

113
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:30.470
a lot of people can't write and maybe they have a just a different path.

114
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.700
Like I always tell my girlfriends too,

115
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:36.701
like it's unfair also to romanticize like to your friends who either opted not

116
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:39.020
to have children or whatever,

117
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:44.021
met a partner too late or didn't or whatever because I think it is a really

118
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.660
rich,
I mean there's nothing like it.
I mean I love my children,

119
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:51.140
but if I had one friend,
she was like got married later and she was like,

120
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:54.050
you know,
we're going to adopt.
And um,

121
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.860
she was also doing a new business and I was like,
listen,
I need to come.

122
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.760
I want to talk to you.
And she also like to consider taking naps occasionally.

123
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.580
I was like,
if you think you're going to adopt and like,

124
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:06.320
you're going to have a 12 year old that's like a,
hey,

125
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:10.610
I really appreciate you guys.
Thank you so much.
I go,
that's not what you know.

126
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:13.640
Like if you think you're going to have a kid and it's gonna make you happier,

127
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.060
that's not what having a kid is.
I think it makes you,

128
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.820
it makes you know yourself better in a different way and you can adapt and do

129
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.080
something different.
But I,
I think when people sort of sell that bill of goods,

130
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:30.170
like,
Oh,
you've got to have kids.
It's like,
well,
do you want to have kids?

131
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.720
You know,
I think it's like you said,
not for everyone.

132
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.390
You definitely shouldn't adopt.
You think it's going to be easy.

133
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.320
That's what I mean.
It's like she had this romantic idea of like,
and I go,

134
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.030
you know,
you don't,
first of all,
you don't know what the,

135
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.500
what's where the kid is coming from.
And then also you have a romance.

136
00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.340
I think every parent going into it has a romantic idea.
I did.

137
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.590
And I'm a pretty realistic person of like,

138
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.340
I'm going to do all these things right and we're gonna be,
you know,

139
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:59.150
running in sunflower fields together and my kids are never going to think my

140
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:03.560
music sucks,
or I can drive.
And then you realize,
I had a friend tell me,

141
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.830
everyone gets their turn in the barrel.
No matter what you do.
Uh,

142
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.220
you got,
you have to navigate stuff,

143
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.610
you're going to have to deal with stuff for sure.
And on the other hand,

144
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.410
it's awesome when someone does adopt people,
if they're really into it,

145
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:19.190
if they know what they're getting into and those martyrs out there and those

146
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:23.960
people that are just super kind and generous and love to adopt children of God

147
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.660
bless them.
Yeah.
So glad they're there.
Yeah.
It's just,

148
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.920
I agree with you that there are some people that have a romanticized idea of

149
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:33.830
what it's like to raise a child and it's unfair to,
to sell it.

150
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.570
Like I love the moms.
What?

151
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.050
So when are you going to have number two or whatever to somebody it's like,
oh,

152
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:41.960
you know that they're behind closed doors doing,
you know,

153
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.140
like they just want everyone to be in the psychotic ness with them.

154
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.780
I have three kids.
You should have three kids.
You know,

155
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:50.410
there are people like that,
right?
Yeah.

156
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.960
There's people that have a kid then immediately take this moral high ground,

157
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:57.050
looks like they're doing something during an adult and you're,

158
00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.390
you're just a fool.
Yeah.
You're like,
I wonder who is the fool?

159
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.780
It's like I ask myself that sometimes.
Well,

160
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.930
don't you think you're a better person for raising kids?
Do,

161
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.080
does it make you feel like you're more in tune and nicer and just more aware of

162
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:18.050
what it is,
what it means to be a human?
Yeah.
I,
I not only that I,

163
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.230
I feel like,
I feel like it's,

164
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.430
it's a forced expiration if you're trying to participate.

165
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.930
Like if you just lay down the law and go,
hey,
in this house,
this is how we do it,

166
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.470
then you're not doing anything.
But I think if you,

167
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.670
you learn to adapt and also go,
wow,

168
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:42.600
I was doing that wrong for like 10 years.
Amazing.
You know?
Like I've,

169
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:47.601
one of my daughters at a 12 or 13 sort of revealed some stuff about what she was

170
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.120
unhappy about,
about my parenting and I was like,
God,

171
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:55.350
I've been doing that for a long time.
Uh,

172
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.000
so I think it's,
it's cool that she had the confidence to do that though.
Yeah.

173
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:02.490
It's so cool.
I wanted to hear that.

174
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:07.140
Like when she was 30 at the Thanksgiving table when she moved out,
I was like,

175
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:11.070
what?
You're supposed to reveal all that?
Like after you move out.
And then I go,

176
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:15.720
oh,
what did I do that,
sorry.
Turned out great.
It's amazing.

177
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.620
What time's your flight?
Uh,
no,
no.
Listen,
it's a,

178
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.740
it's a surrender.
I think for me it's,
it's been a real surrender because I,

179
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.330
I just think I,
you think you're in control of stuff and you think,
oh,

180
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.950
I've got some discipline and work ethic.

181
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:35.490
I can just work my way through it or power my way through it.

182
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:39.530
And then you realize like,
no,
you have to surrender.
And,

183
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.770
and also it's not just about solving it quickly and,
um,

184
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:47.940
yeah,
it is.
I'm,
I know myself certainly better,

185
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:52.260
but also it forces you if you're willing to,
to really expand.
Yeah.
