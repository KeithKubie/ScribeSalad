00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.480
up-to-date with what was going on back
here and in those meetings I wanted to

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:27.490
here and in those meetings I wanted to
 

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.390
here and in those meetings I wanted to
share with him what we were about and we

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400
share with him what we were about and we
 

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.280

had some interesting talks and

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:32.290
had some interesting talks and
 

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.860
had some interesting talks and
particularly the time when he said he

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:34.870
particularly the time when he said he
 

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.130
particularly the time when he said he
didn't didn't believe it endowment we

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:38.140
didn't didn't believe it endowment we
 

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.900
didn't didn't believe it endowment we
were trying to raise a lot of money for

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:39.910
were trying to raise a lot of money for
 

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:42.090
were trying to raise a lot of money for
endowment well it turns out that was

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.100
endowment well it turns out that was
 

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.390
endowment well it turns out that was
based on his thought that the endowment

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400
based on his thought that the endowment
 

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.780
based on his thought that the endowment
was idle capital and it took me about

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:48.790
was idle capital and it took me about
 

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.840
was idle capital and it took me about
two three weeks to figure out idle

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:51.850
two three weeks to figure out idle
 

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:53.610
two three weeks to figure out idle
capital will the opposite of idle

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:53.620
capital will the opposite of idle
 

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.710
capital will the opposite of idle
capital is working Cavanaugh that is a

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720
capital is working Cavanaugh that is a
 

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.720
capital is working Cavanaugh that is a
term that they use in business is

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:57.730
term that they use in business is
 

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.900
term that they use in business is
working capital so we we simply

00:19:59.900 --> 00:19:59.910
working capital so we we simply
 

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.250
working capital so we we simply
transliterated endowment into working

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:02.260
transliterated endowment into working
 

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.140
transliterated endowment into working
capital and he bought it something that

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.150
capital and he bought it something that
 

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.920
capital and he bought it something that
was fine but once he signed on that

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:07.930
was fine but once he signed on that
 

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.630
was fine but once he signed on that
wasn't a question of what he was doing

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640
wasn't a question of what he was doing
 

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.600
wasn't a question of what he was doing
but he had to begin to get a sense of

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:12.610
but he had to begin to get a sense of
 

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.210
but he had to begin to get a sense of
the enthusiasm and himself participate

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:15.220
the enthusiasm and himself participate
 

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.400
the enthusiasm and himself participate

in this in the positive spirit they won
 

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.490
in this in the positive spirit they won
and so that that was a took a while of

and so that that was a took a while of
 

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.260
and so that that was a took a while of

and I remember one

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059
and I remember one
 

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:40.789
and I remember one
the things that Jimmy Sibley and I

00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799
the things that Jimmy Sibley and I
 

00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:43.399

worth over 100 million Oh that'd be
 

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.619
worth over 100 million Oh that'd be
equivalent of 20 million-dollar the

income from 20 million dollars but in
 

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:08.149
income from 20 million dollars but in
the process the thought of that and

00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159
the process the thought of that and

between receiving a portion of the
income and getting the whole corpus is

00:21:26.989 --> 00:21:26.999
income and getting the whole corpus is
 

00:21:26.999 --> 00:21:28.999
income and getting the whole corpus is
enormous because of course the growth of

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:29.009
enormous because of course the growth of
 

00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:36.619
enormous because of course the growth of
the corpus over the next 15 years was

00:21:36.619 --> 00:21:36.629
the corpus over the next 15 years was
 

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:38.119
the corpus over the next 15 years was
just unbelievable

for the University and that was a
 

00:22:46.409 --> 00:22:51.080
for the University and that was a
godsend because then without you know we

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:14.210
 
the other thing that happened about that

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220
the other thing that happened about that
 

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.260
the other thing that happened about that
time was the the growing conviction that

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:18.270
time was the the growing conviction that
 

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:21.470
time was the the growing conviction that
we ought to try to sequester the

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480
we ought to try to sequester the
 

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.620

Woodruff fund from the general endowment
the idea of sequestering the thing was

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380
the idea of sequestering the thing was
 

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.130
the idea of sequestering the thing was
that we wanted to see if we couldn't

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:31.140
that we wanted to see if we couldn't
 

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.670
that we wanted to see if we couldn't

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.830
continue the the power of initiative
within the university and once it gets
