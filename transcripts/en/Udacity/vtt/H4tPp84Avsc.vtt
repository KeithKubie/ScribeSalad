00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.340
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.380
What are the deep similarities here?

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt; So, I picked that three of
these are deep similarities.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.410
In both there's something
revolving around something else.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.740
The planet revolving around the sun and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.950
the electron revolving
around the nucleus.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.110
In both,
there's a force between two objects.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.820
A force between the sun and
the planet, and

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.510
a force between a nucleus and
an electron.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.670
And in both,
two objects attract each other.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.150
All three of these
are based on relationships.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.210
The revolution,
the force between two objects and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.520
the attraction between two objects.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.190
I didn't pick the other three
because while these two are true,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.420
they don't represent deep relationships.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.729
And while this is actually true,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.250
it's not actually captured
in our representation.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.280
So this isn't part of our knowledge
base for the purpose of this problem.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.970
Now we can see why the textbooks
write about this solar system and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.410
the atomic structure in such a way that
these relationships become salient.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.530
They help us make sense of the atomic
structure, but pointing to the deep

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.630
similarities between the relationship
that are occurring with the atomic

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.320
structure and the relationship that
are occurring in the solar system
