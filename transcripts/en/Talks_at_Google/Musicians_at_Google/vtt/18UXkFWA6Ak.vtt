DARA WILSON: How you
guys doing today?

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.550
[CHEERS]

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.050
DARA WILSON: There you go.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.980
That's the enthusiastic
Google I know.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.740
BRANDY: Yes.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.080
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.600
My name is Dara Wilson.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.490
I'm a merchandising manager for
devices on Google Play.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.650
I am also a happy member of the
Black Googlers Network.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.340
And on behalf of them and
"Musicians at Google," I want

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.530
to welcome you all here.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.510
Thank you all for
coming so much.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.632
We are here to have the
wonderful Brandy with us--

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:31.000
[CHEERS]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.830
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.420
DARA WILSON: --here at the
Google campus in Mountain

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.000
View, California.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.720
So as if we all don't already
know, Brady has been a force

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.924
in the entertainment industry
for the past nearly 20 years.

00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:47.330
BRANDY: That's telling my
age-- telling my age.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.180
That's telling my age.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.850
DARA WILSON: She has sold more
than 40 million records

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.370
worldwide, won over
a hundred awards.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.130
It is no wonder why she is
ranked one of the best-selling

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.745
female artists in American
history.

00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:00.210
BRANDY: Oh, wow.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.800
DARA WILSON: No big deal.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.690
So in celebration of Black
History Month, BGN has chosen

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.020
three themes to focus on.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.130
Those are mapping the past,
searching the present, and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.530
inventing the future.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.510
And so we're going to have
Brandy here with us to talk

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.590
about those themes through
her career.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.640
BRANDY: OK.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.060
DARA WILSON: So first, I want to
say happy belated birthday.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.430
BRANDY: Thank you very much.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.300
DARA WILSON: How does it feel?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.020
BRANDY: It feels good to
celebrate another birthday.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.980
My birthday is February 11, and
yeah, I just hung out with

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.300
my friends and my family.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.820
and we just did a quiet
celebration.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.160
It was fun.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.346
At the house, it was simple.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:42.720
And it was good.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.480
DARA WILSON: OK, so we actually
have a video clip of

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.930
you discussing your beginnings
in the music industry that we

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.080
wanted to start with.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.360
So let's go ahead and play
that to start out.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.811
BRANDY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.040
DARA WILSON: We like
that girl, huh?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.366
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:57.366 --> 00:01:59.510
DARA WILSON: OK, so it has
been 18 years since

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.040
the single came out.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.220
How does it feel to be
celebrating such a milestone

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.100
in your career?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.160
You're still going strong
all these years later.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.699
BRANDY: Well, it feels great
to do what I love to do.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.570
Singing is my passion.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.960
Entertainment is my passion.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.470
I love people, so it feels
good to keep going.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.790
I've gone through a lot,
a lot of ups and downs.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.740
At one point, I didn't like
what I did anymore.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.750
And so to rediscover and to
reinvent and to develop all

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.160
over again has truly
been a blessing.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.910
I've been so blessed to get
chance after chance.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.660
And I'm just happy to
be an example of

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.280
possibility, really.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.000
Y'all can clap on that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.900
BRANDY: I must say, that
was pretty profound.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.718
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:46.718 --> 00:02:49.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.990
DARA WILSON: OK, so you have
been around for a significant

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.390
amount of time.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.120
So tell us about some of the
biggest influences in the

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.170
music industry for
your career.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.020
BRANDY: Oh my god.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.400
Well, my dad was the first
performer I saw in church.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.740
He was the first person
that I was wowed by.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.500
And then being introduced to
Whitney Houston at an early

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.850
age was like, whoa.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.870
I couldn't believe a woman
like her existed.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.860
Her smile alone just made your
heart melt, and just her voice

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.700
and her aura and her presence.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.210
And so I grew up loving
her, idolizing her.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.300
And I had a chance to meet her,
work with her, and become

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.000
a friend of hers.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.330
So that's awesome.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.790
I'll never forget her.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.280
And she will forever be
my idol and someone

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.100
that I look up to.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.090
DARA WILSON: You did a good job
of introducing her to our

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.085
generation as well.

00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:41.675
BRANDY: Oh, really?

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:42.010
DARA WILSON: Oh, yeah.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.760
BRANDY: I did that?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.350
No, I didn't.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.230
DARA WILSON: Yes,
you did, girl.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.156
BRANDY: Oh, no, y'all knew
Whitney Houston.

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:48.400
DARA WILSON: But [INAUDIBLE]
have her to be so accessible--

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.490
Sunday night, you're sitting
between your mom's legs.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.600
Your doing your hair, and
"The Wonderful World of

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.500
Disney" comes on.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.790
And Brandy is there with
Whitney Houston.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.690
It just brought her to a whole
new generation, I think.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.970
BRANDY: She's unbelievable,
an unbelievable woman.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.980
DARA WILSON: Definitely.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.610
OK, so next we want
to move to--

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.390
this one's a favorite of mine--
your TV show, "Moesha".

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.862
BRANDY: Ooh.

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:09.278
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:09.278 --> 00:04:10.222
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:13.060
DARA WILSON: Yes, we could
clap for that.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.895
It went on to become a great
success, obviously.

00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:17.560
And it was really refreshing--

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.250
let's talk about generational
gaps again-- to see a positive

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.240
depiction of an African American
family in some

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.190
real-world situations.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.050
And one of the things that I
know I personally loved about

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.520
watching the show was all
the celebrity guests.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.610
BRANDY: I know.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.235
We did have a lot of--

00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:34.350
DARA WILSON: So tell us about
who you favorite was.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.150
BRANDY: One of my favorites
was Maya Angelou.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.980
She was--

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.500
incredible African American
woman, and she just inspired

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.210
so many people.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.840
So meeting her, for me, was
like meeting Oprah.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.610
It just didn't seem like
she was touchable.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.240
So she was on the show.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.070
There's a lot of people
that came on the show.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.300
Jamie Foxx--

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.960
so many.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.390
And it's weird because I don't
remember a lot of the "Moesha"

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.030
days, so I'm pretty sure there
was a lot of great people on

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.140
there that I'm not really
recalling right now.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.260
But it was a great experience
for me because I got a chance

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.760
to grow up through the eyes of
"Moesha", because I wasn't in

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.640
regular school, and she was.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.690
And she really had true
teenage issues.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.590
She stood her ground, stood on
her own, and I was able to

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.770
live through that and learn
a lot from her.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.080
I know you didn't ask me that,
but I just felt the need to--

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.160
since we were on the subject,
I just decided to--

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.140
DARA WILSON: That's exactly
what we're here for.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.032
Feel free.

00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:32.478
Please.

00:05:32.478 --> 00:05:33.370
BRANDY: OK.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.220
DARA WILSON: I'm just going to
say that my favorite, I think,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.580
was Brian McKnight.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.710
BRANDY: Brian McNight
was on the show.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.370
DARA WILSON: Yes, girl.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.420
BRANDY: I forgot about that.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.590
DARA WILSON: And you
were dancing,

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.630
and he was your teacher.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.330
And I had to leave the room
because he was so fine.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.852
BRANDY: You like him, huh?

00:05:48.852 --> 00:05:50.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.880
DARA WILSON: So I want to thank
you for that as well.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.155
BRANDY: OK.

00:05:52.155 --> 00:05:52.925
Girl, you're welcome.

00:05:52.925 --> 00:05:54.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.790
DARA WILSON: OK, well, speaking
of which, since I

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.490
brought that up, have you ever
been star-struck by people

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.870
you've met?

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.290
BRANDY: Oh my god, I'm always
star-struck, especially people

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.200
that I'm invested in.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.220
Like recently, I had a chance
to meet Kerry Washington.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.940
She's the lady that plays in
"Scandal" Olivia Pope.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.180
I know you guys know.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.980
And I got a chance to really
tell her how I felt about her

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.120
and all of her monologues that
she does on the show.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.532
And of course, I had to get
through the "oh my god.

00:06:23.532 --> 00:06:25.550
Oh my god." It was a problem.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.490
And I embarrass everybody around
me because I really go

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.980
into groupie mode, especially
when I love someone.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.180
So it happens.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.780
And I never want to lose that
because when people come up to

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.980
me and tell me how they feel
about my work and they

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.800
appreciate the things that I've
done for them, it makes

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.690
me feel amazing.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.700
So I always want to let the
people that make me feel that

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.080
way know how I feel
about them.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.840
DARA WILSON: Awesome.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.490
So Kerry Washington, that's
a recent one.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.335
I feel like everybody here would
have that same reaction.

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:53.710
She is amazing.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.440
BRANDY: It was a mess,
how I was acting.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.720
It was really bad.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.010
DARA WILSON: Anybody else?

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.210
BRANDY: Oh my god, so many.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.140
When I first met Whitney
Houston, I had to register

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.170
that she was a real person.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.270
Like you can go on YouTube
and see it--

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.000
I'm running from her.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.870
I'm screaming.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.230
I'm crying.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.570
I was a hot mess.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.270
And then Michael Jackson,
I fainted.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.230
I just walked in and
saw him and just--

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.060
you know what I mean?

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.032
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:21.940
DARA WILSON: I think that's a
perfectly acceptable response

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.144
to meeting Michael Jackson.

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:23.638
BRANDY: Yeah.

00:07:23.638 --> 00:07:25.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.790
BRANDY: But yeah.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.620
DARA WILSON: Awesome.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:27.320
OK.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.840
So your new album,
"Two Eleven"--

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.570
BRANDY: New album, "Two
Eleven," is out now.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.820
DARA WILSON: Birthday?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.130
BRANDY: Yes.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.280
DARA WILSON: It was released
back in October, right?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.790
BRANDY: Yes.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:37.240
DARA WILSON: OK, so how is it
different, this album, from

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.500
your past works?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.140
What has changed for
you as an artist?

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.340
BRANDY: Well, I'm just a
different person now.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.070
I'm older.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.370
I'm wiser.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:51.330
And I'm a lot more honest
within myself.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.890
I know who I am as a person.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.830
So when you have a better sense
of who you are, you can

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.360
be honest in every part
of your life.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.820
So music is the best way I can
express myself and really just

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.850
let loose already.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.980
So to have that connection with
self, it's a little bit

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.050
more freeing for me.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.960
So with this album, I
just wanted to get

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.750
back to my R&amp;B roots.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:19.160
And it's an album that
I'm truly proud of.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.000
I love every song
on the album.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.730
I didn't write any of the songs,
so I'm not being cocky

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.126
by saying that.

00:08:25.126 --> 00:08:26.930
But I love all the songs.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.750
I relate to them.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.490
And I love the melodies,
the lyrics.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.799
It was just a great experience
to reconnect back to my music

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.799
and then to do music that I knew
my fans would be proud of

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.250
and do an album that my fans
have been waiting for, because

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.610
they've been with me for
such a long time.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.980
And it's all about them
right now for me.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.690
I love my fans.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:54.130
I do.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.350
DARA WILSON: Well I have to
say, it shows, because the

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.030
album is really, really
incredible.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.190
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.650
Thank you so much.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.560
DARA WILSON: It seems like
that extension is there.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.790
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.390
DARA WILSON: So you mentioned
it-- you teed it off for me.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.680
You do have an incredibly
passionate and engaged fan

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.700
base

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.190
BRANDY: I do.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.260
DARA WILSON: You really do.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.310
BRANDY: I mean they go hard.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.632
My fans are not-- like, don't
talk about me to my fans.

00:09:17.632 --> 00:09:18.882
They will let you have it.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.840
They feel like my
extended family.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.820
They really do.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:31.235
And anybody that knows
me, knows my fans are

00:09:31.235 --> 00:09:32.350
a part of my family.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.040
And that's why I call them my
stars, because they keep me

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.000
shining, and they've been there
through everything, the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.700
ups and the downs.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.690
And you can't ask for better
fans than that.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.060
DARA WILSON: Yeah.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.440
So I see that you do cultivate
that on YouTube.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.170
You have a pretty
strong YouTube

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.530
presence and following.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.580
How does that help you interact
with your fan

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:54.920
base in that way?

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.950
BRANDY: Well, just being able
to be that close in

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.580
connection is great.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.010
I didn't have that coming up.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.330
So to have something where I can
be in close contact with

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.990
them-- people that can't get to
every show, they can see me

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.420
and appreciate--

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.970
DARA WILSON: Singing
in the bathroom.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.490
BRANDY: Yeah, singing
in the bathroom.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.110
All that stuff that I'm able to
do to impress them and to

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.840
engage with them
is a blessing.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.200
DARA WILSON: So you do see it
as a big difference from the

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.290
early part of your career, that
social media [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.490
BRANDY: Oh my god, social
media, it has

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.410
its pros and cons.

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.580
But the pros are just amazing
because I can

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.970
talk directly to them.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.032
I can DM them.

00:10:40.032 --> 00:10:40.970
DARA WILSON: You're
DMing your fans?

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.010
BRANDY: Yeah, I DM.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.900
I DM a little.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.790
I Direct Message a little bit.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.040
Yes.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.700
I know if Whitney had a Twitter
or something like

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.190
that, I would be stalking.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.165
So it's great for them to feel
like they can talk to you and

00:10:57.165 --> 00:10:58.800
feel like they know you, because
that's how I feel

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.490
about them.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.275
And I hate that I can't
get to everybody.

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:05.040
DARA WILSON: Well, when you have
such a strong fan base,

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.590
that's never going
to be possible.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.510
But it's a blessing.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:07.920
BRANDY: That's true.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.690
It definitely is.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.790
You're doing a great
job, by the way.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.420
DARA WILSON: Oh, well
thank you very much.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.658
BRANDY: Girl, you should
get your own talk show.

00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:14.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:14.550
BRANDY: Yes.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:18.009
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:19.385
DARA WILSON: Oprah left
her seat open.

00:11:19.385 --> 00:11:20.140
I'm auditioning, y'all.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.460
You don't know.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:24.890
DARA WILSON: OK, so you did
mention that your fans are

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.640
called stars, and they
help you to shine.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.840
But how did that name come
about, specifically?

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.980
Did it just come to you?

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.650
BRANDY: It did come to me.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:36.230
I was doing some videos for them
on the previous album--

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.220
not this album, but
the album before.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.510
And I was just talking to them,
interacting with them.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.060
And it just came
out of nowhere.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.370
I was like, y'all
are my stars.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.235
Y'all keep me shining.

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:48.250
And I was like, hmm,
that should be--

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:48.670
DARA WILSON: Inspiration.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.235
BRANDY: Yeah, that should be--

00:11:50.235 --> 00:11:53.260
because fans sounds so--

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.560
DARA WILSON: Cold.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.670
BRANDY: It does, huh?

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.800
I wasn't going to say cold, but
I'm going to go with that.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.110
That was a good one.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.090
DARA WILSON: Because you're
the opposite.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.460
You have a very warm presence,
and I think it's partly

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.170
because of that.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:05.820
DARA WILSON: I think we
just had a moment.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:06.420
BRANDY: Yeah, we did.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:08.244 --> 00:12:11.520
BRANDY: But yeah, stars, it's
more personal for me.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:11.860
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.190
Do you ever get the chance to
watch some of the stuff that

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.840
they are putting up
on social media?

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.900
I know people do choreography
to your music.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.500
BRANDY: I do.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.140
I watch the choreography.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.800
I watch the birthday messages
they send me.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.770
And some of my stars are
really talented.

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.560
They can sing.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.780
There's this one guy.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.680
His name is Token.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.420
And he always makes these videos
where he's like five or

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.910
six different characters, and
all six of his characters are

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.810
Brandy fans.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:47.510
And so he expresses love for
me in different characters.

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.580
One is real Ratchet.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.160
He calls one of the characters
Ratchet.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.840
And so everything is like,
"girl, honey child."

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.470
And it's like a whole thing
where he's being this

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:00.720
character, and it expresses
the love for me.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.780
And I just love that.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.190
And I'm just amazed by
that, that someone

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.480
could feel that way--

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.990
people could feel that
way about me.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.760
DARA WILSON: That's got to be a
great thing to wake up to in

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.150
the morning.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.064 --> 00:13:11.980
BRANDY: It is.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.060
It definitely is.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:13.405
Definitely Ratchet.

00:13:13.405 --> 00:13:15.292
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:17.440
DARA WILSON: OK, well again,
we have a little bit of

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.670
footage of one of your
stars right now.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.660
So we're going to watch how
they interact with you.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.300
BRANDY: Oh my god, I wish you
would have played another one

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.230
from this clip.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.750
BRANDY: No, it's really
emotionally.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.410
It was a girl.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.910
She walked up, and she just
looked at me like this.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:42.240
And then she stopped, and
then she just broke--

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.730
it had to register to her.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.790
And I'm me, so I'm like,
what's wrong?

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.146
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:53.350
BRANDY: But it was so incredible
how she responded,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.410
and I just broke down.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.370
It was a moment for me.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.880
I was like, wow.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.500
DARA WILSON: Maybe the people
on the committee thought you

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.610
might not want to see yourself
breaking down on video.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:02.920
I don't know.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.210
BRANDY: Right.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.220
Yeah, because I do look crazy
when I cry, so maybe not.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.920
Gotta keep it cute for Google.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.740
Gotta keep it cute.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.150
DARA WILSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:10.080
BRANDY: Right.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.640
DARA WILSON: OK, so you
mentioned that one.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.370
Do you have any other favorite
memorable fan moments?

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:18.960
BRANDY: It's so many
great fan moments.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:25.470
All I know is I really
appreciate when people say

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.240
things like your music
saved my life.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.620
I was going through a break-up,
and your music

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.610
turned me around.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.460
I feel like I can
relate to you.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.100
I have a lot of people that come
up to me and say those

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.540
things, and that always
makes me feel just--

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.810
it's the reason why
I do what I do.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.320
And I'm so glad that I'm
connected to that feeling,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.850
because when you come
up and you're young,

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.650
you want to be famous.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.650
You want to be popular.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.720
It's all about you when
you're young.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.270
But now, I know that it's a
responsibility, and it's a

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.420
service to my fans
to do what I do.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.540
And I'm blessed to have the
opportunity to serve people

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.360
and to share.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.770
So, yeah, y'all can
clap on that, too.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:14.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.110
DARA WILSON: You're making
my life so easy.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:17.810
BRANDY: It's really true.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.400
I mean that.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:20.650
DARA WILSON: It's beautiful

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.730
BRANDY: Because it wasn't
always like that.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.720
And it feels great to have
that connection.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.530
DARA WILSON: And your people
are die hard, too.

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.880
We're all out here waiting.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.045
Every day, it was like, there's
this Brandy thing

00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:31.200
coming, y'all?

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.420
DARA WILSON: OK, so this is a
little bit of a departure, but

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:39.870
I heard that you're an avid
"World of Warcraft" fan?

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.846
[CHEERS]

00:15:40.846 --> 00:15:43.774
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:43.774 --> 00:15:44.690
DARA WILSON: Girl.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:46.110
You're going to fit
in here just fine.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.520
BRANDY: Anybody in here play
"World of Warcraft"?

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.490
OK, never mind.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.000
DARA WILSON: This is a room
full of Googlers.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.580
They all fronting.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.850
Everybody in here
plays that game.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.190
BRANDY: Somebody has to--

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.410
one person.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.330
Don't be embarrassed.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.422
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.422 --> 00:15:59.838
BRANDY: OK.

00:15:59.838 --> 00:16:01.126
DARA WILSON: That's OK.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.040
"StarCraft"?

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:02.290
BRANDY: Oh,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.050
"StarCraft." [LAUGHTER]

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.360
BRANDY: Same people, but
it's not the same game.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.450
No, I've never played
"StarCraft.' But I'm all

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.420
"World of Warcraft."
I love that game.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.480
It's an escape.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.120
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.130
Bordering on obsession, maybe?

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.210
BRANDY: I used to be obsessed.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.310
I'm a little busy right now,
which is a good thing because

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.845
when I wasn't busy I was--

00:16:27.845 --> 00:16:30.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.900
BRANDY: I was gone, seriously.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.130
But I am a Level 90.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:36.122 --> 00:16:37.760
BRANDY: That's the highest
level in the game.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.190
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.550
DARA WILSON: I love this
side of Brandy.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.510
Yes.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.760
BRANDY: Yes.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.900
Girl, who told you to
ask that question?

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.670
DARA WILSON: I'm not going
to out anybody.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.970
BRANDY: OK.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.300
DARA WILSON: OK, so you're on
tour now promoting the album.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:00.650
BRANDY: Yes.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.290
DARA WILSON: And the
tour is amazing.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.820
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.560
DARA WILSON: We have always
really enjoyed your moves and

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.260
your music.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:07.660
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.829
DARA WILSON: But this seems
like it's just on another

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.780
level with the dancing.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.190
And actually, we have
another clip.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.140
This is my favorite one.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.630
I've been waiting all
day for this.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.130
BRANDY: Oh my god, what is it?

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.552
DARA WILSON: So let's
roll this clip.

00:17:20.552 --> 00:17:21.935
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.935 --> 00:17:22.859
DARA WILSON: Yes.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:23.310
BRANDY: That's him.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:25.210
That's the 90 characters--

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.079
the guy.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:26.855
DARA WILSON: Well,
there we are.

00:17:26.855 --> 00:17:27.765
BRANDY: Yes.

00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:29.340
I'm a fan of him, you know?

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.560
DARA WILSON: You know what, we
thought that perhaps he was a

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.520
fan, but his moves were so on
point, we said, no, he must be

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.160
a background dancer.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.700
BRANDY: No, he is a fan.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.380
DARA WILSON: That
is incredible.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.070
BRANDY: A star, yes.

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.280
DARA WILSON: Wow.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.440
BRANDY: And he has
my back, totally.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:47.240
DARA WILSON: So in terms of
the performances, before,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.520
things were a little
bit more subtle.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.480
BRANDY: Yeah.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.180
DARA WILSON: Well, I
didn't say that.

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:50.700
BRANDY: You could say it.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.160
It's OK.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.420
DARA WILSON: Well, I won't.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.320
BRANDY: You want me to say it?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.240
Yeah, I was stiff.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.450
DARA WILSON: But things
have changed a lot.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.730
People are talking about it
that's it's changed so much.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:00.750
You're incredible.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.790
BRANDY: Thanks you.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:08.920
I've definitely discovered
a new performer on stage.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.670
I don't even know who
this girl is.

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.360
I still got a long way to
go, a lot of work to do.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.890
But I'm a little bit more
comfortable on stage now.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.390
And I'll share a quick
story with you guys.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:25.270
When I was about 16, I
appeared on a stage.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.980
It was 20-something
thousand people.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.490
It was this summer jam.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.880
And I got on the stage
to give the radio

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.190
station this plaque--

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:37.160
one of my plaques--

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.300
and the entire stadium
booed me.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.280
Like, boo!

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.870
It was really bad.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.030
I was a teenager.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.325
I'm done after that.

00:18:47.325 --> 00:18:48.575
I'm emotional.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.850
It scarred me.

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:53.750
DARA WILSON: You're a
real human being.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.660
BRANDY: From there, I
became stage fright.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.360
Every audience after that, I
thought I was going to be

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.580
booed, something was
going to happen.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:08.140
So I've come through a lot being
a performer and getting

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:12.010
comfortable on stage, because
that fear is still there.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.170
But it's not as much as
it was coming up.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.870
So I had to really come through
a lot of stage fright

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.810
because of that moment.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.420
And moments after that have
happened, too, where boos and

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.590
things like that.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.960
But there's so much love now and
so much appreciation for

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.970
my music and what I do, I'm
starting to get a little bit

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.230
more comfortable on stage.

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.100
And it feels great.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.450
And now, I don't care now
when I get on stage.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.250
I just let it loose.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.930
You're going to love it, or
you're going to hate it.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.180
It depends on whatever that
person is feeling.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.040
I just know that I leave
everything on stage.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.300
I give it 150%.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.780
And that's all I can do.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.690
DARA WILSON: And it's paying
off in dividends.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.190
I'm telling you, your
stars are talking.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.650
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:56.970
DARA WILSON: You got to teach
us some moves later.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.610
I'm going to corner you, because
I only do half a

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.580
dougie at this point.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.130
BRANDY: Girl, you doing it just
sitting there, honey.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.010
DARA WILSON: I'm trying
to work it out.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:05.480
BRANDY: Yes.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.010
DARA WILSON: OK, so you have
gotten back into acting.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.010
We've seen you on "The Game"
and "Drop Dead Diva." So

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.100
what's that transition like?

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.820
Tell us about it.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.720
BRANDY: I love acting.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.150
It's a little bit more of a
challenge for me because

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.950
acting, you play somebody
completely

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.840
different than yourself.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.820
But I love it.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.770
I love the challenge.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.840
I love bringing truth to
someone that's not me.

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.040
And it's definitely a
challenging thing.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.830
So I love a challenge.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.270
So you see me on "The
Game" this season.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.760
I think that drops in March.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.195
And the new movie with
Tyler Perry--

00:20:40.195 --> 00:20:41.010
DARA WILSON: Congratulation
on that.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.270
BRANDY: --that comes
out in March,

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.810
"Temptation." Yeah, thank you.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.060
So acting is going
pretty well.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.080
I want to do a lot more in the
future though, definitely.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.000
DARA WILSON: Cool.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.170
So what's next for you
in your career?

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:52.280
BRANDY: Well, I'm going
to keep performing.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.270
I'm going to just keep
working hard.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:59.040
I feel like I'm definitely on
the path, my path of destiny,

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.520
so I just want to keep going
and stay humble, stay

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.460
positive, and keep doing what
I love to do because this is

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.890
what I was born to do.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.170
DARA WILSON: And is there anyone
on the horizon that

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.950
you're looking forward
to working with?

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.030
Anybody you have your eye on?

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.810
BRANDY: It's a lot of great
artists out there.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.430
I would love to work with
Beyonce one day.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.640
I think she's incredible.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.170
Kelly Rowland's incredible.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:24.728
I love Miguel.

00:21:24.728 --> 00:21:25.146
[CHEERS]

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:26.820
BRANDY: Oh my god.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.180
My fiance got me on to Miguel.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.470
I didn't even realize
how amazing he was.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.875
And I'm just like, oh my god,
can he perform at the wedding?

00:21:36.875 --> 00:21:38.330
Please.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.360
He is amazing.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.515
And that was actually my
pitch if he sees that.

00:21:41.515 --> 00:21:42.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.455
BRANDY: He might say yes, so--

00:21:43.455 --> 00:21:44.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.070
BRANDY: So yes, Miguel, I want
you to perform at the wedding.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.320
DARA WILSON: Or he can
come to Google also.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.010
BRANDY: Yes.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.360
DARA WILSON: He can--
and then we can--

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.750
Yeah.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.810
BRANDY: See, Google, y'all got
everybody coming up here.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.755
I just need Miguel at my wedding
real quick, you know

00:21:53.755 --> 00:21:53.990
what I'm saying?

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.275
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:54.275 --> 00:21:55.180
DARA WILSON: But can
we work together?

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.520
Can we collaborate?

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.930
BRANDY: Yes, we can
work together.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:57.900
We can work together.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.530
DARA WILSON: Let's
make it work.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.350
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.920
So you also have a
few alter egos.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.790
BeRocka?

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.550
BRANDY: BeatRocka
is a nickname.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:08.790
It's not an alter ego.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.110
DARA WILSON: OK, I apologize.

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:11.310
BRANDY: I don't have
no alter egos.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.690
DARA WILSON: OK, It's
just all Brandy.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:13.630
BRANDY: It's all-- yeah.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.680
I have, like, 10
personalities.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.960
I definitely have a couple--

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.460
I'm not crazy, y'all.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:23.055
But I do have a couple
of personalities.

00:22:23.055 --> 00:22:25.673
DARA WILSON: And some
of them rap.

00:22:25.673 --> 00:22:29.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:29.912 --> 00:22:32.280
DARA WILSON: They rap very
well, I have to say.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:32.820
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.750
I used to rap.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.780
But I'm a little bit discouraged
because no one

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.920
believed in my rapping.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.810
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.400
DARA WILSON: What?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.280
BRANDY: Yeah, the world didn't
really buy into it.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:40.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.770
BRANDY: And the new team that
I'm working with definitely

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:46.470
doesn't want to hear me rap.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.410
So I'm a little bit
discouraged.

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:49.560
DARA WILSON: You just
got to drop a little

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.220
mix tape on the street.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:55.080
BRANDY: See, that's what
I really want to do.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:58.230
But because I don't feel like
any one will take me

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.050
seriously--

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:00.880
and for those dreamers out
there, don't listen to this

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.090
part, because I have no business
feeling like that

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.090
about something that I feel like
I can do a little bit.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.600
But nobody believes, so I just
say, just stick to singing.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.180
DARA WILSON: Just singing.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.880
BRANDY: Just stick to singing.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.090
DARA WILSON: OK, well, I'm a
little sad about that, but

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:13.540
that's all right.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:14.060
BRANDY: Me too.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.810
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.940
You can rap to me later.

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:18.424
BRANDY: Mmm-mmm.

00:23:18.424 --> 00:23:20.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:21.812
DARA WILSON: No.

00:23:21.812 --> 00:23:23.270
OK.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.480
So now we have a [INAUDIBLE]
question submitted from a

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.350
fellow Googler.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.830
So Felix asks, who, if any, was
the inspiration for the

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.420
song "The Boy is Mine"?

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.450
That is an excellent
question, Felix.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:37.100
BRANDY: It is.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:43.220
Well actually, I was a huge
fan of "Jerry Springer."

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.040
"Jerry Springer" was hot back
in the day, let me tell you.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.170
Everything was about boys and
fighting over them, and I was

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:51.850
a huge fan.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.290
So I was like, oh my
god, I should do a

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:58.370
song around that subject.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.010
DARA WILSON: You mean, you
weren't a huge fan of Jerry

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.940
Springer as a man.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.620
The boy is not Jerry Springer.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:05.320
BRANDY: No, the boy is not--

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:07.950
DARA WILSON: I just want to
clarify that for everybody.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:08.920
BRANDY: Did it sound like--

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.760
yes, I'm sorry.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.220
Jerry Springer was not the boy.

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.490
BRANDY: It was the show, "Jerry
Springer", and the

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.530
subject matter.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:16.983
DARA WILSON: Uh-huh.

00:24:16.983 --> 00:24:18.635
Well that makes a
lot of sense.

00:24:18.635 --> 00:24:18.900
BRANDY: Yes.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:23.352
So I went to Rodney Jerkins, my
producer at the time, and I

00:24:23.352 --> 00:24:27.490
was like, we should do a song
called "The Boy is Mine", and

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.510
we should put Monica on it.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.120
People are already putting us
against each other, and we

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.050
don't even know each other.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:39.300
So it would be the perfect song
to get people even more

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.050
into the feud.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.770
So it worked out.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.110
DARA WILSON: But the feud
is not a real thing?

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.940
BRANDY: No, it wasn't.

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:46.860
We didn't even know
each other.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.520
We hadn't even met, and people
were already saying, oh, she

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.430
doesn't like her. and it was
just a whole catty thing that

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.720
was not appropriate.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.430
DARA WILSON: Yeah.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.310
But it worked out because
the song is incredible.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.910
BRANDY: It did work out.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.430
Thank you.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.670
DARA WILSON: And my 12-year-old
self is dancing

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.150
inside right now because
it's happy.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.150
BRANDY: So which one were
you, Brandy or Monica?

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:07.000
DARA WILSON: I was Brandy,
obviously.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.235
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.235 --> 00:25:10.129
BRANDY: I'm just kidding.

00:25:10.129 --> 00:25:12.551
You know, because everybody
had their--

00:25:12.551 --> 00:25:13.200
I'm just trying to check.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.790
DARA WILSON: Your vocal
range is more within--

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.850
BRANDY: Girl, don't expand on
that, because you know they're

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:18.490
going to try to--

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.900
DARA WILSON: And also because
you had the best--

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.295
listen, we've got to move on.

00:25:21.295 --> 00:25:21.570
BRANDY: Please.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.920
DARA WILSON: We all have our
favorite Brandy songs.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.010
Mine is "They Boy is Mine."
But what is yours?

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.260
BRANDY: (SIGH).

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.720
I don't think I've
recorded it yet.

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.040
DARA WILSON: Mmm, that's
a real good answer.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.570
BRANDY: That was, right?

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.930
Yeah, girl, that
was real good.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:44.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.836 --> 00:25:46.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.080
DARA WILSON: I love it.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.600
OK, so still to come.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.610
BRANDY: Yeah, still to come.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.170
DARA WILSON: OK, and so you
did to win a Grammy.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.960
And so we want to know what
that experience was like.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.030
How did that feel?

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.860
BRANDY: Winning a Grammy
was like--

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:10.050
it's like you've arrived,
because that's what they say

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.930
before they introduce you.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:12.740
Y'all didn't say it today.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:13.652
It's cool.

00:26:13.652 --> 00:26:14.948
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:14.948 --> 00:26:17.610
BRANDY: But that's
what they say--

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.510
Grammy Award winning
such-and-such.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.170
So it just--

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.490
DARA WILSON: You said I did
a good job, and now you're

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.050
saying I messed up.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.490
BRANDY: No, you did
a good job.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:29.910
No, I didn't say
you messed up.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.540
You didn't introduce
me today, did you?

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.060
You did?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.840
BRANDY: Aww.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:38.800
It was a joke.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.610
They laughed.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:40.200
They laughed.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:40.660
They laughed.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.400
We good.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:41.530
We good.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:41.770
We good.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:42.660
DARA WILSON: It's OK.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.900
BRANDY: You can say it
now if you want to.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.870
No, I'm just kidding.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:50.530
No, but it really felt like,
oh my god, I've made it.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:56.820
And that was the one
thing I wanted.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.800
I really wanted a Grammy
for that validation,

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.170
I have to be honest.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.000
At that age, you want
to be validated.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.340
You made it.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.960
And when they called our name--
because Monica won it,

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.960
too-- when they called
our name, it was so

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.340
ghetto how I reacted.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.460
It was really, really,
really a problem.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:22.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.204
BRANDY: No class, no
etiquette, just--

00:27:25.204 --> 00:27:27.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.390
BRANDY: I'm booking to the
stage like, oh my god.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.570
I just felt like it was
just really bad.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.200
I'm so glad it was
on the pre-show.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.250
It wasn't on the main show
because it would have just

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.360
looked horrible how
it happened.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.660
DARA WILSON: I'm sure we could
find some footage of that

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:39.860
somewhere

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.500
BRANDY: Please don't find it.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.805
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:43.810
BRANDY: Please don't.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.310
I'm running for my life to grab
that Grammy, seriously.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.320
DARA WILSON: That's passion.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.130
BRANDY: It was passion,
but it was wrong.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.230
It was very wrong.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.550
But I got that Grammy.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.300
I got it.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.850
And it felt amazing.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:57.540
It really did.

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.540
DARA WILSON: Great.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:58.675
BRANDY:

00:27:58.675 --> 00:28:05.990
Yeah [APPLAUSE]

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.130
DARA WILSON: So going back to
"Moesha" a little bit--

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:09.320
because that little
12-year-old girl

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.390
won't let me stop--

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.050
we all know the theme song.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.230
It's incredible.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.840
We love it.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.130
How did the creation
of that come about?

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:23.632
BRANDY: Oh, the creation of "Mo
to the E to the, Mo to--"

00:28:23.632 --> 00:28:24.740
I don't remember.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.015
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:27.015 --> 00:28:27.470
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.840
BRANDY: I don't even remember
recording that.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.310
DARA WILSON: So when you say
you don't remember the

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:33.735
"Moesha" years, you
were being honest?

00:28:33.735 --> 00:28:35.890
BRANDY: Yeah, I'm
being honest.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:36.840
A lot of it is a blur.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.900
I have special moments that I'll
never forget, but that

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:43.705
part of my life was a
blur-- is a blur.

00:28:43.705 --> 00:28:45.750
DARA WILSON: What are some
of those special moments?

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.060
BRANDY: Well, of course, the
Maya Angelou moment.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:53.950
The first episode, because
I couldn't believe I was

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.370
actually doing a television
show.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.780
And all my friends were there,
my family friends were there.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:05.100
And I had a moment where I had
to cry in the first episode,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.860
and I'm asking everybody,
how do you cry?

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.480
So what do you do?

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.400
What's going on?

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.065
So it was like, just blow
something in your

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:12.080
eye and then tears.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.910
So someone blew something in
my eye, and got a chance to

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.800
cry and played it
off pretty well.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.181
So I remember that.

00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:27.550
And my first kiss on television
was crazy.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.505
DARA WILSON: Mmm-hmm.

00:29:28.505 --> 00:29:31.840
You want to expand on that?

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.430
BRANDY: He passed away, the guy
that I-- the first kiss.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:36.080
He passed away.

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.520
His name was Merlin Santana.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.410
DARA WILSON: Oh

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.110
BRANDY: Yeah.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.380
DARA WILSON: I remember.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.135
BRANDY: But yeah, my first
kiss, it was interesting.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.290
DARA WILSON: In a great way.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:48.465
BRANDY:

00:29:48.465 --> 00:29:49.762
No [LAUGHTER]

00:29:49.762 --> 00:29:50.150
DARA WILSON: No?

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.120
BRANDY: He's a great guy, a
great actor, but mmm-mmm.

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.460
BRANDY: I think it was because
it was in front of people and

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.920
cameras, and I was really shy.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.630
DARA WILSON: And it was
the first time.

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:04.080
BRANDY: Yeah, so that
and, hmm, what else?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.540
I'm pretty sure if someone could
help me remember things,

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:10.200
I would remember more.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:10.600
I'm sorry.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.910
DARA WILSON: No,
don't be sorry.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.230
You mentioned a little bit
about having a familiar

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.320
support there.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.300
But what is it like now trying
to balance your career with

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.520
being a mother?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.430
BRANDY: Well, my daughter is
my biggest supporter, and

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.700
she's my biggest inspiration.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:30.600
And she's just really a
sweet person inside.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.710
And so to be a mother of someone
like that, someone I

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.230
like and love and have
a great time with,

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.640
it's truly a blessing.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:41.470
And my fiance is very
supportive--

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.640
just my family in general.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.260
I have a really great
support system.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.400
And you need that.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:54.200
You need that to keep going
and to push forward.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.980
DARA WILSON: Awesome.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:02.440
OK, and so your "BET Honors"
performance of "Without You"

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.830
received a lot of
rave reviews.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.285 --> 00:31:08.230
BRANDY: Yes.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.590
DARA WILSON: And it
premiered on your

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.440
birthday which is amazing.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.020
BRANDY: It did.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.830
DARA WILSON: So can you tell
us about the experience of

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:14.390
doing that?

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:15.310
BRANDY: Yeah.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:21.340
I was really nervous because I
knew that it was going to be a

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.900
lot of people in the audience.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.930
Again, and that stage fright
thing comes on.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.820
I knew Halle Berry was going
to be there, TD Jakes, Lisa

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.710
Leslie-- all of these great
people being honored there.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:34.910
And I knew I had to
do a good job.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:36.630
I knew I had to really
bring it home.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.230
And this was the first time I
had ever performed "Without

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.430
You" on television.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.710
And it's a favorite
of my fans.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.420
They love this song.

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:48.340
So I really wanted to deliver
a great performance.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.220
And so I just wanted to
be very creative.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.500
So the performance
was creative.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:57.590
It wasn't a lot of dancing, but
it was a moment between me

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.890
and one of my dancers.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.490
And it was about love between
the both of us.

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:10.240
And I was inspired by the Pink
performance at "American Music

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.580
Awards," and I was so in love
with her performance.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.720
I was like, now, we not going
to do no splits or no

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.380
acrobatics or nothing
like that.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.800
But we can get the inspiration
with two people that really

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.260
love each other.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.270
DARA WILSON: OK, so getting back
talking about the acting

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.590
a little bit, what do you
prefer, TV or film?

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.320
Where do you think you're
going to be

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.400
going in the future?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.180
BRANDY: I like both.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.000
I like TV and film.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.880
I like the business of TV and
film better than the music

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.810
business, I must say that.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.460
DARA WILSON: Why is that?

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.070
BRANDY: It's the union.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:45.990
You guys know what I mean?

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.150
With the music business,
you just keep going

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:49.140
and going and going.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.430
You don't have any
time to sleep.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.550
With the TV and film, you can do
your job, and then you can

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.250
go to sleep and then wake up
the next morning and don't

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.600
have to go right back to work
because they have a union to

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.920
protect you from--

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.460
you get your 12 hours.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.090
But in the music business,
you don't get that.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:03.855
DARA WILSON: Nobody's
giving you overtime

00:33:03.855 --> 00:33:04.270
in the music business.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:05.000
BRANDY: You just keep going
and going and--

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.005
no.

00:33:06.005 --> 00:33:09.190
But I love what I
do, so it's OK.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.213
But the business is better.

00:33:11.213 --> 00:33:14.030
DARA WILSON: OK, and in terms
of-- since we are at Google,

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:15.680
we're a technological
company--

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.450
where do you see the future
of technology and music

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:20.945
collaborations going
in the future?

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.410
BRANDY: Y'all got a
lot going on here.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:33.680
I think you guys are already
in the future, seriously.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.375
I can't think of anything,
seriously.

00:33:36.375 --> 00:33:37.980
DARA WILSON: Like one day,
you're going to be singing on

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:41.300
Mars because of Explorer
machine that we saw?

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.230
BRANDY: I didn't know if I could
actually say that I saw

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.890
that today, but I was
on the moon today.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:47.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.000
BRANDY: Mars.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.010
I was at my old high school.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:51.980
It's a lot going on
in Google today--

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.890
a lot.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.280
So I can't think of any new--
because if I thought of some

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.134
new ideas, then--

00:33:58.134 --> 00:34:01.410
seriously, you guys have thought
of all the ideas.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:01.890
So I don't know.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:05.240
I just know that it's going to
be huge, whatever it is.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.710
And I'm really happy
to be here today.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:12.250
And I'm really happy that I was
able to see everything and

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:13.060
to see everybody.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.510
And I felt so comfortable.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.270
I think I might be a little bit
too comfortable up here.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.570
I'm cracking jokes and just
being myself, so it's great to

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:25.550
feel this type of energy and
just to be in the midst of

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:26.070
good people.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.139
So thank you.

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:27.620
DARA WILSON: Well, we are
very happy to have you.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:29.420
BRANDY: I didn't mean to end
the interview, but it just

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.449
seemed as though that's
where you were going.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.100
DARA WILSON: Well, I guess
we should just wrap up.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:33.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.409
BRANDY: But I'm happy to
be here, seriously--

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:35.820
really happy.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.233
DARA WILSON: Great.

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:41.949
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:44.139
DARA WILSON: So we are going
to have 10 minutes for

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.120
questions for the audience.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.730
Mmm-hmm, live questions.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.750
BRANDY: Yay.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:49.580
JASMINE: Hi Brandy.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.100
BRANDY: Hi.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.389
DARA WILSON: Make sure you
introduce yourself.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.400
BRANDY: My name is
Jasmine Way.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:53.929
BRANDY: Hi Jasmine.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.053
JASMINE: I work here.

00:34:55.053 --> 00:34:56.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:56.676
BRANDY: Of course.

00:34:56.676 --> 00:34:58.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.520
JASMINE: So you've penned
quite a few songs.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.540
I'm just wondering what your
take is on song writing.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.270
What's your favorite part, and
does it come easily for you?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:11.150
BRANDY: Song writing doesn't
easy for me at all.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.010
But when I do it, I definitely
feel amazing.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.310
I feel more connected to the
song because I know that the

00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:19.980
lyrics are coming from me.

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:25.090
But also, just songs that I
can relate to in general--

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.630
it's easier to bring that song
to life when you've actually

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.830
been through the experience or
you've actually seen somebody

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.170
else go through it and
you can relate to it.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.420
But yeah, I like song writing,
but it doesn't

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:35.710
come as easy for me.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.010
JASMINE: OK.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.690
I have a follow-up question,
really quickly.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:39.950
BRANDY: Oh, go ahead.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.440
JASMINE: OK.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.810
My other question is, if you
were not a singer, what do you

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.210
think that you would be--

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:50.175
if you weren't in the
entertainment industry?

00:35:50.175 --> 00:35:52.420
BRANDY: If I were not in the
entertainment industry, I

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.760
would be a kick-ass lawyer.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.635
I would represent all
of y'all, honey.

00:35:56.635 --> 00:35:57.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.240
BRANDY: Seriously, I would
be an incredible lawyer.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.820
I know that.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.000
And I would do hair
and makeup.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.800
I love doing hair and makeup
for my friends.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.950
DARA WILSON: Why didn't
you help me out today?

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.050
BRANDY: Girl, because when
I saw you, you was

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.130
already done, honey.

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.510
BRANDY: You didn't
need no help, OK?

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.888
But I got you next time.

00:36:17.888 --> 00:36:18.346
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:36:18.346 --> 00:36:19.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:21.500
DARA WILSON: Go ahead.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:21.830
BRANDY: Hi.

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much
for coming, Brandy.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.020
BRANDY: Oh, thank you.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.300
AUDIENCE: I may not look like
it, but I was a huge closet

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.480
fan back to the '90s.

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:28.344 --> 00:36:29.210
BRANDY: A closet fan?

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:33.370
DARA WILSON: So me and my male
cousins, outside of our

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.110
family, we could not talk about
it amongst our friends,

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.012
so that's why--

00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:37.463
BRANDY: Why?

00:36:37.463 --> 00:36:38.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.360
BRANDY: Oh, I wasn't cool
enough for y'all?

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:40.770
No.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:42.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.160
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.700
AUDIENCE: So I guess my question
is, my wife and I, we

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.220
just started a nonprofit
to help low income and

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.740
under-served kids with college
admissions advising, and this

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.510
is totally free.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.440
And so one thing that we
discovered in our outreach to

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.210
these kids was a lot of them,
they look up to people like

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.870
you-- to celebrities and
artists and musicians.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.720
And they don't realize how
much hard work it took,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.850
outside of just having amazing
natural talent, to get to

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:13.340
where you are and to maintain
that level of success.

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:17.660
And so I guess my question is,
they feel that they can

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.030
achieve that success without
having to really work hard or

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.230
without sort of understanding
what goes into all that.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:25.910
What are your thoughts
on that?

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:31.000
And I know you're extremely
busy, but if you would love to

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.246
help us promote higher
education--

00:37:33.246 --> 00:37:34.122
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:34.122 --> 00:37:35.440
DARA WILSON: All right.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.020
AUDIENCE: --that would
be amazing, because--

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.900
BRANDY: I absolutely would

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.120
AUDIENCE: --to have star power
to say how cool and attractive

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.690
and sexy higher education
is would be a blessing.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:46.850
DARA WILSON: College
is sexy, yes.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:48.690
BRANDY: Yes, sexy education.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.720
No, I absolutely would.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.980
And I just wanted to say that
it's impossible to succeed

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.820
without hard work.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.790
It really is.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:04.600
But I think the key to getting
to even working hard is

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.920
finding the love for
what you do.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.230
Once you find the love for
what you do, you can push

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:13.620
yourself, and you can motivate
yourself to keep going because

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.280
sometimes the work just seems
like it's too much.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.960
It's just too much,
need a break.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:24.750
But if you want to keep going
and you want to get to all the

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.470
places that you want to get to,
you have to continue to

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.540
work hard, and you have to
continue to push yourself.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:32.970
And that takes connecting with
the love for what you do.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.764
That's what I think.

00:38:34.764 --> 00:38:35.700
AUDIENCE: Great, thank you.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.820
BRANDY: And I will put you in
touch with the right person

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.910
for the face of your charity.

00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:42.210
No, I'm just playing.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:45.682 --> 00:38:46.674
BRANDY: I'm just kidding.

00:38:46.674 --> 00:38:49.154
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:49.154 --> 00:38:50.404
AUDIENCE: That sounds funny.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:54.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, Brandy.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.850
BRANDY: Hi, how are you.

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:56.710
AUDIENCE: I'm also a huge fan.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.800
I'm one of his cousins,
actually.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:58.275
BRANDY: Hey.

00:38:58.275 --> 00:39:05.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.050
AUDIENCE: I'm really nervous,
but I'm going to try to keep

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.600
it cool because I'm really
star-struck right now.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.130
But you're awesome.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.800
You're beautiful.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.260
Thank you for coming.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:10.985
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:39:10.985 --> 00:39:11.480
Aww.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.530
AUDIENCE: I actually remember
"Special Delivery," maybe 10,

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.070
11 years ago, your
documentary on--

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.510
BRANDY: 10 years ago.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:23.720
AUDIENCE: --on MTV.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.360
I was a little high school kid
just watching you going

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.150
through that stuff.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:33.200
And also, I remember your more
recent reality TV on VH1.

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.250
So I just wanted to know-- just
to keep it a little bit

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.470
more informal-- if you follow
reality TV yourself, and if

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.190
so, what kind of
shows you like?

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.320
"Basketball Wives," maybe?

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.100
BRANDY: Do I follow reality?

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:42.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.672
AUDIENCE: "Bad Girls Club"?

00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:46.384
I don't know, something.

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:52.590
BRANDY: Well, let's start with I
follow the "Mary Mary" show.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:53.410
I love that show.

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:55.550
It's so positive.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:00.395
I watch "La La" from time to
time, and I watch "Basketball

00:40:00.395 --> 00:40:11.930
Wives LA," "Loving Hip Hop: New
York" and "Atlanta." And

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.840
yeah, I'm a reality junkie,
definitely.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.160
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:17.210
BRANDY: Definitely.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:18.410
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.240
BRANDY: Mixed in with "Scandal"
and "American Idol"

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.250
and all those shows, too.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.070
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank
you for coming.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.510
BRANDY: You're welcome.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.350
DARA WILSON: Thank you.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.250
BRANDY: (LAUGHING) Do you
like reality shows?

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:27.713
JASON: Hey Brandy.

00:40:27.713 --> 00:40:28.200
How you doing?

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.770
BRANDY: Hey, how are you?

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:29.900
JASON: My name is Jason.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.320
Sorry, I'm a little star-struck,
so bear with me.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:33.910
BRANDY: No, don't-- no, no.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.000
JASON: I remember back in high
school, I was listening to "I

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.970
Wanna Be Down," so it goes
all the way back.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.460
But I want to thank you for
doing "Moesha" and then

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:45.630
especially "The Game." My wife
and I are big fans, so we want

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.210
to know what's going to
happen with you and

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.776
Jason Pitts this season.

00:40:48.776 --> 00:40:50.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.920
BRANDY: Well, Chardonnay
and Jason Pitts are

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.233
going to stay married.

00:40:54.233 --> 00:40:55.190
AUDIENCE: Oh, nice.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.730
BRANDY: You didn know
they were married?

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.210
AUDIENCE: Oh, I remembered that
from the last episode.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:40:59.035
BRANDY: Oh, OK.

00:40:59.035 --> 00:40:59.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.600
BRANDY: But yeah, they're going
to stay married, and

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.350
that's all I can tell
you, because then it

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.560
wouldn't be a surprise.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.240
JASON: Yeah, we can't
wait until March.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.045
BRANDY: OK, cool.

00:41:08.045 --> 00:41:08.895
That is so cute.

00:41:08.895 --> 00:41:09.320
JASON: Thank you.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.980
BRANDY: Thank you, Jason.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.410
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.850
Hi.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.360
BRANDY: Hey.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.820
AUDIENCE: So I have a little
bit more of an obscure

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.630
reference, maybe.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:20.890
I remember when you did

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:25.924
"Cinderella." [CHEERS]

00:41:25.924 --> 00:41:27.390
BRANDY: Yes, thank you.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.820
AUDIENCE: And it was awesome
to see this multicultural

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.640
retelling of an American
classic, Rogers and

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.060
Hammerstein.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.720
What was that experience like?

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.930
It was huge.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:39.380
I don't know if it still
is, but it's huge.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.190
My mother-in-law is going crazy
right now somewhere once

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.565
I tell her that I asked
you this question.

00:41:44.565 --> 00:41:46.190
BRANDY: Aww.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:50.940
OK, well it was a
dream come true.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:56.870
Number one, to just work with
my idol and then to be the

00:41:56.870 --> 00:42:00.090
first African American
princess.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.970
That was a big deal for me.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:10.170
And it's so weird because when
you get older and you start to

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.760
look back on things, you really
start to appreciate--

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.160
I didn't really know what was
happening at that time.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.020
I didn't really know what kind
of history was being made.

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.840
I didn't really understand it,
or I couldn't receive it.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.680
But when I look back on it now,
it's like, oh my god.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.840
What a blessing.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.650
What a great opportunity to be
able to set that type of an

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:39.150
example and to be, again,
a face of possibility--

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.170
that things can actually happen
if you put your mind to

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:46.250
things and you just let go and
let God, you know what I mean?

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.910
So, yeah.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:48.340
I love that you brought
up "Cinderella"--

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.980
AUDIENCE: I love that I
brought that up, too.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.130
BRANDY: --because we didn't talk
about that today, really.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.130
So thank you.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.730
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.410
Thanks for coming.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.426
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:42:54.426 --> 00:42:57.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.470
SUMMER: Hi, Brandy.

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:00.240
I don't usually get
star-struck, but

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.790
I'm like, oh my god.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:04.140
I'm going to have that moment.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.120
And you're absolutely
beautiful in person.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:06.490
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.390
SUMMER: My name is Summer, and
I have a question for you

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:12.080
regarding R&amp;B music,
specifically for women.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.680
When you came out with "Boy is
Mine" and "I Wanna Be Down,"

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:16.960
everything was fun.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.040
And then you had your sultry,
very touching moments with

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.130
"Waiting to Exhale," the
song that you did

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.120
for that movie track.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.180
Where do you see R&amp;B music,
specifically for women, going

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.920
in the future?

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.690
BRANDY: Well I really can't
speak for other artists.

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:37.020
I know that I will continue to
contribute to that genre of

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.320
music because that's
where I come from.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:43.550
And there is no music like
R&amp;B. It just touches a

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:48.960
different place in your spirit,
and it's a freedom

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.830
there that I don't feel with
any other type of music.

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:54.970
I love my pop.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.340
I love my country
and all that.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.660
But R&amp;B, for me, is where
I can just let loose.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.410
And I'm going to continue
to do that.

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:10.160
And then music is just real
subject matters, and so I'm

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.450
just going to keep it
real in that genre.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.650
Of course, I'm going to venture
out, too, but R&amp;B is

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:16.430
where it is for me.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.750
It's where I live.

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.880
SUMMER: And thank you for coming
back because we need

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.540
more of the real R&amp;B
coming back.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.300
There's not too many female
artists out there right now

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.730
that we can listen to,
so kudos to you.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:28.674
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:44:28.674 --> 00:44:33.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:34.390
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.390
So my heart's beating a little
bit fast, so excuse me.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.530
But I wanted to ask you, if you
could meet anyone, dead or

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.668
alive, in the world
right now--

00:44:42.668 --> 00:44:43.952
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:43.952 --> 00:44:44.910
DARA WILSON: No pressure.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.477
AUDIENCE: --who would
it be and why?

00:44:46.477 --> 00:44:48.762
BRANDY: Oh my god.

00:44:48.762 --> 00:44:50.445
That's a hard one.

00:44:50.445 --> 00:44:53.720
That's a really hard one,
because I've met two of the

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.325
greatest entertainers
of all time.

00:44:58.500 --> 00:44:59.825
Let me think about that one.

00:44:59.825 --> 00:45:00.560
AUDIENCE: OK, take your time.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.810
BRANDY: Let me think
about that one.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.240
Yeah, that's a tough one,
because then if I say the

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.380
wrong thing, and then it
will be something else.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.970
Let me really think about that
one, because I have to

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:11.400
represent for everybody
on that question.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.460
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.630
BRANDY: OK.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:17.820
AUDIENCE: Hello, I'm so excited
to meet you again.

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.230
BRANDY: Yeah, I just met
you on the stairs.

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:19.575
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:45:19.575 --> 00:45:20.235
And now--

00:45:20.235 --> 00:45:20.990
I know.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:22.460
Anyway, let me calm down.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:22.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:28.490
OK, I sing, too, and I love
your vocal arrangement.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:28.800
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.420
AUDIENCE: Like on "Never
Say Never," "Angel In

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:35.380
Disguise" is like my--

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.320
anyway.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.390
I get so excited just
talking about it.

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:40.870
Your vocal arrangements--

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.820
I know you said you don't write
a lot of your songs, but

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.750
do you had a hand in--

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.210
BRANDY: Oh, I vocal
arrange now.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:48.110
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:50.630
As far as the background, do you
do it all yourself, or do

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:52.220
you have people?

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:52.570
BRANDY: Yes.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.780
I have to take claim
for something.

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:55.075
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:55.075 --> 00:45:56.741
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:56.741 --> 00:45:57.870
DARA WILSON: This is an
artist right here.

00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:58.740
BRANDY: Yes.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:04.010
That is where I experienced
god is doing backgrounds.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.980
I hear things in my head
and really able to

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.340
bring a song to life.

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.550
Now, I love the writers and
producers, but I'm taking

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:11.110
credit for that.

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:12.380
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.800
Your vocal arrangements
are awesome.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.700
The notes that you find to
harmonize together are

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:18.100
amazing, and I appreciate
them.

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.150
BRANDY: And thank you for
appreciating them.

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.820
AUDIENCE: Oh, I do.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:19.980
I listen to that.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.220
BRANDY: Because a lot
of people don't

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.570
understand what it is.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.600
They like what they hear, but
they don't really know old the

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.350
ins and outs.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.820
AUDIENCE: No, I hear every
note you sing.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.670
It's awesome.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:30.430
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.995
Thank you.

00:46:30.995 --> 00:46:34.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:36.340
BRANDY: I love this.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:36.800
AUDIENCE: Hi Brandy.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.210
BRANDY: Hi.

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:37.605
AUDIENCE: You're beautiful.

00:46:37.605 --> 00:46:37.940
BRANDY: Thank you.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.440
You're beautiful, too.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.850
AUDIENCE: Huge fan.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:44.280
My question was going to be
to where music is going.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:47.700
We hear a lot of house and a
lot more of the club beats.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:50.070
Are you going to venture
into that at all?

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.385
BRANDY: House, hmm.

00:46:53.385 --> 00:46:55.470
I'm not mad at house.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.892
I'm not mad at it.

00:46:56.892 --> 00:46:59.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:59.222 --> 00:47:00.266
DARA WILSON: But are
you joining?

00:47:00.266 --> 00:47:01.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.770
BRANDY: I don't know if I'm
going to become a part of the

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:08.000
club, but I do appreciate
all types of music.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.710
But I don't know if house is
about to be my new thing.

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:15.320
AUDIENCE: Maybe, say, on
some different tracks?

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.230
BRANDY: You want me to, huh?

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.870
BRANDY: You want me to
explore a little bit?

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:19.730
AUDIENCE: I would love to hear
you more in the clubs and

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:20.390
everything.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.760
I love you.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.210
BRANDY: It's OK if
you want me to.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:24.040
You said you're a fan.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.070
I'll venture out a little bit.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:27.500
Now, I can't stay.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.240
BRANDY: But we can venture
a little bit.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:31.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:32.872
Thanks for coming.

00:47:32.872 --> 00:47:33.864
BRANDY: You're welcome.

00:47:33.864 --> 00:47:35.890
DARA WILSON: OK, we're going
to take these last two and

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:37.330
then move on.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:38.200
ASHRAN: Hey, my name's Ashran.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.580
My question is not going to be
as interesting as the others,

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.550
but I'm going to try.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.790
Just so you know, I studied
engineering in an obscure part

00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.920
in southern India, and you
are popular there.

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:51.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.800
BRANDY: Really?

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.770
DARA WILSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:53.800
ASHRAN: Just so you know,
you have a new

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.410
demographic of fans today.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:59.380
BRANDY: Yes.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.930
ASHRAN: Anyway, I'm a vocalist
myself, [? Iranian ?]

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:02.520
classical.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.840
But I want to ask you,
as a musician, you

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.690
wear different hats.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:07.610
You're with legal.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.235
You do business.

00:48:08.235 --> 00:48:10.070
You have to do media
appearances.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.770
There's all this circus
around you.

00:48:11.770 --> 00:48:14.000
How do you try and disconnect
yourself when you really want

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.940
to get into a groove and not be
worried about the realities

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.900
of the business?

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.970
How do you connect with your
soul and produce good music?

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.990
BRANDY: Well, I grew up in the
business, so I had to learn

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:31.610
the hard way of how to
disconnect and how not to care

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:36.160
about what the business part
of it was all the time.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.860
But now, I'm so in touch with my
purpose, and I'm so normal.

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:47.800
The business part of it,
I don't even want

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:48.370
to hear about it.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:51.110
I don't want to deal with it,
I just want to connect with

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:54.380
people and connect with what
I'm supposed to do.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.290
And that's how I
stay grounded.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:00.990
That's how I stay normal.

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.285
I know you guys feel like I'm
like a big sister right now or

00:49:03.285 --> 00:49:06.940
a friend because the business
part doesn't matter.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.310
And I just don't deal with it.

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:08.973
ASHRAN: OK, cool.

00:49:08.973 --> 00:49:10.490
Thank you.

00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:11.470
BRANDY: My money got to
be right, though.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:15.070
ASHRAN: Thanks.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:16.500
DARA WILSON: Amen.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.020
BRANDY: Amen.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:19.690
AUDIENCE: Hi Brandy.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.340
How are you?

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:20.945
BRANDY: Hi, how are you?

00:49:20.945 --> 00:49:21.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.010
I'm that crazy girl from
the cafeteria.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:23.886
BRANDY: I just saw
that just now.

00:49:23.886 --> 00:49:26.080
AUDIENCE: And I was like,
oh my god, it's Brandy.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.370
But I just wanted to say hi.

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:29.970
I'm actually a pediatrician
from New York.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.495
I just came into town
to visit a friend.

00:49:31.495 --> 00:49:34.425
BRANDY: You are a cute
pediatrician.

00:49:34.425 --> 00:49:35.610
AUDIENCE: She was like,
Brandy's here.

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:36.440
I was like, awesome.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.160
I'm going to come
get to meet her.

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.394
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:41.380
AUDIENCE: And then
I saw you in the

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.590
cafeteria two minutes later.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.230
It was awesome.

00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:46.660
Anyhow, I do motivational
speaking on the side, and I

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:48.726
wanted to ask you what motivates
you, because I want

00:49:48.726 --> 00:49:50.930
to share that with the kids
that I speak with

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:52.880
when I go back home.

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.770
BRANDY: Just in general?

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, whatever.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.040
Go wherever you want with it.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.600
BRANDY: Oh my god, my
family motivates me.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.800
My friends, they motivate me.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.410
My love for what I do, it helps
me to strive and to

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:12.550
continue to push forward even
when I don't want to.

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:16.340
Just life in general,
life is a school.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.550
You learn so many different
things about yourself with

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.210
different experiences.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:26.950
And that, in itself, can create
new creations and new

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.880
opportunities for you
to express yourself.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:30.130
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:50:30.130 --> 00:50:31.330
I agree.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:32.920
So I'm going to jump in like
that other guy-- if I could

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:34.914
get that on video, you could
share with the kids.

00:50:34.914 --> 00:50:35.700
They'll love it.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.410
BRANDY: OK, absolutely.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.105
You should have got
that on camera.

00:50:39.105 --> 00:50:41.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.820
DARA WILSON: That's what the
camera phone is for, right?

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:43.560
BRANDY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:44.710
DARA WILSON: Well,
thank you all so

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:45.510
much for your questions.

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:47.080
They were really insightful
and interesting.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:47.670
BRANDY: I know.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:49.150
This was so much fun.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:51.040
DARA WILSON: And we have one
more fun thing for you.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.290
BRANDY: Y'all don't have
me leaving in here.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:53.410
I don't even want to leave.

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.270
Babe, get a new flight.

00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:57.690
We gonna stay.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.190
DARA WILSON: Since we have
just a little bit of time

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:01.030
left, we're going to do
rapid fire with you.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:03.580
I'm going to ask you 10
either/or questions.

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:04.600
BRANDY: Oh, OK.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.010
DARA WILSON: They're here.

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:07.010
OK, you ready?

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:09.070
You got to answer as quickly
as possible.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:09.810
There's no pressure.

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:10.430
BRANDY: It's alreayd done.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:11.200
DARA WILSON: But it's
really important.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:11.670
BRANDY: Go ahead.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.190
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.500
LA--

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.030
BRANDY: LA.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.340
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:19.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:19.625
DARA WILSON: Truth or dare?

00:51:19.625 --> 00:51:20.170
BRANDY: Truth.

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:21.940
DARA WILSON: Early riser

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:22.800
BRANDY: Early riser.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.760
DARA WILSON: Lakers

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.640
BRANDY: Lakers.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.210

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:27.080
BRANDY: Girl, don't

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.350
They ain't doing well right
now, but you know.

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:31.810
Love you, Lakers.

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.080
DARA WILSON: Martin
or Fresh Prince?

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.060
BRANDY: Martin.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:34.830

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.046
BRANDY: I'm not a diamond girl,
but I like this one.

00:51:54.046 --> 00:51:54.542
DARA WILSON: OK.

00:51:54.542 --> 00:51:56.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:58.560
DARA WILSON: SWV or TLC?

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.050
BRANDY: Ooh, that's
a tough one.

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.155

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:05.730
OK, I agree with that one.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.580
BRANDY: Sorry to expand.

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:07.610
I know we supposed to be fast.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:08.450
Go ahead.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.780

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.800
DARA WILSON: Well, that's

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:06.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.540
DARA WILSON: We want to thank

connected to all of you guys.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.625

Y'all laughed at all my jokes.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.380

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.600
four seats.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.280
This makes sense.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.850
So check under you seat

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:05.940
of the lucky people.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.720
BRANDY: It ain't under
your seat.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.226
Don't even bother checking.

00:54:08.226 --> 00:54:09.172
