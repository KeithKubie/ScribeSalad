&gt;&gt; From the Library Of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.180
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree Bradley:
I'm Michelle Cadoree Bradley,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.640 position:56%
a research specialist in the Science
Technology and Business division

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.940
of the Library of Congress,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.730
and I'd like to welcome
you to today's program.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.890
Walking With the Last
Men on the Moon.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.070
Revisiting the Apollo
17 landing site,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.070
with the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.390 position:56%
Tomorrow, December 7th, is the 44th
anniversary of the Apollo 17 launch.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.750 position:56%
The last manned mission to the moon.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.310
Today, we will revisit the
landing site with our guide

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.900
from NASA, Dr. Noah Petro.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.790
He is a lunar geologist and
the deputy project scientist

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.240
for the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter, which launched in 2009.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.440
Dr. Petro became interested
in geology in high school.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.200
He has received a BS in
geology from Bates College

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.570
where he was introduced to the
field of planetary geology.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.300
He has a PhD in geological
sciences from Brown

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.340
and was a NASA Post Doc before
becoming a research scientist there

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.980
in 2009.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.220
I also understand that he has
a familial history with NASA,

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.150
which perhaps he will go into,
but if not, I encourage you

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.270
to review his NASA
scientist interview

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.100
which is available
from the NASA website.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.510
Please help me welcome Noah
Petro to the Library of Congress.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.040
[applause]

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.340
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Wow.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.640
Alright, well thank you very much
for that awesome introduction.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.330 position:56%
I'm really quite humbled to be here
today to talk to you about something

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.630
that I care deeply about.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.330
As mentioned, space
exploration is sort of in my DNA.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.140
My father, when he
graduated from college

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.120
in the early 1960's
immediately took a job working

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.870
for a contractor working for NASA
building parts for the Lunar Module

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.650
and for the backpack that the
astronauts wore when they were

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.950
on the surface of the moon.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.650
So for instance, in this picture
here of Jack Schmidt standing

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.810
on the Apollo 17 landing site,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.570
my dad built parts for
the backpack there.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.260
And actually, as a kid, that really
didn't resonate with me too much.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.530
I don't think most kids
really care all that much

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.980
about what their parents do, as
long as they're there to take them

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.870 position:56%
to baseball games or whatever it is.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.670
But we were at a museum, The Cradle
of Aviation Museum in Long Island

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.860
and he started, he never really
made a big deal about it,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.850 position:56%
we go to the air and space museum as
a kid of course and that was awesome

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.150
and we talked about Apollo.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.550
And hey, kid, people
went to the moon.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.850
And things like that.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.340
But then at the museum, he
said, oh you see this piece?

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.410
This was part of the backpack
and I helped build that.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.820
Wow! And you know, one
of the things that we did

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.120
and nobody knows this, he told me.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.330
And he pulled me aside and said,
see that piece of metal that sort

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.630
of holds the whole thing together,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.770
it doesn't really do anything
except hold the backpack together,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.620
the guts of the backpack together?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.040
Well, all of the engineers, when
we were finished building one,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.330
we take out the etcher, the metal
etcher, and sign our names on it.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.550
So at some point in the future,
although we know that each

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.820
of the Apollo landing sites
are preserved or intended

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.020
to be preserved, if someone
were to go and crack open one

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.860
of the twelve backpacks that are
left on the surface of the moon,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.780
there will be the scribble
that if you could decipher it,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.280
it would say Dennis Petro.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.590
So it is a proud heritage
of studying the moon

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.940
and revisiting some of the
work that he did in the 1960's

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.850
to help get the astronauts
to the moon.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.770
If you've ever seen the Apollo 13
movie, there's the famous scene

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.900
where the astronauts are trying
to take the round connector

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.200
and put it in the square hole.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.680
He built the round
oxygen exchange canister

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.980
that was in the lunar module.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.160 position:56%
So it's with a lot of gratitude
that I come to talk about Apollo 17.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.610
As mentioned, tomorrow
morning, the wee hours of 12:33

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.940
in the morning will be
the anniversary of launch

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.670
and really start the celebrations,
as limited as they may be,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.690
for the 45th anniversary
of the Apollo 17 landing

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.270
which will occur next year.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.530
Before I get started, though,
I want to take a moment to talk

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.430
about why I care about or why
I think I care about the moon.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.100
I got a colleague of mine, Jim
Zimmlin, who works at the Air

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.250
and Space Museum and the Center
of Earth and Planetary Studies,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.030
if you were to ask him this
question he would have a different

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.330
answer perhaps.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.260
So this reflects my thinking on
why we think the moon is important.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.910
And I'm talking about
my home team here.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.890
I was vested interest in the moon,
obviously, but I think of the moon

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.960
of the cornerstone of
understanding how planets work.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.150
We can learn about a lot
by studying the Earth.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.510
That's why we go out and
study lava flows in Hawaii.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.680
How do planets work?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.480
But the Earth is not the
best example of a planet.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.760 position:56%
We have our lovely atmosphere, we've
got water that erodes the surface.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.830
If you look at the other planets,
large objects in our solar system,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.380
outside on the table outside in
the hall, I encourage you to pick

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.980
up the information about the
new Verizon's mission which flew

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.220
by Pluto several months back.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.600
Those images of Pluto reveal a
world that's unlike anything,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.220
at least I expected.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.480 position:56%
But our understanding of the moon is
what helps us interpret the record

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.840 position:56%
of the surface of Pluto, of Mercury,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.770
ultimately of any object
in the solar system.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.850
My mind goes back to
understanding what's going

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.050
on on the lunar surface.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.650
Because the moon is
close to the Earth,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.190
it took the astronauts
three days to get there.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.510
It is a neighbor.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.330
I like to think of the moon
as sort of the Earth's attic.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.870
It's where the ancient record
of the inter-solar system,

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.070
our corner of the solar
system, is recorded.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.090
In the rocks on the
surface of the moon.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.740
And because we have the
six Apollo landing sites,

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.050
we have those successful missions

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.380
that brought rocks
back to the Earth.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.000
Those samples tell us
something very important

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.510
about how the moon evolved, and by
association we can use those rocks

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.070
to understand how the moon evolved
and how planets work in general.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.470
But one of the things that we get

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.300
from our mission that's
orbiting the moon right now,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.970
The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter,
is the context for those samples.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.350
A rock is a wonderful thing,
but a rock with context

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.910
where you know exactly where it
came from, where it's history is

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.880
that you can use to tell a story,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.180
tells a lot about how
a planet works.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.710
And so what I'm going to
talk about in the latter half

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.710
of my presentation, is the
context of some samples

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.590
that we got form Apollo 17

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.950
and how the new data we have helps
us better understand what those

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.250
rocks are telling us.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.360
We're here and building
a facility that's devoted

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.150
to the history of the written word.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.750
The rocks, I like to think of
rocks as kind of like little books.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.210
It's up to us to understand
what those books are telling us.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.250
A rock without context is like one
of the middle books of a volume.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.650
If you took book three
of Harry Potter,

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.080
well you don't know what
went on on either sides.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.010
But if you have context, the
full volume of an encyclopedia

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.340
or Harry Potter, you get a
better sense of the whole story.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.910
And so when we get the
context of these samples,

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.110
whether it's through the images
the Apollo astronauts took

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.890
or those images in the context of
the entire planet and the globe

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.260
of the moon, that tells us
something very important

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.290
about how the moon works.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.970
So that's my preamble about why
I think the moon is important.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.620
Hopefully, if you're
convinced, that's wonderful.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.430
If not, well let's at least enjoy
talking about some of the things

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.330
that I do on a daily basis.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.760
This is one of those awesome
external rocket camera footage

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.240
that we get from rocket launches.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.090
This was in the late
afternoon of June 18th, 2009.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:56.270
The launch of the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.710
This is in the pre
hi-def day, by the way.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.250
I sort of shutter to show this.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.220
But it is still pretty
spectacular, the launch of LRO.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.410
Now, LRO has been at the
moon for over seven years.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.830
That feels like it's gone
by pretty quickly to me.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.280
But the seven years that LRO has
been at the moon is important,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.780
and not just because that's seven
years of funding for someone

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.330
like me to work on the mission.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.160
But it's seven years of
studying the moon in a way

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.320
that we've never been
able to do before.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.430
Oftentimes, what we do in planetary
science is we go to a new object,

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.280
we go to Mars, we either fly by
it as we did in the case of Pluto

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.260
or we orbit it very shortly.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.470
What's happened at Mars with our
long duration of orbital missions

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.240
and indeed now what's
happening at the moon,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.830
is we're not measuring the moon

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.900
in ways we've never
been able to do before.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.300
We're actually able to
[inaudible] the changes that occur

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:44.600
on the surface of the moon.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.920
We're finding new impact craters

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.330
that have formed in
the last seven years.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.130
Now if you're like me, first
of all I apologize for that,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.700
but if you're like me you go to
Google Earth and maybe you look

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.490
at your neighborhood, and
you use the little slider

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.910 position:56%
to see what your neighborhood looked

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:59.500
like ten years ago,
twenty years ago.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.660
We can do that for
areas of the moon now.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.450
We can see images from eight years
ago, not eight, six years ago,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.860
and images taken yesterday
and compare them

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.460
and actually see changes
that are occurring

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.940
on the surface of the moon.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.410
Why is that important?

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.680
Well, before LRO we
had no idea the rate

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.340
at which the surface
of the moon changed.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.110
And as I said before,
our understanding

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.410
of the moon is what we use
to leverage our understanding

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.040
of all other objects
in the solar system.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.850
So when we learn that
the moon is dynamic,

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.930
it's changing at a very slow
rate but still changing,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.380 position:56%
that tells us something important
about what's happening on asteroids,

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.210
Mercury, throughout
the solar system.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.550
Indeed, one of the most
interesting implications relevant

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.400
to the Apollo landing sites
is those beautiful footprints.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.230
We're all familiar with
the image from Apollo 11

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.530
of Buzz Aldrin's boot print.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.020
And the thought for years was

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.920
that that boot print would be
visible for millions of years.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.240
It turns out that the rate
of change, the new impacts

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.390
and the turning of the surface of
the moon is happening much faster

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.690
than we expected and that boot
print may disappear in the scale

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.240
of 100,000 years, not
a million years.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.280
Now that may not seem all
that important but again,

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.370 position:56%
we are using the moon as a natural
laboratory to understand the process

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.770
that are affecting
all of the planets

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.190
in the solar system,
including the Earth.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.230
So LRO, and I'm going to
show a lot of pictures today.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.110
Because pictures are
worth 1,000 words

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.710
but LRO has many, many instruments.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.600
Seven instruments, in fact.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.990
When LRO was launched in
2009, there was a plan

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.620
that we would eventually
send humans and robots back

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.040
to the surface of the moon.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.910
And so we wanted a
Reconnaissance mission.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.040
A mission that would find the safe
and interesting landing sites.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.010
That would tell us where to go and
how to stay at the moon safely.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.660
And so these instruments were
selected to find safe places

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.470
to basically pave the way for
human exploration into deep space.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.840
They're also selected
to help us find places

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.430
where you might find water
or [inaudible] at the moon.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.660
One of the objectives was
originally to send humans

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.960
to the moon to live off the land.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.830
And one of the ways to do that
is to not have to bring all

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.490
of the water and oxygen with you.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.820
So we wanted to find places
where we could get water

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.580
from the lunar surface.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.320
And so we have instruments
ranging from a radiation detector

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.180
that measures how much radiation
damage a human might expect

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.430
when they're traveling to the moon.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:14.120
We have a thermal instrument that
measures the surface temperature

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.030 position:56%
of the moon, an instrument that will
measure reflected starlight that's

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.230
light not form our sun, but
light from all the other stars

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.420
in the galaxy that reflect
off the nice side off the moon

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.940
to suggest where water might be.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.890
We have a neutron detector that can
map out where hydrogen is present,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:32.590
commonly in the form
of oxygen or OOH.

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:36.740
We have a laser instrument that
measures the surface topography

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.320
of the moon with a precision
greater than any object

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.620
that we have in the solar system.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.370
We have the best topography, not
to sound like a future President.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.860
We have the best Topography
in the solar system

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.390
at the moon thanks to
the Lola instrument.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.180
The L Rock instrument, a camera

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:55.380
which is actually 3 different
cameras, has mapped the moon

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.330
at resolutions of approximately
fifty centimeters per pixel.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.470
We're going to see a lot
of those pictures today.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.570
And a radar instrument that allows
us to peer beneath the surface.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.310
Kind of 3D glasses, x-ray
glasses to see what's going

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.120
on in the first upper
meter or so of the surface.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.320
That gives us a sense of what's
happening to the lunar surface.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.510
Also, it's been used
to map out the presence

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.700
of ice deposits near
the lunar poles.

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.350 position:56%
So all of these instruments combined
gibe us this really incredible view

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.940
of the moon that we've
never had before.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.790
Because we've been to the moon,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.320
we went with the Apollo mission six
times, several times to lunar orbit

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.060
with Apollo, we have
a misguided sense

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.770
that we know everything
about the moon.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:39.080
And I think one of the things that
we're learning from LRO is a lot

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.580
of our presumptions about
the moon have been wrong,

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.430
or if nothing else, incorrect.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:49.350
Now just a few other moments of
promotion, I encourage everyone

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.410
if you haven't gone to the second
floor of the Air and Space Museum,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.930
there's an exhibit devoted to
the results coming back from LRO,

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.980
particularly from the camera.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.090
This is Mt. Marilyn and
again for those of you

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.070
who remember the Apollo 13 movie,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.100
Jim Lovell who had orbited the
moon previously on Apollo 8,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:09.220
named this mountain after his wife.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.840
So sometimes in the movie you'll
hear him talking about it.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.440
This is an LROC image again high
resolution, oblique out of the,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.940
I think of it as the window view
although we don't actually have

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.280
windows on the spacecraft, we
tilt the spacecraft to the side

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.810
to get an image like this.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.910
But there's an entire
gallery devoted to images

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.650
from the LROC instrument.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:32.150
The gallery will be open at least
through the end of this year,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.890
so you have at least one
more month but I've been told

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.050
that it's likely going to be there
into the early part of next year

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.860
until they find something
to replace it.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.350
It's definitely worth the visit.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:43.140
I would normally say
it's on the side

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.750
where the lunar module
was but that doesn't help.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.860
It's like getting directions
from someone in Maine.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.500
You go to where that
place used to be.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.040
It's on the McDonald's side
of the-- everybody knows that.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.320
It's on the McDonald's
side of the museum.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.830
The second floor.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.690
A few other just upcoming
events that we want

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.990
to make sure everyone is aware of.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.990
On August 21st, there will
be a total solar eclipse.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:06.500
The path of totality
crisscrosses the country going

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.800
from Oregon all the way

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.210
across through South
Carolina and out to sea.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:16.420
Even in D.C., we'll get a really
nice show of partially obscured sun

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.130
but we want to remind everyone
that the central player

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.030
in a solar eclipse is the moon.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.500
And again, because we have a
very accurate representation,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.450
we have an accurate dataset
of the topography of the moon,

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.740
we can actually predict with a
really high degree of accuracy,

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:34.520
the exact shape and path
of that eclipse that goes

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.770
across the central part
of the United States.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.990
In fact, we have an understanding
of the topography of the moon

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.830
to such a degree that the
uncertainty is down to

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.070
about a second or so of the
timing of the eclipse are not due

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.260
to any uncertainty of the
shape of the Earth or the moon,

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.180
it's actually uncertainty
to the shape of the sun.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.480
So basically, we can blame all
of our friends in helio-physics

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.500
for not standing up and getting
enough information to us.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:04.030
So that should be a really
great event next summer.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.510
October 28th of next year
also is another event

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.720
that the LRO mission
supports and that's going

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.210
to be International
Observe the Moon night.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.400 position:56%
If you go to observethemoonnight.org
you can learn more about that

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.490
but there are events all across the
world actually where we get people

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.920
out looking through
telescopes and thinking

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.890
and learning about the moon.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.940 position:56%
Ok, so Apollo 17 and 44 years later.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:28.180
So I would highly recommend
that everyone wake up,

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.820
when you turn your phone back off
of sleep mode, wake up at 12:33,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.630
go to the website, a
friend of mine Ben Feist

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.890
who is here today created
Apollo17.org

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.770
and at 12:33 the mission
will play out in real time

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:46.270
over the next ten days or
so, as the mission unravels.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.910
And it's a shameless plug.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.430 position:56%
There's no money gained from it,
it's just for the sake of knowledge.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.350
But Apollo 17, they saved
the best for last ultimately.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.340
It was the first night launch of
the Apollo mission was viewed up

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.700
and down the East coast
and really was the climax

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.350
of the entire space
program up to that point.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.120
You had the Mercury, Gemini, and
the preceding Apollo missions all

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.580
in my mind building
up to this moment,

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.380
where we could get astronauts to
go to the moon, live on the moon

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.860
for three days, work, drive a car,
commute, no traffic not like here.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:22.010 position:56%
But it also represents the last time

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.370
that humans traveled
into deep space.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.730
The astronauts were very fortunate.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.330
In August of 1972, some months
before a large solar flare passed

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.090
through the sun, passed
through the Earth moon system.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.800
Had astronauts been on
the moon at that time,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.310
there could have been potentially
serious medical effects to them.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.970
They dodged a solar
bullet, as it were.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:45.210
There are hazards to exploring deep
space and they were very fortunate.

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:50.450 position:56%
All of the Apollo astronauts were
very fortunate to make the roundtrip

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.070
as President Kennedy outlined.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.020
So for a little context of
what lunar expiration is like,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.280
this is a map put together
by the camera team.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.310
Normally I like to
wander towards the screen.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.610
I like to gravitate
towards the moon.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.250
I'm going to try to stay close to
the microphones for a moment here.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.550 position:56%
This is the hemisphere of the moon
that we're most familiar looking at.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:09.960
And actually, the image of the moon
here you see is stitched together

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.700
with hundreds of smaller images
to make this beautiful map

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.890
of the moon showing the relief of
the moon, the texture of the moon.

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.480 position:56%
Now in grain and barely visible here
are all of the Apollo landing sites.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.560
Apollo 17 is here, Apollo
11 landed to the South,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:30.160
12 and 14, 15, 16, 17 now.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.970
Just as a reminder,
there's an entire half

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.310
of the moon that's not shown here.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:40.190
An entire hemisphere that has
never been explored on the surface.

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.950
And as I very gingerly lean over
out in front here is a lithograph

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.580
of both the near and far side.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.290
I would encourage everyone
to grab a copy.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.400
I say that because there
is a whole half of the moon

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.700
that has not been explored.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.200
The surface area of the moon
is roughly the size of Africa.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.670
If I were to tell you that we've
been, I've been to Africa six times

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.110 position:56%
and I've seen everything, I've
learned everything there is to learn

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:04.880
about Africa, I'd be
laughed off the stage.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.880
We've been to the moon
six times with humans,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.690
we have three robotic
sample return missions sent

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.000
by the Soviets, all in a line here.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.540
And several other landers
all across the near side.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.010 position:56%
But again, there's an entire half
of the moon that remains unexplored.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.070
Just as a bit of a preview,
there's a feature I'm going

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.370
to be talking about
a little later on.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.080
The tycho crater here.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.590
This is a very bright feature
that's visible to the naked eye

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:32.420 position:56%
when the moon is full, but I do that
as a bit of a preview to call back.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:37.360 position:56%
The LROC team has an amazing website
with clickable, searchable images.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.660
I encourage you.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.330
There's a lot of wonderful
time-syncs,

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.430
real news that you can explore

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.430
by seeing what's going
on with the camera.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.170
It's amazing images that
the camera is returning.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.540
Ok. So again as a bit of context
for what's going on in 1972,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.220
and again because we're at
the Library of Congress,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.010
I hold up the Apollo 17
preliminary science report.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.510
Nice, light reading.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.740
This was drafted sort of
in the immediate aftermath.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.780
Each of the missions had a
preliminary science report.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.720
But what that served as the first
digestion of what we learned.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.170
It's really an impressive document

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.950
and I spend fafr too mich time
leafing through it because there's

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.240
so many wonderful nuggets.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.250
Now this is a bit of inside
baseball information here.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.690
I was not born in 1972, so
looking back at what was going

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.870
on really offers an insight
into what was happening

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.170
with science at the time.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:35.070 position:56%
And there's this quote that I pulled
from the preliminary science report

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.950
which sort of blew my mind.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.020
In the past decade, there
have been two revolutions

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.590
in planetary science studies.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.930
There has been a revolution
in new global tectonics,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.740
describing the motions of
continents and the generation

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.020
and destruction of the sea floor.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:51.190
That's right, I forgot--
1960's, this revolution.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:56.160
The theory of plate tectonics was
deposited and shown to be feasible.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.520
This is happening almost
contemporaneously

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.040
with the Apollo program.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.040
With our return of samples.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.100
And so the second half of this
quote, and it's investigations

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.090
of the origin, history,
and formation of the moon,

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.430
the Apollo program has led
to a-- and you can all read.

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.390
I'm just reading this because--

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.130
providing the first deep
understanding of a planet other

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.160
than the Earth through the
development of new techniques

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.860
of exploration, investigation,
and analysis.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.890
And through the integration
of scientific knowledge,

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:24.010
gained an interdisciplinary fields.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.280
And another really
important side effect benefit

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.680
from Apollo is the advancement
in analytical techniques

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.000
and also bringing in of
researchers into studying samples.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.510
Now I'm very fortunate to work
with a number of people who are

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.560
on the front lines
studying Apollo samples.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.330
And they're still active today.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:43.770
Fewer and fewer every year.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.140
Every year at our conferences,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.070
the old timer group is
getting a little bit smaller.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.480
Still as vocal as ever,
but smaller and smaller.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.110
But it was this period in time
where there was an advancement

00:20:55.110 --> 00:21:00.140
of scientific analysis
techniques of the instrumentation,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.130
partially because of the samples
coming back that we knew we needed

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.560
to study these samples to really
make the scientific investment

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.160
in Apollo worthwhile.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.450
So all of this revolution
[inaudible] the Earth is being

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.480 position:56%
accompanied by our understanding of
the moon and our sort of advancement

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.250
in exploration through the
rest of the solar system.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.780
Earlier, I mentioned that
Apollo 17 was the final mission.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.050
It was the last of what
we call the J missions.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.720
Heavy-duty scientific experiment
laden missions with the rovers.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.590
It had ten surface experiments
to take on the lunar surface.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.480
Ten were conducted in lunar orbit.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.530
This is a plot, again, from
the preliminary science report

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.680 position:56%
of basically the distance the Apollo
astronauts traversed while they were

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.980
on the surface.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.970
Apollo 11 didn't leave the
infield of the baseball diamond.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.270
They just got out and walked

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.460
around the immediate
vicinity of the lander.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.700
By the time Apollo 15, 16, and
17 came along with the rovers,

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:58.330 position:56%
they were driving over 20
kilometers across the lunar surface.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:03.160 position:56%
The massive of experiments that
were brought to the surface and left

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.950
on the surface was increasing.

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:10.100
The time outside of the lunar
module was now well over one day,

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:14.320
24 hours spent outside the
surface of the lunar module.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.840 position:56%
And of course, then the weight o the
samples brought back was increasing

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.030
dramatically across that time.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.000
Has anybody, how many people have
ever been to the British Museum

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.190
or have seen the Rosetta Stone?

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:29.310
Ok, the Rosetta Stone
is this iconic figure

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.900
in our understanding
of Ancient Egypt.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.420
And if you ever go
see the Rosetta Stone,

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:38.290 position:56%
it's this beautiful [inaudible] It's
a beautiful rock with all of the--

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.620
etchings and words
on it are nice too.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:42.570
But the rock itself is beautiful.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.990
The combined mass of
the samples brought back

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.100
by Apollo is almost exactly

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.640
to the kilogram half the
mass of the Rosetta Stone.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.300
Now, the mass of the
Rosetta Stone doesn't matter.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:56.030
It's what's written on that
one side that matters most.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.240
I think there's this
misinterpretation that,

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.190
oh there's truckloads of rocks
that came back from the moon.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.850
No, these are precious samples
and I've said this before:

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.420
putting those samples
into the context

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.510
of where they were collected,
what they tell us about not only

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:12.410 position:56%
that spot on the moon, that region,
but then by association that we have

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:13.730
with the data from orbit, the rest

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.900
of the moon is really,
really important.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.090
Now there's one other experiment,
and I put in quotes experiment,

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.740
that was brought to the
surface on Apollo 17.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.950
And as I was putting this talk
together I got maybe a little

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.120
carried away with this thought,
but there was one experiment

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.650
that was the culmination
of decades of development.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.490
And particularly the Mercury,
Gemini, and Apollo programs.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.730
And that experiment was in
the form of Dr. jack Schmidt.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.030
Harrison Schmidt.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.200
He was the first and thus
far only geologist to walk

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.750
on the surface of the moon.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.880
He was the last one to get
out of the lunar module,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.850
the twelfth to walk on the surface.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.420
He was in the first group of
scientist astronauts selected

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.680
by NASA in the mid 1960's,
and he had participated,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.420
once he was selected, he had
participated in the training

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.970
for prior missions and helped
in the analysis of samples

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.800
that were brought back, as well as
the other surface investigations.

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.190
So he was intimately aware of
what the prior missions had done,

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.450
their results, and what I
want to at least leave you

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.780
with here is the importance
of having, hopefully we'll be

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:18.240 position:56%
at a position in the not-too-distant
future we'll have astronauts going

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.400
to the surfaces of objects.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.110
Having a geologist,
a trained geologist,

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.490
part of that process
is very important.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:29.900
I know Jim has worked in the field
with several astronaut candidates,

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.860
has participated in some
events working with astronauts.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.230
The ideas of getting trained
scientists on the surfaces

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.930
of planets is very important.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.060
Because what they can do is not
only call upon their decades

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.510 position:56%
of experience in the field, but also
kind of put together a synthesis

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:48.890
of what the results of
that investigation are.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.140
We benefitted not only by
having Jack on the surface

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:55.650
of the moon then, but also now
44 years later working with him

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.220
to reanalyze what he did
on the surface of the moon

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.350
on those three days in 1972.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.750
And so one of the benefits

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.690
that I feel is happened strongly
today is not only he gets the right

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.260
samples but he's helped
us tell that story.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.290
Again, take those stories each rock
tells us and weave a narrative.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.380
A history behind those rocks.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.700
So let's go back to why
Apollo 17 was sent to the moon

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:23.080
and what its objectives were.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.230
Now Apollo 17 was being planned
in the early part of 1972.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.650
This was hot on the heels of
Apollo 15 but before Apollo 16,

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.710
and there were five
objectives laid out.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:37.030
This is defined by an August panel
of leaders saying that they wanted

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:38.480
to sample ancient lunar crust.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.870
As far from the Apollo 15
landing site as possible.

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:45.010 position:56%
When I showed you that map of Apollo
landing sites, they all cluster

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.280
in a region roughly
around the equator,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.490
but they are also very
close to one large feature.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:51.880
The imbrium basin.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.280
They wanted to get a landing site
as far from the imbrium basin

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.010
as safely possible so that
they could gather the diversity

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.490
of the lunar surface.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.720
They wanted to sample what they
thought were young volcanic rocks.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.960 position:56%
Most of the volcanic rocks that we
got back from the moon are the order

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.280
of three to four billion years old.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.460
And they wanted to try to get
rocks that were younger than that.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.980
Volcanic rocks that
were younger than that.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.960 position:56%
They wanted to get improved coverage
by the orbiting command module.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.230
The command module orbited sort
of in a roughly hula hoop band

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.290
around the surface of
the moon that passed

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.900
over each of the landing sites.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.570
They wanted to get coverage that
improved upon the prior missions.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:33.600 position:56%
They wanted to be able to deploy
geophysical elements on the surface,

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.310
but also in an area that
had some surface layers.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.210
They're looking for a
volcanically covered region

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:42.450
to measure the thickness
of those volcanic layers.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.310 position:56%
And then also deploy the experiments
that would then subsequently be left

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:49.330
on the surface of the moon
after the mission concluded.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.910
So the Apollo 17 landing site, and
there's my first typo of the day,

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.940
was selected on-- this
is not an Irish spelling.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.100
This was on February 11th, 1972.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.010
So just keep in mind,
so they have had,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.980
at this point they had essentially
one year or just under a year,

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.750 position:56%
ten months to plan the investigation

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.340
at the Taurus-Littrow
Valley for Apollo 17.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.190
So with these five goals and the
identification of a landing site,

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:20.640
specific traverses were identified
to address those five topics.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.600
And so using images that came
back from the Apollo 15 mission,

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.160
and these prior missions
all shouted for each other.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.670
They were all imaging potential
landing sites for future missions.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.590
Five different units,
five different areas

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.830
within the Taurus-Littrow
Valley here,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.040
five different units
were identified.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.370
It may be a little hard
to see in the screen here,

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:45.250
but there is this light
debris material,

00:27:45.250 --> 00:27:49.820
this light colored unit called
the light mantel deposit

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.330
that they wanted to sample.

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.890
There's the dark mantel deposit
and this is a larger unit

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.790
where the floor of the valley,
this dark floor of the valley,

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.140
appeared to have some
kind of covering.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.440
The craters that you see

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.680
on the surface all appear
to be somewhat degraded.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.050
You ever picture your lawn or
your front yard or some large area

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:14.480
on a snowy day everything, your
wall, gets a little bit subdued.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.440
So there was this hypothesis that
there was some covering material,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.500
something covering the
floor of the valley here

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.840
that they wanted to sample.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.220
They wanted to sample whatever
was below that, the subfloor.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.410
They also wanted to get
material from this unit here.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.400 position:56%
This is called the sculptured hills.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.750
This has a slightly
different texture.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:37.020
To use a very technical term,
lumpy, compared to these mountains

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.540
to the North and South of the
valley that appear to be--

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.890
to use another technical
term-- mountain like.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.860
There are these little knobs
in the sculptured hills

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.190
where the [inaudible] appear
to be one large, coherent unit.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.790
So with the identification of
these five different units,

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.800
traverses were identified based
on the optimal landing site

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.620
in the middle of the valley
where the astronauts could drive

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.330
around the valley to sample
these different materials.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.660
Just as a point of comparison, talk
about the Taurus-Littrow Valley

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:10.570
and a little bit of scale, this
is the Grand Canyon on the Earth.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:14.470
This is, again, using that
amazing tool Google Earth,

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.820
and this is a transect
through the Grand Canyon.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.370
So this is about 30
kilometers from end to end.

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:25.560
Covers about a kilometer and a
half, 1.8 kilometers of relief.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.650
For comparison, this is
the Taurus-Littrow Valley,

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.210
same 3 thirty kilometers across.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:34.040
This is two and a half, 2.3
kilometers of elevation change.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.970
So this is another important
thing to consider here.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.910
With the first Apollo
landing, Apollo 11,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.550 position:56%
they landed in what they thought was
the smoothest safest landing site,

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:45.590
as far from hazards as they could.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.530
And of course when they
tried to land on Apollo 11,

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.200
they were headed right
for a boulder field.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.120
And so Neil Armstrong had to
steer the lunar module away

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.180
from those boulders.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.910
Just four years later,
they were able to land

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.750
in a valley deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:04.610
That's an incredible
advancement in a very short order,

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:09.620
going from finding the safest
landing site to landing in a valley

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.960
where you have towering
mountains on either side of you.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.320
That was quite the accomplishment.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.400 position:56%
Ok, so let's now look after mission.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.910
How did the-- let's
give the astronauts,

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.530
let's give the Apollo
17 crew an evaluation.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.880
How did they do?

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.290 position:56%
So, for those pre-flight objectives,
they were indeed able to go

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:36.140
and sample this light mantel
deposit, this debris flow.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.590
And an interpretation
was made from--

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:43.280
an interpretation from the origin
of this debris flow was made

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.290
that material from
that tycho crater,

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:47.090 position:56%
and I showed you that image earlier.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:49.700
Tycho crater is located
over 1,000 kilometers away

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.500
from the Apollo 17 landing site.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.980
That objected material shot
out of that crater, landed,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:01.060 position:56%
hit the top of the South [inaudible]
and triggered a landslide.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.830
So the interpretation was that the
astronauts sampled this material

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:08.410
that was estimated to be
about 100 million years old,

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:13.180
was caused by the formation of
that crater, 1,000 kilometers away.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.270
And so this is one of the
beauties of lunar science is

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:21.080
that you can have an event 1,000
kilometers away trigger a landslide

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.920
here, and we can go and
sample that landslide

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.710
and get the age of that crater.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.010
So that's handy.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:28.840
And as a reminder, geologists
are very interested in organiza--

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.310
if you ever come to my
office, you may not think

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.300
that geologists are
interested in organizing things,

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.530
but indeed we like putting events
into some sort of sequence.

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:41.310
And so getting the ages of
events is very important.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.000
So an interpretation was made
that the samples collected

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.380 position:56%
from this debris flow were triggered

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.470
by that impact 100
million years ago.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.890
The second objective was
to sample the dark mantel,

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.720
and that proved to be difficult.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.960
And again, in this
preliminary science report,

00:31:55.960 --> 00:32:01.380
interpretation was made that that
origin of that dark mantel deposit,

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.190
the subdued texture of the
surface, remains one of the enigmas

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.490
of the Apollo 17 missions.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:10.010
So we can't necessarily say
that that was addressed.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.580
Now, they did however
sample much of the subfloor.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.490
This volcanic fill that flowed
in and filled the valley.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:19.690 position:56%
They sampled that quite extensively.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:22.210
The fourth objective of
sampling the sculptured hills,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.890
now one of the last stations
on Apollo 17, station 8 here,

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.650 position:56%
which the primary objective of which
was to sample the sculptured hills.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.140
But at the time it
remained uncertain.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.680
And no more is known about
the sculptured hills unit

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.100
than it is indeed different.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.150
It looks different than the
[inaudible] to the North and South.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:40.940
And so this remained an
open question of whether

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.610
or not any material from the
sculptured hills were ever sampled.

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.420
And lastly, the [inaudible] and
those were sampled very well.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.210 position:56%
And as I'll show in a moment,
several stations were along the base

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.960
of the [inaudible] Of course they
could not drive up the [inaudible]

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.580
but instead of having to go get
the rocks, the rocks came to them.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.180
Several boulders were
observed to have rolled

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.650
down the hills well
before the mission.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.490
These were boulders that were
seen in preflight images.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.190
And so they drove to the
boulders knowing that they came

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:12.490
from somewhere up the mountain.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.630
And so those were sampled
quite well.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:20.290
So Now, this is the
Apollo 17 landing site.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:24.000
The Taurus-Littrow Valley as
imaged by the camera on LRO.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.420
Again, so this is an image
from 1972, here it is today.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.790
Looks the same.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.650
Again, those changes that
are occurring on the surface

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:37.190 position:56%
of the moon are occurring at smaller
scales than what we can see even

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.620
in this particular image here.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.340
Apollo 17 landing site is
marked very small right here.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.620
Right in the middle, essentially,
of the valley, giving easy access

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.920
to these units that
they wanted to sample.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.620
In addition to wanting
to put things in order,

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.020
geologists like naming things, so
these were all craters and features

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.090
that were named by the crew
to help in communications,

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.890
and then in yellow is the
traverses that they took.

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.090
Over 20 kilometers of traverses,

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:08.100
starting with the very first
traverse on day one, traverse two,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.610
and finally, traverse three.

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:14.350 position:56%
So let's sort of retrace their
steps a little bit and evaluate some

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.880
of the open questions that
they left that still remain--

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.270 position:56%
well, remain unanswered until today.

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:25.800
But for a bit of context,
just to help drive everybody,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.020
this is the traverse in the
context of D.C., so we're sitting

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:31.620
in a building right over here.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.850 position:56%
A colleague of mine, Brent Gary, who
works at Goddard and is a colleague

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:39.340
of Jim's back here, made
this really helpful map.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.760
If you put the landing site right
on top of the Smithsonian Metro

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:47.510
which on a normal day
isn't that easy to get to,

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.670
but landing a lunar module
on it might be the best way.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:56.300
They were able to cover quite a
bit of distance getting not only

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.220
on day one close to Nats Park
but not all the way there.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.470
But day two going well
into Arlington,

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:07.350
and day three up into Northeast
D.C. Somewhere in here is a joke

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.360
about either the metro
or local traffic

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.000
but I'm not quite sure
how best to make that.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.060
Fortunately, they didn't
have to contend with traffic.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.360
But this does give you a sense.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.660
That they were able with the rover

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.970
to cover quite a good
amount of distance.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.380
So that landing site, so here's
the Smithsonian Metro Station,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.780
this is an image from the camera
and all of these black streaks

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.750
on here are traces of their
boot prints or in some cases,

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:33.160
and if you get real close, and
normally I'd say [inaudible]

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.790
and take a look, you can
actually see two parallel lines.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.530
Those are the tracks of the rover.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:42.680
The wheel tracks still
there 44 years later.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.690
The next slide is actually
going to be a series of images.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:51.130
Pretty much every time the
spacecraft passes over any

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:53.610
of the Apollo landing sites,
we take an image of it.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:58.130
And so what I'm going to show here
is a series of eighteen images.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.380
We passed over the site
more than eighteen times,

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:05.120
but eighteen illuminated times--
showing basically the landing site

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.420
as a function of solar angle.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.720
Basically time of day.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.020
From morning to nighttime.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.640
And it's going to loop and will
let me talk a little bit about some

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.610
of the things that we can see.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:14.970
Good, it works.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:19.400
Ok, so at center here is the
descent stage, the bottom half

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.530
of the lunar module sitting
on the surface today.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.690
There's the shadows creeping along.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.990
This black spot here is the
lunar rover which is parked

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:32.310
at the culmination of the EVA's
sitting on the surface there.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.540
And the west is the [inaudible]
station, scientific experiments

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.210
that were set up and left
operating for about five years

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:46.390
until they were shut off in
September of 1977 prematurely.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:50.370
So you can very accurately retrace
the steps the astronauts took.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:54.130
There was an experiment that
was set up here as well,

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:57.730
so we can literally follow the
footsteps of the Apollo astronauts.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.860 position:56%
There's one other feature that moves
around here that you might follow.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.580
I'll take the laser pointer
off, you'll see a spot moving,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.470
a shadow moving across the surface.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.730
Anybody want to venture a
guess at what that shadow is?

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.390
Jim, you can't answer that.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.690
Ben, you can't either.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.050
You know the answer.

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.430 position:56%
Yes. So one of the great mysteries--

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:22.450
mystery in the sense
of what will we find,

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:27.440
and one of the great questions, is
will we see evidence of the flags

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.270
at the Apollo landing sites?

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.110
We know that the Apollo 11 flag was
knocked over when they lifted off.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:36.360
There's footage of that from the
lunar module as they lifted off,

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.660
the flag got knocked over.

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.890
12's flag never deployed properly.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.870
There's a rod that hangs
it out so it stands

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.060
out at attention beautifully.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:48.580
But there was a question of whether
or not we would see anything.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.890
Now if you ask me, before the
mission I would have said no.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.880
there's no chance that
the flags are still there.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.270
This flag is probably as
well if not better designed

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.590
than the flags that
are brought there.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:02.410
They were off the shelf, not quite
go down to the local hardware store

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:05.520
but essentially had an
objective of lasting three days

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.230
on the moon and that was it.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.880
Well, we get these pictures
back and there's only one thing

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.210
that can cast a shadow like that
and some of the images taken

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:16.960 position:56%
of other landing sites, you can see.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.920 position:56%
I'm sure the flag has been bleached.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.850
You leave a colored shirt
out in the sun too long

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.780
over the summer it
will bleach white.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.700
I'm sure that any color that were
on the flags were bleached away

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.980
but nope, they flags
are still standing.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:32.500
Ok, yeah that's a good question.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.920
So this is about 100
meters right here.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.770
So a football field.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.050
This lunar module, and I
would encourage everyone to go

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:44.880
over to the Smithsonian to
see an actual lunar module.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.310
Well not one that flew, of
course, but a lunar module.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:52.140
So this covers about, all
told, about 400 meters across.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.870
This flag was put about
twenty meters

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.650
to the north of the lunar module.

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.110
They learned from Apollo 11
that having it too close meant

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.940
that it got blown over when they
launched and so no one wanted

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.310
to knock over the American
flag a second time

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.140
on the surface of the moon.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:13.330
So if nothing else,
that was kind of cool.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:17.210
As a quick aside, there's a
letter in the NASA archives

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:21.940
at NASA headquarters of someone
violently complaining as a lot

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.730
of people tend to do, of
the waste of sending flags

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.740
and why would we spend
the extra money,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.230
and some very dutiful NASA civil
servant wrote back saying well,

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:32.920
here's a copy of the
receipt for those flags.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.590
It was like five bucks.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.240
It was a lot of talk
about investment

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:42.070
and so this is not a huge
expenditure of resources

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.730
to get flags to the moon.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.100
Ok. This is a fly through
that the camera team produced

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.930
to just highlight some
more of the hardware.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:56.800
I think, ok so here's the
descent stage of Challenger.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.000
You can still see the footpaths.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.370
This is where the ladder
where the astronauts exited

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.980
and entered the spacecraft.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.800
There's your flag still
standing on the surface.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:12.120
The experiment packages that was
called the [inaudible] deployed

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.200
on the surface.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.910
There was over ten experiments
that were brought to the surface

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:23.820
that were designed to last upwards
of twenty years but we're going

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.590
to shut off after five years.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:29.910 position:56%
Over to the east of the landing site
is the surface electrical properties

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:35.810
experiment and then to the
South is the lunar rover.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:40.240
There is a documentary put together
by CNN called the last steps

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.240
that should be aired
sometime this week.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.270
It's available online if
you Google The Last Steps.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:50.070 position:56%
But some of the footage that's
impressive, especially of the ascent

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:52.140
when the lunar module took off.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.700
Let me go back one moment.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.570 position:56%
Camera mounted on the lunar rover
actually shows the astronauts taking

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.160
off from the surface and
then pans back around.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.660
And you can see the orientation
of the flag as it was then

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.000
and you know, that
was the last time.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.900
December 1972, that
humans ever touched space.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.680
And it really hasn't
changed at all since then.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.770
Ok, so now I'm going
to revisit in the time

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:23.670 position:56%
that I have left three questios that
we've been able to address using LRO

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:31.050
and modern data in a peper
that-- and this is #HumbleBrag.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:34.220
Jack Schmidt was interested in
looking at what data we have

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:37.610
for Apollo 17 and so he put
together with the help of myself

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:45.030
and several other people, a
paper not quite as thick as this.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:46.390
It feels like it's
that thick, though.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:50.600
A really deep investigation
into the Apollo 17 landing site

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.120
with modern data.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.520
And so we're going to
address these three questions.

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.880
What is the origin of
that light mantel deposit?

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.180
Where was this sample?

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.480
Sample 70019.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.780
Where was that collected?

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.320
And there's an interesting
backstory to that.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.170
And was sculptured hills material
sampled during the mission?

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.670
So let's talk about the
light mantel deposit.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:17.410
So this is a very quickly sped up
video produced that Ben has posted

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:22.440
to his website, apollo17.org, that
allows us to follow the astronauts

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.810
as they begin traverse two.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:28.380
EVA two. Starting at the lunar
module and driving all the way

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.200
down to the South maseef.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.920 position:56%
This is easily about five kilometers
of driving that they had to do

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.700
to get there, over
quite a long time.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:42.450
Stopping several times not for rest
breaks, but to sample the surface.

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:48.030
As they got to the base
of the south maseef here,

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.530
they actually had to
drive up this ridge.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:55.010
This is a tectonic feature called
a wrinkle ridge where two parts

00:42:55.010 --> 00:43:00.010
of the lunar crusts essentially
collided and one went on top

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.170
of the floor here,
creating this ridge.

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:07.640
So this second traverse, this
EVA two, was designed partially

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:12.020
to collect material of
this light mantel deposit.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:20.990
As I said before, the assumption
was that the light mantel deposit

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.520
in Apollo 17 is here,
came from tycho crater.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.650
And you can see the
beautiful streaks

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.940
of material coming
out of tycho crater.

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:31.440
The thought was that some
material was ejected,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.700
impacted the south maseef
and caused this avalanche.

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.370
So this is an image from
the LRO camera taken

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.600
when the sun is very high in the
sky as you saw in that animation

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.690
of the Apollo 17 landing site that
depending on what angle the sun is

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.270
with the sky, you can
make out different things.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:50.290
When the sun is low in the
ground, you can see boulders,

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.170
craters, surfaces, very well.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.680
When the sun is high in the sky,

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.610
seeing those features
becomes very difficult

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:58.920
but you can see differences
in color very clearly.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:06.020
The bright tracks, the bright
lander, the dark rocks beneath.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.320
Here is this debris flow.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.240
And something that came out
to us in this investigation is

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:15.690
that it appears that there's
a darker debris flow here

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:17.610
and a lighter debris flow here.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:21.010
Now it's very possible that this
lighter debris flow covers this

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.680
darker unit here, but it's
apparent to use that instead

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.630
of one massive landslide
coming off the South maseef,

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.330
it appears that there are two.

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:35.020
The darker one in the subsequent
unit, this lighter one here.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.620
And so what this tells us is

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.640
that perhaps this debris flow
represents multiple events

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.550
and not one single triggering
event such as the placement

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.950
of ejector from tycho crater.

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:50.790
Just as a slightly different
perspective, this is again one

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.160
of the out the window views.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.460
These oblique's.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.670
Again, taken from somewhat high
sun so you can see the differences

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:59.330
in the original image, anyway,
you can see the differences

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.180
of the younger flow
and this older flow.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.930
Here's their landing site here.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:08.940
And so what this potentially tells
us, and this is at high sun here

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.050
and so that becomes very apparent,
or at least becomes apparent

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.050
that there are these
two debris flows,

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:19.370
is that perhaps there's multiple
events triggering these avalanches

00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:20.910
on the lunar surface.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.360
So that sort of gave
us one of those moments

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:26.440
when we think what have we done?

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.740
Are we wrong?

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.610
What could cause these avalanches.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:34.320 position:56%
I pointed out moments ago that there
are indeed those tectonic features,

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.390
those scarps.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:40.110
This is this data from
our radar instrument.

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.260 position:56%
And again, the radar instrument lets
us look slightly below the surface.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.120
Deeper into the surface.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:51.050
Here is that fault, that scarp,
it's called the Lee-Lincoln scarp.

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.080
The valley here is seven kilometers
wide and you can barely make

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.720
out here the outline of at
least the younger debris flow.

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.690
But it looks like there may
actually be a second fault

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:07.330
that goes along near the
older landslide as well.

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.550
So our conclusion, at least at this
point, and it's explained much more

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:16.610
in the paper, is that instead
of having to rely on objector

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.770
from a crater 1,000 kilometers
away, these landslides

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:21.070
that were sampled very well

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.250
by the Apollo 17 mission may
actually even be triggered

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:25.210
by a much more localized event.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:30.560
Indeed, moonquakes forming
these tectonic features.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.720
And so that's sort of a
big shift in understanding.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:41.600
We've used that age of tycho
for samples now for 44-45 years.

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.040
Turns out that tycho is probably
still very young but we may have

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.500
to remove tycho from one of
those features on the moon

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.600
that we know it's precise age.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.910
Something that we do know
precisely well is now the origin

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:55.210
of this sample.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:57.460
Sample 70019.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.760
This is sampled by Jack
near the lunar module

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.480
at the culmination
of his second EVA.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.760
Let me pull the curtain
back a little bit.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.460
I was making this slide
and I was thinking oh,

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.550
how am I going to explain
this sample?

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:13.850
I could get into some

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:17.840
of the technical details
but I don't have to.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:21.460
I'm going to let Jack explain
a little bit about what he did.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.760
And so--

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.230
&gt;&gt; Hey Bob?

00:47:28.230 --> 00:48:12.050
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.500
&gt;&gt; I cheated on you.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.800
&gt;&gt; I was sure you would.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.100
What'd you do?

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:23.510
&gt;&gt; I just sampled a glass
from the bottom of a crater.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:29.700
I documented it by shooting the
limb across the crater [inaudible]

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:33.770
and it's eleven feet and in
that prospect it's seven.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:35.070
And then I sampled it.

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:36.370
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.670
&gt;&gt; It's very fragile.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:38.970
That's right.

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:40.790 position:56%
Very fragile and I double back and I
don't know if we can keep it or not.

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:43.810
We need to think about
how to preserve it.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.110
&gt;&gt; Ok.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.230
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: So this
is from Apollo17.org.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:50.370
Again, it's you'll spend the
rest of your day at this website.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:52.080
I've had, well that's Jack
describing sampling this rock

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.550
from the floor of this crater.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:57.310
Now because of his
experience in prior missions,

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:01.160
he knew that young craters
would have glass covered floors.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.810
And his thought was that if we
could sample a rock from the floor

00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:08.560
of this crater, one of these
craters that's very young

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.280
that hasn't been disturbed,
we may be able

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:13.920
to measure the magnetic field
of the moon in those samples

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.750
because theoretically, those
fragments, those rocks on the floor

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.520
of the crater haven't
been disturbed,

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.560
haven't moved since
the crater formed.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.530
So if you know exactly the
orientation of the sample

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:27.830
as it was the moment
the crater formed

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:30.570
and then a million years later
when he came along and sampled it

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:33.430
and put it in the lab, he put it
exactly in the same orientation,

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.960
you could measure any
paleo old magnetic field.

00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.160
So he went through some
painstaking efforts not only

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.460
to find the right crater,
to sample it,

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:41.760
and bring it back and preserve it.

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.060
And he did that.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.790
It was brought back, analyzed,
but essentially largely forgotten.

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:47.520
He went off on a world tour, he
went back and analyzed the samples,

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.930
but never really revisited
the sample and never did

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:50.760
that really detailed documentation
of trying to reposition exactly

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.060
where that sample came from.

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.360
So one of the coauthors

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.660
of this paper took it
upon himself to do that.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.960
Now this is that first
image he describes taking

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.260
where he knows he has the
lunar module precisely located

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.560
in the image, the sample
came from right here.

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.860
And then using basically some very
simple reconstruction techniques we

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.160
can identify features in the image.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.990
And this is a blow up
of this image here.

00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.970
It's hard to see, but basically
it's a before and after

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:09.140
that lets us show exactly
where that sample came form

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.880
in the floor of this crater.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.180
Now tying these features, we've
got the lunar module, these craters

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:16.480 position:56%
and boulders sitting on the surface.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:20.030
There's the tracks of the
rover in the image there.

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.320
This is the LROC image.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.040
There's the lunar module.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.770
There's feature A, B, C, and
D. We can precisely locate,

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:34.250
just using trigonometry
that I thought

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.820 position:56%
in high school I'd never need to use
again, and find exactly where he was

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.610
on the surface when he
sampled that crater and exactly

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:43.910
which crater that came from.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:46.620
It was never determined exactly,
there's a lot of craters.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.550
But we were able to say exactly
where that sample came from

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:54.430
and now a series of at least
proposals are under way to try

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.960
and get the money to be
able to analyze that sample

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.650
in the way that Jack saw fit.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:02.660
It's very elegant, very simple,

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.670
but essentially allows
us to precisely know.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:07.700
And actually an important thing
I mentioned, the topography

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.390
of the moon being as
well understood as it is:

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:14.060
we now know where features
are on the lunar surface.

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.860
Especially around the lunar
modules, within centimeters.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.960
Further away from the lunar
modules, a few meters.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.930 position:56%
But we have a precise, genetic grid.

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:25.570
We know where features are on
the lunar surface to a degree

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:27.020
that we've really never known

00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:30.150
for any planetary body
apart from the Earth before.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:34.270
And the last point I wanted to make
is about these sculptured hills.

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:38.040
This is, again, out of
an airplane window view.

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.430 position:56%
Here is the North and south maseefs,
here's that Lee-Lincoln scarp,

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.630
the landslide, there's
where they landed.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.060
And this is the sculptured hills.

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.490
And perhaps you can start bleeding
when you see this knobby texture

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:53.170
versus this more coherent texture,

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:56.150
and you can pair the sculptured
hills to the South maseef.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:03.240
And so the third and final
EVA went to the North and East

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.590
up along the base of
the North maseef,

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:09.570
two stations where large boulders
were identified and finally

00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:12.310
to the bottom of the sculptured
hills to sample that material

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:16.540
at station eight and then
finally make their way back

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.270
to the lunar module.

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:22.530
Jack, my coauthor for the talk,

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.510
described a little bit
about what they did.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:54:00.420
[inaudible]

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: So there's Jack who's
scampered, almost the right word,

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:10.260
up 30 meters uphill, not easy, to
get this one rock of the whole area

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:11.760
that he sees that's unusual.

00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:15.660
And what you hear him do
is just the best example

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:17.090
of field geology on the moon.

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:20.290
He's telling Gene, all these
rocks around here are the same.

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.590
Get one of these things.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:22.890
Not going to worry about it,

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:27.220
but that rock up the hill
there, that's what I want.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.530
&gt;&gt; A minute to make up some

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:30.580
of this time we've spent
at station 6 and 7--

00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:31.880
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Oh come on.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:35.850
Come on. Mute.

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.790
Ha ha. Awesome field geology,

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.690
this field site happens
to be on the moon.

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:41.320
He's telling Gene, get
one of these samples.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:42.620 position:56%
I'm going to go up and get that one.

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.110
That's unusual, that doesn't
look like these other things.

00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:46.410
That's what we want to get.

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.490 position:56%
He goes up, he documents it, images
it, then he starts trying to kick it

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.410
to roll it downhill and
it goes down a little bit.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:54.650
Because he knew that that
was the unusual sample

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.640
and potentially would be
from the sculptured hills.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.240
But as I showed in that
documentation and really

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:02.820
for decades, it was never thought
we were able to get materials

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:04.120
from the sculptured hills.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.560
That rock that Jack is
doing an excellent job

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:11.070
of documenting, was unusual.

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:14.260
It was unlike other sample--
let me go forward one.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:16.600
It was unlike-- I could
play that video.

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.110
It's just so awesome.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:21.370
Unlike other samples, there was
no visible [inaudible] In fact

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:24.800
if I had let Jack talk more which
I probably should have done,

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.100
he says there's no boulder.

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.620
We don't know where it came from.

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:29.230
That boulder was unlike any

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:31.860
of the other boulders they
samples over at station 6 or 7.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.140
This is an LROC view
of these boulders.

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.440
Here's the close up view.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.890
They went here and sampled this
and you can see the little trail

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:39.870
of the boulder which
goes up the mountain.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.610
Station seven boulder.

00:55:41.610 --> 00:55:44.100
They actually didn't see the
boulder trail when they were

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:47.740 position:56%
on the surface here, only with these
images are we able to see oh yes,

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.400
station seven boulder came
from further up the hill.

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.130
So that's one other area where
the new data has really helped

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:55.430
in the analysis.

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:59.360
But the boulder from
station eight had no context.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.180
And I said before, context is king.

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:03.270
But we pulled in another data set.

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:07.060
A compositional data set that came
from a mission just before LRO.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:09.380
An Indian mission that
had on it an instrument

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.680
that I was fortunate
enough to work on.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.770
The Moon Minerology Mapper.

00:56:12.770 --> 00:56:14.730
And this psychedelic

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.700
on the right-hand side here
is basically a color map--

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.420
a compositional map.

00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.170
And colors indicate variations

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:24.880
in composition, specifically
minerology.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.660
And in the North massif which
is here, basically we see apart

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.630
from a few examples, it's largely
[inaudible] which is the kind

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:38.690
of average composition of the
lunar surface, of the lunar crust.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:43.020
The sculptured hills is a
much more polka dot pattern

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:44.320
of different colors, suggesting

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.440
that it's much more compositionally
diverse and indeed, the composition

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.830
of that boulder that was
sampled at station eight,

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:53.420
matches almost identically the
composition that we can infer

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:57.840
of the uphill portion
of that mountain.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:03.590 position:56%
So that tells us that indeed, it
did sample sculptured hills material

00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.720
and has led to a whole
different understanding

00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.110
of what this material represents.

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.910
Our current hypothesis is that,
remember I mentioned earlier

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:13.820
that they wanted to go as far from
the embrium basin as possible?

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:16.370
It turns out that there's a chance

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.870
that this material is actually
objected from that large basin.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.900
Maybe we didn't get ejecta from
tycho but we may have gotten ejecta

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:25.620
from the embrium basin in the
form of the sculptured hills.

00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:30.010
And this material will be very
deep material ejected by that basin

00:57:30.010 --> 00:57:35.220
over about a thousand kilometers
from the Apollo 17 landing site

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:38.360
and brought here about
3.8 billion years ago.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.320
So it turns out that, again,

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.030
some of this new data tells
us as much as they thought.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:46.870
Maybe they weren't able to
sample the sculptured hills.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:48.310
By golly, they did.

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:52.860
And again, you saw that example of
Jack doing what geologists do best

00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:57.570
which is observe, classify very
quickly, and find the outlier.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:57:59.880
The geologist, you always want
to hang out with the geologist.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.860
They're going to find the best
restaurant that nobody goes to

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.290
or the best bar that nobody goes
to because there's one thing

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:08.450
that geologists don't like
to do is wait in line.

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:10.320
So new light on the
Taurus-Littrow Valley

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.850
and the Apollo 17 landing site.

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:16.020
One, it appears that tycho may
not have caused that avalanche.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:18.820
That we may actually not have
an accurately aged the tycho

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.120
crater event.

00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.130
We have located the exact
source and orientation

00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:26.460
of this precious sample, 70019.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.530
And that indeed the sculptured
hills were sampled at station eight

00:58:29.530 --> 00:58:32.790
in the form of that
boulder which suggests

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:37.890
that the sculptured hills have a
very complex and convoluted origin

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:41.060
that involved a basin
1,000 kilometers away.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.650
Ok, so Apollo 17.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:46.200
Still crazy after all these years.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.900
I'm going to elave you
with just a few thoughts.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.080
We have a lot left to
learn about the moon.

00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:53.490
We have not, in any
way, closed the book

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:55.370
on our understanding of the moon.

00:58:55.370 --> 00:59:00.010
We have many future missions
that we'd like to explore.

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:03.780
I'm involved with a group that's
proposing or will propose a mission

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.430
to sample from the
far side of the moon.

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:09.320
We have a successful current
mission at the moon that's healthy

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.200 position:56%
and happy, and of course we have
the wealth of past missions: robotic

00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.060
and human, that we're
still learning from.

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:18.290 position:56%
Apollo has left an incredible legacy

00:59:18.290 --> 00:59:21.480
that we are still unraveling
and understanding.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:25.550
As much as these are events that
happened 44 and more years ago,

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:27.980
they're still as relevant
today and still as important

00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:29.740
to our understanding of the moon.

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:32.950
And this is perhaps masybe
the least important statement

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:36.180
but maybe also the most important
statement that I'll make today,

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.240
is the solar system is amazing.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.660
All of the planets tell us
something about how planets

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.350
in our solar system
and indeed in all

00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:45.850
of the other solar
systems in the galaxy work.

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.470
And the moon is one of
our best opportunities

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:53.150
to understand the processes that
shape all these solid bodies.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:56.400
With that, I'll thank you for
your time and your attention.

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.700
Two minutes over.

00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.000
Not bad for me.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.510
And thank you for your time today.

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:10.060
[applause]

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.360
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree Bradley:
Please, if you'd like to start

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.180
with any questions and we
see a number of hands raised.

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.510
So why don't we go
from bottom to top.

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:33.030
[inaudible]

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:38.060
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: So Apollo, so yes,
the question was Apollo's 18, 19,

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.080
and 20 were originally missions
that were going to happen.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.360
Actually Jack Schmidt was going
to be the lunar module pilot

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.550
on Apollo 18 and got bumped up
to 17 when 18 was cancelled.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:52.510
And so the question, if I hear
you correctly, is the equipment

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:55.130
that was built for those three
missions still usable-- oh.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.430
&gt;&gt; Not equipment.

01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:05.390
Whatever the mission you're looking
for geologically on the moon,

01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:12.160
are those missions that cannot
be fulfilled in the 18, 19,

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.530
going to replicated in some fashion
with what you're doing now or?

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:17.830
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Ok, yes,.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:23.970
So basically the landing sites or
the objectives of those missions,

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:25.810
are those still viable today?

01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:27.550
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:35.210
Apollo, and those missions were
cancelled early enough along

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:41.300
that they didn't get into
the incredibly detailed ok,

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:49.380 position:56%
we're going to land here and sample
these places and there were a number

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:55.820
of possible landing sites that
were identified for those missions.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:01.640 position:56%
I'd say the story has almost gotten
more complicated because now we know

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.760
that there are many more
places we'd want to go.

01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:09.720
But certainly those landing sites

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:13.530
which would've been a Copernicus
crater, there are several lava

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:16.750
or magnetic features or volcanic
features that were identified.

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.460
There are amongst many
possible future landing sites.

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:20.960
The geologists are
also sometimes greedy.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.430
We don't want to just go back--

01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:25.590
I mean, if we could go back to
one spot that would be great.

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:29.180
But you know, one place isn't
going to answer all the questions.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:33.070
So, but certainly the work
that was done then is relevant.

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:42.130 position:56%
It's actually one of the things in
my limited amount of time in working

01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:49.470
for NASA and Jim might share this
thought, it NASA is really good

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:54.230
at a lot of things but one
of them is making reports.

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:58.380
And so every decade or so
there is another report.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.850
And this is not intended
to criticize anybody,

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:03.450
it's important to revisit it.

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:09.070
But there are a number of ok, here
are the five most important things

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:13.600 position:56%
that we can do in the next ten years

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.090
and every ten years
we brush that off.

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:24.850 position:56%
But those landing sites would still
be amongst many high priority spots.

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:28.800
&gt;&gt; You said that the experiments
were cancelled after five years.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.100
Why?

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.400
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: That's, ok.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.700
Money, basically.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.080
The [inaudible] program has
active experiments going

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.140
on from the Apollo.

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:41.640
Ultimately, each of the
missions left something behind

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:46.320
but the long lived ones were at
Apollo's 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:51.150
And those were terminated
on September 30th, 1977.

01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:55.360
Now for those of you in the civil
service or work for the government,

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:58.880
September 30th is the
end of the fiscal year.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.220 position:56%
And they were turned off because it
was costing a million dollars a year

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.920
to operate those experiments.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.820 position:56%
There was also a concern at the
Johnson Space Center, there's a room

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:10.420
that was used to basically,
you know,

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:15.510
the 1977 equivalent
of a server farm.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.590
Basically the station where the
room, maybe as large as this room,

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.580
that was used to get the data,
process it, and then archive it,

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.880
was valuable real estate at JSC.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.300
And they were getting ready for
the deorbit of Skylab which was one

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.770
of the later Apollo missions,
upper stage of the Saturn five

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:26.070
that was used as our
first space station.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.370
Again, the engineering model,

01:04:27.370 --> 01:04:28.670
the training model is
there at the space museum.

01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:29.970 position:56%
And so that room, the folks that
were concerned about bringing Skylab

01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:31.270
down safely, they wanted
space to be able to do that.

01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:32.570
And so that was another
argument that was used

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:33.870
to terminate [inaudible] was
that they needed the room.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.170
They wanted that room.

01:04:35.170 --> 01:04:36.470
So it's ultimately those
two things that conspired

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:37.770
against the right word
while I said it.

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.070 position:56%
So that basically acted to terminate
the [inaudible] program prematurely.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:40.370
Some of the equipment was failing

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:41.670
but there was still very
important seismic date,

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:42.970
there was still information
to be learned.

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:44.270
But a million dollars a year was
deemed needed to go elsewhere.

01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:45.570
So it was terminated.

01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:46.870
Apollo 17's operated again for that
five years but you had Apollo 12

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:48.170
that had been running since 1969
so in some cases it was seven

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:49.470
or more years of almost continuous
data coming down from the moon.

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.270
There was a question on the, yep.

01:04:51.270 --> 01:05:03.090
[inaudible]

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:06.970
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Yeah I can
go back to-- let me see.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:11.690
Yeah, I mean this was
as if you were there.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.390
It's good.

01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:18.690
For some people I don't want to
strap to the side of a rocket.

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:19.990
Nobody in this room.

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:23.390
This is not sped up, certainly
I didn't do any monkeying

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:24.690
around with this.

01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:25.990
It goes very fast.

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:29.820
And remember, this is
going, well the Saturn Five

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.920
when it cleared the tower
three or four seconds

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:33.990
after launch was going
60 miles an hour.

01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:36.050
That's pretty slow when
you think about it.

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:39.910 position:56%
I can go-- I've got CRV and I can go
faster than that in three seconds.

01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:42.150
Not that I ever would though.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:47.140 position:56%
But you know, this is a lighter
rocket and it clears the cloud deck,

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:49.120
it was not a very cloudy
day that day

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.170
but it was cloudy enough,
within a few seconds.

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:56.930
But it takes-- actually, if you
go back and watch the launch

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:59.330
of New Horizons to Pluto,

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.710
I mean that cleared the
moon in a couple hours.

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.570
Six hours or less.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.530
Because that thing
had to get going fast.

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:08.640
We only had to get to the moon so
we didn't have to go that fast.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:13.670
But launching rockets is awesome.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.510
We'll go back and then come back.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:30.040
[inaudible]

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.530
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Ok.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:33.520
Yeah, so that's a great question.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.970
And actually, the origin and age

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.140
of the moon is really
important because,

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.360
that's again the big question.

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.960
We still argue about that.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.420
But indeed, the samples, even from
the very first mission Apollo 11,

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.800
showed us that the
moon was very old.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.850
And under, most likely underwent
a global melting event early

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.150
in its history.

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:59.360
And so early on, a model was
developed that hypothesized

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.680
that about four and a half billion
years ago, an object about the size

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.000
of Mars struck the Earth and
sent into orbit around the moon,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.290
basically for lack of a more
technical term, a bunch of debris.

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:15.240
But ejecta from the Earth
that coalesced, reheated,

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:20.830
and melted to form the
lunar crust and mantel.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:25.030
And so samples from subsequent
missions show that the crust

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:28.810
of the moon is about
4.4 billion years old

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:33.860
and so a more detailed analysis
has gone back and showed when some

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.140
of that would have
actually coalesced.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:43.010
But on the Earth, there are some
very few places, Northern Canada,

01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:47.000
Central Australia, where you
can get rocks that are upwards

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.380
of 3.8 billion years old.

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:50.300
But those are few and far between.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.760
Whereas the crust of the moon
has these rocks pretty much,

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:57.010
I won't say everywhere, but
widespread rocks that are 4.3

01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:58.460
or older billion years old.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.360
And there's still arguments
about the age of the moon.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:05.790
We know that it's likely older than
4.4 billon years, but there's a lot

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.360
of that early history
in the solar system

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.890
that we don't very well understand.

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:12.820
But the record for those
rocks is sitting on the moon

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.950
and likely not sitting
here on the Earth.

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:17.680
So we just went through staging,
that was the bright flash there.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.930
And in a moment, you'll see
the space crust separation

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.230
if you're worried about it.

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.530
Fortunately we know LRO survives,

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:24.510
so anything you see here
couldn't have been too bad.

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:44.110
[inaudible]

01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:48.740
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Yeah, so the
question is about some recent work

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:53.530
and it's very good to see a lot of
effort going back into reanalyzing

01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:55.130
and asking these questions.

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:57.770
It's not a closed question
of the early dynamics

01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.070
of where the moon came from.

01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:00.800
And really, the more we
learn about the moon--

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.070
that the moon has water in it,
that it's not completely dried out,

01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:08.460
punches some holes into the
theory of this large impact early

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:12.270
on because one of the ideas was
this early impact will devolatilize

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:14.530
whatever came to form
the moon very quickly.

01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:19.650
Well we know the moon has volatiles
in it so I'd say it's still open

01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:24.390
to debate and question
and I would say again,

01:09:24.390 --> 01:09:26.660
perhaps a little self-serving
that more analysis

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:28.970
of these Apollo samples,
there are some Apollo samples

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:30.630
that have never been analyzed.

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:32.940
There's some samples that
haven't been analyzed in 45 years.

01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.030
So I think we have a lot left
to learn from those samples

01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:41.440
and looking towards what that tells
us about day one from the moon.

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.740
Moving down the line.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:44.540
Yep.

01:09:44.540 --> 01:10:00.090
[inaudible]

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:03.010
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Well,
that's a great question

01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:06.120
because I'm going to
speak for myself.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.490
It's all I know.

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:11.720
I certainly feel like I missed out
on that opportunity to participate

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:16.340
for something like that and
hopefully, I'm not that old

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.330
but I know there's an end to my
career somewhere and hopefully

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:21.780
between here and there there's
something that I could contribute.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:28.310
I think when we are ready to go
back to the moon as a species,

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:31.860
we can do so safely with
the data that we have here.

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:35.130
So yeah, I feel like I
missed out but there's a lot

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.860
of great things that
are going on here.

01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:43.670
You know, we lost our way, we
got-- there was a war going on.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:44.970
I wasn't there.

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:48.220 position:56%
And looking at and talking to
folks, there was a certain sense of,

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:52.190
even Apollo 12 wasn't
as popular as Apollo 11.

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.510
The second time humans go
to the moon wasn't like--

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:58.100
by Apollo 13 people were
barely paying attention.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.200
I think that tells u more
about how we have to.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.150
I mean, we've learned a lot in
the last year about how our,

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:09.420
and when I say our I mean
the U.S., the attention span

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.720
and the interest of the country.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:13.230
So whenever we are ready
to do something bibg,

01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:17.370
and going to the moon was big.

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:21.520
Billions and billions of
dollars spent to do it.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.760
Society, leadership has to
be on board to continue it.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.360
We talked about turning
off [inaudible]

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.590
after five years or prematurely.

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:34.140
We have to be on board
with big investments.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.020
And the investment that was
made in Apollo has told us

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.120
about the origin of the moon.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:43.870
Again indeed, events are happening
four and a half billion years ago.

01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:45.170
These are things that
can't be solved

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:48.410 position:56%
for the price of this cup of coffee.

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:49.710
Even if it is from Starbucks.

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:51.010
You can't do it.

01:11:51.010 --> 01:11:53.750
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree Bradley: We
have time for one more question.

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.050
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Ok.

01:11:55.050 --> 01:11:56.390
There's a question
in the front here.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:58.190
Yeah.

01:11:58.190 --> 01:12:13.800
[inaudible]

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.100
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Sure.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.820
So this is radiation doses.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:24.860
So the question is, what do we
know would happen and the causes

01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:28.600
and events of a solar flare.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.060
As I mentioned, one
of the instruments

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:32.250
on LRO is this radiation detector.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:36.090
Unfortunately, the moon, the sun
has been fairly quiet the time

01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:39.170
that we've been at the moon with
LRO for the last seven years,

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:42.020
so we haven't had one of these
large solar flares occur.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:46.130
But we know that if not lethal,
a harmful does of radiation.

01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:47.830
Now where would they go?

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.940 position:56%
If we're on the moon for a long
period of time we we want to be able

01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.240
to get the astronauts to sagety.

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.340
Now whether or not that shelter
is in their habitat that's covered

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:59.450
in some thickness of [inaudible]
that would protect them,

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:02.320
shield them, one of the
surprising discoveries

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.620
and I don't have an image of it.

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:06.820
So I'll just put a picture of
Mt. Marilyn up for a moment.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:11.010
Is that there are places that
we've seen that are pits.

01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:14.740
They're collapsed lava tubes.

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:19.090 position:56%
We don't know if the pit is the size
of the hole or a little big larger,

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:21.670
or if there's an extensive
lava tube system.

01:13:21.670 --> 01:13:24.380
We've seen these scattered
across the lunar surface.

01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:26.640
Mostly in areas of volcanism.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.110
Those could be good habitats,
because now of course you have

01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:31.410
to get into it so you have to go

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:34.910
down into a pit that's
30, 40, 50 meters deep.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.210
That's not easy.

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.930
You saw the astronauts
running around, climbing up

01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:41.590
and down a rope ladder that's
going to be next to impossible

01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:45.340
for an astronaut on the surface but
there may be some natural shelters

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:49.740
that we found on the moon that
would prove to be potential

01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:55.560
if they're extensive enough
to be shelters for astronauts.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.980
The other possibility, though,
is just designing a habitat

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:01.400
that has enough shielding.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.970
Or again, if you can take the
loose material on the surface

01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:09.850
and cover that, that could
provide enough protection.

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:16.530
Humans have remained in lower-Earth
orbit since 1972, and when you're

01:14:16.530 --> 01:14:17.830
in lower-Earth orbit
you're in protection

01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:19.580
of the Earth's magnetic field.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:26.560
So if we want to go on to Mars,
this is going to be a major issue

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.430
for any long duration
deep space exploration,

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.730
will be radiation hazards.

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:34.160
But instruments like crater
and instruments that are

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:36.000
on Mars right now measuring
radiation,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.210 position:56%
we at least know the expected doses.

01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:41.710
This provides some
arguments of whether

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.400
or not this means you should send
people who are young and can agree

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.900
that if this is going to
happen this is going to happen,

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.690
or if you send older people.

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:50.990
No offense.

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:54.620
Who don't have to worry about
having kids or anything like that.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:57.350
Everybody's got their
own vested interests.

01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:02.440
But it's definitely going to be one
of the major, although achievable,

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.350
but a major hurdle for long
duration deep space exploration.

01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:11.400
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree Bradley:
Dr. Petro, thank you very much,

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.080
we have so enjoyed
this presentation.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:17.940
If you have questions,
perhaps you can come outwards

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.040
and down and talk with Dr. Petro.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.340
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Absolutely.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.640
[applause]

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.430
&gt;&gt; Noah Petro: Thank you very much!

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:29.150
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
