NAZMAL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXT,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.059
where we're going to
learn more about lean UX

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.850
and why it's important
in creating products

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.830
that people love.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.650
I'm your host, Nazmal Idris.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.180
I have a very special guest
with me today, Laura Klein,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.930
author of "UX for
Lean Startups."

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.210
Welcome to the show?

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.124
LAURA KLEIN: Hello, internets.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.290
NAZMAL IDRIS: Before we
start talking about lean UX,

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.630
we should perhaps address
lean startup first.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.445
So Laura, what is Lean Startup?

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:32.320
LAURA KLEIN: So lean
startup is a methodology

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.730
that was created by Eric Ries.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.490
And it's based on
lean manufacturing,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.490
which actually
came out of Toyota.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.970
Lean startup this about
learning as quickly as possible

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.910
and reducing the cycle
time through what's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.260
called the
build-measure-learn loop.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.320
The idea is that,
instead of just assuming

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.153
that you know exactly
what you should build,

00:00:48.153 --> 00:00:50.170
you form a hypothesis
that something might work.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.760
And then you find the fastest
way to validate or invalidate

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.500
the hypothesis.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.490
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.865
LAURA KLEIN: The
goal, of course,

00:00:56.865 --> 00:00:59.020
is to create things
that people want to use

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.562
and that they will actually buy.

00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:02.270
And we do that by
learning and validating

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.119
our ideas at every
step of the way.

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.410
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.000
So Laura, word on the street is
that I can make some products

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.120
very quickly, and on the
cheap, without spending money

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.140
on design using this
lean startup thing.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.090
Is that true?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.870
LAURA KLEIN: No.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.120
It is not true.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.210
I know it's terrible,
that it isn't.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.610
But it's absolutely not true.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.660
Because lean startup, really,
it's not about being cheap.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.520
And it's not about being
free, or cutting corners.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.603
And just because you're
bootstrapping your startup

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:28.670
doesn't make you lean.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.090
I mean, OK, so it turns out
lean startups can end up

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.490
spending less money and
time than other startups.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.670
But that's because
they are constantly

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.836
evaluating whether they're
building the right thing.

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:38.440
And that minimizes waste.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.389
Just saving money or going
fast does not make you lean.

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:42.680
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.790
So what is Lean EX?

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.400
How is it different
than lean startup?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.530
LAURA KLEIN: Lean UX
is really just a way

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.320
to apply those iterative methods
to the user experience design

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.730
practice.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.459
Doing Lean UX means that you're
always validating with users

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:58.000
that you're designing something
that people are going to use.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.416
It's about designing
products that

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:01.159
are both usable and useful.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.450
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.660
So you wrote a book
about this, right?

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.410
So what type of an audience
would find this book useful?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.630
LAURA KLEIN: So right.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.590
The book is called "UX
for Lean Startups."

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.509
But it's not actually
just for UX designers.

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.300
And it's not even really
just for startups.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.992
So I don't.

00:02:15.992 --> 00:02:17.450
Maybe I could have
named it better.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.460
But the book is
really for anybody

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.350
who's building a product because
design is everybody's job.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.850
It gives you a lot
of tips and tools

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.308
for learning from your users
and turning that understanding

00:02:26.308 --> 00:02:28.392
into great products that
people will actually buy.

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:29.683
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:02:29.683 --> 00:02:31.270
Design is everyone's
responsibility.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.500
We say that a lot on this show.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.860
So Laura, if I want a Lean UX
organization in my company,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.880
how do I go about
making that happen?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.630
LAURA KLEIN: Well, if
you're a big company

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.240
with a lot of siloed
organizations,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.590
you know, UX in one silo,
engineering in another,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.100
marketing in another, it
can be really big change.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.450
But even if you're a
startup with one designer

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.100
and three people
in a room, there

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.790
are some fundamental things
that you need to get right.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.690
The ones that I think
are most important

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.050
are thinking in terms of
hypotheses and assumptions

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.910
and learning to validate those
before you commit to building.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.580
Creating cross
functional teams that

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.930
include engineering, design,
research, product management,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.210
and whoever else needs to
be involved in these product

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.770
decisions.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.324
You need an environment where
you can measure and test

00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:15.990
all of your design
and product decisions

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.260
and a team that's
open to understanding

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.770
the real impact they're
having on end users.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.590
You also need a really
different approach

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.630
to design deliverables,
where you're only

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.220
creating artifacts that are
necessary for communication.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.750
You're not making little
pixel perfect mockups

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.680
for every single change.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.490
And finally, you need
support from the top

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.550
of your organization
because you're

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.090
going to have to change
your whole way of thinking

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.110
about products.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.129
You need product
managers and designers

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.670
to be held accountable
for the impact

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.569
that their decisions
have on the end user.

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.860
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.750
LAURA KLEIN: I
mean, you no longer

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.050
get evaluated on whether
a feature ships or not.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.660
You get evaluated based on
whether the changes you make

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.534
positively impact user behavior.

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:55.950
And that's a big
change that needs

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.950
to happen at the very
top of the organization.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.199
NAZMAL IDRIS: That is so true.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.360
So Laura, can you talk
more about validating

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.360
assumptions and hypotheses?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960
That sounds really important,
but it also sounds complicated.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.117
What does it mean, exactly?

00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:09.200
LAURA KLEIN: So it's a
really big part of Lean UX.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.179
And it's a big change
in the way we work.

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:12.720
We have to stop
assuming that we know

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.250
exactly what we're building.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.870
Instead, we need
to frame everything

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.870
as a hypothesis that's going to
be validated before we commit

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.190
those coding resources.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.940
NAZMAL IDRIS: So can you
explain that with an example?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.830
LAURA KLEIN: I can.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.875
So here's something that,
I think, a lot of us

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.210
can probably identify with.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.365
I want you to imagine
that you've got a product.

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:32.520
And your product manager
comes in and says,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.120
our product needs more social.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.220
Make it more social.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.040
Let's add comments.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.123
NAZMAL IDRIS: Isn't
everything better with social?

00:04:38.123 --> 00:04:40.220
LAURA KLEIN: Everything
is better with social.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.470
But see, what happens is
that the manager comes up

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.760
with a brilliant, brand
new idea for comments.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.850
And then the designers
immediately dive in.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.460
And they start thinking, OK,
how do I make the ideal comments

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.160
experience?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.250
And the engineers go, OK, great.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.890
How do I write this
code so that it's

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.869
a really fast, stable
comments experience.

00:05:00.869 --> 00:05:02.410
But instead, what
we should be asking

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.670
is how do we know whether
this is even the right thing

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.049
to build in the first place?

00:05:07.049 --> 00:05:08.340
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.300
LAURA KLEIN: See, the
whole comments feature

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.570
has a lot of assumptions
packed into it.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.070
For example, there's
this assumption

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.736
that, by making the
product more social,

00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:17.430
our key metrics are
going to improve.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.642
Do we really know that?

00:05:18.642 --> 00:05:20.350
Do we know that adding
a comments feature

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.100
is going to improve
our business?

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.350
Do we even know that people
are going to leave comments?

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.740
In other words, do comments
fulfill either a user

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.080
need, or a business need,
or, even better, both.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.080
We can't just don't assume
that those things are

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.280
true because the product
manager had an idea.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.040
Instead of assuming
that those are facts,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.000
we're going to treat
them as hypotheses,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.390
and we're going to test
them as quickly as possible.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.940
And ideally, we're
going to test them

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.490
without building the
entire comments feature,

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.020
and then launching, and
just seeing how it does.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.620
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.900
So these are hypotheses.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.200
How do we validate them?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.700
LAURA KLEIN: So
this is where we run

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.980
into a really common lean
startup buzz word-- MVP.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.230
NAZMAL IDRIS: I've heard that.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.021
LAURA KLEIN: Yeah, we
need to build an MVP.

00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:03.300
And MVP is a Minimum
Viable Product.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.370
It's the smallest
possible thing that we

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.450
can build that will help
us to learn whether or not

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.647
our hypothesis is true.

00:06:09.647 --> 00:06:11.980
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense
I've heard of these MVPs.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.840
So are they just really
crappy versions of products?

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.076
LAURA KLEIN: They are not.

00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:18.030
NAZMAL IDRIS: Ah.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.610
LAURA KLEIN: So this is
a common misconception.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.610
But an MVP is never a
crappy version of a product.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.860
Because it turns out that
the only thing that we learn

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.730
from crappy products
is that people

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.220
don't like crappy products.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.410
That's a well-validated
hypothesis.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.540
We know that people
hate crappy things.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.776
The word viable is actually
there for a reason.

00:06:35.776 --> 00:06:37.650
It's got be something
that we can learn from.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.108
NAZMAL IDRIS: No,
That makes sense.

00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:42.050
So what is the MVP version
of this comments feature?

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.675
LAURA KLEIN: That's
a good question.

00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:44.960
There are actually a few
different versions of the MVP.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.501
And you could start
with any of them,

00:06:46.501 --> 00:06:48.920
sort of depending on what
you want to validate first.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.620
So for example, if you wanted to
validate whether anybody would

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.310
leave a comment
at all, you might

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.744
create what we call a fake
door, or a feature stub?

00:06:55.744 --> 00:06:57.160
NAZMAL IDRIS: What
is a fake door?

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.180
LAURA KLEIN: So if you want
to validate whether anybody's

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.880
going to use
something, you build

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.700
the very first interaction
with that feature.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.200
And then you record whether
anybody interacts with it.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.090
So in this case,
you might put a box

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.900
on the page that's a
little comment box.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.108
And it's got a little button
that says Add a Comment.

00:07:13.108 --> 00:07:14.720
And you let people
Add a Comment.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.810
But instead of
Adding the Comment

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.200
to the page immediately, you
might just give the answer

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.390
a nice Thank You message saying,
you're reviewing the comment.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.600
And then you'd send the
comment in an email to you.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.500
That way, you'd know whether
anybody tried to leave one.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.000
It's a lot faster than
building the whole system,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.700
with flagging, and blocking,
and moderation, and everything,

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.826
and then realizing that
nobody has anything to say.

00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:36.116
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:07:36.116 --> 00:07:37.540
So that's a quick
way to validate.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.390
Now what if people actually
start leaving comments,

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.730
like they actually
engage with this feature?

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.104
LAURA KLEIN: Yeah,
so once you've

00:07:42.104 --> 00:07:45.000
validated that people are
interested in starting

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.620
this process and
leaving comments,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.390
the next minimum
viable product might

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.380
be to see whether adding some
of those products to the page

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.210
actually makes a
different in your metrics.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.930
So remember, you've
got some comments

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.320
that people have emailed to you.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.070
And so you could add
those to the page by hand

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.730
and then doing an
A/B test to see

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.280
if the comments you've
added make a different.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.890
For example, show the same
page with comments and without

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.320
and see if more people buy on
the page that has comments.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.690
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.689
So what you're saying is
that the idea of an MVP

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:15.760
is to learn whether a feature
or product is likely to succeed

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.660
before you actually
put in the resources

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.740
to completely build it.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.000
LAURA KLEIN: Yeah.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.150
That's exactly right.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.199
That's 100% true.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:23.240
And that's really what
this whole thing is about.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.531
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:26.910
So now, after the
MVP, how do you

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.200
know when your hypotheses
and assumptions have

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.970
been validated?

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.720
LAURA KLEIN: That's
an excellent question.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.230
And it's also a huge question
with a lot of answers to it.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.110
The basic idea is
if you have to be

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.250
able to measure your
results in some way.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.624
And if you can't tell what
effect your changes are having

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.570
on real user behavior,
you can't actually

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.929
ever know whether your design
decisions were any good.

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:46.220
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.010
So can you illustrate
that with an example.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.440
LAURA KLEIN: Sure.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.690
So let's say you end up
shipping that comments feature

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.360
that we've been talking about.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.550
In most place, you
just ship the feature

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.950
and then move on
to the next one.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.241
But what if, for some reason
that you don't necessarily

00:08:57.241 --> 00:09:00.200
understand, when this
feature is out in the wild,

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.100
comments really end up
hurting your product?

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:02.891
NAZMAL IDRIS: Whoa.

00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:05.420
LAURA KLEIN: Yeah, I know,
so, maybe, it sounds weird.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.650
But maybe people are so
busy commenting on things

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.810
that they don't buy anything.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.260
Or maybe comments make
the page load really slow.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.719
And you end up
driving people away.

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:15.218
There could be any
number of reasons

00:09:15.218 --> 00:09:16.380
that a feature might fail.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.980
But the point is
that you don't know

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.869
it fails unless
you are measuring.

00:09:19.869 --> 00:09:21.160
NAZMAL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.394
So is this where you
might use A/B testing?

00:09:23.394 --> 00:09:24.810
LAURA KLEIN: A/B
testing is really

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.030
the best way to test the real
impact that your changes have

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:28.840
on your product.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.339
But there are other ways, both
qualitative and quantitative,

00:09:31.339 --> 00:09:32.770
to validate your changes.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.280
NAZMAL IDRIS: Ah, that
sounds like something we

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.821
should talk about
in future episodes.

00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:37.238
LAURA KLEIN: I
think you're right.

00:09:37.238 --> 00:09:38.029
NAZMAL IDRIS: Cool.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, thank you so much
for being on the show.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.960
If you want to learn
more about Lean UX

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.930
before we make more
episodes on it,

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.970
don't forget to read Laura's
book "UX for Lean Startups,"

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.920
where she will teach you
all about making products

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.880
that people love.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.130
LAURA KLEIN: Thanks everybody.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.600
Go build something amazing.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.230
NAZMAL IDRIS: And thank you,
Laura, again, for being here.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.520
And thank you for watching.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.240
Good bye.
