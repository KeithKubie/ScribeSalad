GREG IVANOV: Hi.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.180
Thanks, [? Albert. ?]
My name is Greg,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.210
and I'm Partner Development
Manager at Google Play,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.950
and I lead a lot of our VR and
AR focused efforts in Europe.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.900
So this talk will be so
philosophical a little bit,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.130
a little bit practical.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.780
And the idea is to give you a
taste of our vision for what

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.270
we now call immersive
computing, which we see now

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.610
emerging through
the frameworks of AR

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.540
and VR, and perhaps
most importantly,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.670
give you a little
bit of inspiration

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.070
and a way of thinking
around this topic

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.050
and what this might mean
for you as a developer,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.630
and then explain
some of the tools

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.920
that we have in place today to
help you succeed in this area.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.720
So let's start with the vision.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.650
So ultimately, this comes
down to making technology work

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.600
a lot more like we do.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.816
And does anyone know roughly
what year this photo's from?

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:03.112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:04.900
GREG IVANOV: No.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.790
'40s.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.200
So that's a computer
punch card from the '40s.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.220
So that's obviously not the most
frictionless and intuitive way

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.960
of interacting with a computer.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.610
I think you'll all
agree with that.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.510
And so, I think it's fair to
say that smartphones were truly

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.940
the first breakthrough in terms
of innovation and interfaces

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.950
and accessibility with
computers and what they can do.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.560
And still, the level of
abstraction remains, right?

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.805
So when you call a
friend on your phone,

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.180
you don't really see them like
you see them in real life.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.850
You see this flat, lifeless
version of them on the screen.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.660
And equally, when you're
looking for restaurant,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.960
your phone doesn't really
walk you to the restaurant.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.410
You still have to look at your
phone and see those blue dots,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.110
and then find a way
of navigating that.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.080
It's not ideal.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.930
It's getting better,
but, it's not ideal.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.300
So with immersive
computing, we're

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.180
saying that instead of
staring at our screens

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.580
and constantly
checking our phones,

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.340
we'll be able to interact
with the world and computers

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.380
in a more natural way.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.140
We'll be able to
hold up our heads

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.771
to the real and virtual
worlds around us.

00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:21.270
OK.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.580
That's kind of the
high level philosophy

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.110
as to how we think about this.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.530
So what is immersive computing?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.580
So the way we think of this
is really as a spectrum,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.870
with AR and VR as
two points on it.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.910
So on the very right, we
have virtual reality, which

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.110
is fully computer-generated.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.880
On the very left,
you have reality,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.950
or you can call it real
reality, as what we

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.750
are taking part in right here.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.060
And in the middle, sort
of the middle part,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.810
is augmented reality,
and this layer

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.550
of computer-generated
reality that

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.250
comes on top of our real world.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.510
Another way to put
it is virtual reality

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.590
can take you anywhere, as
this beautiful image shows,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.780
and augmented reality can
bring anything to you.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.114
So this is all
kind of intuitive.

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:24.530
So let's take a look at some
of the efforts and the latest

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.770
things that we've done in
the augmented reality space.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.620
So if you think
back 10 years ago,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.870
that was one of the
first Android devices.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.632
Computers as phones have become
a lot more powerful and sort of

00:03:45.632 --> 00:03:47.340
interesting in terms
of what they can do,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.190
yet their understanding,
contextual understanding

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.025
of the world around them,
has become pretty limited.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.890
With AR, this equation will
be changed dramatically.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.700
This will really bring
the next big shift

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.320
in terms of computers
understanding

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.680
the world around them in a
completely different way.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.280
So at the most basic
fundamental level,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.790
this is about providing
timely and relevant

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.110
digital information in the
context of the real world.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.160
So here, you've got an
example of da Vinci's

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.820
"Lady with a Ermine," where
the very first version

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.000
of the painting didn't
even have the ermine.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.330
And then, you can
see the progression

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.990
to the very final version, where
actually the face of the lady

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.600
has changed dramatically.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.890
And that's a really rich and
interesting digital contextual

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.290
information that you just
wouldn't have access to

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.783
in the same way without
this AR technology.

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:47.170
So what are some of
the other use cases?

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.140
Well, shopping is really
obvious and fun one,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.950
and kind of immediately
practically useful,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.670
where you can essentially
overlay any digital object

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.260
into a physical
space and see what

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.360
this is going to look like.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.810
You can learn about
real-life objects

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.100
in a completely new and
interactive way, which

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.390
is kind of shown by this
high-end coffee machine, where

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.390
you can learn and
interact in this way.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.420
So games is obviously a huge
use case, and as we all know,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.080
"Pokemon Go" has really
planted the seed in this space,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.630
and we're only going to
see more and more amazing

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.350
stuff coming in terms
of gaming and AR.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.660
And last but not
least, the example

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.170
that I used earlier in
terms of navigation,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.434
it becomes a contextual
window into the world,

00:05:36.434 --> 00:05:38.100
where instead of
holding down your phone

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.680
and figuring out how
to relate to it, how

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.241
to relate to your external
world as an external object,

00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:45.240
you will actually be using
the phone as a window

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.140
and be able to see contextual
information around you

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.840
and navigational prompts in
a much more intuitive way.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.520
So at Google, as
a lot of you know,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.110
we started our AR efforts
with Tango in 2014.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.420
Now Tango was a hardware play,
as intrinsically everything

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.770
hardware, it's a lot harder
to scale and distribute.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.100
So two months ago,
we announced ARCore,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.860
which is all about AR
at the scale of Android.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.620
So let's take a quick
look at what this can do.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.730
So motion tracking.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.220
This is a really
fundamental aspect of AR.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.370
So it knows where your
phone is in space.

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.650
Secondly, environmental
understanding.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.889
So as in this case, it knows
that a table is indeed a table,

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.430
and that you can
place objects on it.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.971
The same goes for
walls and ceilings.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.050
Light estimation is
super important too,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.689
so that, as in this
example, the object knows

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:46.480
when the light in the
room is switched off,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.230
and it can adjust accordingly.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.770
Right now, this is running
on pixel devices and Samsung,

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.520
with more OEMs coming
on-board very quickly,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.890
and we're expecting over 100
million devices very soon.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.330
The way we think
of this is really

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.300
as both a feature
and a foundation,

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.460
meaning that we
certainly hope that you

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.470
are able to integrate
ARCore and AR

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.170
experiences within
your existing apps,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.110
and we hope that
this will give birth

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.186
to a whole new types of
experiences that are native AR.

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:23.185
Let's take a look at some
of this in action now.

00:07:23.185 --> 00:07:24.900
Want to play the video?

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.365
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:31.335
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:35.988 --> 00:08:36.990
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.320
Amazing.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.909
So that's CoreAR.

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.190
And let's move
onto VR now and see

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.940
what we've done there in the
last couple of months or so.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.410
So last year in
November, we launched

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.900
Daydream, which is all about
basically high-end premium VR

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.150
experiences with the
scale of Android,

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.920
interactive experiences,
and comfortable headsets.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.890
Then this year, we've
announced even more devices

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.080
that are supporting
Daydream, so that you

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.280
can use Daydream on almost
any high-end Android device,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.030
most notably Samsung S8 is now
supporting Daydream as well,

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.220
and we're expecting
even more OEMs to come

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.850
onboard in the next year or so.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.630
In terms of software and
hardware-- and by the way,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.130
the new Google Daydream View,
with more colors and even more

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.630
comfort.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.350
In terms of software, we have
even more apps than before.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.980
So the momentum is quite strong.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.322
You, know let's keep in mind
that developing for VR--

00:09:36.322 --> 00:09:38.030
and let's be honest
about this-- is still

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.020
very hard and quite expensive.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.860
So we're trying to be very
careful as to how we bring this

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.010
to market.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.220
Having said that, all
Android developers

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.890
are now able to develop
for VR, and we're

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.820
seeing a lot more
organic titles coming

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.180
into the store, which we're
supporting through featuring.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.740
In terms of the product
itself, and what Daydream

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.170
looks like inside, we've
made it even easier

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.110
to discover, interact with,
and share experiences in VR.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.930
So let's take a look
at what this means.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.720
In terms of discovery,
Daydream Home

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.380
has an updated look, with these
new tabs of the top, which

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.860
makes it even easier to engage
users and keep users in VR

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.080
for longer, therefore
kind of developing

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.800
this daily use of VR, which
we think is so, so important

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.920
by taking it sort of mainstream.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.690
Dashboard is extremely
powerful as well.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.610
So this enables you to interact
with your Android notifications

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.736
without having to
take off the headset.

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:37.110
Casting, that was
one of the most

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.600
asked for software features.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.900
So the power of
Chromecast and Daydream

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.760
now enables you to stream
or cast your VR experience

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.930
in the headset onto
any large screen,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.500
therefore making the
experience a lot more social.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.390
Screenshot and video
capture is also here,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.340
so that you can now
share your experiences

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.537
on all the usual
channels, making

00:10:59.537 --> 00:11:01.870
it more accessible for users
to see what you're actually

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.572
up to in your VR environment.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.350
Last but not least, and this is
a really cool one, YouTube call

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:10.880
watching.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.450
So you can actually
experience YouTube on Daydream

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:16.040
concurrently with your friends.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.350
So we've talked a lot
about the philosophy,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.200
and what we've done with AR
and VR on the product side,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.280
and I want to leave you with
kind of a taste of the future.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.770
So this convergence
of AR and VR,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.890
those two points in the
spectrum, is pretty inevitable.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.350
And we think this will
enable a new type of devices

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.670
to come to the market.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:46.290
First one such device is the
Lenovo All-In-One headset

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.860
that will come to the
market early next year.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.010
This will use part
of the technology,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.430
such as motion tracking
and depth perception,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.380
and it will be a busy
running Daydream,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.020
so you can interact
with your VR experiences

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.670
in a more richer and
kind of untethered way,

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.306
with more functionality
and more freedom to move.

00:12:09.306 --> 00:12:13.860
And beyond that, we've all
heard the term mixed reality.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.470
And so, let's see
what shape that takes.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.450
Most likely, in the form
of devices that will

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:21.620
combine both AR and VR in one.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.280
And so, immersive computing,
and its future and present,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.160
frankly, is pretty exciting,
and we're only just

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.340
at the very beginning.
