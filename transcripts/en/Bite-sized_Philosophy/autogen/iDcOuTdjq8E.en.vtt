00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.389
one of the things that I figured out

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399
one of the things that I figured out
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:03.949
one of the things that I figured out
over the last years is this is a good

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959
over the last years is this is a good
 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.440
over the last years is this is a good
proposition so you know it's pretty

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
proposition so you know it's pretty
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.379
proposition so you know it's pretty
self-evident that life is have got its

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
self-evident that life is have got its
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.120
self-evident that life is have got its
rat's nest of miseries and that's for

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
rat's nest of miseries and that's for
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.350
rat's nest of miseries and that's for
sure maybe you could even make a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
sure maybe you could even make a
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.089
sure maybe you could even make a
categorical statement that life is

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099
categorical statement that life is
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.460
categorical statement that life is
mostly a rat's nest of misery you know

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
mostly a rat's nest of misery you know
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.420
mostly a rat's nest of misery you know
you could make a pretty powerful

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
you could make a pretty powerful
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.210
you could make a pretty powerful
argument for that but then there's a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
argument for that but then there's a
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.710
argument for that but then there's a
counter question which is well what if

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
counter question which is well what if
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.029
counter question which is well what if
you tried not to make it any more

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
you tried not to make it any more
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.910
you tried not to make it any more
miserable that had had to be right then

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
miserable that had had to be right then
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.519
miserable that had had to be right then
what then what would it be like and my

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
what then what would it be like and my
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.589
what then what would it be like and my
suspicions are is that a lot of that

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
suspicions are is that a lot of that
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720
suspicions are is that a lot of that
misery I would suspect that most of that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730
misery I would suspect that most of that
 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.430
misery I would suspect that most of that
misery would go away because it's the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
misery would go away because it's the
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260
misery would go away because it's the
unnecessary misery that really brings

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270
unnecessary misery that really brings
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330
unnecessary misery that really brings
you down you know it's like well someone

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
you down you know it's like well someone
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.450
you down you know it's like well someone
has cancer it's like that sucks but it's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
has cancer it's like that sucks but it's
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.990
has cancer it's like that sucks but it's
not like it's not like you can say if

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
not like it's not like you can say if
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750
not like it's not like you can say if
only we had done this differently then

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
only we had done this differently then
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819
only we had done this differently then
that wouldn't have happened but when

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829
that wouldn't have happened but when
 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.500
that wouldn't have happened but when
someone's out like car Turing you in a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
someone's out like car Turing you in a
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.299
someone's out like car Turing you in a
malevolent way or maybe you're doing the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309
malevolent way or maybe you're doing the
 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.740
malevolent way or maybe you're doing the
same you can always ask yourself was

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
same you can always ask yourself was
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.959
same you can always ask yourself was
really this really necessary is this

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
really this really necessary is this
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.450
really this really necessary is this
just like I'm useless add on to the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
just like I'm useless add on to the
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310
just like I'm useless add on to the
miseries of life that's what disheartens

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
miseries of life that's what disheartens
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650
miseries of life that's what disheartens
people and so even in your own life if

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
people and so even in your own life if
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.100
people and so even in your own life if
if you if you aren't suffering from

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
if you if you aren't suffering from
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.920
if you if you aren't suffering from
self-imposed misery and you're only

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
self-imposed misery and you're only
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260
self-imposed misery and you're only
suffering from inescapable misery maybe

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
suffering from inescapable misery maybe
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.060
suffering from inescapable misery maybe
you could handle that and you know you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070
you could handle that and you know you
 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.370
you could handle that and you know you
could you could survive you could bear

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
could you could survive you could bear
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.820
could you could survive you could bear
it and even maybe without becoming

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830
it and even maybe without becoming
 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.410
it and even maybe without becoming
irredeemably corrupt so the goal would

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
irredeemably corrupt so the goal would
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.450
irredeemably corrupt so the goal would
be well yeah life is a rat's nest of

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
be well yeah life is a rat's nest of
 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.370
be well yeah life is a rat's nest of
miseries and maybe it has no ultimate

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
miseries and maybe it has no ultimate
 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620
miseries and maybe it has no ultimate
meaning we could say that we're feeling

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
meaning we could say that we're feeling
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.539
meaning we could say that we're feeling
particularly pessimistic but it still

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
particularly pessimistic but it still
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550
particularly pessimistic but it still
leaves one question open which is you

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560
leaves one question open which is you
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.870
leaves one question open which is you
didn't do everything you could to make

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
didn't do everything you could to make
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.870
didn't do everything you could to make
it worse how good could you make it be

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
it worse how good could you make it be
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.109
it worse how good could you make it be
and the least answer is well it could be

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
and the least answer is well it could be
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.530
and the least answer is well it could be
tragedy but maybe not hell and I think

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
tragedy but maybe not hell and I think
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.850
tragedy but maybe not hell and I think
that's right I really believe that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
that's right I really believe that
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.200
that's right I really believe that
that's that's the most pessimistic

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
that's that's the most pessimistic
 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.899
that's that's the most pessimistic
proper statement the worst-case outcome

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
proper statement the worst-case outcome
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.270
proper statement the worst-case outcome
in the worst of all possible worlds is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
in the worst of all possible worlds is
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980
in the worst of all possible worlds is
that your life could be tragic but not

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
that your life could be tragic but not
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560
that your life could be tragic but not
hell and that's a lot better than hell

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
hell and that's a lot better than hell
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.020
hell and that's a lot better than hell
right it's it's you think I could give

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
right it's it's you think I could give
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.310
right it's it's you think I could give
you an example of the difference you're

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
you an example of the difference you're
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.630
you an example of the difference you're
at your mother's deathbed

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
at your mother's deathbed
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.330
at your mother's deathbed
well that's tragedy here's another

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
well that's tragedy here's another
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340
well that's tragedy here's another
scenario you're at your mother's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
scenario you're at your mother's
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.050
scenario you're at your mother's
deathbed and all you you and all your

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
deathbed and all you you and all your
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.199
deathbed and all you you and all your
idiot siblings are arguing well that's

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
idiot siblings are arguing well that's
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.820
idiot siblings are arguing well that's
the difference between tragedy and hell

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830
the difference between tragedy and hell
 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.710
the difference between tragedy and hell
and you might be able to tolerate the

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720
and you might be able to tolerate the
 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.730
and you might be able to tolerate the
first circumstance in

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740
first circumstance in
 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.870
first circumstance in
maybe it would even bring you closer

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880
maybe it would even bring you closer
 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760

second one no one can bear that you walk
 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040
second one no one can bear that you walk
away from a situation like that sick of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050
away from a situation like that sick of
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.930
away from a situation like that sick of
yourself and sick of everything else too

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
yourself and sick of everything else too
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.520
yourself and sick of everything else too
and you know it's often the case that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
and you know it's often the case that
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.220
and you know it's often the case that
tragic circumstances bring out the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
tragic circumstances bring out the
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.190
tragic circumstances bring out the
Dragons because the stress is high and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200
Dragons because the stress is high and
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.390
Dragons because the stress is high and
all those things that people haven't

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
all those things that people haven't
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.210
all those things that people haven't
dealt with they don't have the energy to

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220
dealt with they don't have the energy to
 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.550
dealt with they don't have the energy to
repress and and all the bitterness comes

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
repress and and all the bitterness comes
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.150
repress and and all the bitterness comes
pouring forward it's like seriously man

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160
pouring forward it's like seriously man
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.710
pouring forward it's like seriously man
you know so that's actually a good

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
you know so that's actually a good
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.240
you know so that's actually a good
it's a rough lesson but it's a good

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
it's a rough lesson but it's a good
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.860
it's a rough lesson but it's a good
hallmark for figuring out whether or not

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
hallmark for figuring out whether or not
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.320
hallmark for figuring out whether or not
you're you've got yourself adjusted

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330
you're you've got yourself adjusted
 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.360
you're you've got yourself adjusted
properly and in relationship to your

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370
properly and in relationship to your

who is dying could you manage it if the

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110
who is dying could you manage it if the
 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.020
who is dying could you manage it if the
answer is no looks like well put your

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030
answer is no looks like well put your
 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.650
answer is no looks like well put your
life together

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
life together
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.690
life together
because it's going to happen and you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
because it's going to happen and you
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.040
because it's going to happen and you
should be the person who's there that
