We call the following problem that we considered earlier.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.350
You have a source of textual data, a Document, with a file system interface,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.250
which we call the FileManager. You have a resizable viewing window

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.980
resource capable of displaying lines of text which we call the ViewPort.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.720
And you have a controlling device which we call the ScrollBar capable of

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.790
selecting a discrete value via handle, where the purpose of it

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.140
controlling which lines have actually appear on the screen. The objective of,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.820
of this case study is to specify the properties of a text browser,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.870
choose an architecture, and assemble the components together
