00:00:01.634 --> 00:00:02.602
- And action, Adam.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.137
- Aloha.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.639
It's the original beach boy
himself,

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.441
me, Adam DeVine.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.210
Last year, I took my house party
to New Orleans,

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.378
where I took over a bar,

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.314
but this year--
no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.751
I'm taking over a resort
in freaking Hawaii.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.787
- Um, excuse me?
[snaps fingers]

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.488 align:start position:0%
What's going on here?

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.525
- I'm introducing my show,
"House Party," right now.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.492
- No.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:27.660
- We are currently doing the--

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.529
- I am here to tell you

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:32.131
that you are currently
not doing that.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.366
- We are, though.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.201
- No, you are not,
because guess what?

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.170
You're not supposed
to start filming your show

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.204
until tomorrow.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.539 align:start position:0%
Okay?
This space is reserved

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.774 align:start position:0%
for a wedding today,
so you will have to wait.

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:44.410
I'm so sorry.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.146
- I'm getting married
during the show.

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.582
It's a comedy show/my wedding.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.419
- So--so you're the groom
in the Kahananui wedding?

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.823
- Yep.
So, this is my wedding.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.324 align:end position:100%
Okay?
Anyways.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.826
Like I was saying, last year I--

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.294
[sound cuts out]

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.029
- She unplugged the sound, dude.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.230
- Hey, Adam.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:05.264
I'll be watching you,

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:07.500
and I can unplug your show

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.770
at any time.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:12.205
- Jesus Christ.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start position:0%
Can you--plug it back in.
Just...

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:19.245
- "House Party" Hawaii, baby!
