1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:01,480
Okay.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,660
All right, great. You're
listening to radio,

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,770
the podcast from New York
public radio and public radio.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:12,710
W. Y. C

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,460
n n p. R. Hello Chad here
every, this is radio lab,

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,190
the podcast coming to you now with, uh,

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,310
not one of our big hour long situations,

8
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:26,600
but rather one of those in-betweens
that we do, uh, between seasons.

9
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,370
Our next season is about two months off
and one of the programs that we're going

10
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:36,371
to be presenting is about people who fall
in love with science and then fall out

11
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:40,010
of love with science.

12
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,550
And in that spirit we thought we'd
play a conversation for you now,

13
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:48,530
which is more on the falling in love
side. Robert Krulwich, my esteemed cohost,

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,120
who you are here in just a moment,

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,150
recently interviewed maybe one
of the greatest scientists alive,

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,500
really e o Wilson. He is a
biologist. He's an entomologist,

17
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,430
meaning he studies bugs. He's an
author, a world famous conservationist.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,130
He recently started the,
um, encyclopedia of life,

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,350
which tries to make a list of
every single species on the planet.

20
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,990
Pea discovered so many things
about how animals communicate,

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,460
which you'll hear in a moment,
particularly ants. And, uh,

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,340
if you heard our emergence show,
you will recognize a bit, uh,

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,480
from that show that repeats
in this conversation.

24
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,630
But it's really cool to hear the whole
conversation that too many edits,

25
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,460
which is where I'm going
to play for you now.

26
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,651
So here it is.

27
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:38,910
Here's Robert Chromebooks speaking with
e o Wilson at the 92nd Street y here in

28
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:43,070
Manhattan. I see. I prefer to, for
starters, I'm just curious. Um,

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,320
what did you know,

30
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,000
do you remember the moment when
you said the word scientist? Comma,

31
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:54,710
I want to be one, not shy, I
guess anthem biologist. You know,

32
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:58,700
I just wanted to work on that
entomologist blog. Oh yes.

33
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,440
When I was about eight or nine,

34
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,940
I discovered that there were people
who actually made their living, uh,

35
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,070
chasing bugs. Uh, and, uh, you know, I,

36
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:12,440
I every kid has a bug period. I've just
set now, I'll never to grow out of mine.

37
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,080
Your right of what you said. And
I, uh, down in Alabama we had, uh,

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,950
people who are driving around in green
trucks for the Department of Agriculture

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,850
and Sullivan were
exterminating intersects and I,

40
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:30,200
they were made their living by finding
and studying bugs. I said, well,

41
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,330
that's what I want to do. Nevermind
being a fireman or anything like that.

42
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:38,840
I don't want to do that. Kill
by. I was, yeah, I was, uh, uh,

43
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,760
I was frozen in that, uh, in that
ambition at the age of seven,

44
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,370
five, eight or nine or nine when I really
shuttled down four with [inaudible].

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Okay. Now did, did,

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,240
did science sees you or did science
rescue you cause you were you,

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,310
how many schools did you go to before
you were the, of 14 or whenever it was?

48
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,260
Ah, yeah, it was about, uh,

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,930
13 or 14 schools and 11
grade. I skipped one grade.

50
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,350
Well that made me always
the runt of the class,

51
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,320
which didn't help see what the run
social skills and new kid every,

52
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,500
a new kid in the neighborhood.
Yeah. So that means what now?

53
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,790
Do you have a choice here? You could
be the class clown or something,

54
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:27,700
or you could go off into the forest and
make friends with a worm or something

55
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,750
like that. Well, yeah, I guess
that's the way of looking at it. Uh,

56
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,770
I turned into, um, nature
in the woods and so on.

57
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:40,771
And then I discovered that this extra
intricity made me a socially acceptable in

58
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:41,860
an odd way.

59
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:46,500
So I had the nickname bugs when I
was in my grammar school hanging,

60
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,530
but then I had a snake period
as snake period. And, uh,

61
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,150
this was in southern Alabama,

62
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:57,151
I guess I was about 15 or 16 by that
time and there were about 40 species of

63
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,720
snake sound down there. And then
a period of time, about a year,

64
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:05,860
I managed to find them all. I kept a
lot of them in the back yard alive.

65
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:10,060
And so I was now known
as Snake Wilson. Uh,

66
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,930
it wasn't because in this
intense football culture,

67
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:16,690
I went out for football at this point, uh,

68
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:21,691
at the Bruton high school in
Alabama and I weighed 112 pounds.

69
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:27,050
I was second light as kid there
probably couple of snakes. Have you

70
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,790
[inaudible] story. I A I,

71
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,150
you're a tough competitor anyway. I,
uh, so, uh, it turns out your three,

72
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:37,751
there was, uh,

73
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,751
there were 23 people on the squad
and I was entire third string.

74
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,360
But anyway, I got respect
in part because, uh,

75
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,450
I was doing all these
strange things and, and uh,

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,820
Alabamians are really, uh,

77
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,350
they're really very tolerant
of eccentricity. They
kinda like it, you know,

78
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:04,030
the old odd, the aunt that lives up in
the attic and you know, that Kinda thing.

79
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,950
I got along very well, uh,
both as a naturalist, you know,

80
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,951
fanatical collector and naturalist at the
[inaudible] then in high school to any

81
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:18,340
rate. Um, so I, at the age of 16,

82
00:05:18,341 --> 00:05:22,080
I decided that the time had come to
get serious about professional with the

83
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,400
biology. And so, uh,

84
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:29,401
I decided to select the group of
insects to study and I said flies.

85
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,140
They have marvelous, tremendous diversity.

86
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,840
And so I would start collecting flies.

87
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:39,790
I wanted to become the
world expert on slides,

88
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,340
but the year was 1945. And
in order to study flies,

89
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,140
as many of you understand,
you have to have insect pins,

90
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,000
special pins to put through the
body of the specimens. It'll still,

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
insect pins are were available at that
time only from checklists of Akio and the

92
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:05,330
supply had been cut off in the United
States in check. Pins were unavailable.

93
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,060
So I said, what's my favorite
group of insects? You know,

94
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,250
I don't have to stick pins
through and that the ants,

95
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,460
so I got started my collection by going
down to the drugstore and collecting

96
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:23,570
these little pill bottles
and that was rubbing alcohol,

97
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,720
which is ICO protocol. Alcohol got
massed in my collection started.

98
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,310
I built a large collection of events
that I took with me to the University of

99
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,583
Alabama.

100
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,000
Could you say that launched,

101
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,830
but for the permit that for lack of
pins and for the availability of rubbing

102
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,310
alcohol,

103
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,580
therefore ants or wears aunts always
going to be it and you would've gotten to

104
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,060
it by whatever route or,

105
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,430
well, I think I eventually
would've ended up with anch,

106
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,920
but I would've been retarded there.

107
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't think I would've been able to
do serious research until maybe I was

108
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,300
Jean. Um,

109
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,770
now let's get onto the joy of, of this
may not be obvious to other people.

110
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:06,380
The joy of an studies cause
you know if you think about it,

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,850
they do seem like somewhat indifferent
to anyone that was observing them and so

112
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,600
on and that you might not wonder exactly
why somebody would get delight out of

113
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,900
looking at ants. But I want to
take you back to one moment,

114
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:19,700
which I think is one of my favorites ever.

115
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,350
The question is how do these little
ants communicate with one another?

116
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:27,080
The year is 1953 and you're
considering the problem.

117
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,060
We know that at least for us,

118
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:33,350
most of our communication goes because
of things we hear or things we see.

119
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,110
This does not seem to
be the habit of ants.

120
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,860
So you have some fire ants and the
question is you noticed that they,

121
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:46,870
that a scout will go find a piece of
food and somehow tell the other mans,

122
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,130
look what I found. Come
here and get the food.

123
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,410
How do you figure out how the scout
aunt tells the other aunts were that a,

124
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,230
there is food and where
it is. We had the idea,

125
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,350
even back then people did biologists
that the ads were somehow laying a trail

126
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:06,080
down and then they were telling the
other ants go out and follow that trail.

127
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,320
But nobody knew where the trail came from.

128
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,290
And I didn't know really how it worked
and I didn't know how ants communicated

129
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,750
otherwise. And you're perfectly right.

130
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,100
Human beings are really
unusual along with birds. They,

131
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,890
we are audio visual and, and uh,

132
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,920
and that puts us in a tiny minority
of all of the creatures on earth,

133
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,850
which are primarily chemical
in their communication.

134
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,370
It wasn't understood or
appreciated at that time.

135
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,920
Pheromones in many of you who've
heard the word pheromones,

136
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,250
pheromones are the key to understand the
communication of the vast majority of

137
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:46,450
the animals species. We didn't
know it then. And uh, so, uh,

138
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,780
one day I set out,

139
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,350
I was culturing fire ranch than in
the laboratory at Harvard and I said,

140
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,440
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

141
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,990
And the way I did it was
to, uh, dissect these tiny,

142
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:02,910
tiny, it's very difficult to do,

143
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:06,480
but I just selected them and we just say
[inaudible] so you're watching the aunt

144
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:10,320
going along and it's laying on its
abdomen or some part of its body is mainly

145
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:11,640
off the ground. That's right.

146
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,670
I can see the ant running along and
under magnification I can see that it's

147
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,890
sticking out sting and dragging the thing.
Something's coming out of that sting,

148
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,070
like kind of like a fountain pen or
something through little bit like that.

149
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,300
Yeah. And uh, so, uh, I proceed to, um,

150
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,060
believe me folks, this is
the way science goes. I mean,

151
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,620
it really is simple minded.

152
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,610
It's only later when you're doing
the technical paper, you know,

153
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:43,020
and you're producing the mathematical
models and you're describing the micro

154
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,660
analysis and so on that it
looks tough. It's really,

155
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:48,360
this is the way of thinking when
you're doing something. So I said,

156
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,070
I'm going to find out what the organs are
inside this hat and I'm going to track

157
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:57,690
down where that stuff is coming from.
So what I did was to do and that to me,

158
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,770
and then, uh, you know, just detected,

159
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,590
I knew approximately what the different
glands were and so on, when you snip,

160
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,010
you snipped off the part where
the glands, where you see there,

161
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,770
well you just detect open or you
opened it, you know, and, and uh,

162
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,900
and just the way you would in the animal
or it's exceedingly difficult when it's

163
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:21,150
about the size of a great assault.
That's the tough part. But anyway,

164
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,290
aren't your hands going [inaudible]
well, yes, your hands is vibrating.

165
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,650
And in fact, it was down at the limit.
I didn't go to a micro manipulator,

166
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:32,160
you know, which is when you're doing
it with me and controlled. And, uh,

167
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,420
I did it raw manually, but
it was right at the limit.

168
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,670
So the way I did it was I got
these very fine needles in, uh,

169
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,150
and because there was this
inevitable vibration in your hand,

170
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,910
you can see it when you put it in
a microscope. Everybody has it.

171
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,430
It's a little vibration, but
the highly magnified it. Uh,

172
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,700
it allowed me to use a needle like
a Jack Hammer. I could jack it.

173
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,940
I could do it if I did it just right.
You know, and just open up the anthem.

174
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,330
Anyway, I took out the various
organs, one after the other,

175
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:08,310
and I made a preparation and I made an
artificial trail and we waited a second.

176
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,680
Make strains, follow this. You know,

177
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,640
I've got like six organs and you've got
the smooshed each one of the six organs

178
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,650
and then you're going to take, let
me just see if I remember this.

179
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,360
You're going to take a a sharpened
Birchwood applicator stick.

180
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,980
Yes. And then I smeared out
one organ after another.

181
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,850
No effect. Well, where are there
ants? Are there answers? Yes.

182
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,310
You have brought in. Why? I'm leading,

183
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm leading my artificial trails from
the colony that I have in the lab,

184
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,890
so they're ants over here.

185
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,120
You got your birch stick here and
you're drawing lines of gut stuff,

186
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:45,630
I guess basically what it is.
Yeah, just an or different organs.

187
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:48,780
I've watched each one in
turn and then smeared it out.

188
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,830
And finally I came to a
little finger shaped organ,

189
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,530
which we didn't know the function of
his at the tiny little thing talk down

190
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:01,000
there and I mirrored that out
and incredible. It wasn't,

191
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,630
I didn't have to tell them to follow
that trail. They exploded out of them.

192
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:08,520
This running along that thing. And does
that mean like if you'd taken the stick,

193
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,800
could you go, did you, did you,

194
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,450
did you do it when all the wheels
would go droop, do, do, do, do, do, do.

195
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:15,420
Well I what I actually have, I
started playing around with this.

196
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:18,240
It was so effective for demonstrations.

197
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:23,241
I would write my name and a column of
102 hundred three a hundred ants would

198
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:29,721
come pouring out back and forth and
they'd actually write my name and I am so,

199
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,910
well that was the beginning. I, you know,

200
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:35,520
just to show that there is
some seriousness to this.

201
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,380
That was the beginning and we
were able to defended aunt lovers.

202
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,433
We were in the roof.

203
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:41,290
Alright,

204
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,470
now I want to finish this little section
because this is my favorite story of

205
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,410
all. When you get bad, you get bad.

206
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,830
This is once you begin to figure out
how these chemicals and the fear and the

207
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,600
smells that they give off the
com communicating devices,

208
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,090
you discover that when an aunt dies,

209
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,270
this doesn't happen to be exactly
in a category. One man dies,

210
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,970
aunts not being the
smartest creatures around.

211
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
It just sorta dies and it just sits
there and for the first day or two,

212
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,180
all the other ants just don't
even notice it. And then,

213
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,470
and when the deans to decompose,

214
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,850
it begins to give off a smell and then
the first time it gives off a smell.

215
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:18,160
I guess the next ant
that passes by goes whoa.

216
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,560
And says we have a dead aunt here.

217
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,460
And he takes the hand and puts it
in the dead place, I guess the aunt.

218
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,060
Yeah, dead place. Yeah.

219
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,910
I'll tell you about the experiment
because I had a lot of fun with it,

220
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,111
but first,

221
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:36,111
but let me show you that
my chemist colleagues and I
quickly worked out that the

222
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:40,440
chemical code of the ants, we found
somewhere, or a good part of it,

223
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:45,300
we found that the answer communicating
somewhere between 10 and with tens of 20

224
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,710
chemical signals,

225
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,020
they have glands all over their bodies
as at the functions which were unknown.

226
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,160
And many of these glands produce
pheromones, you know, some for two alarms,

227
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,870
some the recruit, some to
identify themselves as a
member of a cast and so on.

228
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,660
And one of them says, I am dead.

229
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,850
I am, I'm coming to that.
Uh, well how does an ant,

230
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,020
when it dies, how is it
identified as you say, you know,

231
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:16,090
the others know when an aunt dies
then for a while it just lives there.

232
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,790
You know, if we fall, wish all one of
us just lying on the ground like this,

233
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,450
we'd probably do something. Maybe
not do it in New York, but I mean

234
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,880
usually we do something because you
know, we're audio, we're audio visual.

235
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,920
But in the case of the ads in New
York, most aunt likes city in America.

236
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,350
Anyway, go ahead Eddie. Right. The um,

237
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,950
so the aunt against the decompose,

238
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,110
and I was really going crazy with
this. We were still successful. I mean,

239
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,690
we were making one discovery after
another. It was wonderful. And uh,

240
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,340
I was going crazy with the show. I said,

241
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,790
how does an an identify a corpse?

242
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,320
It's got to be in this,

243
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,410
the substances that are being produced
by decomposition, it's gotta be,

244
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,970
and in those days we had just
hit upon animal behaviors,

245
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:15,971
generally had just hit upon
the idea assigned stimuli
that animals don't grasp a

246
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:20,360
whole lot of stimuli
the way we do, you know,

247
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,510
an assess the gestalt in a variety of
signals when they usually work out of one

248
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:32,920
substance or a very small number of
substances or a site, and then that,

249
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,940
that releases their a complex
behavior. So I was going to find that.

250
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,260
What's the corpse substance?
It turns out, well,

251
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,970
this is how science works across.

252
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,760
It turned out that for some
reason I never found out.

253
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,180
The chemist had already identified a large
number of decomposition substances in

254
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:59,000
rotting insects. And so
with that as my guide,

255
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:03,860
I gathered in pure form on my laboratory
shelf, a whole variety of them.

256
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,140
Uh, and uh,

257
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,520
the place for a while filled
like a combination between a, uh,

258
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,590
an outhouse and a choroidal house. Cause
there were, you send me the smells,

259
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,480
you'd have rotten spit smell
that know rancid body smell.

260
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,540
Yeah. That's uh, that's uh, the uh, uh,
fatty acids that you have in volume.

261
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,370
When we were walking up the
corridor at your, in your building,

262
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:32,300
what did they like stay? I
never tried to explain to them.

263
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,280
Uh, but there was, it was, it was a,
a very strange smelling place. Uh,

264
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,760
you know, skate coal with, uh,
one of the comments. That's,

265
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,540
that's the essence of
theses. Yes. Well, any rate.

266
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,080
I then started with my, you
know, a typical experiment.

267
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,430
I started dobbing dummy aunts with tiny,

268
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:57,431
tiny amounts of these different substances
and observing and nothing happened

269
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,040
until finally I came to one of the
substances oleic acid who leak acid is a

270
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:09,490
fatty acid of a particular
kind. Bingo. The, uh,

271
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,600
then picked it up and
the dummy with nothing,

272
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:18,620
but the only signal they had was a leak
acid and a took it and dropped that

273
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:23,210
dummy on the refuse pounds. And so
I had it and essentially had it.

274
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,380
Now here's where you get bad. Ah, yeah,
that's a trait. Okay, well, you know,

275
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:28,970
you get to play around at this point.

276
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,690
So I said what would happen if I
put a Lia, cast it on a live amp?

277
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,250
What happens is that
nothing, this aunt says,

278
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,270
if they said anything, you
know, nothing. The ad does, uh,

279
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,410
does any good because now it is a
course and the other ants pick this live

280
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:53,310
kicking ant and I'll, it goes and
it's dropped on the refuse path.

281
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,480
So it's a weekly,

282
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:58,440
obviously alive and perfectly healthy and
the other aunts thinking, you're dead,

283
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,950
you're dead, you're dead all the
way to the great bye. Goodbye.

284
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,120
What happened then was that the ant would,
uh, proceed to clean itself, answer,

285
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,090
always cleaning themselves and finally,

286
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,490
but if it didn't clean itself
enough when it got back,

287
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,540
picked it up and brought out til finally
as clean enough and then it can reenter

288
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:21,771
the realm of the living of I you have
one sometimes describe the process of

289
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:25,760
science as you do it as,
as a form of story telling.

290
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,750
[inaudible] what did
you mean by that? Well,

291
00:18:29,751 --> 00:18:32,720
I mean I think it's everyone
here understands that, um,

292
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,840
human beings are the
storytelling species. We,

293
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,410
the way we think is a
narrative. You know, we built,

294
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,760
we build scenarios forward hole and
we, when we're making a decision,

295
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,280
we're running one scenario.
After another forward,

296
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,190
we're telling a story to our
shows. I'm going to do this,

297
00:18:49,191 --> 00:18:52,410
that will then that will follow and
joins. What? We'll probably do this and,

298
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,730
and I will lose that, or, oh,
gain this or I will finish that.

299
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,140
And they tell stories of real
past what happened to me.

300
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,310
And then of course, this allows
them to make fictional stories.

301
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:10,730
Uh, the scientist tell stories and
he hopes it will be true stories.

302
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,950
He's thinking, oh, there's
this, there's that, uh,

303
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,640
this creature is doing this.

304
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,500
That creature must be detecting
this or have a bald instruction way.

305
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,210
And then they make you make a series of
story and these are called hypotheses.

306
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,390
And the fancy term then for doing
science by storytelling is a,

307
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,920
the method of multiple competing
hypotheses. And then you figure,

308
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,090
you do the experiments to
find out which of the two,

309
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:39,260
which of the stories is true

310
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,110
[inaudible]

311
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,530
that was a conversation between
e e o Wilson and Robert Krulwich,

312
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,340
my cohost, and let us know
what you thought. Radio

lab@wnyc.org is our email address.

314
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,240
Want to thank the 92nd street y
for making that available to us.

315
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,930
Also want to thank as always
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

316
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:14,740
the corporation for public broadcasting
and the National Science Foundation for

317
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:15,760
making all of this possible.

I'm Jad Abumrad thanks for listening
to this, a podcast from Radiolab.

320
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,810
Hope you enjoyed it.
See in a couple of weeks

321
