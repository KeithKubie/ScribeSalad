LUKE MENAND: That was great.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.640
Dan Gilbert is an
incredibly talented writer.

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:20.870
A lot of the hard part is, as
he says, finding the voice,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.903
who you are on the page.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.500
That's what readers
want to encounter.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.320
Mainly, I'm going to make some
comments that merely repeat

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.930
and underline what has
already been said because this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.570
is all excellent advice.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.360
One thing that Angela
said is important

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.030
is that as academics, we like
to read books about books.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.220
But most people like to
read books about people.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.464
It really is important to think
about the ideas that you're

00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:58.880
writing about, and the material
that you're writing about,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.150
in the context of human
beings because that's

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.810
what readers respond to.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.410
In my view as an
historian, there's nothing

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.030
dumbing down about that.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690
Because it just is the
case that human beings

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.150
are part of the world of
art and ideas that we cover.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.180
If we include that
in our story, we're

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.300
going to enrich it in
every possible way.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.320
Secondly, also something that
Angela said and been repeated

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.740
is that also readers
like a story.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.450
We're not trained to
do that, most of us

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.480
in our scholarly writing.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.480
That's just not the way
a journal article reads.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.220
But again, there's
nothing wrong with turning

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.670
what you have to
say into a narrative

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.320
because people like to follow
it in the form of a story.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.040
Those are two things that
aren't the way we normally

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.450
would approach a subject
for an academic audience

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.480
but are important for a
more general audience.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.080
The final thing is that people
are interested in people.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.621
And people are
interested in stories.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.400
But they're also
interested in you.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.820
They want to get to
know you as a writer.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.050
In my experience, I put
very little of myself

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.070
into my writing.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.900
I'm very stingy about it.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.350
I don't think it's really
about autobiography,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.700
or confession, or anything.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.997
It's about having a
personality in your writing

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:22.580
to make people want
to read more of it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
and get to know you
a little bit better.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.760
Malcolm Gladwell
is genius at that.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.100
Adam Gopnik is great at that.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.680
It's part of what you
need to do to put yourself

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.630
in front of readers.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.990
They become interested in
you and fascinated by you.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.440
And they want to read more
of what you're writing.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.750
The second thing I wanted
to talk about a little bit

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.150
was this question
about the money.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.210
I don't think any of
us want to write trade

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.000
books to make a lot of money.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.700
Very, very few people
who write trade books

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.810
make significant
amount of money.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.980
I wrote a book that was
called The Metaphysical

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.087
Club that was a bestseller.

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:03.420
It took me 10 years to write it.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.610
If I amortized how much
money I made off that book,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.237
it was not worth
10 years writing.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:08.570
I didn't write it to make money.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.110
I wrote it because I
wanted people to read it.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.790
I'm sure that's
true of all of us.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.860
The important thing is
that you're reaching people

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.860
and that you're spreading
what your knowledge is,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.560
what your ideas are, to people
who normally wouldn't encounter

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.450
them.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.560
One way to think about
that, for a long time

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.630
I used to work at The
New York Review of Books.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.620
The way we thought
about writing there

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.600
was to think about writing an
article or review on a topic

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.780
that you knew a lot
about and thinking

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.650
of your reader as somebody in
another academic department who

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.630
knew nothing about that subject.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.200
Your reader is
very well educated.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.075
Your reader is probably
smarter than you are.

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:49.560
But your reader doesn't know
anything about the subject

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.840
that you're writing about.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.620
That's a good target audience,
I think, for the kind of books

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.770
that we want to write.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.850
Because we want people
who are intelligent,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.590
educated, interested, but
ignorant of our subject.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.980
If we can reach
those people, you

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.640
can often think about
that as a colleague

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.510
in a different department.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.051
If you can reach
those people, you're

00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:11.266
going to reach a
much larger audience.

00:04:17.043 --> 00:04:19.209
This is the third point,
and it's a little connected

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.209
to what I just said.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.370
The New Yorker has a
million subscribers.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.390
If you write a book that
5% of those people buy,

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.210
you'll have a bestseller.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.110
Who are those people?

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.530
Those people are smart people.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.600
They're educated people.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.520
They're intelligent people.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.100
They're mostly doing something
else besides reading books

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.660
or doing the kind
of stuff that we do.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.470
Those people are people
who don't know a lot

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.760
about what we know a ton about.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.130
When we write about our
research in an academic venue,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.310
we mostly want to appear smart.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.250
And we appear
smart by not saying

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.310
things that are obvious to
other people in our field.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.800
We have a very
complicated mechanism

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.730
for sorting out things
that might sound

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.450
banal or apparent
to people who are

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.460
our peers, our scholarly peers.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.640
That doesn't work at all
in the non-academic world

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.100
because you're
dealing with people

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.620
who don't know a whole lot
about what you're writing about.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.590
Things that are obvious to us
are not obvious at all to them.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.600
They need to be told.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.760
But they need to feel smart.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.380
It's a very important
part of getting

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.004
readers interested
in what you're doing

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.670
is it makes them
feel intelligent.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.460
You have to devise,
and this is, I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.110
think, the trick for writing
for a place like The New

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.760
Yorker or The New
York Review of Books,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.110
you have to devise a
way of saying things

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.640
that are completely
obvious in a manner that

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.800
doesn't make it seem as though
you're talking down to people.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.170
If you write a sentence in the
sort of standard magazine style

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.400
and say something like,
Charles Sanders Peirce

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.630
comma the 19th century
American philosopher comma,

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.310
that's talking down to people.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.480
Because you're
assuming that they

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.654
don't have any idea
who Charles Peirce was.

00:06:10.654 --> 00:06:12.070
But you don't want
to assume that.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.560
You want to make them feel they
had heard of Charles Peirce

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.060
and they know who
Charles Peirce is.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.450
So you say, like
many 19th century

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.450
American philosophers comma
Charles Peirce had a beard.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.430
OK?

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.101
Then they think, oh, yeah,
I knew he was a 19th century

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:25.976
American philosopher.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.780
It's not that you're not
explaining everything.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.820
You're explaining everything in
a way that sounds by the way.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.580
You don't have to
explain the obvious.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.780
But you do, you just
have to insert it

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.075
in a way that makes people
feel good about their reading.

00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:44.200
Everything else that these
people up here have said

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.962
is great advice.

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:47.670
I think maybe the best
thing for us to do

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.300
is just try to answer
some of your questions.
