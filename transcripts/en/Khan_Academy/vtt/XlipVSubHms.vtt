00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.390
- [Instructor] The snow
outside piled so high

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.230
that we couldn't see thorough the window.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.110
All right, so over here they've listed

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:09.910
a bunch of words that
sometimes people confuse.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.090
Or even if you read it real fast,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.130
you might read it the wrong way,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.190
or you might write it the wrong way

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.650
if you're doing it really quick.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.483
What we want to say

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.610
is that we couldn't through the window.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.270
This right over here, this says thorough.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.350
Thorough means to do something completely,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.850
to do something really
well, to do it thoroughly.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.010
So this right over here, we
don't want to write thorough.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.760
We want to write through.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.060
So we look at the choices here.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.160
So we definitely want to change it,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.290
so we're not gonna pick that.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.430
And so this is the word threw,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.830
but this sounds just like the word we want

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.960
but it's a different word.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.750
This is T-H-R-E-W.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.810
This means the past tense
of throwing something,

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.810
throwing a ball.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.040
He threw the ball.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.890
So that's not the type
of through that we want.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.960
This one over here, it
has a lot of letters

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.690
in common with through.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.020
But this doesn't spell through.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.630
This spells trough.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.340
Trough is kind of where kinda animals

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560
might get their water from,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.820
or it's sometimes viewed as
a low point in something.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.600
It is not through.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.890
So this is not true.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.940
This is trough.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.930
This right over here is
the through that we want.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.150
We want this through.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.073
This means to go through something.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.180
The snow outside piled so high

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.583
that we couldn't see through the window,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.763
T-H-R-O-U-G-H,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.920
through the window.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.510
This type of threw, throw a ball.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.520
This is trough.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.380
And what was originally
there, that was thorough,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.880
to do something kind of
really, really completely.
