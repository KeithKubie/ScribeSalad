00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.969
Now even scientists have a hard time counting chromosomes that

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.140
are just disorganized like this. We know now that there are

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.330
46 chromosomes in here somewhere, but obviously trying to see

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.000
which one is which can be difficult. So what we want

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.690
to do is what scientists do, which is try to

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.710
find them and line them up in order of biggest to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.360
smallest. And I'm actually going to give you a little taste of

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.820
that here. And I'm actually going to try to organize them

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.450
by literally cutting and pasting them one-by-one.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.299
[NOISE]

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.660
Okay, so this was my very amateur job at trying

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.610
to organize these chromosomes in order, from biggest to smallest. You

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.730
can see it, there's some imperfections here. I probably didn't

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240
get it right, because this isn't my job. This isn't something

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.910
I do on a regular basis. Well let's take a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.170
look at how scientists actually would put them in a row.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.050
Okay, so, here's what it looks like if a professional

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.970
scientist, who works with chromosomes and knows what they're doing here,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.240
if they cut and paste them and organize them. they'll

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.129
get ordered in this way. So i want you to pay

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.140
really close attention to all the chromosomes that you see here

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
and see if there's any kind of pattern that stands out

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.090
to you. What I want you to tell me is if

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.200
you see nay pattern that stands out in all of these

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.690
chromosomes when they're ordered in this fashion from biggest to smallest.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.430
Try to think of an answer, one or two word response

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.060
if possible, and put it in the text box here.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
Don't worry so much about getting this question right or

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.750
wrong. Just try to look for any pattern that you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.060
see, and then put it in the text box here.
