MARTIN OMANDER: My guest
today is Pascal Jaillon,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.290
who leads the developer
program at the start up Magnet.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.500
Pascal, welcome to the show.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.640
PASCAL JAILLON: Thank you.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.140
MARTIN OMANDER: So
Pascal, would you

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.830
tell us a bit about
the startup Magnet?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.000
PASCAL JAILLON: Yes,
so Magnet offers

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.030
a suite of products
for developers

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.600
to build great mobile
applications-- apps that

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.055
take full advantage
of all of all

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:26.810
the powers of
those minicomputers

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.270
that we now carry
in our pockets.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.120
MARTIN OMANDER: Yes, good.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.972
So what Google Developer
products do you work with?

00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:36.180
PASCAL JAILLON: So we develop
for Android, obviously.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.700
And we use all the tools
that Google can provide,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.880
from know the
Mini-SDKs, the older

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.460
versions, the IDEs, the
[? generators, ?] everything.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.980
Nowadays, developers
don't really try,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.410
or having anything to say about
the version or the platform

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.210
that the users will use for
the mobile applications.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.570
So at Magnet, we make
sure we can develop apps

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.587
for all those devices
in the nature.

00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:06.170
MARTIN OMANDER: So
I haven't heard you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.340
say the word "platform" yet.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.130
But I suspect that
the word will come up.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.050
And I'm a developer, and
I think many developers

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.410
with me get a bit nervous
when we hear the word

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.880
"platform," because it entails
going to a new code base.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.010
You don't know the and
weaknesses and strengths

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.300
of this new platform.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.800
It's a bit scary, honestly,
for a developer to go

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.480
with something completely new.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.602
How do you address those
concerns from developers?

00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:35.060
PASCAL JAILLON:
Yeah, well totally.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.580
People, developers, want
to try it first, right?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.560
So the bigger the platform
you're building, the more,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.540
actually, you have to cut that
into pieces, into components,

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.960
that can be actually tried
and used independently

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.790
from each other.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.050
So that that's exactly
what we did at Magnet.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.450
We are addressing
different pinpoints

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.540
that developers have, from
connectivity, to real time

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.160
messaging, to
remote persistence.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.500
And each of those
pinpoints is addressed

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.500
to a different products.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.780
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, so a
developer can dip their toe in,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.940
and use one or two of
these, without going

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.600
whole hog with your platform.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.070
PASCAL JAILLON: That's right.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.444
And it's very
important that they

00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:13.760
can try it, play with it, for--
typically, our new messaging

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.670
solution, we are hosting
a version in the cloud,

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.340
so they can just
use it, and see how

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.430
it works before they
can decide to adopt it

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.300
in their own product.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.500
MARTIN OMANDER: Building a good
developer experience is hard.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.310
I mean, we try to do
it here at Google.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.100
And you're doing it as well.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.130
It must have taken
lot of iterations

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.470
before you had something
that was ready to ship,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.496
I'm guessing.

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:36.620
PASCAL JAILLON: Absolutely.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.950
And it was very important
for us to understand

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.470
how developers
actually work, how they

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.400
develop the mobile application.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.800
So we need to understand
closely the way

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.440
they work to build your
product that actually addresses

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.640
the pinpoints.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.360
So focusing on the key
pinpoint is important.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.230
And then, in the case of
rest2mobile, the first product

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.350
that addresses the
connectivity, we

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.500
realized, to keep the
developers in the flow,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.240
it was better to actually
build a plug-in for the IDEs

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.830
as opposed to perhaps a
competitive solution, where

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.827
using the web browser to
download the full SDK,

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.410
we wanted to do that
within their IDEs

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.700
to keep the developers
inside their IDEs

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.280
where they are productive,
and doing all the coding.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.100
MARTIN OMANDER:
You mentioned IDEs.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.410
Developers use many
different IDEs on Android.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.610
How did you deal with that?

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.485
PASCAL JAILLON:
Right, so also, we

00:03:30.485 --> 00:03:31.860
wanted to make
sure that they had

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.520
the same experience across
multiple IDEs, also on iOS,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.290
on Xcode.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.030
So we ended up
doing a lot of work,

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.680
more work than we
intended first.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.610
But we've got IDEs for--
we picked Android Studio,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.610
because that's the official--
I think-- by Google.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.720
And as a bonus, we
got that to work

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.860
with IntelliJ, because it's
a [INAUDIBLE] code base.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.110
But we also built
a command line tool

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.952
for automation,
and for developers

00:03:58.952 --> 00:03:59.910
who are not in the IDE.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.795
And we built another
plug-in for Xcode.

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:05.320
It was more work on our
side, but, all good.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.010
MARTIN OMANDER: And
one for Eclipse.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.510
PASCAL JAILLON: You
can use Eclipse.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.560
But we don't have to a
full plug-in for Eclipse.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.860
But our command line
tools helps developers

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.120
who are in Eclipse
to generate the code

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.329
in their mobile applications.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.245
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:23.660
So where are seeing the most
Android developer interest?

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.420
Are people moving
to Android Studio?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.600
Are they still on Eclipse?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.050
PASCAL JAILLON:
We see the switch

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.610
happening to Android Studio.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.570
It's a great IDE.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.580
It works really well.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.150
The experience is great.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.460
They get a lot of the
feedback and the work

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.870
that was done with
IntelliJ IDEA,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.530
so that's definitely
a great place

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.140
to start building
Android applications.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.260
MARTIN OMANDER: When I
download this plug-in

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.440
from my [INAUDIBLE] and
install it in my IDE,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.180
what happens then?

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.050
How does it help
me, as a developer?

00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:03.220
PASCAL JAILLON: With this
first product-- again,

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.710
rest2mobile-- we want
to help the developer

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.590
build their connected apps--
to connect their mobile apps

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.940
to REST APIs, to REST services.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.760
It's a little bit complicated.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.830
You have to deal with remote
connection to a server.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.264
You have to deal
with JSON payloads.

00:05:20.264 --> 00:05:22.680
MARTIN OMANDER: For the network,
anything on the network--

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.740
it can time out.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.740
PASCAL JAILLON: Exactly.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.781
[? I'm ?] working with
some offline capabilities.

00:05:26.781 --> 00:05:30.585
So we wanted to offer those
capabilities out of the box,

00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:31.210
with a plug-in.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.080
So we do code generation.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.087
And I know that code generation
sometimes has a bad reputation.

00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:38.670
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah,
code generation.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.140
When I hear that,
I get suspicious.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.660
It will be code I can't touch.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.140
Magic code that, if I
touch it, it'll break.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.732
I can't easily regenerate it.

00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:48.190
PASCAL JAILLON:
Yeah, and we wanted

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.710
to make sure that that was not
a concern for the developers.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.620
So we generated the
best code we could,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.690
made sure that the
code that ends up

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.780
being in your mobile
apps is as good as what

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.440
you would have done by yourself,
if that were written by hand.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.680
But we take all the
burden out of your hands.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.090
We create this
code for you, make

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.586
sure it's
[? unitest ?] friendly.

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:08.960
It comes with
[? unitest. ?] It's

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.460
refactoring friendly, something
that the app won't decompile

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.220
just once.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.500
There is a full life cycle.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.720
So being able to
refactor, to make changes,

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.870
that was super important,
and we addressed that

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.674
with our plug-in.

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:22.590
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.980
So when building for
the Android ecosystem,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.340
what lessons have you learned?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.620
And what experience
would you like

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.950
to share with other startups in
a similar position to you guys?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.785
PASCAL JAILLON: So
definitely, Android

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:39.880
is more open than
iOS on the app side.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.039
So that's, good because
there are more documents,

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:44.830
more documentation.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.470
It's a bit easier for us to
build these kinds of plug-ins.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.380
At the same time, there
are multiple IDEs,

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.260
as you said earlier.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:57.990
So we had to address different
platforms, different IDEs,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.250
and build for
different code base.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.040
It was not the case on
the Xcode side, when

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.400
we built the plug-in for Xcode.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.930
But at the same time, we
had much less documentation,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.210
so we had to look at other--
like, Github projects,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.330
and work with other projects
to understand how to that,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.334
to offer the same experience
for other mobile developers.

00:07:17.334 --> 00:07:18.250
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.400
Thank you for coming
in here, Pascal,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.700
and sharing your experiences
with us, and our viewers.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.241
PASCAL JAILLON:
Thanks for having me.

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:28.100
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.620
you can use in your startup.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.030
Your input matters.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.620
Please leave your
comments below.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.280
We read everything you write.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.550
To learn how Google
can help your startup,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.860
go to
developers.google.com/startups.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.160
If you would like to
be a guest on the show,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.010
go to bit.ly/applyrootaccess.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.185
That's it for now.

00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:52.470
See you next time.

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:56.420
