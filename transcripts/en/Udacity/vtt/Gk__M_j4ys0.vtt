00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.670
To illustrate how joinable threads work, let's take a look

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.762
at a very simple program. We first create a thread,

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:07.853
and then we can't be sure what's going to happen

00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:11.230
next. Perhaps the main thread will keep control and print

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.250
his hello message, or perhaps the created thread will get

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.860
control and print his hello message. It's indeterminate. In any

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.490
case, however, the main thread is going to execute this

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.370
join procedure. It specifies which thread it wants to join and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.190
gives an address where the return value can

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.390
be passed. Only when the created thread is

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.450
finished will the pthread_join call complete. So we

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.880
can be sure that Done will be printed last.
