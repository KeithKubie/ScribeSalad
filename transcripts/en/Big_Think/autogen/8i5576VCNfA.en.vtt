the interesting thing about trying to
 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.810
the interesting thing about trying to
unravel the laws of nature is that yes

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820
unravel the laws of nature is that yes
 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.260
unravel the laws of nature is that yes
we have found some laws we understand

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270
we have found some laws we understand

now what theoretical physicists do is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039
now what theoretical physicists do is
 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.080
now what theoretical physicists do is
the following

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090

they try to learn what we know so far
 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.090
they try to learn what we know so far
and they try to see where the limits of

and they try to see where the limits of
 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.210
and they try to see where the limits of
today's knowledge lie and they try to go

everything are so extreme that the laws
 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.060
everything are so extreme that the laws
we know they break down and that is why

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070
we know they break down and that is why
 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.840
we know they break down and that is why
both these that is one reason why both

at for a long time gravity has told us

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360
at for a long time gravity has told us
 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.480
at for a long time gravity has told us
that nothing can escape the

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490
that nothing can escape the
 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.969
that nothing can escape the
gravitational grip of a black hole but

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979
gravitational grip of a black hole but

then in 1976 or 75 professor Stephen

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970
then in 1976 or 75 professor Stephen
 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.590
then in 1976 or 75 professor Stephen
Hawking discovered that it was not the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600
Hawking discovered that it was not the
 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.170
Hawking discovered that it was not the
case that actually things could escape

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180
case that actually things could escape
 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.440

black holes how did that come about

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
black holes how did that come about
 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.960
black holes how did that come about
picture yourself in outer space there is

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970
picture yourself in outer space there is
 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.510
picture yourself in outer space there is
a black hole right in front of you you

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520
a black hole right in front of you you
 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.520
a black hole right in front of you you
don't see anything no light can come out

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530
don't see anything no light can come out
 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.490
don't see anything no light can come out
of it so it's like a dark patch that

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500
of it so it's like a dark patch that
 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.399
of it so it's like a dark patch that
distorts the the stars that are around

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409
distorts the the stars that are around
 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.160
distorts the the stars that are around
but there is this dark patch right in

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170
but there is this dark patch right in
 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.050
but there is this dark patch right in
front of you and you're far away and you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060
front of you and you're far away and you
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.880
front of you and you're far away and you
look at it and it's scary and you don't

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890
look at it and it's scary and you don't
 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.580
look at it and it's scary and you don't
want to get closer which is normal but

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590
want to get closer which is normal but
 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.929
want to get closer which is normal but
and respectable but what you know is

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939
and respectable but what you know is
 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.490
and respectable but what you know is
that gravity is not everything the

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500
that gravity is not everything the
 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.589
that gravity is not everything the
matter that surrounds you the light that

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599
matter that surrounds you the light that
 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.800

law they obey quanta

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
law they obey quanta
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.479

world and everything we had known about

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519
world and everything we had known about
 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.589
world and everything we had known about
black holes until the mid-1970s was only

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599
black holes until the mid-1970s was only
 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.390
black holes until the mid-1970s was only
related to gravity

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
related to gravity
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.580
related to gravity
now what Hawking did at the mid-1970s is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590
now what Hawking did at the mid-1970s is
 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.160
now what Hawking did at the mid-1970s is
to add some quantum aspects to all this

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170
to add some quantum aspects to all this
 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.030
to add some quantum aspects to all this
he took a quantum particle and threw it

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
he took a quantum particle and threw it
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.190
he took a quantum particle and threw it
in his mind towards the black hole to

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
in his mind towards the black hole to
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.050
in his mind towards the black hole to
see what would what would happen to it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060
see what would what would happen to it
 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.349
see what would what would happen to it
and it found out that some part of that

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359
and it found out that some part of that
 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.559
and it found out that some part of that
particle was getting out of the black

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569
particle was getting out of the black
 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.030
particle was getting out of the black
hole that the black hole was evaporating

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
hole that the black hole was evaporating
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.970
hole that the black hole was evaporating
it was not the exact same particle he

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
it was not the exact same particle he
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.399
it was not the exact same particle he
has sent inside and that was that that's

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409
has sent inside and that was that that's
 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.259
has sent inside and that was that that's
what's tricky about this problem and

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269
what's tricky about this problem and
 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.180
what's tricky about this problem and
that's what's interesting about this

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190
that's what's interesting about this
 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.460
that's what's interesting about this
problem in the way that means that the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470
problem in the way that means that the
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.099
problem in the way that means that the
information gets bleached by a black

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109
information gets bleached by a black
 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:08.580

why is that you you could imagine that

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829
why is that you you could imagine that
 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.250
why is that you you could imagine that
it's the same with an encyclopedia that

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
it's the same with an encyclopedia that
 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.199
it's the same with an encyclopedia that
you would throw in the fire and you take

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209
you would throw in the fire and you take
 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.539
you would throw in the fire and you take
an encyclopedia you throw it in the fire

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549
an encyclopedia you throw it in the fire
 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.990
an encyclopedia you throw it in the fire
it's gone well not quite if you could

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000
it's gone well not quite if you could
 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.599
it's gone well not quite if you could
get back the ashes if you could collect

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609
get back the ashes if you could collect
 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.140
get back the ashes if you could collect
all the lights that was shown during the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150
all the lights that was shown during the
 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.360
all the lights that was shown during the
the fire if you could get the heat and

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370
the fire if you could get the heat and
 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.729
the fire if you could get the heat and
everything you could build back the

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739
everything you could build back the
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.339
everything you could build back the
encyclopedia it's not gone it's just

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349
encyclopedia it's not gone it's just
 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.610
encyclopedia it's not gone it's just
difficult to retrieve for black hole

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
difficult to retrieve for black hole
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.220
difficult to retrieve for black hole
it's worse if you throw an encyclopedia

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230
it's worse if you throw an encyclopedia
 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.229
it's worse if you throw an encyclopedia
inside what the black hole will

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
inside what the black hole will
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.409
inside what the black hole will
evaporate has nothing to do with the

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419
evaporate has nothing to do with the

Encyclopedia whatsoever you could have
 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.879
Encyclopedia whatsoever you could have
thrown in something else so why is that

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889
thrown in something else so why is that
 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:51.780
thrown in something else so why is that
a problem

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790
a problem
 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.349
a problem
it is a problem because it means that

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359
it is a problem because it means that
 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.050
it is a problem because it means that
our universe has memory losses it means

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
our universe has memory losses it means
 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.469
our universe has memory losses it means
that whatever a black hole has swallowed

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:00.479
that whatever a black hole has swallowed
 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.259
that whatever a black hole has swallowed
would get inside never get back out and

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269
would get inside never get back out and
 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.809
would get inside never get back out and
we would never be able to understand the

we would never be able to understand the
 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.879
we would never be able to understand the
past of our universe there are some

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889
past of our universe there are some
 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.689
past of our universe there are some
things that are not not retrievable at

things that are not not retrievable at
 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.449
things that are not not retrievable at

maybe and if it's gone where did the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810
maybe and if it's gone where did the
 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.600
maybe and if it's gone where did the
information go about the the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610
information go about the the
 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.790
information go about the the
encyclopedia where did it go we don't

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800
encyclopedia where did it go we don't

and that's a problem because that's

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409
and that's a problem because that's
 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.399
and that's a problem because that's
called non unitarity that's the

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409
called non unitarity that's the
 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.769
called non unitarity that's the
static technical term for it and it

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:34.779
static technical term for it and it
 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.669
static technical term for it and it
means that you do not you cannot use

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:38.679
means that you do not you cannot use
 

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:42.839
means that you do not you cannot use
physics to understand the history of

physics to understand the history of
 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.359
physics to understand the history of
what happened before in a sense the

information paradox says that physics is

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009
information paradox says that physics is
 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.249
information paradox says that physics is
not going to give you the history of our

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259
not going to give you the history of our
 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.949
not going to give you the history of our
universe and you can fairly easily

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:52.959
universe and you can fairly easily
 

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.829
universe and you can fairly easily
understand that scientists did not like

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:55.839
understand that scientists did not like
 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:59.339
understand that scientists did not like
that idea and people are still working

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349
that idea and people are still working
 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.350
that idea and people are still working
today on the way out of that problem

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360
today on the way out of that problem
 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.109
today on the way out of that problem
there are some solutions that have been

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:04.119
there are some solutions that have been
 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.459
there are some solutions that have been
put forward none that I believe is

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:07.469
put forward none that I believe is
 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.049

sufficiently convincing mathematically

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:10.059
sufficiently convincing mathematically
 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.719
sufficiently convincing mathematically
to be considered the proof but people

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729
to be considered the proof but people
 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.489
to be considered the proof but people
have been working on that information

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:14.499
have been working on that information
 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.919
have been working on that information
loss paradox problem since 1975 1976 and

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:18.929
loss paradox problem since 1975 1976 and
 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.009
loss paradox problem since 1975 1976 and
in a sense maybe that the answer to that

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:23.019
in a sense maybe that the answer to that
 

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.679
in a sense maybe that the answer to that
question will come from this theory of

00:05:25.679 --> 00:05:25.689
question will come from this theory of
 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:33.110
question will come from this theory of
everything that everybody is looking for
