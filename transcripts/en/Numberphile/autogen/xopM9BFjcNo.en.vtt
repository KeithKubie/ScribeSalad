can<00:01:04.019><c> learn</c><00:01:04.199><c> how</c><00:01:04.409><c> to</c><00:01:04.439><c> do</c><00:01:04.680><c> this</c><00:01:04.830><c> and</c><00:01:05.479><c> I</c><00:01:06.479><c> often</c>

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 align:start position:0%
can learn how to do this and I often
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.820 align:start position:0%
can learn how to do this and I often
explain<00:01:07.320><c> about</c><00:01:07.530><c> this</c><00:01:07.830><c> in</c><00:01:08.460><c> the</c><00:01:08.640><c> school</c><00:01:09.830><c> it</c>

explain about this in the school it
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.300 align:start position:0%
explain about this in the school it
gives<00:01:11.100><c> you</c><00:01:11.250><c> some</c><00:01:11.520><c> sense</c><00:01:11.820><c> of</c><00:01:12.000><c> victory</c><00:01:12.270><c> in</c><00:01:12.750><c> the</c>

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 align:start position:0%
power of mathematics and I'll go with
 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:30.830 align:start position:0%
power of mathematics and I'll go with
Nick<00:01:25.880><c> there</c><00:01:26.880><c> you</c><00:01:27.030><c> are</c><00:01:27.180><c> ready</c><00:01:27.750><c> he</c><00:01:29.329><c> passed</c><00:01:30.329><c> logic</c>

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
Nick there you are ready he passed logic
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 align:start position:0%
Nick there you are ready he passed logic
so<00:01:31.380><c> if</c><00:01:31.439><c> I</c><00:01:31.560><c> saw</c><00:01:31.770><c> that</c><00:01:31.979><c> visit</c><00:01:32.490><c> to</c><00:01:32.520><c> enter</c><00:01:32.909><c> time</c>

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 align:start position:0%
so if I saw that visit to enter time
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.740 align:start position:0%
so if I saw that visit to enter time
journalist<00:01:33.950><c> that's</c><00:01:34.950><c> correct</c>

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 align:start position:0%
journalist that's correct
 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
journalist that's correct
but<00:01:37.430><c> bit</c><00:01:38.430><c> more</c><00:01:38.670><c> than</c><00:01:38.850><c> that</c>
