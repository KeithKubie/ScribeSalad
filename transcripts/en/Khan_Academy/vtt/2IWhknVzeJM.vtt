00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:03.032
- [Voiceover] Ify is
building a tree tower,

00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:06.933
which is a tower built on top of a tree.

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:09.831
The tree is currently five meters tall

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:13.181
and Ify has found, I don't
know if it's Ify or Ify,

00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:15.015
and Ify has found that it is growing

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.945
by zero point one meters a month

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.225
or a tenth of a meter a month.

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:21.862
The tower is currently two meters tall.

00:00:21.862 --> 00:00:24.226
So this tower that sits
on top of the tree,

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:27.948
is two meters tall
currently and Ify, or Ify,

00:00:27.948 --> 00:00:31.509
adds to it at about zero
point two meters a month.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.695
So, I guess, he or she, I don't know,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.998
Ify, let's just say, "he."

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:40.107
Is continuously building this tower

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:43.632
on this continuously growing
tree, which is fascinating.

00:00:43.632 --> 00:00:47.204
Alright, the function A
of m, returns the tree's

00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:50.590
height in meters and months from now.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.827
Fascinating.

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:54.390
The function B of m,
returns the tower's height

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.051
in meters and months from now.

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.453
So, this is the tree's height,
A of m, is the tree's height.

00:00:58.453 --> 00:01:01.215
B of m is the tower's height.

00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:03.981
Find the formula of the two functions.

00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:06.337
So, A of m, so they tell us the tree

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:08.185
is currently five meters tall.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.293
So, it's going to be five
meters tall right at the start.

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:16.293
And then every month it is
growing by zero point one meters,

00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:21.874
so it's going to be five
plus zero point one times m.

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:24.642
And this m here, this is not meters,

00:01:24.642 --> 00:01:25.718
this is actually the months.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:29.461
Remember, m returns, m
is the number of months.

00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.699
So after zero months,which is right now,

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:33.527
well this is just going to be five.

00:01:33.527 --> 00:01:35.417
After one month, it's
going to be five point one.

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.368
After two months it's
going to be five point two.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.593
Which is exactly what we want.

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:41.946
Alright, now let's think about the tower.

00:01:41.946 --> 00:01:43.817
So, the formula for B of m,

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:46.365
so the tower is currently two meters tall.

00:01:46.365 --> 00:01:47.941
So, it's currently two meters tall

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.941
and it grows at two tenths
of a meter per month.

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.719
So, two tenths times the number of months.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.489
And once again, this m right
over here is not meters,

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:00.477
I'm not writing the units here,

00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:04.060
we're just assuming whatever
this returns is in meters.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.667
This m right over here is the
number of months that pass by,

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.550
the number of months from now.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.085
Alright, the function C of m
returns the vertical distance

00:02:14.085 --> 00:02:17.188
between the ground and
the top end of the tower.

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.473
Makes sense, that would be
from the bottom of the tree

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:21.511
to the top of the tower.

00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.927
Wright the formula, C of m,
in terms of A of m and B of m.

00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:28.786
Well the total height is going
to be the height of the tree,

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:33.462
which is A of m plus
the height of the tower.

00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:37.346
Plus B of m, plus B of m.

00:02:37.346 --> 00:02:39.325
That's what C of m is going to be.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:39.899
And then they say,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.615
"Wright the formula of
C of m in terms of m."

00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:44.301
Well, we just need to
add these two functions.

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:46.543
So, if we add five plus zero point one m

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.040
to two plus zero point two m,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.671
that's going to be, we
could add five plus two,

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.859
and we'er going to get seven, plus,

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.577
and if I have point one m
and I add another point 2 m,

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.000
that's going to be point 3 m.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Zero point 3 m, and we are done.

00:03:04.544 --> 00:03:06.609
And we got it right.
