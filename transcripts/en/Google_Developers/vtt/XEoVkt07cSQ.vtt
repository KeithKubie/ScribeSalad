SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Welcome
everyone.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.360
My name is Scott.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.480
I'm a software engineer on the
map rendering team in Seattle.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.760
JONAH JONES: And I'm Jonah, I'm
the design lead for Maps.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.670
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Today
we're going to cover

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.180
four different things.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.050
First, we're going to try to get
you inspired to create a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.660
map of all your own.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.670
Second, we're going to cover
three design principles that

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.880
lead you through the process of
creating the perfect map.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.250
And then we're going to cover
some building blocks that are

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.170
all the different ways that
you can change the

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.540
map to what you want.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.620
And lastly, we're going to
combine the design principles

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.920
with the building blocks and
put it into practice.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.220
JONAH JONES: All right.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.640
So what is the perfect
map for your site?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.150
Is it the standard Google map?

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.340
Is it a colorful map?

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.690
Is it a monotone map?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.010
Is it a subtle map?

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.890
Or is it something else?

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.010
Old Maps Online let you find
historical maps and libraries

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.310
around the world.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.750
And they've got a map
that really feels

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.780
historical and old.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.330
They've got a faded color
palette, they've got this cool

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.590
kind of grain effect that
you see over the top.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.250
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: They're going
to be at the Maps Sandbox

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.720
outside after the session,
as will we.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.250
JONAH JONES: And Trulia
have also done a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.850
really good job of this.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.140
This is their house search
that you can see here.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.630
And they've got colors
that are very

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.280
harmonious with their brand.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.610
They've also kind of the
de-emphasized the roads and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.020
other information that the
users don't care about.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.000
And they've emphasized the data
that they really want to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.320
present, which is the green
house process you see here.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.910
Now Trulia actually did some
usability studies on their

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.080
map, and it turned out that
users really care about the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.300
position of parks in relation
to the houses.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.730
So they made sure that they
were very emphasized.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.520
And you can meet them at the
Maps Sandbox after this

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.110
session as well.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.470
And speaking of Trulia, this is
their new commute time map.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.530
This is pretty cool, too.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.200
They've got a black marker in
the middle you can see here.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.790
And then the green places are
places that you can access

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.130
quickly from here.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010
And the orange places
are places that take

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.160
a little bit longer.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.580
And this shows the versatility
of this kind of faded base map

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820
that they've got, that they
can overlay information

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.940
harmoniously on top.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.750
So to answer, what is the
perfect map for your site,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.680
there are three things
that you're

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.930
going to need to consider.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.740
The first is to remove
unnecessary information.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.110
The second is to refine the
data that you have left.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.930
And the third is to test
multiple zooms and regions.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.620
And I'm going to take you
through each of those in turn.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.790
So to remove unnecessary
information, the first thing

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.510
you need to consider is,
what is the message

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.140
that you want to convey?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.920
And who is the audience
that you want to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.490
convey the message to?

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.430
Now once you know the message
and the audience, think about

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.360
all the information you need to
convey to them and remove

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.110
everything else.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.660
So here's a good example.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.620
This is our New York map that
we have today on Google.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.020
This is pretty general
purpose.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.180
We've got a lot of different
information on here.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.710
We've got road colors
to convey the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.590
different types of road.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.000
We've got some highway
badges you can see

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.970
running down the left.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.620
We've got one-way arrows
all over the streets.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.790
We've got points of interest.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.210
You can see little buildings
and stuff.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.750
We've got parks.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.360
We've got transit data.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.520
There's a lot of different
things on here.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.760
But when a user goes to the
Layers menu and turns on the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.030
Transit layer, then we have a
pretty clear signal that the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.840
user cares about
public transit.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.560
So in this case, we can remove
some of the driving

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.580
information.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.840
We've taken away the
one-way arrows.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.750
We've taken away the colors
on the streets.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.570
We've taken away the
road badges.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.680
And now when we've added the
public transit lies on there,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.390
you can see that they stand out
a lot more than they would

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.190
have done if we'd kept all the
other colors on the map.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.780
Now if we take that to its
logical extreme, we could

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.640
actually remove pretty much
all the other information.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.390
So here we've dropped away
a lot of the businesses.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.120
We've taken away the parks.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.430
We've taken away all of
the street labels.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.690
And now the public transit
information really, really

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.330
stands out, not because we've
done anything special to the

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.760
public transit, but just because
we've removed all the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.490
other unnecessary information.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.020
So it's a very focused
map now.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.120
So we've taken away all the
information we don't want.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.040
What's the next thing to do?

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.500
It's to refine the data
we have left.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.230
So to do this, you need to take
into consideration what's

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.660
the important data that you want
to convey, and what's the

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.670
data that's more kind of
background context

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.640
information?

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.250
And then choose the colors
and the styles

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.090
appropriately to that.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.255
So your primary information,
you want to make sure it

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:43.650
really visually pops.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.980
And then all of the rest of the
information kind of sit

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.250
back and don't take too
much attention.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.870
And while we're on the subject
of colors, a good color

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.760
scheme, obviously, is something
that you want to

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.670
take into consideration, first
to be harmonious with the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.970
general brand of the website
that you're putting it on.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.330
And second of all, color can be
really powerful in creating

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.370
an emotional response
with your users.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.820
So if you're going to create a
bright versus a dark map, or a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.030
very colorful or colorless map,
that can really resonate

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.190
with your audience in
a different way.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.890
So we'll take you through a
couple of examples again.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.720
Here's a map we quickly
created for

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.300
San Francisco parks.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.540
And you can see here that we've
pretty much removed all

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.940
the labels except for
the park labels.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.930
So that's removing the
unnecessary information.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.390
And then we've made sure
that the parks are

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.700
very prominently colored.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.990
So that's the first thing that
you see, and all the other

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.430
information like the roads, and
the background, and the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.010
water and stuff is really the
background information.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.370
And we've picked a really nice
kind of positive, vibrant

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.060
color scheme here, so this feels
very natural and good.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.200
And I'll contrast that
with another map.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.010
This is a map all about
San Francisco roads.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.970
Now the information we've
removed this time is

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.100
everything except for
the road labels.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.590
And the roads themselves
are dark.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.040
They're very, very prominent.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.800
And in general, we've just
chosen a kind of

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.940
heavier color scheme.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.140
So the overall map feels a lot
more serious and more somber.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.490
Going back to Old Maps Online,
you can see when we see the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.100
map now in the context of the
overall site, the whole

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.360
experience is very,
very on brand.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.540
Old Maps Online is all about
feeling historical, so they've

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.630
got this kind of faded color
scheme, like all the yellows.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.120
And the map really, really
fits in well with that.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.030
And Trulia have the
same story.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.780
Their overall website
[? chrome ?] has got kind of

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.850
light greys and light blues,
and that's their general

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.140
background color that you
see mirrored on the map.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.290
And then they have this bright
green that they're using as an

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.365
emphasis color for the important
information, first

00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:40.535
of all, on the website itself,
but also on the map.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.850
And the last thing that you need
to consider is make sure

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.000
that the map works in different
zooms and different

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.040
regions around the world.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.900
So you can see here that
at far zooms, the main

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.920
information we've got are around
countries and country

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.140
labels, borders, sometimes you
can see the major highways.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.070
When you move into the
medium zooms, new

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.630
information is appearing.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.900
You can then see neighborhoods,
you can see

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.640
geographical features like
national parks and things like

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.260
that, and the road layout is
actually a very important

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.680
thing here.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.670
So you can really see the
difference between the orange

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.420
highways and the yellow
arterial roads here.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.110
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Arterials
are the roads that

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.360
travel through a city.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.770
Generally pretty wide,
may have a median.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.670
JONAH JONES: By the time we
get to the deep zooms, the

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.310
things we're really paying
attention to here are the 2D

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.160
building footprints, and we've
got some 3D buildings.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.970
You can see some points of
interest around here.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.080
And we've got lots of new
information that appears at

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.700
the very deepest zooms.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.720
So it's worth making sure that
you check your map for all of

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.750
these different zoom levels.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.222
You can easily imagine that you
could create a map that

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:49.460
looks great in San Francisco
and push that out, and then

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.800
you've forgotten to include
something that appears at a

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.870
very deep zoom.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.550
So what we would really
recommend is designing your

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.450
map for the deep zoom, and then
kind of let it degrade

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.090
gracefully as you zoom out,
because we generally tend to

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.050
take things away as we zoom out,
rather than add things.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.250
Now speaking of deep zooms,
here's a deep zoom here of

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.680
Turkmenistan.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.060
Now this is quite interesting.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.270
You can see that the data
here is super sparse.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.050
So hardly any of the
roads have labels.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.230
We've got a very small
smattering of building

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.395
footprints, and of building
information.

00:08:24.395 --> 00:08:27.710
We've got one rail line that's
running through that.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.690
Now compare this with the exact
same zoom in Tokyo.

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:33.299
This is crazy busy.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.490
We've got 3D buildings
all over the place.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.500
We've got underground
information, we've got traffic

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.909
lights, we've got
business icons.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.169
We've got things all
over the place.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:47.360
So it's a good idea, again, to
design for this rich data case

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.110
and then have it degrade
gracefully.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.720
You don't want to be designing
your local area, which maybe

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.320
doesn't have all
the information

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.780
that could be elsewhere.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.260
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Right, and in
the case of Turkmenistan, we

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.620
have Mapmaker in that country
and many other countries of

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.760
the world, and so users
can go and add

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.050
information at any time.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.600
So you must think about the case
where they have lots and

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.420
lots of data.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.300
JONAH JONES: And Japan leads
us to another interesting

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.760
issue, which is of local
conventions.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.280
So in many countries around the
world, we use localized

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.910
iconography and colors.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.290
So in Japan, for example, you
can see here that they use

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.260
green highways.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.920
And this might be quite
different to what you're used

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.640
to seeing if you're looking at
a map of Europe or America,

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.020
where you see all highways
are orange.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.100
And the UK's another
example of this.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.540
You can see that in the UK,
we've got these blue highways.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.770
So it's worth bearing this
kind of thing in mind.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.110
If you're going to be changing
styles and colors, it might be

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.110
affecting local users in a way
that you might not first

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.360
anticipate.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:53.030
So remember, remove the
unnecessary information,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.470
refine the remaining data,
and test it for

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.740
multiple zooms and regions.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.660
So I've given you a little hint
of the things you need to

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.620
think about to create
your perfect map.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.700
Now I'm going to hand you over
to Scott, who's going to

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.800
explain to you how to do it.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.900
SCOTT SHAWCROFT:
Thanks, Jonah.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.150
So Jonah went over the three
principals that can help guide

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.570
the design of the map.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.880
I'm going to cover the three
different things to consider

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.850
when thinking about how
to implement the

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.270
design that you want.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.110
The first thing are stylers.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.280
Stylers are an object or thing
that takes in the existing

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.240
style of the map
and mutates it.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.710
It either does that by taking
the input values and tweaking

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.580
them, or just overriding them.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.880
Once you can do that, you need
to be able to restrict what

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.050
you style on the map.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.460
And there's two ways to
do that restriction.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.940
The first is with feature type,
and the second is with

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.200
element type.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.870
Now let's go into those
in more detail.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:00.510
So stylers, again, they mutate
the existing style of the map.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.270
Many of them are relative, so
we'll go through those first

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.710
and then get to the more
powerful ones.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.560
The first relative styler that
we have is the hue styler, and

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.360
it takes all the colors of the
map and tints them to one

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.760
specific color.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.240
That doesn't mean that it
changes the lightness.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.660
It just means that everything
is tinted towards,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.940
in this case, red.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.850
We also have saturation.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.310
This changes the intensity
of the color for

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.530
everything on the map.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.680
Here we're removing the
color altogether

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.450
using negative 100%.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.460
You can also increase this.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.740
We also have lightness.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.090
This changes the overall
lightness, again, by

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.190
percentage.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:48.580
And there's two other related
stylers to lightness.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.720
The first is gamma.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.080
Gamma lightens and darkens the
map just like lightness does,

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.170
but has a great property of
leaving whites white and

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.620
blacks black.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:02.600
This means that your labels our
labels that typically use

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.450
black and white will
be preserved.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.160
They'll still be readable.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.540
And we also have invert
lightness.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.480
This changes the colors from,
say, a light orange to

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.330
something that's
a dark orange.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.730
This is great if you have a
dark-themed website, or want

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:26.690
to give a feeling of nighttime
without losing the color

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:30.110
scheme of a typical
Google map.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.580
So those are all relative
stylers.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.800
They've taken in a color, and
they produce another color.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.420
Let's talk a little bit
about more powerful

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.670
stylers that we have.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.580
The first is visibility.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.760
Here you can see I've destroyed

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.930
the map to some degree.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.260
There is no map anymore.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.270
I've turned everything off.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.550
This is a convoluted example,
but it proves the point.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.420
This is extremely, extremely
powerful, and I can't

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.340
reiterate this enough.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.020
In the first step of the design
principles, which is

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.920
remove all unnecessary
information,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.630
this is your tool.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.780
Use it, and don't be scared to
use it even more so than you

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:14.780
might have thought.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.145
You can always bring something
back in later stages.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:25.300
In addition to visibility, we
have a new styler called wait.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.690
This was just added today, we're
really excited about it.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.350
And this changes the thickness
of both the inside of roads

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.400
and the outside of roads, and
any other features that are

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.890
represented with a line.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.710
So that's available today.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.760
Also available today is color.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.150
Color sets the RGB color of
all the things that you've

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.000
selected to that color.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.940
You can see here, again, I've
gone a little bit extreme and

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.090
changed the entire map to red.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.530
But it's very, very powerful,
and it's a great tool to get

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.570
the map to use the precise
colors that you want for your

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:10.390
brand, or the precise colors
that you want to

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.960
complement your data.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.070
If you want to take it back a
step and only use it in a

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.450
refined way, here's an example
where I've just changed the

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.430
water color to white.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.700
This is a great tool if you want
to move the user's eye

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.580
towards the land rather than
the water, because the blue

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.930
that we have the water typically
can really draw the

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.720
eye away from the land.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.960
So that's a new feature
today, color.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.790
We're really, really, really
excited to see what you come

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.560
up with, this new, powerful
styler that we've introduced.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:52.740
Now let's go into how you can
use these very powerful

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:59.220
stylers in limited ways,
as I've done here.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.600
The first way to do it is by
selecting a feature type.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.760
So features are any place on the
map, and what we've done

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.690
is we've categorized them.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:12.010
Today I'm going to talk about
the top categories in our

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.880
hierarchy of features.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.380
Some types have subtypes that
allow you get more granular.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.500
So let's dissect the map of San
Francisco that we've been

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.750
using for stylers.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.060
The first feature type we have
is "administrative" features.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.165
These are things such as
cities and provinces.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.260
We have "poi's" This is short
for point of interest.

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:42.030
This includes things such
as parks, coffee shops,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.970
hospitals, and there's also
subtypes to this that will let

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.230
you get more granular.

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:50.430
You'll see us use that later.

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.850
We also have type "road." This
is all of the roads that cars

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:59.340
can travel on, in addition
to foot paths, which are

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.010
typically in things
like parks.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.200
We also have transit.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.960
Transit is all your
mass transit.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.770
You can see here it's rail
lines, and you can see the

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.650
BART icons, and also
the ferry lines.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.290
We have feature type
"landscape." This is the

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:17.210
background color.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.280
This is your land color, in
addition to things such as

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.650
built up area, if there is
structures in that area or

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.770
things like islands.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.890
The last type category we have
is "water." This includes

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:39.550
bays, rivers, lakes, all
that sort of stuff.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:40.800
So that's feature type.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.350
The other way that we can
break down the map is by

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.510
element type.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.090
And I think of elements as the
way we've chosen to represent

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.140
a feature on the map.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:57.840
The first way you can do that
is by selecting all labels.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.190
Here you can see we have both
symbols and icons, in addition

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.430
to textual labels that include
the names of the

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.220
features on the map.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.240
Today we're announcing that
we're allowing for subtypes of

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.990
elements, so sub-element
types.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.190
The first one that we're
introducing today is

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.170
"labels.icon." This selects
just the icon so that you

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.200
recolor them or turn them
off as you wish.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.640
We're also announcing
"labels.text." This allows you

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.900
to do the inverse and just
select the text.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.650
As you can see, it includes the
straight texts that are

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:39.090
for things like parks but also
the curved texts for roads.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:42.350
Furthermore, we're
sub-categorizing that again

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.870
into the "fill," which is the
rendering of the font, and the

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.100
name itself, and the stroke.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.800
The stroke is an outline or a
border around that text fill

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.450
that is typically used to make
the label more readable by

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.280
adding or ensuring contrast
between the

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.650
fill and the stroke.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:07.510
And also, as you can see here,
we have lots of dark orange

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.540
and light orange.

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:13.950
And those colors emphasize
which type of roads those

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.910
labels are for.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.160
So that's labels.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.540
The other thing that we allow
you to select by element type

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.580
is "geometry." This is all the
areas that you see in all the

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.160
line features that represent
things such as roads and

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.390
rivers, all that
sort of thing.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.290
Today we're also announcing
that we're allowing you to

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.450
sub-select geometry in a similar
way to text, where

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.220
this is all the fills
of all our geometry.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.300
This is really, really useful
for roads, particularly,

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.380
because the inside of the road
is considered the fill, and

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.660
the outside of the road is
considered a stroke.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:55.340
So typically, you'll get strokes
on things like roads,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.840
but you may also get
them around areas

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.240
such as land parcels.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.910
So those are all the element
types that you can select.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.150
So we've covered three things.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.130
We've covered all the different
ways you can change

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:10.050
the map with stylers, and then
we've covered the two ways

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.400
that you can dissect
the map to reduce

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.410
the impact of stylers.

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:18.050
What Jonah and I are going to
do now is we're going to put

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:21.720
both these building blocks I
just covered and the three

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.450
design principles into practice
to show you how you

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.825
can create the perfect map.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.770
So to start with--

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.400
my thumb is weak, apparently.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.880
This is how you show
a Google map.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.460
This is just meant
as an overview.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.780
There were lots of awesome
talks earlier

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.210
that covered this.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.110
Things I'd like to point out,
though, is as you can see,

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.840
we're loading the Maps
API JavaScript.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.420
We have a dot, dot, dot where
I'm going to add some more

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.790
JavaScript later.

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:56.310
And we also have a div
that is where the

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.100
map will end up showing.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:03.760
That's 640x480, and it
has an ID of "map."

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.150
So what JavaScript do we use?

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.360
What we do is we add an init
function that gets called once

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.740
the window is loaded.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.610
And then within that function,
we set the map options, which

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.210
set things like the default
zoom, the center that we want,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.500
and the base or the
map type that we

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.900
want to show by default.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.320
In this case, it's just the
standard Google roadmap.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.440
And we do that, we take those
options and we pass that into

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.380
our construction of the map
object that also takes the

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.532
development that we want
the map to show up in.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.910
So now that we've got a standard
Google map, how do we

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:45.210
make it our styled map?

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.050
Here's the changes that
you need to make.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:57.670
We need to create a styled map
type that we can use just like

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.220
any other map type.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.230
To create a styled map
type, we provide

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.640
two different things.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.040
We provide all the styles
that we want to apply to

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.660
the Google base map.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.070
This is a list of different
styles, and we'll show you

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:12.670
examples of what a style
is a little bit later.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.650
And then we also provide it
with map options, which

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.910
include things such as the
name of the map type that

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.640
you're creating.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.750
Here you can see I've also--

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.420
sorry.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.850
Now that we have that object, we
want to set our ID to that

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.120
map type object so we can
switch between all the

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.640
different types of maps,
and that's what

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.680
I've done at the end.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.670
I've also created this ID as a
constant so that we can have

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.360
the map default to it also.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.630
So that's how you use
a styled map.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.060
Here's Jonah to walk through
how you create the

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.000
design for your map.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.070
JONAH JONES: OK.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.760
So we're going to create a map
of people who like dogs versus

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.410
people who like cats
in San Francisco.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.490
So we'll say that the dog lovers
are going to be the red

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.060
dots here, and the cat
lovers are going to

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.660
be the green dots.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.040
And we've got quite a lot
of information going

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.310
on on the map here.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.610
We've probably got too
many colors, I think.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.150
We've got all the yellows of
the roads and the greens of

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.940
the parks, and that's
interfering a little bit with

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.080
the information we're
trying to overlay.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.630
And also, there's too many
labels on there, like I think

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.720
we're trying to read the labels
a little bit much.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.690
And also, the labels look
awkward with the

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.650
overlaid data on top.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:33.770
So I think what we want
is something a

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.940
bit more like this.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.820
Now here, you can see that the
information is really standing

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.880
out very prominently, and then
the background information of

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.250
the map is really sinking back
for context, and it's not

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.680
grabbing your attention.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.280
So how can we create something
like this?

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.840
We'll start back with
the base map.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.470
Now I suppose the obvious thing
to do is probably just

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.850
to desaturate this map
completely and

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.940
get rid of the labels.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.150
So let's give that a try.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.060
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: So here you can
see an example of how to

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.280
use a sequence of styles to
create the map that you want.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.490
We have two styles here.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.840
First, we have one that
has no element type

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.140
and no feature type.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.090
This means that it applies to
everything on the map, and so

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.870
we're desaturating
that by 100%.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:22.590
We have a second style that is
restricted to only labels.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.900
And for that, we turn them
all off using visibility.

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.180
JONAH JONES: OK, so this looks
all right, but it's kind of

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.300
looking a bit crude.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.900
Like something that's really
bugging me here is the water

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.250
is very, very similar color
to the parks now.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.960
So they're kind of blending
into each other.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.300
The roads are quite visually
noisy, like they're

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.540
distracting me a little bit.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.330
Like especially, you can
see the highways,

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.460
they're very dark.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.780
And it's just in general,
like there's a lot

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.510
of patches and lines.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.170
I think we can do a lot
better than this.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.840
So let's start again.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.920
And we'll go back to the
first principle.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.420
And first of all, we'll remove
some of the unnecessary

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:58.390
information.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.850
So the most obvious candidate
here is the labels.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.460
They're pretty much just there
distracting you, causing you

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.430
to read them.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.450
And we can assume for the
purposes of this example that

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.820
the users are familiar
with San Francisco.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.925
So we'll go ahead and get
rid of the labels.

00:24:15.972 --> 00:24:18.752
And that is immediately
looking a ton better.

00:24:18.752 --> 00:24:22.640
But now I'm starting to notice
a few more things, like you

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.820
can see kind of in the middle
of the map there, we've got

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.600
some brown and pink patches.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.620
These are actually the
universities and the

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.030
hospitals, and they're actually
part of the points of

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:34.330
interest, the POIs.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.620
So we don't need these for the
purposes of this demo, so

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.670
we'll get rid of those
ones as well.

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.050
And now I've just made a
mistake, because we've just

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.400
gotten rid of the parks, too.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.090
So we'll have to bring
those back.

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.430
But for the meantime, we'll have
a little look at the rest

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:49.870
of what's going on.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.610
The next most obvious thing is
these kind of dark-colored

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:54.660
transit lines that you see
running horizontally and

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:55.800
vertically.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.400
And also, you can see the little
dotted ferry lines in

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.780
the top-right corner here.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.050
So again, we don't really
need this information.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.310
We'll get rid of that, too.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:08.130
And now we've got a fairly
minimal map.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.355
I think right now, we're
probably done with removing

00:25:10.355 --> 00:25:11.930
the information.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.825
So now it's time to refine
the information

00:25:13.825 --> 00:25:15.330
that we've got left.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.820
Now the water is looking pretty
heavy at the moment.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.840
I think that's probably
the main colored

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.650
element on the screen.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.280
This is drawing our attention.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.140
So we don't really want that.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.850
I quite liked what Scott did
earlier, which was to remove

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:28.690
the water and change
it to white.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.280
So I think let's do that, and
that will give us a nice,

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.310
clean background canvas
to work from.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.050
And so this is immediately
looking a lot better.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.900
And this introduces the new
feature that we've got today

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:43.730
to recolor things directly.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.110
So now this park thing's
bugging me.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:48.040
So let's bring the
parks back again.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.190
I don't think we'd want them to
be a fully prominent green.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:52.750
So we'll just use a quiet,
subtle gray, because we want

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:55.400
them there for context and
orientation of the map, but

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.590
not to be something that
you really notice.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.720
So here's the parks added
back in again.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.500
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: As you can see,
we just have individual

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.890
styles on the left
side, typically.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.120
The expectation is that we're
adding those to the

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.280
list that we have.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.700
And so to turn on parks, we
don't need to go back and

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.060
change the POI visibility off.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.670
We can simply add another
style that selects our

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.360
poi.park, which is just our
parts and just their geometry,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.030
and then turn them on in
addition to coloring them.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.000
JONAH JONES: And again, it's
important to note, as Scott

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.730
said, we are bringing just the
geometry back in here.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.030
If we'd forgotten to include
that, then we'd have brought

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.640
the labels back in, which
isn't what we wanted.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.930
So this is now looking
fairly good.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.110
The obvious last thing to
remove now is the roads.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.080
Now we want to keep the roads
on the map because they're

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.300
good for, again, orientation,
but we don't

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.280
really need the colors.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.500
And I don't think we need a
distinction between the stroke

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.145
and the fill here.

00:26:51.145 --> 00:26:52.860
It's just adding visual noise.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:55.720
So let's simplify these.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.200
And we've just given them a
kind of grey fill here.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.110
So this is now nearly done.

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.010
I think probably the last thing
we should do here is the

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.810
roads are still looking just
that tiny little bit too

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.550
heavy, still a little bit fat.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.030
So we can refine these a little
bit further with the

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.220
new width control that we've
announced today and make them

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:17.890
a bit thinner.

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.190
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Yeah, so as
you can see here, we're

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.060
setting the weight of the three

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.800
different types of roads.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.740
What's interesting is that we're
setting the arterials

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.630
and the locals to
the same weight.

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:33.350
The reason this doesn't screw up
our hierarchy where we want

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:35.920
the highways to be fatter than
the arterials, and the

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.750
arterials to be fatter than the
local roads is because in

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.280
San Francisco, arterials are
typically separated by a

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:46.650
median, which means we actually
draw two lines next

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.690
to each other and causes them
to look fat, even though the

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.130
weights are identical to the
weight of the local road.

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.300
JONAH JONES: And this may not
be the case everywhere.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.000
In different parts of the world,
it could be that the

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.020
arterials are done as one road
instead of two, in which case

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.250
the arterial road thing we've
got here would probably need

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.350
to be 1 or 0.75, or something
like that to maintain that

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.600
sense of hierarchy.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.450
But for San Francisco
here, this is

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:14.450
looking great, actually.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:19.640
So I think we can add our dogs
and cats data back again.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.830
And this is looking
pretty good.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.620
There's one problem here, which
is that this is probably

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.960
fine to most of you, but maybe
a couple of you in the

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.510
audience are seeing something
a bit more like this.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.710
This is what you'll see if
you're colorblind, where reds

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.400
and greens, distinguishing
between them can

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.650
be a bit of a problem.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.470
So there's a few different
approaches you could use to

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.850
combat this.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.310
One good one is to just change
the brightness of

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:46.960
the red and the green.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.250
We actually do this on
our traffic layer.

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.990
Another one would be to change
the shapes, so maybe the red

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.830
things would be triangles
and the green

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.230
things would be circles.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.860
We actually considered using
cute little cats and dogs on

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.625
the map, but we thought
that was a bit cheesy.

00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:03.470
So for now we'll just give
it a nice Google I/O

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.250
themed set of colors.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:06.640
And there we have it.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.610
We've got nice map
of San Francisco.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.110
We can clearly visualize
the data on top.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.230
It's taken us about
10 minutes.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.540
That's not bad.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.310
So the next stage would
be to check the

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.960
different zooms and regions.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.285
But something I didn't mention
before is there's actually a

00:29:20.285 --> 00:29:21.560
clever little trick here
than we can do.

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.780
So I'll give you Scott back
to introduce you that.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.830
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Thank you.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.000
So Jonah and I work
on Google Maps.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.590
And because we work on Google
Maps, we have to think about

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.610
everyone in the entire world.

00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:33.290
That's a good thing.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:33.940
We like that.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.450
But it makes it really hard
to get a design that works

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.660
everywhere.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.290
In addition to that, we have
to check every zoom level.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:44.640
We have 20 different zoom levels
that we have a map on,

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.600
and a design that works
for zoom 4 may not

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.530
work for zoom 17.

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:53.990
However, you guys have a better
idea of what your users

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:58.180
want from your map, so you can
restrict both the zooms that

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.570
the user looks at, and the
places in the world that they

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.200
can see on your map.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.660
So how do you do that?

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.770
To restrict the zoom, you simply
set the min zoom and

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.140
the max zoom on the
map options before

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.540
you create your map.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.640
Here you can see I've used a
variable for my default zoom

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.920
so that if I want to change
my default, it's easy.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:27.780
That's what the zoom option on
the object is, is also the

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.810
default zoom.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.080
And then I'm just allowing
two more zoom levels

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.620
in addition to that.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.110
So that's restricting zoom.

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:38.210
Restricting the center is
a little bit trickier.

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.350
What I have here is a
LatLngBounds at the top that

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.180
the center of the view port
will be restricted to.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.750
In our example, this is a rough
bounding box for the

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.340
data that we're showing.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:56.290
And then on every center changed
event callback, we

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:59.750
take the center of the map, we
see if it's in those bounds,

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.140
and if it is in those
bounds, we're done.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.750
Otherwise we need to move
it back into the bounds.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.870
And we do that by capping the
latitude and the longitude and

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.910
then resetting the center
of our map.

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:15.770
So now that we've restricted
the zoom in the center, we

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.470
know where people are
going to look at.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.710
Jonah's design was only done
for zoom 13, so let's check

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.520
the other two zooms that we're
going to allow them to see.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.560
So this is zoom 14.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.920
It looks good.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.270
There's nothing that
we didn't expect.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.440
You can see the nice Golden Gate
Park there running across

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.130
the screen, along with the
Presidio above it.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.300
I think it looks good.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.400
So zoom 14 looks fine.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.630
However, zoom 15 doesn't
look fine.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.340
On Google Maps at zoom 15, we
introduce land parcels.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.890
And in this case, the land
parcels are really distracting

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.460
because they're adding a lot
of visual noise to the map,

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.960
which is exactly what we
tried to avoid in the

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.380
design that we did.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.210
So using the styling API, we
can simply take them off.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.560
Here you can see I've added
a style that says for

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.700
administrative features, which
land parcels are a part of,

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.260
turn them off.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.510
We don't need it.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.420
One way we could do that is by
appending it to all the styles

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.250
that I showed you earlier.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:27.260
Another cleverer way is to
do it only for zoom 15.

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.250
So how do you change the style
of the map for a given zoom?

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.320
Here's a code snippet
that I've done.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.640
You can see what I'm doing is
I'm listening for the zoom

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:41.230
changed event, and whenever I
get that, I'm changing the

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:44.600
styled map type that's
associated with

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.660
our map type ID.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.310
I'm doing that using
an object.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:52.330
So I just give it the zoom to
the object, the styles per

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.330
zoom object.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.390
I give it the zoom, and then
I'll get back the particular

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.470
styled map type that I want.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:02.500
As I explained it, the adminOff
was just an addition

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.790
to our previous style.

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:08.080
So I've used a rate
concatenation in JavaScript to

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.220
just add it to the one
zoom that we need it.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.080
So our one live demo.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.330
Here we have it all working.

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:23.070
Or no.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.320
What did I click?

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.595
If you wanted to see it all
again, here you go.

00:33:43.365 --> 00:33:45.670
All right.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.400
Don't click anything.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.930
So as you can see, this is a
live version of the demo that

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:53.850
we just walked through.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:57.350
And as I pull up, I
get constrained.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:00.050
I can't move any further.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:02.570
That's great because we then
don't need to worry about what

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.820
this looks like in some
place such as Seattle.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.260
And we can zoom in.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:10.040
Our circles stay the same.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.960
The circles are being done with
the new symbols API we

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.880
launched yesterday.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.080
And we can zoom in to zoom 15
again, and now we can't zoom

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.000
in anymore.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.150
So that's our live demo.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.670
Let's wrap up.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.340
JONAH JONES: All right.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.699
So we've given you three
principles for the design that

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:34.510
you should remember.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.060
The first is to remove the
unnecessary information.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.790
The second is to refine the data
that you have left, and

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:42.120
the third is to test it at
multiples zooms and regions

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.739
that we've just seen here.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.590
And we've also announced some
new features, which is

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:50.670
changing the weight of roads and
strokes, being able to set

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.440
the color directly, which is
awesome and very powerful, and

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.880
also being able to select
the fill and the stroke

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.840
individually.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.370
And we hope that if you use all
of these new things we've

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.680
announced today, then you'll be
able to create the perfect

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.920
map for your site.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.210
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: We can't
wait to see what you

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.330
guys come up with.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.730
Thank you for coming.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:11.210
We're excited for all
these new features.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.200
If you have questions
we'll take them now.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.140
Please use the mics because
this is being recorded.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.610
If you'd like to talk to us
personally, we're planning on

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.390
heading over to the Sandbox
right after the session.

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.580
In addition to us being at the
Sandbox, representatives from

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:27.440
Trulia, Old Maps Online,
and UbiLabs--

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.640
another awesome user of
custom map styling--

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.730
will be there.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:35.510
If you liked the session, also
please drop a +1 in the box.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:36.760
Any questions?

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.020
JONAH JONES: We have one.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:45.980
AUDIENCE: Can static
maps be styled?

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.110
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Yes.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.650
I got a thumbs up.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.520
AUDIENCE: OK, because I had an
idea where as soon as my page

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.250
loads, I show a static map.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.510
And then after half a second,
when the full JavaScript map

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.130
loads, I'd replace it,
and hopefully the

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.040
user wouldn't notice.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.080
I don't know if that
would work.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.230
AUDIENCE: So we actually
do that for you.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:06.460
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: So for those
of you watching at home, the

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.530
JavaScript API does
this trick.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:08.905
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:08.905 --> 00:36:09.565
Well, thanks.

00:36:09.565 --> 00:36:12.350
AUDIENCE: But not if you're
using a styled map.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:14.968
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: But not if
you're using a static map.

00:36:14.968 --> 00:36:15.856
AUDIENCE: Styled map.

00:36:15.856 --> 00:36:17.100
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Styled map.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.030
AUDIENCE: Not the styles.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.760
OK.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.010
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: I work on the
rendering part of it, not the

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.270
JavaScript side.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.660
AUDIENCE: So the second question
is I still want my

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:27.620
users to be able to switch
to satellite view.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.260
Can they do a hybrid with our
styled roads on top of

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.880
satellite imagery?

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.860
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Yes, you
can style hybrid also.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.170
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.420
Thanks.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:41.920
AUDIENCE: Do you have support
for transparent maps, so I

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:47.970
could, like, have labels on top
of something else I draw?

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:49.370
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: Not at the
moment, but it's something

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:50.620
we've heard from other people.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.600
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
it's important to keep certain

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.720
elements on the map for context
and orientation.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.770
And I think it would be
important at least have the

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:09.890
label California, and San
Francisco, but hide all the

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:10.840
other road names.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.710
Is that possible?

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.330
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: It's possible
to only show administrative

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:16.830
labels, such as cities.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.280
So localities are what we
typically call cities, and you

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.250
can leave those explicitly.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.880
There's no way to ensure
currently that a label such as

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.690
San Francisco alone
will show up.

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.420
AUDIENCE: So would the names of
parks still show up, then,

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:34.200
in that case?

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.510
JONAH JONES: The
parks will go.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:38.830
You'll hold on to city names
and the neighborhood names.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.390
But you can get rid
of all the parks.

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:42.790
You can get rid of the road
labels, all of those things.

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:45.310
So depending on which bucket
that it fits into, you can

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.740
turn on the big ones.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.800
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.050
That should be it for me.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.840
AUDIENCE: Can I style points
and polygons that I've

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.540
uploaded with the Google
Apps Engine?

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.880
SCOTT SHAWCROFT: There is
a separate API for that.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.580
JONAH JONES: All right.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.820
Well, we'll be around in the
Sandbox, so if there's any

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.650
questions you want to give to us
in person instead of on the

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.840
mic, we'll be very happy
to hear them.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.990
But other than that, yeah,
thanks for coming.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.010
And we're excited to see
what you come up with.
