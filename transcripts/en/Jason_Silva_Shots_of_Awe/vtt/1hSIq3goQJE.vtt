JASON SILVA: I think a lot
about the psychology of spaces,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.170
the intention of
architecture, the capacity

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.385
to design dwellings that
inform our inner world.

00:00:26.385 --> 00:00:29.375
You walk into a room, and
you start feeling better,

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:30.822
and you don't quite know why.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.094
Then you realize the
lighting, the shapes,

00:00:33.094 --> 00:00:36.370
the lines, the shadows,
everything about how we've

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.260
installed, impregnated, mind
and intention and agency

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.820
into the physical form, shows us
the ways in which architecture,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.880
in which design, is really about
the design of the inner spaces.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.360
When you design the "without,"
you design the "within."

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.620
And this is a wonderful idea.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.510
I think architects
don't get celebrated

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.845
enough in our society, because
these are the people that

00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.225
allow us to design cities,
spaces, and dwellings

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.850
in which we unfold.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.850
And if anything, architects
should work together

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.820
with psychologists
and with designers

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.940
who understand the impact of
shapes, shadows, and forms

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.750
upon human subjectivity.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.520
Design matters.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.320
Architecture matters.
