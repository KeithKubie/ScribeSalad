When we are watching movies it is easy to
spot mistakes when you are not enjoying the

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.680
film but when the film is enjoyable it’s
much harder to spot.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.130
That’s because we are so engrossed into
the story we aren’t paying attention to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.309
mistakes but that’s why we are here.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.180
To spot out these fun mistakes so you don’t
have to and can continue enjoying these blockbuster

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.180
films.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:50.449
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Mistakes
In Popular Movies That Were Caught Too Late.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.969
Captain America: Civil War

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.569
When the trailer for Captain America: Civil
War came out everyone went crazy over the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.609
inclusion of cast member Tom Holland as Spider-Man.

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.070
The shot that kept being played over and over
again is when Spidey shoots a web onto Captain

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.950
America’s shield and snatches it.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.530
Take a look at all that webbing he needed
to use to take the shield and then take a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.200
look at the clean shield when he lands.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.380
Maybe Captain America just polished his shield
and that’s why the webbing came off.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:28.140
It’s important to keep your equipment clean.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.140
Suicide Squad

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.840
We’ll be honest with you, catching Harley
Quinn mistakes are easy not because she makes

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.670
a lot of them but because we can’t take
our eyes off her.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.290
Despite her being a wacko, she does do some
odd things in the movie though.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.290
When they are picking out weapons she picks
up a mallet, which is a nod to her comic book

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.290
character but then later on she uses a bat
as her weapon of choice.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.280
And when she jumps in an elevator to beat
the other squad members to the top, why are

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.130
they up there waiting for her?

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.509
What was the point of having her use the elevator?

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.149
Here’s a trivia question for you, what were
the Suicide Squad originally named in the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.289
comic books?

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:04.929
The answer will be at the end of our video.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.850
The Empire Strikes Back

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.060
One of the greatest movie lines of all time
is Han Solo’s response to Princess Leia

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.060
when she tells him that she loves him.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.690
It’s also something you shouldn’t say
to your girlfriend if she ever says she loves

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.690
you.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.379
From the shots of Solo with Leia you can see
he has no jacket on but then when they cut

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.550
to his famous line he has a jacket.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.010
Wait a second, you can’t see it?

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.620
That’s because George Lucas lightened the
jacket for the re-release but you can see

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.319
that it’s shiny like leather and we also
have these stills from the original release

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.379
to show you.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:47.379
Next Lucas will change who shot first.

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.379
Finding Dory

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.720
When Hank and Dory make their way through
the aquarium in a stroller, we learn that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.959
not only does Hank make an ugly baby but there
are a few goof ups with all the excitement.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.720
When the little girl spills the popcorn, look
at popcorn cup fly out of frame but then in

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.340
the next shot it didn’t fall that far away
from the popcorn.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.812
But that isn’t the biggest oops in this
scene, let’s go back and look at her shirt

00:03:09.812 --> 00:03:14.390
of the little girl when she was hit, then
take a look at it after she was hit.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.540
Looks like she made a quick costume change.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.349
Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.049
Seeing two of DC’s greatest characters fight
it out in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.409
was awesome to see on the big screen.

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.209
These legends colliding than working side
by side were a dream to comic book fans of

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.319
every age.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.470
When Batman gains the upper hand on Superman,
Superman’s hair is out of place.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.930
A great way to show Superman loosing his powers
but when Superman fights Doomsday his hair

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.830
is perfectly combed again.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.980
Maybe he stopped to add some gel to his hair
before saving the world.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.530
He has to keep impressing Lois Lane, you know.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.530
Inside Out

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.040
Here are a few contradictions in the movie
Inside Out and the way Riley’s memory works,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.609
take a look at her running around the house
as a child.

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.650
It is her point of view but then when they
show other memories of Riley’s, like her

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.030
ice skating they are not in her point of view.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.620
Also, take a look at the way she dreams, when
she loses her teeth they fall down crossing

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.720
her eyes.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.970
In reality her mouth is below her eyes so
how would she see them?

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.110
Maybe in Riley’s dreams her mouth is on
her forehead and that’s how the teeth were

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.900
able to fall past her eyes.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.670
Do you know plays the voice of Joy in Inside
Out, Sarah Silverman, Amy Poehler or Will

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:38.720
Ferrell?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.720
Stick around to the end for the answer.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.660
Jurassic Park

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.510
Sometimes a filmmaker will intentionally make
a mistake because it is for the benefit of

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.530
the story and Steven Spielberg did not shy
away from this in his 1993 blockbuster, Jurassic

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.530
Park.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.080
When a goat waits to be T-Rex’s dinner he
is on a flat piece of land and on top of that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.930
the T-Rex walks through that same flat land
to attack the jeeps and a guy using the bathroom.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.460
Then when the T-Rex knocks the jeep off the
road it falls down a cliff.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.710
Where did that cliff come from?

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:14.480
We’re too caught up in Spielberg’s great
storytelling to even notice.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.970
Ant-Man

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.810
This is a little mistake from a movie about
the littlest superhero out there.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.710
When we learn how the original Wasp dies through
a back flash scene we see her land on a nuclear

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.270
missile with her husband.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.180
Since this is a Russian missile why are the
letters in English and not in the Cyrillic

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.180
alphabet.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.180
The Cyrillic alphabet has been the written
language of Russia since the 9th century and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.180
is still used today.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.180
Maybe the missile was stolen from the Americans
by the Russians and they were using our own

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.420
weapons against us.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:45.230
Yes, we’ll go with that and say this wasn’t
a mistake.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.220
Deadpool

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.910
As Deadpool is driven to his destination by
Dopinder the Taxi Driver the two men exchange

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.910
some of the best one-liners from the film.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.800
During their exchange Deadpool loads his twelve
bullets into one clip and loads it into his

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
gun.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.280
Then when we see him strategically using his
twelve bullets to kill the bad guys he uses

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.300
two guns.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.870
Deadpool could have had twelve different guns
and we wouldn’t care because we had a blast

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.100
counting down those twelve bullets with him.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.200
He can do no wrong in our eyes.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.840
Fill in the blank, Deadpool’s roommates
name is blank blank.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.550
We’ll reveal the answer at the end of our
video.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.280

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.740
we caught.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.280
When Flynn cuts his hand you can see a pretty
big gash right down the center.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.410
Then why is it that in the next scene when
he comes out of the water the cut is gone?

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.880
We know it’s a cartoon and they can’t
keep a cut on there forever but maybe for

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.510
the entire day next time.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.030
Or maybe the water is special like the water
in the Grail from Indiana Jones and the Last

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.570
Crusade, he chose wisely.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.600
There you have it ten Mistakes In Popular
Movies That Were Caught Too Late.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.270
Here are the answers to our trivia questions:

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.600
The Suicide Squad was originally named “TASK
FORCE X” in the comics.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.700
Amy Poehler plays the voice of Joy in Inside
Out.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.580
And Deadpool’s roommates name is Blind Al.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.030
