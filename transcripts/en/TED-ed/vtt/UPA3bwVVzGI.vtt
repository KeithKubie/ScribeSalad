00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.722
When I was in fourth grade,
my teacher said to us one day:

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.275
"There are as many even numbers
as there are numbers."

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:21.098
"Really?", I thought.

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.458
Well, yeah, there are
infinitely many of both,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.878
so I suppose there are
the same number of them.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:28.933
But even numbers are only part
of the whole numbers,

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:30.584
all the odd numbers are left over,

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:33.657
so there's got to be more whole numbers
than even numbers, right?

00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.529
To see what my teacher was getting at,

00:00:35.553 --> 00:00:39.061
let's first think about what it means
for two sets to be the same size.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:41.885
What do I mean when I say
I have the same number of fingers

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.357
on my right hand as I do on left hand?

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.015
Of course, I have five fingers on each,
but it's actually simpler than that.

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.490
I don't have to count, I only need to see
that I can match them up, one to one.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:54.620
In fact, we think that some ancient people

00:00:54.644 --> 00:00:58.087
who spoke languages that didn't have words
for numbers greater than three

00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:59.483
used this sort of magic.

00:00:59.507 --> 00:01:02.233
For instance, if you let
your sheep out of a pen to graze,

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:05.938
you can keep track of how many went out
by setting aside a stone for each one,

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:09.092
and putting those stones back
one by one when the sheep return,

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:11.909
so you know if any are missing
without really counting.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:15.172
As another example of matching being
more fundamental than counting,

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:17.339
if I'm speaking to a packed auditorium,

00:01:17.363 --> 00:01:19.667
where every seat is taken
and no one is standing,

00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:23.221
I know that there are the same number
of chairs as people in the audience,

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.771
even though I don't know
how many there are of either.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:28.938
So, what we really mean when we say
that two sets are the same size

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.690
is that the elements in those sets

00:01:30.714 --> 00:01:32.943
can be matched up one by one in some way.

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.634
My fourth grade teacher showed us

00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:37.999
the whole numbers laid out in a row,
and below each we have its double.

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:40.892
As you can see, the bottom row
contains all the even numbers,

00:01:40.916 --> 00:01:42.457
and we have a one-to-one match.

00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:45.386
That is, there are as many
even numbers as there are numbers.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.700
But what still bothers us is our distress

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:51.203
over the fact that even numbers
seem to be only part of the whole numbers.

00:01:51.227 --> 00:01:52.681
But does this convince you

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:54.880
that I don't have
the same number of fingers

00:01:54.904 --> 00:01:56.630
on my right hand as I do on my left?

00:01:56.654 --> 00:01:57.669
Of course not.

00:01:57.693 --> 00:01:59.536
It doesn't matter if you try to match

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.729
the elements in some way
and it doesn't work,

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:03.515
that doesn't convince us of anything.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.730
If you can find one way

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.978
in which the elements
of two sets do match up,

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:09.895
then we say those two sets have
the same number of elements.

00:02:10.472 --> 00:02:12.487
Can you make a list of all the fractions?

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:15.170
This might be hard,
there are a lot of fractions!

00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:17.071
And it's not obvious what to put first,

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:19.238
or how to be sure
all of them are on the list.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:21.918
Nevertheless, there is a very clever way

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.115
that we can make a list
of all the fractions.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.985
This was first done by Georg Cantor,
in the late eighteen hundreds.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.017
First, we put all
the fractions into a grid.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:32.131
They're all there.

00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:35.912
For instance, you can find, say, 117/243,

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:38.996
in the 117th row and 243rd column.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.821
Now we make a list out of this

00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:44.245
by starting at the upper left
and sweeping back and forth diagonally,

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.596
skipping over any fraction, like 2/2,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.659
that represents the same number
as one the we've already picked.

00:02:49.683 --> 00:02:51.561
We get a list of all the fractions,

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.698
which means we've created
a one-to-one match

00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:55.800
between the whole numbers
and the fractions,

00:02:55.818 --> 00:02:59.199
despite the fact that we thought
maybe there ought to be more fractions.

00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:01.330
OK, here's where it gets
really interesting.

00:03:01.354 --> 00:03:03.319
You may know that not all real numbers

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:06.491
-- that is, not all the numbers
on a number line -- are fractions.

00:03:06.515 --> 00:03:08.662
The square root
of two and pi, for instance.

00:03:08.686 --> 00:03:11.113
Any number like this is called irrational.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:13.064
Not because it's crazy, or anything,

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:16.102
but because the fractions are
ratios of whole numbers,

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:17.593
and so are called rationals;

00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:20.828
meaning the rest are
non-rational, that is, irrational.

00:03:20.852 --> 00:03:24.694
Irrationals are represented
by infinite, non-repeating decimals.

00:03:24.718 --> 00:03:26.853
So, can we make a one-to-one match

00:03:26.877 --> 00:03:29.606
between the whole numbers
and the set of all the decimals,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.518
both the rationals and the irrationals?

00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:34.114
That is, can we make
a list of all the decimal numbers?

00:03:34.138 --> 00:03:36.188
Cantor showed that you can't.

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:39.509
Not merely that we don't know how,
but that it can't be done.

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:43.900
Look, suppose you claim you have made
a list of all the decimals.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:46.142
I'm going to show you
that you didn't succeed,

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.452
by producing a decimal
that is not on your list.

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.795
I'll construct my decimal
one place at a time.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.144
For the first decimal place of my number,

00:03:53.168 --> 00:03:55.930
I'll look at the first decimal place
of your first number.

00:03:55.954 --> 00:03:58.408
If it's a one, I'll make mine a two;

00:03:58.432 --> 00:04:00.388
otherwise I'll make mine a one.

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:02.520
For the second place of my number,

00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:05.021
I'll look at the second place
of your second number.

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:07.560
Again, if yours is a one,
I'll make mine a two,

00:04:07.584 --> 00:04:09.894
and otherwise I'll make mine a one.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:11.221
See how this is going?

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.220
The decimal I've produced
can't be on your list.

00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:17.531
Why? Could it be, say, your 143rd number?

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.713
No, because the 143rd place of my decimal

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:24.374
is different from the 143rd place
of your 143rd number.

00:04:24.398 --> 00:04:25.965
I made it that way.

00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:27.466
Your list is incomplete.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.484
It doesn't contain my decimal number.

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.413
And, no matter what list you give me,
I can do the same thing,

00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:34.650
and produce a decimal
that's not on that list.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:37.195
So we're faced with this
astounding conclusion:

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.084
The decimal numbers
cannot be put on a list.

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:44.026
They represent a bigger infinity
that the infinity of whole numbers.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.812
So, even though we're familiar
with only a few irrationals,

00:04:46.836 --> 00:04:48.617
like square root of two and pi,

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:50.134
the infinity of irrationals

00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:52.594
is actually greater
than the infinity of fractions.

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:54.387
Someone once said that the rationals

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:57.335
-- the fractions -- are
like the stars in the night sky.

00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.119
The irrationals are like the blackness.

00:05:01.143 --> 00:05:03.664
Cantor also showed that,
for any infinite set,

00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:07.094
forming a new set made of
all the subsets of the original set

00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:10.386
represents a bigger infinity
than that original set.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.459
This means that,
once you have one infinity,

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:14.041
you can always make a bigger one

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:16.966
by making the set of all subsets
of that first set.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.406
And then an even bigger one

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.739
by making the set
of all the subsets of that one.

00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:21.989
And so on.

00:05:22.013 --> 00:05:25.601
And so, there are an infinite number
of infinities of different sizes.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:29.090
If these ideas make you
uncomfortable, you are not alone.

00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.505
Some of the greatest
mathematicians of Cantor's day

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.053
were very upset with this stuff.

00:05:33.077 --> 00:05:35.697
They tried to make these different
infinities irrelevant,

00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:38.013
to make mathematics work
without them somehow.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.070
Cantor was even vilified personally,

00:05:40.094 --> 00:05:42.999
and it got so bad for him
that he suffered severe depression,

00:05:43.023 --> 00:05:46.309
and spent the last half of his life
in and out of mental institutions.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.662
But eventually, his ideas won out.

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:51.644
Today, they're considered
fundamental and magnificent.

00:05:51.668 --> 00:05:54.245
All research mathematicians
accept these ideas,

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:56.064
every college math major learns them,

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:58.327
and I've explained them
to you in a few minutes.

00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:00.844
Some day, perhaps,
they'll be common knowledge.

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:02.042
There's more.

00:06:02.066 --> 00:06:04.496
We just pointed out
that the set of decimal numbers

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.970
-- that is, the real numbers --
is a bigger infinity

00:06:06.994 --> 00:06:08.429
than the set of whole numbers.

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:10.510
Cantor wondered
whether there are infinities

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:12.794
of different sizes
between these two infinities.

00:06:12.818 --> 00:06:15.315
He didn't believe there were,
but couldn't prove it.

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:18.250
Cantor's conjecture became known
as the continuum hypothesis.

00:06:19.402 --> 00:06:21.859
In 1900, the great
mathematician David Hilbert

00:06:21.883 --> 00:06:23.634
listed the continuum hypothesis

00:06:23.658 --> 00:06:26.417
as the most important
unsolved problem in mathematics.

00:06:26.441 --> 00:06:29.254
The 20th century saw
a resolution of this problem,

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:32.236
but in a completely unexpected,
paradigm-shattering way.

00:06:32.942 --> 00:06:34.899
In the 1920s, Kurt Gödel showed

00:06:34.923 --> 00:06:37.923
that you can never prove
that the continuum hypothesis is false.

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:41.003
Then, in the 1960s, Paul J. Cohen showed

00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:44.027
that you can never prove
that the continuum hypothesis is true.

00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:46.200
Taken together, these results mean

00:06:46.224 --> 00:06:48.748
that there are unanswerable
questions in mathematics.

00:06:48.772 --> 00:06:50.286
A very stunning conclusion.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.435
Mathematics is rightly considered
the pinnacle of human reasoning,

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:56.568
but we now know that even mathematics
has its limitations.

00:06:57.094 --> 00:07:00.809
Still, mathematics has some truly
amazing things for us to think about.
