00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's a quiz.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Will orientation or heading never play a role?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the answers are:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes, Never--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so we always get a random set of orientations--

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
or No--eventually they matter?
