00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.250
Nuclear bombs are the most destructive weapons
humanity has ever devised, but they have an

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.950
unexpected upside.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.710
Thanks to their development and testing, they’ve
contributed to some surprising advances in

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.060
other scientific fields like neuroscience
and climatology.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.930
You may wonder what neuroscience has to do
with nuclear weapons, and to understand the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.450
connection, you need to know about carbon-14.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.510
Usually carbon has an atomic mass of 12; 6
protons and 6 neutrons.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.630
But on occasion, neutrons energized by cosmic
rays from our sun will collide with nitrogen

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.819
atoms in our atmosphere, knocking a proton
off the atom and converting nitrogen into

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:42.800
carbon with two extra neutrons, AKA Carbon-14
Unlike its 6 neutron cousin, carbon-14 is

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.589
radioactive, with a half-life of about 5,700
years.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.489
To organisms though it doesn’t make much
difference.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.269
Plants use carbon-14 like any other carbon
atom during photosynthesis, and that carbon-14

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.019
works its way through the food chain.

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.059
That’s right.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.850
All of us have this radioactive isotope spread
throughout our entire bodies.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.700
Since carbon-14 is constantly decaying and
is replenished by natural cycles, the amount

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.130
of it in our atmosphere remains pretty constant.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.909
At least it should, so long as nobody’s,
oh I don’t know, setting off massive explosions

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.320
that release a lot of high energy neutrons
into our nitrogen-rich atmosphere.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.890
Remember when we did that?

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.549
Atomic bombs create an artificial spike in
atmospheric carbon-14, and we can associate

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.409
that spike to an exact moment in time.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.640
Since we know how much carbon-14 WAS in the
air for any given year, and we know how carbon

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.990
works its way into our bodies…

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.180
We can use these spikes to measure how much
carbon-14 is in a cell’s DNA and determine

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.409
what year that cell was formed.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.500
Clever scientists realized this gave them
a rare opportunity to answer a vexing question

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.020
about the human brain.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.799
The prevailing wisdom had long been that humans
don’t grow new brain cells after early childhood,

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.220
but research on rodents and monkeys showed
that wasn’t the case for them.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.149
These animals would grow new neurons in the
hippocampus and olfactory bulb, the areas

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.960
associated with memory and smell.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.829
But the method used to track neuron growth
in monkeys couldn’t be used on humans because

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.039
it relied on a banned chemical.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.190
So instead, in a small study, researchers
realized if they looked at samples of brain

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.190
tissue and checked how much carbon-14 was
present, they could determine when the neurons

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.200
formed during that person’s lifetime.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.190
At first, they couldn’t test the hippocampus
because it contained so few neurons, making

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.630
carbon-14 too difficult to detect.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.150
But, their initial tests on the larger olfactory
bulb showed that we humans do NOT generate

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.110
new olfactory neurons like our smellier monkey
cousins.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.930
But, soon after, advances in DNA sampling
made it possible to scan the hippocampus of

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.050
110 brain slices for carbon-14, and VOILA.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.830
They found the average neuron in that region
of the brain was only 20 to 30 years old,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.560
even when the brain was more than 90.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.960
It would seem we do generate new neurons in
the hippocampus after all, about 700 a day

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.600
by the researcher’s estimate.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.640
So case closed, right?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.640
We’re done here?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.040
Hahaha, of course not.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.510
A study published in early March went looking
for those new and forming neurons in 59 brains.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.380
While they were abundant in the brains of
children, nary an immature brain cell was

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.470
found in adults, challenging the results of
the experiments that relied on Carbon-14.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.700
Maybe there’s another explanation for the
Carbon-14 levels but if we’re going to find

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.610
it we better hurry.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.600
The window to test something like this is
closing.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.580
Open air atomic testing was banned in 1963,
and carbon-14 levels are fast approaching

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.710
their old pre-atomic levels.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:41.680
By 2050 researchers believe this sort of carbon-14
testing probably won’t be possible anymore.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.770
You may remember that carbon-14 has a half
life of almost 5,700 years and wondering why

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.380
the levels are dropping so fast.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.710
It turns out much of the excess carbon-14
is being absorbed by oceans and organisms,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.630
which has helped scientists understand how
atmospheric CO2 flows.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.220
So in an unexpected way, nuclear weapons have
helped us learn about our planet and our own

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.220
brains.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.100
I guess even mushroom clouds have silver linings.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.840
Before we knew about C14, we could track cell
growth with bromodeoxyuridine, but it was

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.970
banned because it can harm the fetus in pregnant
women, causing scientists to question the

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.970
results.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.949
Thanks for watching Seeker.
