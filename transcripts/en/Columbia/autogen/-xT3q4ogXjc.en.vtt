overnight it's going to take a lot of
time and if we finally get around to

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.250
time and if we finally get around to
 

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.819
time and if we finally get around to
doing it how are we going to get those

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:20.829
doing it how are we going to get those
 

00:12:20.829 --> 00:12:25.049
doing it how are we going to get those
good boards in place my own view is that

00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:25.059
good boards in place my own view is that
 

00:12:25.059 --> 00:12:27.629
good boards in place my own view is that
the boards are very responsible for good

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639
the boards are very responsible for good
 

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:29.730
the boards are very responsible for good
boys better but that's that's short

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:29.740
boys better but that's that's short
 

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.759
boys better but that's that's short
circuiting in it and there will be a lot

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:32.769
circuiting in it and there will be a lot
 

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:34.710
circuiting in it and there will be a lot
of that involved too namely after we

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720
of that involved too namely after we
 

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.840
of that involved too namely after we
know how to do it what we want how do we

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:36.850
know how to do it what we want how do we
 

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.210
know how to do it what we want how do we
get them there what is it that's going

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:39.220
get them there what is it that's going
 

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:42.869
get them there what is it that's going
to give us the ability to replace what

00:12:42.869 --> 00:12:42.879
to give us the ability to replace what
 

00:12:42.879 --> 00:12:46.829
to give us the ability to replace what
we have and improve it now finally what

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839
we have and improve it now finally what
 

00:12:46.839 --> 00:12:49.139
we have and improve it now finally what
I got out of it is how important crown

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:49.149
I got out of it is how important crown
 

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:51.509
I got out of it is how important crown
and its algorithms are I don't

00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519
and its algorithms are I don't
 

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.790
and its algorithms are I don't
understand those algorithms at all all I

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800
understand those algorithms at all all I
 

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.750
understand those algorithms at all all I
know is it

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760
know is it
 

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.750
know is it
do produce information not data and the

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760
do produce information not data and the
 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.490
do produce information not data and the
kind of information in crown and Rob

00:12:59.490 --> 00:12:59.500
kind of information in crown and Rob
 

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.350
kind of information in crown and Rob
showed you this morning is just

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360
showed you this morning is just
 

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.330
showed you this morning is just
scratching the surface but think how

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:03.340
scratching the surface but think how
 

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.690
scratching the surface but think how
important it is now that we're thinking

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:06.700
important it is now that we're thinking
 

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.750
important it is now that we're thinking
about the motivation of shareholders

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760
about the motivation of shareholders
 

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.870
about the motivation of shareholders
want good boys do they really want good

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880
want good boys do they really want good
 

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.430
want good boys do they really want good
boys they want something else we can

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:14.440
boys they want something else we can
 

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.740
boys they want something else we can
find out now we have the ability to do

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:16.750
find out now we have the ability to do
 

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.140
find out now we have the ability to do
that how many good boards are there we

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.150
that how many good boards are there we
 

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.820
that how many good boards are there we
have the ability to find that out once

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:20.830
have the ability to find that out once
 

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.830
have the ability to find that out once
we know what a good board is in other

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:22.840
we know what a good board is in other
 

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.050
we know what a good board is in other
words these algorithms are going to give

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.060
words these algorithms are going to give
 

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.870
words these algorithms are going to give
us the ability to get into data which is

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880
us the ability to get into data which is
 

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.480
us the ability to get into data which is
there it's there and a whole variety of

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:30.490
there it's there and a whole variety of
 

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.150
there it's there and a whole variety of
places but nobody's been able to access

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.160
places but nobody's been able to access
 

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.820
places but nobody's been able to access
it and make it information crown can do

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:35.830
it and make it information crown can do
 

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.450
it and make it information crown can do
that so we now have the center operating

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:39.460
that so we now have the center operating
 

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.090
that so we now have the center operating
on a very good investment in the crown

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.100
on a very good investment in the crown
 

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.130
on a very good investment in the crown
which is going to produce results for

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:44.140
which is going to produce results for
 

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.580
which is going to produce results for
all of us and a future which can be

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:47.590
all of us and a future which can be
 

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.990
all of us and a future which can be
