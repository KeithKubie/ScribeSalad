JANET RANKIN: A common
active learning technique

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.050
that people often use, or
maybe the first technique

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.050
that they use, is
personal response systems.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.450
So that's an
opportunity for students

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.360
to respond to a question.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.950
And that can be anything.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.930
It's usually a multiple
choice question,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.970
but it doesn't have to be.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.950
And it can be anything
from a show of hands--

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.241
who thinks the answer is A,
who thinks the answer is B,

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.790
who thinks the answer is C--

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.880
to dedicated devices
and applications

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.340
that allow students to
respond to questions.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.930
So there's pros
and cons for each

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.067
of the different
techniques, but the essence

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.650
of all the techniques
is that students

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.230
are given an opportunity
to think about the answer

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.290
that they think is correct,
and then respond to that.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.320
And there is evidence
to show, research

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.770
that shows, that when students
make a claim, when they're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.819
asked to make a public response,
a public claim as to what they

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.240
think the correct answer is,
that makes them more committed

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.350
to the answer.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.410
And then they're more likely
to remember or to even notice

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.970
if their answer is incorrect.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.724
It primes the
student for learning.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.390
And that's the biggest
advantage for any

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.780
of these personal
response systems.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.410
The disadvantage with having
students raise their hands

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.920
is that in a big lecture hall,
it can be hard to count, right?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.050
It can be hard to say,
OK, how many people raised

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.100
their hand when I said A?

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.140
How many when I said B, etc.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.730
So that can take up time and
it can be pretty inaccurate.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.470
The other thing that
people do sometimes

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.837
is they'll use like,
just a sheet of paper.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.670
They'll put on letters
and then the students

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.300
can fold the paper up.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.090
And depending on how
they want to vote,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.040
they just hold it up so that
really only you can see it.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
Point of fact is other
students can kind of tell what

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.740
the other students answered.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.850
And if I know that
a friend of mine

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.620
always gets the
answer right, then I

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.480
might just look and
see what he or she said

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.430
and then answer the same.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.150
So it might not give us a
real accurate measurement

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.140
of what every student thinks.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.880
The other problem
with that is this

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.130
can be hard to read
in a big lecture hall.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.200
Sort of the first kind of
digital or electronic personal

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.230
response systems were
these dedicated clickers,

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.310
is what they're called.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.880
And students literally,
they log into the system.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.440
They turn their devices on.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.140
And you ask a question,
and then the students

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.450
respond A, B, C, D
using the touch pad.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.280
Some clickers lets
students actually

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.680
type answers, so open response.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.140
They can actually type
a word, or a number,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.130
or a set of numbers.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.350
So that can give you a
little bit more flexibility.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.290
And then the software on
the instructor's computer

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.700
will create a
histogram of responses.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.380
So you know right away the
distribution of responses.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.870
If you have more than
70% of the students

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.030
get the question
right, you probably

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.300
just want to state the
correct answer and move on.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.030
You can also say, if
you didn't get it right,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.160
here's some extra resources
or go to the TA office hours,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.660
or whatever.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.390
But in general, if more than 70%
of the students get it right,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.390
you can move on.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.150
One thing I like to do is if
I really have a resounding,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.230
say 75%, get it right, I like
to ask a follow-up clicker

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.600
question that says,
how confident were you

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.920
in your answer?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.227
Because sometimes
students will just guess.

00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:32.060
And if you give them
the opportunity to say,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.810
yeah, I got it right, but
I don't really know why--

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.421
that might be the situation
sometimes, that a lot of people

00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:39.920
get it right, but not that many
people know what's going on.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.630
So you want to know that too.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.600
If between 30 and
70 get it correct,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.970
then I like to move
into the pair share.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.040
So I like to say, OK.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.360
Let's divide up.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.640
Looks like we have a pretty
good split of answers.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.231
So let's talk to
each other and we

00:03:57.231 --> 00:03:58.730
can do some peer-peer
learning where

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.000
peers can try to argue
their point to whoever

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.320
is sitting next to them.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.840
And then I ask
them to vote again.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.660
Now, when things
are working well,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.280
people actually converge
to the correct answer.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.110
And generally speaking--
I think it was Eric Mazur

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.550
has a preliminary
research study that

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.360
shows that when you
put two students

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.820
with the incorrect
answer together,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.790
they actually tend to
converge to the correct answer

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.650
because they argue
each other out

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.400
of their respective
wrong answers.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.324
So that can be pretty effective.

00:04:33.324 --> 00:04:35.240
You do have to have a
pretty good distribution

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.880
of incorrect answers
for that to work.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.730
If two students had the same
incorrect answer, generally,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.450
speaking they stay embedded
with the incorrect answer.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.470
If less than 30% of students
get the correct answer,

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.100
you probably just want
to stop and reformulate

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.580
your explanation and really
go over everything again,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.480
because that's really
not a lot of people

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.800
that know what's going on.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.190
So that's the general
ballpark for how to proceed

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.520
with the clicker questions.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.470
In between the pieces of
paper and the clickers

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.030
are some newer technologies,
new applications.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.470
One is there's a
few applications

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.250
for web-enabled
devices, like Socrative,

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.080
which is a software
that you can download.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.270
The instructor
downloads it and then

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.800
students log into a room using
their web-enabled device.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.310
So they log in and then no
one has to buy anything extra,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.560
but you are assuming
that every student has

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.330
a web-enabled
device, and you are

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.310
saying you're happy
if they take them out

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.970
in your class, which may
not be true for everyone.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.880
So that's the issue
with that, access

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.730
and also whether you want
the smart phones out.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.150
An application that I think
is a really great compromise

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.920
is something called plickers,
with a P, P L I C K E R S.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.250
And with that, the instructor
downloads an application

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.610
on his or her smartphone
or web-enabled device,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.300
it has to be a
device with a camera.

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.410
And then the instructor
downloads these PDFs,

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.550
which are just pieces of paper
with these patterns on them.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.640
They're all different, and I
believe you get 40 patterns

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.760
for free and they're reusable.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.750
And so each one is unique and
you give them to the students.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.290
And students then
vote A, B, C or D.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.534
There's four sides to the shape
and four letters, A, B, C, D.

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:36.950
And if they think
the answer is A,

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.765
they hold it with
the A at the top.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.340
If they think it's
B, they hold it

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.560
with the B at the
top, et cetera.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.200
And you can use your
web-enabled device,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.220
and you scan the crowd
with the software,

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.810
and that actually
picks up the responses

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.350
and creates a histogram.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.860
So I think that's a
really nice compromise,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.630
because it gives
you the histogram,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.940
it has student
anonymity, and students

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.690
don't need anything
but the piece of paper

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:03.410
that you gave them.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.326
And you can actually
reuse the piece of paper.

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:09.440
We printed sets on card stock,
which are pretty durable.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.660
And we can use them
over and over again,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.350
so the students don't
need any extra technology.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.290
For educators that are
thinking about using

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.930
some kind of personal response
system for their students,

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.410
there's a couple different
levels of how far in to get

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.850
and how fast.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.130
The first step would be to
construct some really good,

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.730
thoughtful questions
that students can answer

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.430
in a multiple choice way.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.400
That would let you use the
clickers, or a show of hands,

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.150
or any of the other methods.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.230
It is important to construct
the clicker questions in a way

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.990
that students know they're
really meaningful, that you're

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.690
not just asking kind
of silly questions.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.810
You want to ask them
questions that are a bit rich

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.990
and that also lend themselves,
as I said to, if students,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.840
you know if a decent number
don't get them right,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.990
that lend themselves to
that peer-peer interaction,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.520
that sort of debate
with each other.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.170
So want to think carefully about
your learning outcomes, what

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:12.920
you want students to
know or be able to do

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.952
by the end of the class.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:15.410
And you want to
construct questions

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.480
that help them
get there and test

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.950
whether they're there or not.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.910
So you might use one, or two,
or three questions in a class.

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.330
And that might be it,
that might be all you do.

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.288
But you do want to make
sure that you construct

00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:30.320
the questions thoughtfully.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.530
The next-- sort of if you
want to go further in,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:38.179
is to think about what it is,
really think critically about,

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.169
your learning outcome.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:40.585
What do I want
students to get out

00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:43.130
of this class, this
particular class?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.830
And then construct a
series of clicker questions

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.130
that really help
students understand

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.960
whether they get it or not.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.110
Help them argue their
point with others

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.870
or encourage them to argue their
opinion or point with others.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.300
And then ultimately,
come to a realization

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.090
or come to attain the
learning outcomes really

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.310
by engagement with
the clicker questions

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.802
and by engagement in a
subsequent discussion.

00:09:09.802 --> 00:09:11.510
So where the clicker
questions are really

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.800
the core of your
class and the learning

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.950
happens sort of threaded
among those questions.
