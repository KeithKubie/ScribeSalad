There's another lady behind you.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.683 align:start position:0%
- You know Charles Manson
killed 19 people right up there.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:17.517
Yup.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:18.718
So join us.

if you're interested.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.689
- Jamarcus... did you
play for the Cowboys?

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.923
- No.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.125
- There's sunscreen
in that doughnut.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.092 align:start size:84% position:16%
We're going to be
out in the sun a lot.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.694
- Hello my name is David.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.029
- This is my brother David.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.963
- I'm David.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.831
This is our free walking tour.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.801
And it begins right here
at the central library

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.236
right here behind us.

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:39.039
This was built in 1926
and it's been housing

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start size:88% position:13%
all the wackos and
kooks since that moment.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:43.176 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Before we go...
- Oh!

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.477
- I would like to...

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:45.745
Is it okay if I say a
prayer over everyone?

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:46.713 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Please do.
- Okay.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.214
- Just take his hands please.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.516
Electricity, everybody just
take each other's hands.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.451
- Sweet baby Jesus
please protect us

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.387 align:start size:88% position:13%
from our enemies and the
citizens of this city

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.455
that wish to do...
- Okay moving on!

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:58.024
(upbeat music)

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:10.036
(sweet music)

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:11.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
Okay so now we're under
the library tower.

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:14.908
If everybody looks
up, straight up...

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
And imagines
themselves on a beach

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.512
with no clothes on.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.748 align:start size:94% position:6%
And you can wrap your
legs around this building,

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.350 align:start size:84% position:16%
you'd have the tallest
penis in the West.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.552
- The tip of which would have

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.787
a McDonald's and a Jacuzzi.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.090 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Just a couple of
things I want to tell you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.658
about Joseph Scott.

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:34.627 align:start size:94% position:6%
he was a beloved citizen,
distinguished lawyer,

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.397
stalwart champion
of Americanism.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:41.901 align:start size:94% position:6%
He practiced law in Los
Angeles from 1894 to 1958.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:45.872
- Also this is the
most masturbated to
statue in the city.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:48.775
- And if you look above you
you'll see more buildings.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.244
- Well that's a PT
Cruiser right there.

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:52.712
Car of the future.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.714
The Westin Bonaventure Hotel!

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.584
Hey, can anybody tell
me what it's made of?

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:58.418
- Metal?

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.252
- That's right.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.053
Metal and glass.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.020
- Glass.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.255 align:start size:75% position:25%
Metal and glass.
- You guys...

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.723
I don't even know
why we're here.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:04.557
- Alright come on.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.391
Come on. Come on.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.226
Come on.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.160
Come on.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.628
Sir, you stay over there.

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.231 align:start size:97% position:3%
- This right here is named
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion,

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:15.468 align:start size:97% position:3%
and is the crowning
achievement of Miss Chandler.

00:02:15.468 --> 00:02:17.003 align:start size:84% position:16%
Her previous crowning
achievement was

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.640 align:start size:84% position:16%
she had seven orgasms
in seven minutes.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.908
Come on, hurry!

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.215
(intense music)

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.484
Who's hungry?

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.453
Anybody hungry?

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:35.054 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well there's one
thing we did for you

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.890
on this free walking tour.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.427
We provided you with one of
L.A.'s finest food trucks.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.829
Here it is right here.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.298
The Diablo Huevos and
bologna sandwiches.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:46.299
(crowd cheers)

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.267
Who likes deviled eggs?

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.368
Come on, join us!

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.802
- Hello my friends!

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.605
It's so good to see you!

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.007
You want deviled egg
or bologna sandwich?

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:55.275
- Yes, bologna sandwich.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.377
- All we have left is
open-faced. (laughs)

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:58.311
Oh, here we go!

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.512
No, no I do it to you.

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.881
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yes!

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.650
It's so good!

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.419
(mariachi music)

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.122
- Muscles, everybody.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:09.956
Muscles.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.331 align:start size:97% position:3%
Some interesting
information about this sign.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.401
Now Los Angeles has
25 sister cities.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.472 align:start size:97% position:3%
And yes, they do all get
their period at the same time.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.876
- Interesting thing about
the Biltmore Hotel David,

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.313
is it is the most haunted
building in the world.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.447
Maybe because it's built

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:37.317 align:start size:84% position:16%
on an ancient Chinese
burial ground.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:38.318
- This right here is one

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.519
of the last remaining hold outs

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.255 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the Occupy Wall
Street movement.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.591
(screaming)

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.962
As you can see, this is
titled the Broad Plaza.

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:51.764 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's a tribute to
women in Los Angeles.

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.367
(string music)

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.271
Okay, so this is one

00:03:58.271 --> 00:03:59.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
of my favorite
corners in the city.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:01.074
Right behind me that is

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:02.642
the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:04.811 align:start size:84% position:16%
Frank Gehry has
deemed the bathrooms

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.413 align:start size:84% position:16%
in that place
acoustically perfect.

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:09.549
- I would also like to
point out that it's built

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.051 align:start size:84% position:16%
on an ancient Disney
burial ground.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.387 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Behind you if we
can all turn around...

00:04:14.387 --> 00:04:17.624
There's a great sculpture
there of Daniel Day Lewis.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.193
(upbeat music)

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.898
Right now is the
end of the tour.

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:27.667
- Concludes the end
of the tour, yes.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:28.835
(crowd moaning)

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:29.736
- Part one.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.273
We're now starting part two.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.107
Pile on in!
- I told you

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:34.941
there would be a limo.

00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:35.775
Nancy Joe!

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.843
Lady Purple!

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:38.778 align:start size:75% position:25%
Joey Satrioani!
- Satch!

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:41.114
Take her away, Rick.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.082
- Take it away!

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.652
(upbeat music)

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:52.892 line:0%
- Hey everybody.

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.093 line:0%
We're the Walsh Brothers.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:55.328 line:0%
And after you've written

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.329 line:0%
whatever the hell
you wanted to write

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.031 line:0%
underneath the video...

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.133 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
Hopefully it's terrible
and negative and...

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.634 line:0%
We love that shit.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.003 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Go back and watch
the video because...

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.638 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Because we've hidden
a secret button.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:06.873 line:0%
- He hid the button.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.074 line:0%
- Somewhere on our
favorite expression.
