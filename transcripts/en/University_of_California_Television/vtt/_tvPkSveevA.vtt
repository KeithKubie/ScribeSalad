00:00:01.549 --> 00:00:04.716
(introspective music)

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:33.961
- Good afternoon.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.470
I'm William Lester, Professor of Chemistry

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.970
and chair of the Hitchcock Committee.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.450
I'm pleased along with
the graduate council

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750
to introduce Dr. Noam Chomsky as part

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.610
of the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.060
In appreciation for
their generous bequests,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.650
I'd like to tell you something about how

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.093
the Hitchcock Lectures
came to UC Berkeley.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.060
Dr. Charles Hitchcock was
a physician for the army,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.240
he moved west during the gold rush

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.870
and settled in San
Francisco where he opened

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.470
a private practice that thrived.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.720
In 1885, he established a professorship

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.950
here at Berkeley as an expression of his

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.093
long-time interest in education.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.920
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.750
greatly expanded her
father's original gift,

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620
making it possible for
us to present a series

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.803
of public lectures.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.580
The Hitchcock Professorship
is one of the most cherished

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.690
endowments of the
University of California,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.260
recognizing the highest distinction

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.433
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.570
Thank you Lillie and Charles,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.331
and now a few words about
our speaker, Noam Chomsky.

00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.331
(audience applauds)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.290
Dr. Chomsky is no stranger
to the Berkeley campus.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.030
In fact, he spoke on this very spot

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.700
to an overflow crowd several years ago,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.810
and ever since then we have
wanted him to come back.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.400
So we're honored that he
has accepted our invitation

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.863
to be a Hitchcock professor.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.570
Noam Chomsky is one of the
most influential linguists

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.940
of our time.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.430
He has dominated several
fields in linguistics

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.520
over the past 40 years.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.610
He is credited with changing the focus

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.130
of linguistics from a concern with methods

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.330
of classification to a search
for explanatory principles

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.460
and his numerous writings on
the subject document this.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.980
But Noam Chomsky's
influence extends beyond

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.950
the realm of academia,
he is a forceful critic

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.490
of US foreign policy and a spokesperson

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.193
against the abuse of power.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.810
Noam Chomsky received
his PhD in linguistics

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.570
from the University of
Pennsylvania in 1955.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.783
He has been a professor at MIT since 1961.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.790
He has written numerous
books and has received

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.290
various honorary degrees,
awards, and honors.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.132
I am very pleased to
present Dr. Noam Chomsky.

00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:04.132
(audience applauds)

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:18.510
- Thank you.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.860
Well, I ended yesterday by describing

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.210
the so-called principles
and parameters approach,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.760
which gave the first serious conception,

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.070
to my knowledge, of how the tension

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.260
between descriptive and
explanatory adequacy

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.483
might be resolved.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.450
In this sense, it's fair
I think to regard it

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.840
as the first genuine proposal as to what

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.500
a theory of language might be.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.250
Whether that step turns out
to have been right or wrong,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.030
it offered the kind of
a liberating perspective

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.180
which led to an explosion of
highly productive inquiry,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.330
and it opened new
problems to investigation,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.870
also revitalized the study
of language acquisition

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.870
along new lines and other
language-related areas

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.673
of the cognitive sciences.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.467
To the extent that outstanding
problems can be solved,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.300
not a simple matter, but to the
extent that that's possible,

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.210
we will have a conception
of the initial conditions

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.340
that map experience to
the state that's attained

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.710
by the faculty of language,
to what I called yesterday

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.920
the internal language, the I-language,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.340
that determines the infinite array

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.010
of sound-meaning
combinations that the speaker

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.410
of a language has available for use,

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.450
the potential expressions of the language.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.880
These initial conditions include,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.940
but are not exhausted by,
the genetically-determined

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.820
initial state of the language organ.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.230
In addition, there's the third factor

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.430
that I mentioned yesterday,
general principles

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.740
that are not coded in the initial state,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.130
just as properties of protein folding

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.610
are not coded in the
genome but are available

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.210
to be exploited in the
growth of the organism.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.420
Now there is, I think,
some reason to believe

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.130
that understanding of language

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.960
has at last reached the
level that makes it feasible

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.590
to address these questions, that is,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.390
to pursue the Galilean intuition

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.500
that nature is somehow perfect.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.710
In this case asking not
only what the properties

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.080
of language are, but why language

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.460
has these properties and not others.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.790
That inquiry, in recent
years, has been called

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.010
the minimalist program.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.350
Notice that that program
is theory independent,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.100
whatever you think is the
right theory of language

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.323
you may or may not decide
to pursue these questions.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.280
The initial state, it can be disaggregated

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.840
into elements that have
a principled explanation

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.980
and others that remain unexplained

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.720
at this level of analysis, they have

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.030
to be attributed, therefore,
to something independent,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.820
perhaps an evolutionary accident

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.710
where properties of the
brain that remain unknown

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.490
and would have to be
investigated along similar lines.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.540
The principled elements
of the initial state

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.880
are the conditions that are imposed

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.640
on the faculty of language by the systems

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.720
with which it interacts.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.310
These are what are called
interface conditions.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.560
If language is to be usable at all,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.280
its design must satisfy these conditions.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.280
That is, the information that
is in the internal expressions

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.440
that are generated by the language have

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.810
to be accessible to
other internal systems,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.600
that includes language external
but person internal systems,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.540
including sensory-motor
systems and conceptual systems

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.350
that enter into thought and action.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.280
So we can therefore
restate the deeper problem

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.550
of determining why language
has the peculiar properties

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.370
that it does, insofar as the
properties of an I-language

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.610
can be accounted for in
terms of interface conditions

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.140
and general principles of
computational efficiency

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.800
and the like, they have
a principled explanation.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.670
And we will have verified
the Galilean intuition

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.480
of perfection of nature in this domain.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.480
Well, if one proceeds this far,
you face a challenging task.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.120
The task is to examine
every device, principle,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.460
idea, technique, that is
employed in characterizing

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.000
languages and try to
determine to what extent

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.870
it can be eliminated in
favor of a principled account

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.860
in terms of general conditions
of computational efficiency

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.150
and the interface conditions
that the organ must satisfy

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.900
to function at all.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.960
That's been a focus of a good deal of work

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.780
in the past few years,

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.350
and there are, by now,
rather plausible accounts

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.070
in these terms of some basic processes

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.443
of the computational system of language.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:54.010
These systems that previously had been

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.900
stipulated as descriptive technology

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.050
but can now be reduced to principles

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.000
of computational efficiency.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.550
And also more complex properties
of individual languages

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.360
have, to an interesting
extent, been derived

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.330
from close examination of
the way principled mechanisms

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.231
function under minimization of search

00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:22.210
and other principles of
efficient computation.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.920
Furthermore, what appear
to be radical differences

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.270
among languages have in a
number of interesting cases

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.110
been reduced to something
close to the optimal conclusion

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.350
that would means that the
internal computational processes

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.555
are identical, the
phenomenal differences result

00:09:43.555 --> 00:09:48.555
not from how the mind computes

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.820
but rather how the internal
objects that it constructs

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.820
are related to external events
by sensory-motor systems.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:04.210
So the interesting cases involve
a category of properties,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.760
features with no independent meaning

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.050
that had not really been noticed before,

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.990
though they're crucial, it appears.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.530
And differences in how
the apparent diversity

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.550
of languages seems to be traceable

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.550
to a very significant effect,
the slight differences

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.610
in the way these uninterpretable features

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:35.610
are externalized, are used
by the sensory-motor system.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.510
It's as if the mind
computes in a fixed way

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.703
but with varying effects
at the mouth and the ear.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.030
The general observation, not this far,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:52.350
but the general point was
a very natural consequence

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.010
of the principles and parameters approach,

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.130
it was recognized from the
moment that it came to be

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.070
formulated with at least some clarity.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.070
Actually, I discussed it near here in 1979

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.140
at Kant Lectures at Stanford.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:14.300
At that time I referred to classic work,

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.500
biological work on regulatory mechanisms

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.600
by Jacob and Monod, two Nobel laureates,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.650
quoting their observations
about how slight changes

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.210
in regulatory mechanisms,
utilizing differently

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.650
the same structural
information might yield

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.040
enormous phenomenal differences.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.540
Their examples, differences
between a butterfly

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.150
and a lion or a worm and a whale,

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:44.530
basically identical
organisms but with minor

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.140
changes in how regulatory
mechanisms function,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.600
same mechanisms.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.250
Similarly, slight changes in parameters

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.160
left open in the fixed
schematism of language

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.713
might lead to what appear to
be very different systems.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.830
Apologies here for quoting myself in 1979,

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.250
it was actually in the years that followed

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.610
that such ideas really
did begin to bear fruit

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.820
in the study of language.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.610
Similarly, in the biological sciences

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.710
there have been quite dramatic progress

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.460
along similar lines.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.200
Such conclusions would
have greatly pleased

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.750
Alan Turing I think, he's
known to philosophers

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.240
and linguists, logicians,
computer scientists,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.490
mainly for his work in other areas,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.820
but some of his best-known
work was on morphogenesis

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.670
and the effects of
chemical and physical law

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.330
on the possible course of evolution.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.560
These are matters on which
he took a rather strong stand

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.700
and that have become a central topic

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.653
in contemporary biology.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.150
One fundamental problem that remains

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.940
is why there is parametric
variation at all

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.700
in the computational system,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.060
so why isn't there just one language?

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.370
There are some possible answers
that have been suggested,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.370
but the general problem in my
opinion is still mysterious,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.120
it's a problem that eludes our grasp,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.263
but you can think of possible answers.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.380
One might also hope to
approach the question

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.120
of evolution of language in these terms.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.280
It's rather curious to
compare the enormous number

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:36.200
of pages devoted to the
evolution of human language

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.070
with work on evolution
of much simpler systems,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.460
say, bee communication.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.420
A couple of years ago
asked a biologist friend

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.050
to do a database search on that topic,

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.440
and he could come up with very little.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.260
Apparently, the subject is
considered too difficult

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:59.220
to pursue, although bees are
just a wonderful subject,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.300
they only have 800,000 neurons,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.310
a brain the size of a grass seed,

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:10.170
many different species that
yield rich comparative data,

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.630
a very brief gestation period, lifespan,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:19.380
no need to obtain consent
forms for experiments,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.470
and so on, every conceivable advantage.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.450
But, nevertheless, the
problem's considered

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.660
far too hard to study.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.950
The question of how the
human language faculty,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.230
it might have evolved,
is vastly more obscure

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.940
and hard to study.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.800
One can imagine various scenarios,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.590
a number have been proposed,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.943
some of them are maybe suggestive.

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:47.810
But some leading evolutionary biologists,

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:50.963
Richard Lewontin is the most prominent,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.890
they have argued strongly that the problem

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:58.420
is entirely beyond reach
in terms of anything

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.380
remotely like present understanding.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.620
He, Lewontin, at least extends that

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.200
to evolution of human
mental faculties generally.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.830
Well, if we, nevertheless,
want to pose the problem

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.630
of evolution of language, we have to begin

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.750
with a recognition shared by everyone

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.870
that the faculty of language
is not a distinct entity,

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.350
it's not like a box in the human brain

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.520
with a single location
or a single function,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.083
whatever that term is supposed to imply.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.830
The faculty of language
surely recruits processes,

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:37.800
capacities, physiological mechanisms,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.480
that have evolved quite independently,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.010
and it could turn out in principle

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.220
that there's nothing in
the faculty of language

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.180
that's specific to language,

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.800
that the faculty is just the specific form

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:53.260
of organization of
elements that are recruited

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.100
to constitute this organ of the body,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.473
to borrow Randy Gallistel's term again.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.040
If the minimalist approach to language

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.710
has real prospects of success,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.160
and at least my judgment is that it does,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.420
we would expect to find
that language crucially

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.420
involves interface conditions
and computational processes,

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.630
some of these at least may
have homologous structures

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.160
in other primates, maybe even beyond.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.130
If that's the case, then
the study of language

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.820
will involve, in part, the
evolution of these elements,

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.470
the evolution of the way they're organized

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:40.040
in the language faculty

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.650
and whatever may have
evolved independently

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.160
in the last flick of an
eye in evolutionary time,

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.363
in human evolution, and
it's extremely short.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.440
There is intriguing
work, very recent work,

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.280
on primate perceptual systems
that could bear on the topic.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.110
For example, a rather surprising discovery

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.920
that untrained tamarin monkeys distinguish

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.280
among some language types
in ways that are analogous

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.270
to newborn human infants, in all cases

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.410
without any experience,
though perhaps they use

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:22.680
different cues, that's
under investigation.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.780
Additional work is proceeding
along similar lines

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:31.270
also investigating what
Harvard primatologist

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.600
Marc Hauser calls wild
minds in natural settings,

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.210
also experimental work that he
and his laboratory are doing

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.630
on a number of topics including
computational capacities

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.170
of monkeys on language-like problems.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:51.840
It could turn out that
the core computational

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.470
properties of natural
language are found elsewhere

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.620
in the animal world, perhaps in what

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:01.770
perceptual psychologists call the rules

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.140
of visual intelligence that are used

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.860
to create what we see, quoting.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.140
Conceivably, you might even find them

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.180
in systems as remote as insect navigation,

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.720
that possibility and others
like them can't be excluded

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.360
and they do suggest avenues of research

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.730
into the evolution of at
least some of the factors

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:27.100
that enter into human language avenues

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.760
that might be promising.

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.340
My view, at least, if so,
that would be the first time

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.440
that the problem of evolution of language

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.810
becomes a really serious problem.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:43.810
Well, to proceed further
along in any of these areas

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.270
would require a good deal
of background discussion

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.143
that I can't take time for here.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.130
And, of course, this is where
the topic gets interesting,

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:57.540
but I'll put that aside and just restate

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.840
the guiding intuition of
the minimalist program,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.840
basically Galilean, insofar
as this program succeeds

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.600
we will be able to conclude
that principles of the kind

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.160
that one finds, say,
principles that hold for,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.520
say, sphere packing in early cell division

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.290
or formation of polyhedral cells

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.233
of polyhedral surfaces of viruses

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:33.300
or stability of body forms and symmetries,

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.720
maybe optimal wiring of neural systems,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.980
just general principles of
physical and mathematical laws,

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.880
may also hold for an organ
that's a very recent product

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.270
of evolution and appears
to be a crucial component

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.580
of whatever it is that's
specific about human beings,

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.850
certainly at the core of their existence,

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.470
their thought and their interaction.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.190
Although we have to bear in mind

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.900
that the classical problems
of the theory of mind,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.710
the ones that preoccupied
Descartes, Newton, and others,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.280
they remain as obscure as ever,

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.680
and the problem of unification,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.440
well, it takes a wholly different form

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.440
after the Newtonian revolution,
as I mentioned yesterday

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.220
that problem remains unsolved.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.570
The gaps look as unbridgeable today

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.640
as they did for chemistry and physics

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.940
not many years ago, 70 years ago.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.250
Well, let me return to
the initial question

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.530
that I began with yesterday,

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.630
the questions that are sometimes called

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.630
the problems of intentionality,

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.400
that is, how does language,
this biological entity,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.190
how does it relate to
the rest of the world?

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.950
One of these is the unification problem,

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.510
how do accounts of the brain in terms

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.630
of computational systems relate to others,

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.570
say in terms of cells?

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.340
As long as that question is unanswered,

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.710
there's a crucial explanatory gap

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:10.770
in accounts of behavior,
whether it's insect navigation

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.440
or human language, there's
a gap in explaining,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.180
accounting for how computations
eventuate in action.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.620
Notice that this is over and above

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.280
the questions that are not even posed,

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.220
that is questions of choice of action,

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.253
so like why does a cricket
turn left instead of right?

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:36.130
What about the second
problem of intentionality,

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:39.170
that is, the use of language
to talk about the world,

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:43.560
as when I say that I read
Darwin's Descent of Man

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.690
referring to a book.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.430
There are parallel problems
on the receptive side,

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.360
but let's focus attention on the questions

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.820
as they arise for the speaker.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.450
These questions have two aspects,

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.660
one is how does the sensory-motor system

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.730
use the instructions provided
by the internal language

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.490
to carry out gestures?

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.530
That would be articulatory gestures

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.560
in the case of spoken language,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.900
and second, how does the system of thought

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.780
use these instructions
to talk about a book

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:20.110
or a river or the crisis in Argentina

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.270
or whatever it may be?

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.820
It's this second aspect that's held to be

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:29.490
particularly vexing, but perhaps one can

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.290
gain some insight into it by asking about

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:37.280
the less contentious interface
with sensory-motor systems.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.070
So we now put aside the explanatory gap

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.810
that holds for all animal behavior

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.320
and we ask how the phonetic information

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.160
that's generated by the internal language

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.250
is accessed and used by
the sensory-motor system

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.300
for articulation,
alternatively perception,

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:58.470
but I'm putting that aside.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.826
Let's adopt a conventional but, in fact,

00:23:01.826 --> 00:23:06.230
non-trivial assumption,
namely that the phonetic

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:10.230
information of each expression is encoded

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.930
in a single internal generated object,

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.390
what's called its phonetic form

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.950
or phonetic representation,
here you have to be careful

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.740
to divorce the notion representation

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:28.290
of any connotations drawn
from other uses of the term

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.830
as in the classical theory of ideas

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.880
or in discussion of
representational art, for example.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.600
These problems have
been studied intensively

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.760
with hi-tech equipment for half a century

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.300
and long before that in other ways,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.870
but understanding remains quite limited.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:49.120
The problems are not easy, well,

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.090
maybe everybody's
overlooked an easy solution

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.510
which works like this.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:58.430
We all agree that the lexical item,

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.220
any lexical item, say book, has a sound

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.410
and sounds are perfectly
robust and familiar notions

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.520
so we can tell without difficulty

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:11.790
whether some event is the sound of book

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.850
or the sound of river.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.910
Unproblematically, we
can speak of the various

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.910
events that are sounds of
book, of the word book,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:22.320
on various occasions of use.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.050
So let's just say that
the internally generated

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:28.170
phonetic representation of the word book

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.520
just picks out a sound or
many sounds if we like,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:36.040
that relation we can
give a name, we can call,

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.760
we can give that relation a name,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.760
let's call it phonetically
denote, p denote,

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.280
let's say that that relation holds

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.090
between the internal object and the sound.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.420
Its properties will be the properties

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:55.640
of the technical notion, denote or refer,

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.160
that's devised for formal systems,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.620
say the relation between the numeral three

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.690
and the platonic entity three

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.990
in a system of formal arithmetic
of the Fregean variety,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.937
for those of you who know
some logic or metamathematics.

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:16.450
Further inquiries about the sound

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.730
don't have to bother us,
they can be forwarded

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.510
to the physics department,
perhaps they'll tell us

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.710
that the sound is some
indescribable, four-dimensional

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.943
space-time construct based
on motions of molecules.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.510
Perhaps inquiries can be forwarded

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.750
to the sociology department too

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.750
if we want to make the
task even more hopeless

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.570
by introducing some unexplained notion

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:45.570
of common language that
involves norms and conventions,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.120
attitudes, experts, and so on.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.350
Well, however we proceed there aren't

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.410
any ontological problems, that is,

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:54.490
no problems about existence.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.210
No one doubts the
existence of the particular

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.740
motion of molecules that
I produce when I say book,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.240
so there's no problem about
the existence of sounds,

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.890
the notion is perfectly robust,

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.160
to borrow the standard philosophical term.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.660
Problems of communication
are very easily solved,

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:19.500
you identify what I'm
saying because your internal

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.660
representation p denotes
the same sound as mine

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.850
or at least a sufficiently similar one.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.270
Okay, without preceding we've now solved

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.240
the problems to which acoustic

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.710
and articulatory phoneticians have devoted

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:37.270
so much labor without much success.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:39.290
Well, it's clear enough why this solution

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.910
has never been proposed, it's a bad joke.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.410
The new theoretical
notions, sound, and p denote

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.319
are completely useless, they
merely restate the problem

00:26:50.319 --> 00:26:54.510
in vacuous terminology,
leaving the problems,

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.000
in fact, even in more
worse shape than before.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
The proposal has all the virtues
of theft over honest toil

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.260
to borrow Bertrand Russell's aphorism.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.750
The actual course pursued is much harder,

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:12.760
we have to discover the elements

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.440
of the phonetic representation
of the word book

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:19.840
and others, the properties
that constitute it.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.550
Those are commonly called its features,

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:25.310
and we have to determine
how feature complexes

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.040
are accessed by the sensory-motor systems

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.150
and related to external events,

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.520
maybe ultimately motions of molecules.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:37.680
There's no determinant
mind-external object

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.500
that's picked out by an element

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.770
of the phonetic
representation as its sound.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.610
Rather, these internal
objects provide information,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:49.470
it's accessed by other systems to yield

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.740
or interpret mind-external
entities in a variety of ways

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.880
that depend on
circumstances, expectations,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.850
and a host of other factors.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.600
In fact, the real-world
problem is so intricate

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.700
and involves so many variables

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.490
that no one even contemplates studying it,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.990
actual inquiry keeps to highly idealized

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.563
experimental situations as
always in the natural sciences.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.360
Well, let's now consider an easy answer

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.380
to the problems that
arise on the meeting side,

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.930
following point by point the preceding

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.713
ridiculous account of the
sound side of language.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.540
I made up the other one,
but the one I'm going

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.080
through now is real, unfortunately.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.500
We all recognize that the
word book has a meaning

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.660
just as it has a sound.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.280
The entity book, whatever it is,

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.710
has an internal semantic representation

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:52.890
that incorporates all
information about its meaning

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.950
that's determined by the language

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.070
just as the internal
phonetic representation

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:00.950
incorporates all language-determined

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.020
information about sound.

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.170
And we know exactly what the word book,

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:08.070
or its semantic representation,

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.530
picks out in the world, namely books

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.010
just as the phonetic representation

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:17.730
picks out the sound or the
sounds of the word book.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:19.730
So we can therefore set up a relation

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.730
that's a counterpart of p
denote, let's call it s denote,

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.880
meaning semantically denote, s denote

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.890
holds that relation, holds between

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.800
the internal semantic representation

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.280
of the expression book and books.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.981
You understand that I'm
talking about books not tables

00:29:39.981 --> 00:29:44.981
because your word book, s,
denotes the same things as mine.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:53.830
And the child acquires
the s denotation relation

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:57.290
by virtue of causal
properties of the world

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:01.370
that relate external phenomena
to mind-internal entities,

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:05.520
let's call them concepts
to use the standard term.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.710
Those who are concerned about the status

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.710
of the external objects that are s denoted

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.110
that don't have to have any qualms,

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.150
these are some indescribable constructions

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:19.890
based on whatever physics
tells us about the world,

00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:24.730
and we can forward further inquiries

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:28.680
to the physics department or
maybe the sociology department,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.800
again, if we want to make
it even more hopeless.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.960
There aren't any problems
about the existence of books,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:38.600
those are the things that are
on bookshelves and tables.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.097
It's true that if you and I both took

00:30:41.097 --> 00:30:45.010
Darwin's Descent of Man out of the library

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:48.820
there is a question about whether
one book was taken or two,

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.470
but we can settle this any way we like.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.870
And if someone is concerned
that books are simultaneously

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:58.240
abstract and concrete and have a host

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.910
of other extremely odd
properties when you look closely,

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:06.020
we can answer robustly that
that's just what books are,

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:07.930
it's a problem of metaphysics

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.450
and not semantics or cognitive science.

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:16.450
Well, it should be clear that
something's gone badly wrong,

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.710
we're back to theft
rather than honest toil.

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:24.430
For one thing, referring is
something that people do,

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:27.610
not words, that was stressed 50 years ago

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.623
by Oxford philosopher Peter Strawson,

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.970
and known before, of course.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.400
And like other human actions,

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.510
referring is a highly intricate action.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.500
It's specific to circumstances,
it has normative aspects,

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.730
the act of referring succeeds or fails

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:50.130
in ways that depend on a
wide variety of conditions.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.100
The act need not even involve terms

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:57.480
that have some circumstance
independent relation

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.700
to the referential intention.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.360
So, for example, I can refer to India

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.870
without using any word
or having any thought

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:09.070
that has any independent
connection to India,

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.040
whatever India is.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.203
If such fundamental properties
of referring, the act,

00:32:15.203 --> 00:32:17.770
are omitted from consideration,

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.790
one may be studying something,

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:24.170
but it's not the problem of
intentionality or aboutness.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:26.520
Well, a fair response that could be given

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.620
is that exactly in other cases

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.070
we have to idealize if we hope

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.810
to gain some grasp of reality.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:37.600
We have to abstract away
from a welter of complexity

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.430
to focus on the properties
of core notions,

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.260
in this case s denote or p denote,

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.520
and that's a reasonable response,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.450
but it's a promissory note.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.620
As in other cases, it has to be justified

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.260
by showing how the idealization yields

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.490
some insight and explanatory power

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.740
and doesn't merely reformulate

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.530
the original dilemmas in misleading ways.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.870
That doesn't seem an easy
task in the present case,

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:07.670
to put it rather mildly.

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:09.990
In fact, I think it really is theft

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.880
rather than honest toil in both cases,

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.900
the case that's never even discussed,

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:17.300
the sensory-motor side, and the case

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.680
that's pretty standard, the
analog on the semantic side.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:26.370
Well, how can we approach the
problem of what's happening

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.910
when we think or talk about the world?

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.430
It's possible, and in my view likely,

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:37.430
that the study of sound provides
some useful clues to that.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:42.190
In that inquiry there isn't
any reference-like relation

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.120
between an element of
phonetic representation

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.230
and a mind-external entity.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.410
Rather, the speaker or
hearer employs the systems

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:55.040
of language use to access
the phonetic representation,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.240
the internal object, so as to produce

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.310
and interpret organism-external events.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.280
And perhaps something similar
is true on the meaning side,

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.380
so Smith uses an expression to refer

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.270
when his attention is focused
on some parts of the world

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.570
which he views from the
complex perspectives

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.630
that are provided by
internalist semantics,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.300
very much as in the case of sound.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.570
Features of the internal item, book,

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.450
in Smith's internal
language, provide information

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:33.120
that's used by other cognitive faculties,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.940
constraining the ways that Smith uses it

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:38.830
to talk about the world,
think about the world

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.880
differently from other words.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.900
Smith succeeds in communicating with Jones

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:47.110
to the extent that Jones
attends to related parts

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.960
of the world and has
appropriately-related perspectives

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.310
and understanding of
circumstances and background.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:56.930
Similarly, Jones's ability to perceive

00:34:56.930 --> 00:35:00.210
what Smith is uttering
depends on his ability

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.230
to map the noises that he hears

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.690
to his own internal language.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:07.740
And these are always
matters of more or less,

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.710
not yes or no.

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.440
Well, that's the point of view

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.250
that I've personally
regarded as reasonable

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:17.020
since I began thinking seriously

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.750
about these topics about 50 years ago.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.828
At that time influenced by Oxford

00:35:22.828 --> 00:35:27.280
ordinary language philosophy
and later Wittgenstein.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.900
But as I later learned,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.830
the approach has traditional antecedents.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:34.460
There's an important 18th century critique

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.237
of the theory of ideas
based on the observation

00:35:38.237 --> 00:35:42.400
that the phrase, he has an idea,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.780
should not be understood on the model of,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.210
he has a diamond, invoking
a reference-like relation

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:54.000
between the term idea and
some extramental entity,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.820
that's putting aside for the moment

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.740
whether that's even a proper
step in the case of diamond,

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.933
I think it's not.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.360
Rather, the phrase, he has an idea,

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:08.260
18th century commentators pointed out

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.750
the phrase, he has an idea,
means something like he thinks.

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.780
The phrase is what Gilbert Ryle

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.700
called a systematically
misleading expression

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.810
in an influential contribution

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:23.230
to 20th century ordinary
language philosophy,

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.150
actually resurrecting
a traditional critique.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.810
And the same conclusion
holds for a belief,

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:33.810
a thought, desire, other terms
of so-called folk psychology

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.170
as expressed in its
English language version,

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:41.850
which is far from universal,
in fact, rather idiosyncratic.

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:46.440
The basic insights generalized
to the whole vocabulary

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:49.810
and even more dramatically
to more complex expressions

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.520
constructed from lexical items.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.420
If this is anything like correct,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.810
most of the work that's
going in philosophy of mind,

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.060
philosophy of language, and
theoretical cognitive science

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:05.360
is just off on totally a wrong track,

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.080
as my opinion has been for years.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.990
The roots of these
insights are far deeper,

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.680
in fact, they extend
well beyond misleading

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.270
analogic interpretations of surface form

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.790
as in the case just mentioned,

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:23.740
the 18th century case resurrected by Ryle.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.680
Perhaps the first study of these matters

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.870
was by Aristotle, he asks, for example,

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:31.020
what's the nature of the house?

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.567
And he concludes, quoting Aristotle,

00:37:34.567 --> 00:37:38.617
"We can define a house as
stones, bricks, and timbers"

00:37:38.617 --> 00:37:41.647
"in terms of its material constitution"

00:37:41.647 --> 00:37:45.887
"or as a receptacle to shelter
chattels and living beings"

00:37:45.887 --> 00:37:48.460
"in terms of function and design."

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.460
So I may think that the place
that I call home is a house,

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.150
but I could be wrong, it
could really be a library

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:00.820
in which some odd people
spend much of their time.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.560
And, in fact, someone
entering it for the first time

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.470
might be pardoned for
reaching that conclusion.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.960
The answer depends on
choice of perspective

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.333
and on circumstances which
I might not even know.

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:19.580
So if that thing was
designed to be a library

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.350
and is characteristically
used that way while I'm gone,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:25.690
in fact, much of the time I'm there,

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.410
then perhaps it really is a library,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.200
it's not a house, contrary
to what I thought,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.310
or perhaps it's really a garage

00:38:34.702 --> 00:38:37.160
or maybe it's an oddly constructed

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:41.080
and misplaced paperweight
belonging to a giant

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.850
and so on, there simply is
no mind-independent truth

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.530
of the matter, and material constitution,

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:51.050
as Aristotle recognized,
is only one factor

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:52.810
in reaching answers.

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.200
We can also integrate the factors

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:59.100
of material constitution
and function design,

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.980
that's in Aristotle's terms,
combining matter and form,

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.740
and we can bring in other factors too,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.430
some of which he also explored.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.330
Well, for Aristotle these
are questions of metaphysics,

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.800
that is, the way the world is.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.430
Notice that he talked
about defining house,

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.760
the thing, not the word house.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.540
From the 17th century there's
been a very reasonable

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:25.490
tendency to reformulate such analyses

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.550
in epistemological, conceptual terms,

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.150
that is, as properties of something real,

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.800
but the construction and interpretation

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.233
of experience that's provided
by our cognitive capacities,

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.930
that's in our cognoscitive powers

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.900
in 17th century terminology, which include

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.270
the internal semantics of the language.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.320
And, in fact, there was
quite illuminating discussion

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.320
of these issues by Hobbes,
Cudworth, Locke, many others,

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:59.417
sometimes adopting David
Humes' principle that,

00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:02.020
I'm quoting him, that
the identify with which

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.920
we ascribe to things is
only a fictitious one

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.760
established by the mind,
not a peculiar nature

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.460
belonging to what we were talking about.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.240
Well, in all of these matters,

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.530
textual interpretation is uncertain,

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.630
but the general idea seems clear enough

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.460
and very plausible.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.710
The house that Smith lives in

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.750
or the books that he's reading

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:29.460
surely do not have their
strange and quite intricate

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:34.180
properties by virtue of some
mind-independent constitution.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:36.670
And the properties really
are strange and intricate,

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.690
as soon as you look at the
meanings of the words carefully,

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.120
dictionaries have nothing
to say about this,

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.453
they just presuppose it.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:48.310
Rather, they have these
properties by virtue of the way

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.710
Smith and others think in
particular circumstances

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.340
and the internal meanings of the terms

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:58.810
in which these thoughts are internally

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.760
or sometimes externally expressed.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.880
These devices, in turn, are a property

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.500
of fixed and shared internal human nature

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.830
as are other aspects of
their lives and being.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.030
The semantic properties of expressions

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.540
are used to think and talk about the world

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.950
in terms of perspectives that are made

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:22.560
available by the resources of the mind,

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.170
rather in the way that the sounds

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:25.950
of language seem to function,

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.960
in the latter case as everyone assumes.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:32.210
I've tried to show
elsewhere and won't review

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.370
that these conclusions are supported

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:38.240
by descriptive observations
that are in a tradition,

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.070
17th, 18th century tradition that's been

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.120
much too long forgotten
and greatly reinforced

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.030
when we look more
closely into the meanings

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:51.730
of even the simplest words,
including those investigated

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.100
in the 17th, 18th century philosophy,

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.970
British empiricism and others,

00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:01.430
words like tree or river or person

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:04.440
or names of substances like water

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.780
or the most elementary devices
of reference and anaphora,

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.250
probably every aspect of language.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.720
All are far more intricate than
has commonly been supposed,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.610
so much so that they must come to us

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:23.610
from the original hand of
nature, in David Humes' phrase,

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:27.560
and hence must be fundamentally
the same for all languages.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.480
Now, these topics have been addressed

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.740
in illuminating work by Julius
Moravcsik over at Stanford

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:38.100
on what he calls the
ideational theory of meaning,

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.570
bringing classical sources to bear

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.430
on contemporary issues
of language and thought,

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.170
others have pursued them too.

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.790
And the approach seems to me to have

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.630
a lot to recommend it.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:53.170
Well, what about Fregean systems
that are usually adopted?

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.530
That is, systems based on
either relation of denote

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.440
or refer, holding between
linguistic objects

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.660
and extralinguistic entities.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:03.750
It seems to me that these
are reasonable enough

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.580
for Frege's specific purposes,

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.510
most important for what
really interested him,

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.340
namely formal studies
of mathematical objects,

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.250
at least understood
platonistically in his terms.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:18.950
The ideas also seem
appropriate as a kind of a

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:22.280
normative ideal for the specific

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.790
human enterprise of science.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.760
That is, one hopes that
such notions as say,

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.300
black hole or oxygen or
electromagnetic field

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.710
will pick out something in the world,

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.770
in the mind-independent world.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.330
And we hope that the same will be true

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:43.000
of the internal entities
and computational principles

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.190
that are postulated in the
study of insect navigation

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.670
or visual perception or human language.

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.710
There's also some evidence
that animal communication,

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:57.100
outside of humans, is based
on a notion of representation

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.420
that's similar to the
invented technical concept

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.480
of reference that's familiar
in the study of formal systems.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.680
Here, the concept
representation is understood

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.200
as isomorphism, that is,
a one-to-one relation

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.940
between mind-brain processes and an aspect

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.180
of the environment to
which these processes

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.930
adapt the animal's behavior.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.780
As, for example, when an
ant picks out the corpse

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:28.100
of a conspecific by its odor.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:31.880
Actually, I'm quoting here,
again, Randy Gallistel

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.520
in the comprehensive
introduction to a series

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.853
of essays on animal representation.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.930
Well, if the picture that
I've just briefly reviewed

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.090
is anywhere near accurate,

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.870
it could turn out that
the use of language,

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.470
human language, to refer or in other ways

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:53.747
is totally different from
animal communication systems

00:44:53.747 --> 00:44:57.190
and this is in numerous other respects.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:45:01.160
Human language might not have
any denotational semantics,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:04.260
just an intricate form of pragmatics

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.960
along with very rich internal syntax

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.020
that includes what's
usually called semantics

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.610
but ought to be called syntax,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.610
it's the study of
internal representations.

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:19.040
Of this amalgam, the parts
that we can currently hope

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.260
to understand in most depth
are the internal syntax,

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.900
what's called semantics.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.490
A theory of human action
that would bear on

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:30.300
in some revealing way
on the act of referring

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:34.330
is far more remote than
comparable theories

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:37.650
for much simpler organisms and actions,

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:42.650
domains in which the problem
is scarcely even entertained

00:45:42.770 --> 00:45:45.890
because it's understood
to be far too complicated.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.060
Well, so far I've kept the language,

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.110
but in principle everything I've said

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.850
should carry over to the study
of other mental qualities.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:58.060
In practice, however, the
difficulties mount very quickly,

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.710
language appears to be relatively isolated

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.310
from other cognitive capacities.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:07.090
Here I'm referring to its
structure, not its use

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.870
or the particular component
which are integrated

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.620
into the structure which
could be individually shared

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.620
with other cognitive faculties
or even other species

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:18.240
as I had mentioned before.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.844
One of the reasons why
language is a good topic

00:46:21.844 --> 00:46:25.740
for study for inquiry into the mind

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.880
is its essential role in human affairs,

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:30.700
but another is that it is indeed

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.660
or appears to be relatively isolated.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.510
When we turn to other aspects of mind,

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.780
for example, our moral nature,

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.660
it's much harder to isolate
components for separate study,

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:46.610
that means to abstract them
from reflective thought

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.010
and variety of other factors.

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.080
Nonetheless, those topics,
the study of our moral nature,

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.660
have been subjected to
investigation in various ways.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:59.400
Now, that includes interesting
thought experiments,

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.730
actual experiments with children

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.510
in the last couple of years
and comparative studies.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:09.540
Not uncommonly, the real
world offers illustrations

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.560
of how these faculties function,

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.740
sometimes with very painful choices.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.860
Issues like that test our moral faculties

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.223
and may help us to discover
something about their nature.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.070
Sometimes this perspective is counterposed

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.780
to what's called a relativistic one

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.920
which holds in an extreme form that apart

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.270
from their basic physical
structure humans have no nature,

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:38.600
they have only history,
or that their thought

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.880
and behavior can be
modified without limit.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.310
Nothing like this can
be even close to true

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:47.900
if taken literally, though seems to be

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.240
what is sometimes said in aversion

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.490
due to Richard Rorty
history on anthropology,

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:57.750
I'm quoting him, show that humans

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.280
have extraordinary malleability,

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:01.990
we're coming to think of ourselves

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.110
as the flexible, protean,
self-shaping animal

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:09.510
rather than as having specific instincts.

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.940
Now there can be no moral
progress in human affairs,

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:15.810
just different ways of looking at things.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.500
We should put aside the vain effort

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.810
of exploration of our moral nature

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.687
or reasoned argument about it,

00:48:23.687 --> 00:48:27.330
and we should keep to what he
called manipulating sentiments

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.840
if we happen to be for or against torture

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.340
or massacre, for example.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.430
I suspect I'm misinterpreting
because it's hard

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.940
to believe that the words are intended

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.804
to mean what they seem to say.

00:48:41.804 --> 00:48:46.433
Well, such proposals have
evoked a good deal of criticism,

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:51.653
Oxford philosopher Galen Strawson,

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.100
quoting related statements of Rorty's

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.670
on the relevance of the
extralinguistic world,

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:03.620
the truth, he asks whether
the nonsense might be less bad

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.890
if it didn't build in such
an astonishing contempt

00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:09.290
for the reality of human suffering.

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.060
And his conclusion is it's just as bad.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.510
A recent paper on the
philosophical foundations

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:19.470
of human rights by Matthias Mahlmann

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:22.329
discussing Rorty and others

00:49:22.329 --> 00:49:25.190
points out that, quoting him,

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.970
nobody would've taken a nazi seriously

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.780
who had claimed in 1945
that the sole basis

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.190
for the moral condemnation
of the Holocaust

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:36.460
by the rest of the world is just due

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:40.680
to some kind of culturally
relative emotional manipulation

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.220
based on shrewdly devised
sentimental stories.

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:47.030
If that's so, and I assume it is,

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.570
we want to understand why, and if nobody

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:53.280
really means no normal human being,

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.260
that leads us back to the hard questions

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.680
of intrinsic human nature.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.490
This notion of unique human malleability

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:06.020
is not at all novel, it's been
a fairly conventional view,

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.800
at least back to the
beast-machine controversies

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.860
that were inspired by Descartes.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:15.350
And, for example, the
argument of James Harris,

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.260
British philosopher in 1740,

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.910
that unlike animals and machines,

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:23.930
the leading principle of man is multiform,

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:28.250
originally uninstructed,
pliant and docile.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:33.250
The idea that human-alleged
weakness of instinct

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.810
leads to vast variety
and extreme malleability

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:42.810
has had a long and, in fact,
inglorious history ever since.

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.520
Well, with no metric and
little understanding,

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.110
it's hard to know what to
make of those judgments.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.900
But whatever merit they have,

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.010
they cannot offer an alternative

00:50:54.010 --> 00:50:57.370
to the conception that I just outlined.

00:50:57.370 --> 00:51:00.680
No one doubts that a
person's understanding

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.230
and judgment and values and goals

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:08.230
reflect acquired cultures,
norms, conventions, and so on.

00:51:08.790 --> 00:51:11.440
But these aren't mind-external entities,

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.770
they're not acquired by taking a pill,

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.010
they're constructed by the mind

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:21.880
on the basis of scattered
and constructed experience,

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.560
and they're constantly
applied in circumstances

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.680
that are novel and complex.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.840
And to these facts and their significance

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.730
were discussed 250 years ago by David Hume

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:34.530
who observed, I'm quoting him,

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:38.810
that the number of our duties
is in a manner infinite.

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:42.880
Therefore, just as in other
parts of the study of nature

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.760
we must seek a few general principles

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.760
upon which all our notions
of morals are founded,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.570
principles of human nature
that are original instincts

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:58.100
of the human mind that are
perhaps enhanced by reflection

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:01.840
but steadfast and immutable as components

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.830
of fixed human nature.

00:52:03.830 --> 00:52:05.890
Hume, notice, is articulating

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:09.210
the basic idea behind generative grammar

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:13.400
in a different cognitive
domain and centuries earlier.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.620
Like Adam Smith, Hume
took sympathy to the,

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:21.430
what he called a very powerful
principle in human nature,

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.650
one of our original instincts

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.240
and the grounding of much else.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.860
That idea was reconstructed
in a Darwinian framework

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.440
about a hundred years ago by the anarchist

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.090
natural historian Peter Kropotkin

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.500
in what I think should be
taken as the founding work

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:42.040
in what's nowadays called
evolutionary psychology.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:44.050
And there's recent work that suggests

00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:47.440
some possible evolutionary scenarios.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.210
Well, there's little reason to suppose

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:53.070
that the variety of cultural outcomes

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.770
reflect significant variety
of genetic endowment

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.690
so we're back to the situation we faced

00:52:58.690 --> 00:53:01.510
in the study of language
or the visual system

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:04.410
or any other basic property of organisms.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.950
It's necessary to account for the richness

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.780
and specificity of outcome on the basis

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:13.830
of shared intrinsic nature
tolerating variation

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:16.360
but within a highly structured range

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.160
as throughout the biological world.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.330
Well, to this picture we should add

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:24.720
other conceptions that have
been studied in recent years

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.720
and also resurrecting
the 17th century origins

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.150
of modern science.

00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:37.130
One strand is the recognition
that our innate capacities

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:40.200
are only latent, that is
they have to be triggered

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.870
by experience to be manifested.

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:45.340
Then they're manifested in ways determined

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:49.290
by our intrinsic nature,
much as susceptibility

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.720
to a disease is innate, though the disease

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.050
requires an external trigger.

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:58.410
That's actually the analogy
that Descartes suggested

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.720
in discussing innate
ideas, one of the reasons

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.870
why Locke's famous critique
is beside the point,

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:07.830
that's long recognized.

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:11.590
Another idea that was fruitfully examined

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:14.450
in the 17th century is that the phenomena

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.080
of the world around us do not

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.990
in themselves constitute experience.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:23.260
They become experience for
us as they are constructed

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.940
by our modes of cognition.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.150
I'm quoting 17th century work,

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.240
these, they must therefore conform

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.833
to these modes of cognition.

00:54:33.833 --> 00:54:38.833
This is 17th century, picture
came into modern thought

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:43.170
through Kant's version of it.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.650
These modes of cognition
are a distinctive property

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:50.000
of our nature, they differ
for different organisms.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.630
They're what the evolutionary
biologist Konrad Lorenz

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.170
called the biological a priori,

00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:01.240
in work that I, in fact,
discussed here 35 years ago.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.680
That's also true of the
rich mental constructions

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:07.750
that we call cultures,
norms, and conventions

00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:09.910
insofar as they're shared by groups

00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:12.640
that interact in complex ways.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.500
Well, still assuming that each child

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.900
is intrinsically capable of acquiring

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.840
any culture over a very broad range,

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.840
the process of mental
construction of experience

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.410
and interpretation of it is based

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:29.090
on the common genetic constitution

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:32.103
which must be rich to the
extent that the outcomes

00:55:32.103 --> 00:55:35.110
are highly structured and constrained

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:37.990
in ways that do not
simply reflect features

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:42.000
of the environment,
basically Hume's observation.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.430
It seems unavoidable that the so-called

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:47.213
relativistic approaches
must be profoundly innatist,

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:50.020
at least that they're willing to address

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.470
the issues of nature acquisition

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:57.620
and use of attained
systems, Hume's questions.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:56:00.270
If so, then they fall
together with the study

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:03.340
of visual or linguistic systems

00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.760
or other properties of organisms,

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.300
hard to see any serious distinctions here,

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:13.450
or any interpretation
under which relativistic

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:18.450
approaches differ from the most
highly innatist approaches.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:23.230
Well, one last word on the
import of any conclusion,

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.840
it has to be a very tentative
conclusion about human nature,

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:30.530
one way to assess the
importance of such conclusions

00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:35.440
is to observe how deeply
they enter into conceptions

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.440
of right and justice and the
struggles that they engender.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:44.420
It's very easy to illustrate
from personal relations

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.640
to international affairs.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.100
More generally, every approach
to how human relations

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:53.300
should be arranged,
whether it's revolutionary

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.130
or reformist or committed to stability,

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:59.860
every such approach is
based on some conception

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.730
of human nature, at least implicitly.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:05.740
If it has any claim to moral standing,

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.740
it's advanced with the claim
that it's beneficial to humans,

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.480
meaning because of their intrinsic nature,

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.430
at least as one of its crucial qualities.

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:19.730
We should face honestly
the fact that our ignorance

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:24.380
which is profound, but yet
recognize that we have no choice

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:28.360
but to proceed on the
best tentative assumptions

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.990
we can reach.

00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:33.250
For many of the classical mysteries,

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.460
quite extraordinary bodies of doctrine

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.602
have been developed in the
past several hundred years,

00:57:38.602 --> 00:57:40.220
they're some of the greatest achievements

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.000
of the human intellect,

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.760
they also have far-reaching
implications for human life.

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.140
And there have been some remarkable feats

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:51.950
of unification as well,
sometimes very surprising

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:53.840
in how they turned out as in the cases

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:55.620
I discussed yesterday.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:59.163
How remote the remaining
mountain peaks are,

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:03.730
even where they are,
one can scarcely guess.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.040
Within the range of feasible inquiry

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.880
there's plenty of work to be done

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.350
in understanding mental
aspects of the world,

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:12.090
including human language.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:15.860
We would do well, however, in my opinion,

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.810
to keep in some corner of our minds

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:22.810
Hume's conclusion about
nature's ultimate secrets

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.230
and the obscurity in which they ever did

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:28.560
and ever will remain, and
particularly the reasoning

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.760
that led him to that
judgment and the confirmation

00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.420
of that reasoning in
the subsequent history

00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:35.903
of the hard sciences.

00:58:35.903 --> 00:58:37.970
Now, these are matters that are

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.100
too easily forgotten I suspect

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.960
and that merit serious reflection,

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:48.680
perhaps someday even
constructive scientific inquiry.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.165
Thank you.

00:58:50.165 --> 00:58:53.165
(audience applauds)

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:08.260
- We have a number of questions

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.650
that we'd like to put to you.

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:11.483
- Okay.

00:59:11.483 --> 00:59:13.720
- First of these is, when
you say that language

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:15.930
is a matter of computation,

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:18.760
do you mean in the observer-relative

00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:21.410
or the observer-independent sense?

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.970
And do humans really
start off in the world

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:26.020
with the requisite concepts to express

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:29.083
things like carburetor and bureaucrat?

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:33.310
- Well, as far as the
first part is concerned

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:37.790
we could ask the same question
about insect navigation.

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:42.790
So take a look at, say, the
study of insects by scientists.

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.770
You find that they attribute to the insect

00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:52.440
highly intricate computational systems

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:54.940
which enable, say, bees or ants

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:58.240
to do things that are
far out of our range.

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.100
We can't determine the azimuth of the sun

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:04.180
as a function of the time of year and day

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:08.240
or do dead reckoning the way
an ant and so on and so forth.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.750
The explanations of these that are offered

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.090
in the literature are
computational systems.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:18.040
Are they independent of the observer?

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.380
Well, in the sense that any science

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.250
is independent of the observer,

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:26.678
so when you have a model of
the, say, planetary system,

01:00:26.678 --> 01:00:29.280
in a sense it's relative to the observer.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.410
That is, we can't get out of
our skins, that's hopeless.

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:35.260
But the enterprise of science is an effort

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:38.180
to get out of our skins as much as we can.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.090
You try to construct
an account of the world

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:45.660
that is as observer-independent
as we can manage.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.580
Now, there are limits to this,

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.250
for example, studied in quantum physics,

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:52.620
but we can put that aside.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.080
So yes, it's observer-independent

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.313
in the sense in which
any scientific construct

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.110
is observer-independent, no different.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:07.570
It's true whether it's
computational systems

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:11.320
of insects, whether it's
computational systems of humans,

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.170
whether it's the planetary system

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:18.300
or anything else that
science tries to understand.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.270
As for carburetor and bureaucrat,

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.620
I have to say that my Jerry Fodor

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:27.100
was a little offended by
the fact that the statement

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.090
you quoted was attributed
to me in a recent article,

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:33.610
actually it's his, his proposal,

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:37.910
and he wrote to me that he's sorry

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:39.770
that it came up because he can prove

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.860
that the notion carburetor isn't innate

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:45.840
since he doesn't even know
how to spell it, you know,

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.130
but the fact is that he was
making a very serious point.

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:53.010
His point was that we
have to somehow account

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.640
for the fact that terms like carburetor

01:01:55.640 --> 01:02:00.640
and, what was the other,
bureaucrat, we do understand,

01:02:01.330 --> 01:02:04.050
just as we understand river and tree

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.630
and person and very simple words,

01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:08.210
and we understand them on the basis

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:10.560
of extremely limited evidence.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.670
We have a rich and complex
understanding of them.

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.100
So we're back to the problem

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:17.920
of why we grow arms rather than wings.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:19.780
You can't just wave your hand about it

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.820
and say, well, it's the culture

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.940
because then we have to ask
how did we acquire the culture?

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.850
And, as I said, it's not by taking a pill.

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:30.200
The culture is a construction of the mind

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.830
on the basis of scattered experience.

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:37.110
So the answer that Fodor,
Fodor takes a stronger

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.480
position than I do, I don't
want to defend his position,

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.650
but in general this is the problem,

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.810
what is it about the nature of our minds,

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:48.950
the intrinsic nature of our minds

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:52.080
that allows us to acquire concepts

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.080
like river, person, tree, water, book,

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.210
carburetor, bureaucrat,
even though we have

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.640
very scattered experience?

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.550
And that's the general problem
of developmental biology.

01:03:05.550 --> 01:03:07.180
And the only answer that anyone knows

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:09.800
is the one I just quoted from Hume,

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.170
talking about our moral
nature 250 years ago,

01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:15.450
and the one that's
assumed by every biologist

01:03:15.450 --> 01:03:18.260
for everything except the
human mental qualities.

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.470
It's got to come out, come somehow

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:22.710
from the intrinsic nature of our minds.

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:25.053
And in that respect it's innate,

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.070
the fact that it's difficult to accept

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.120
is a sign of our irrationality

01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:35.627
because it's got to be that
way unless it's a miracle.

01:03:35.627 --> 01:03:39.000
It's either a miracle or it's
pretty much along the lines

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.523
that Fodor suggested, maybe
not as extreme as his position.

01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:45.940
- Thank you.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:48.490
Semi-related, the second question is,

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.440
is it a good idea or not to search

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.020
for evolutionary precursors to language

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.153
whether in cognitive,
sensory, motoric systems?

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.813
- Yeah, it's a good idea,

01:04:01.813 --> 01:04:04.250
and, in fact, if you can find any, fine.

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.561
In fact, I suppose the
question was written

01:04:05.561 --> 01:04:10.170
before the comments I made
- Absolutely.

01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.500
- Well, yeah, I think it's a fine idea.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.330
In fact, I think we're
just getting to the point

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:15.740
where it may be possible to do it.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.490
If, in fact, something like the program

01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:21.490
that I very sketchily outlined,

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:24.570
if something like it
turns out to be correct,

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:27.340
that is if we can give
a principled explanation

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:30.030
for significant aspects of language

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.310
in terms of interface conditions

01:04:33.796 --> 01:04:35.890
and computational principles,

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:37.880
then it makes perfect sense to search

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.770
not only for, I wouldn't
call them precursors,

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:45.962
for homologues, homologous
structures in other organisms

01:04:45.962 --> 01:04:47.983
that happen to be like this.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.790
And as I say, we might
find very remote ones.

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:54.500
We might, I don't think anyone expects it,

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.970
but you can't exclude the possibility

01:04:56.970 --> 01:04:59.670
that we might discover that the basic

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.130
computational principles of language

01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:05.810
show up in insect navigation,
it's not impossible.

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:07.350
In fact, it's not even crazy.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.030
It wouldn't be a precursor to language

01:05:10.030 --> 01:05:12.410
like bees aren't a precursor to humans.

01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:16.090
Remember, species are not
precursors of one another

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:19.110
like bees are no more precursors of us

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:22.373
than we are of bees, just
different evolutionary lines.

01:05:23.405 --> 01:05:28.040
And if you can find sensory or perceptual

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.740
or other computational components

01:05:33.837 --> 01:05:36.160
in the nature of other organisms

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.160
that have some potentially
homologous relationship

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.620
to human language, yeah,
that would be interesting,

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:46.983
of course, that's what
evolutionary studies are about.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.530
- [William] Well, further
proof that these were written

01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:52.090
before you spoke is
given the next question,

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:54.530
why are children geniuses of language

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:57.090
between ages one-and-a-half and four,

01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:59.530
yet other cognitive abilities
are still developing

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:03.163
at a much more concrete,
much less abstract level?

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:08.750
- It's kind of like asking
why children undergo puberty

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:13.400
around age 12 instead of age 35,

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.300
that's the way we're designed, you know?

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.500
We're designed so that certain things

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.720
happen at particular times.

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.380
In that respect we're like every other

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.310
organism in the world.

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:28.400
Binocular vision, being
able to focus your eyes

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:31.467
and use that for depth
perception and so on,

01:06:31.467 --> 01:06:34.650
now that comes along
at around four months,

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:37.270
so we might ask, well, why does
it come along at four months

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.630
and not at one month or six years?

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.610
Well, the answer to that
would have to be something

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:46.500
about the way we're
genetically programmed.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.520
All of these questions are
much too hard to answer,

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.030
nobody knows the answers
to any questions like that

01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:54.560
even for primitive organisms,

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.820
what we call primitive, like insects,

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:59.170
now which are by no means primitive.

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.980
But to try to answer the
question for language

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.300
is far beyond reach, nobody knows

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.300
how genetic instructions
create an organism.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:13.190
That's one of the reasons
why the Human Genome Project

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:17.820
is looked at with some
skepticism by many biologists.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:20.020
Now, you could know
the entire human genome

01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:22.400
and that would tell you
very little about humans,

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.150
because you don't know how you go

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.760
from genetic instructions to an organism.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.300
That's an incredibly complex process,

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.943
only tiny bits of which are understood.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:35.230
And this is just one of
those many questions,

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:39.200
all of them very poorly understood.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.640
- [William] Somewhat different
direction is indicated

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.090
by the next question,
if the study of language

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:45.860
is a branch of natural science

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.940
and language consists of a
lexicon plus computations,

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.020
how would you respond to Sorel's critique

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:54.830
that computation is not a
notion of natural sciences

01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:58.000
like mass or photosynthesis
but an abstract

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.610
mathematical notion which
is entirely relative

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:01.740
to the observer?

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:04.190
- Same, well, first of
all it's not relative.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.760
It's relative to the
observer in the same way

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.730
that any scientific construct is.

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:11.020
Yes, in that sense, of course it is.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.150
Is it an abstract mathematical concept?

01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:16.310
Sure it is, just like Fourier analysis

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:18.440
calculus, anything that's
used in the sciences

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.900
is an abstract in the advanced sciences,

01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.000
is an abstract mathematical concept

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:27.350
that is applied to particular situations.

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:30.590
That's why Newton and Leibniz
had to invent calculus

01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.560
in order to study the effects of motion,

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.080
and the same is true here.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.780
Computational systems are particular kinds

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:41.390
of mathematical notions that appear to be

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:45.020
very well-adapted to problems like, say,

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.290
insect navigation, bee communication,

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:50.770
human language, and some other things.

01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:52.600
So the point is correct, yeah,

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.950
it is an abstract mathematical concept

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:57.740
used in these areas to
give us the best theories

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.060
that we can find.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:00.660
If somebody can find a better theory

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.270
that doesn't involve computation,

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:04.100
great, let's have a look at that,

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.560
for insects or humans or anything else.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.880
But until then we just work

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.900
with the best theories we can find.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:11.380
Notice that this is very similar

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.820
to what I talked about
yesterday concerning chemistry.

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:19.810
Up until very recently, in
fact, less than a century ago,

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:24.810
1920s, leading scientists
described chemistry

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.000
in exactly the same way.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.440
They said it's just an
invented computational system,

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.610
it's a calculating device, it
yields the phenomenal effects

01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:38.070
that you see in experiments,
but it's not real,

01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:39.930
can't be real, it's just something

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:42.790
that people invented in
order to have some way

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.360
of organizing the phenomena that

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.900
they discover in experiments.

01:09:46.900 --> 01:09:48.250
Why can't it be real?

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.390
Well, because it couldn't
be reduced to physics.

01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:52.890
Which was true, couldn't
be reduced to physics,

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.160
reason, physics was wrong,

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:57.650
so it couldn't be reduced to physics.

01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:00.450
After physics was radically revised

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:03.430
by the invention of
development of quantum physics,

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.630
Linus Pauling succeeded in giving

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.430
a quantum theoretic account
of the chemical bond,

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:10.480
he won the Nobel Prize for it.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:13.510
It's 1935, it's not that long ago

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:16.440
And then chemistry and
physics were unified

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:19.320
and everyone recognized
that all of this talk

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.420
about calculating devices
was complete nonsense.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.250
Chemistry was the best
theory you could devise

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:27.600
for dealing with these problems,

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.890
and that's the only notion
of reality that we have,

01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:32.780
we don't have any other notion.

01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.870
The only notion of reality we have

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:38.560
is whatever our best theories
provide, there's nothing else.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.150
So chemistry was as real as you like,

01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:44.030
happened to be more real than physics

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.180
which was on a wrong track.

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.770
When physics changed they became unified,

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:51.210
you get the contemporary science.

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:53.520
In this case, the best theories we have

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.510
as far as anyone knows are
computational theories,

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:58.990
so that's reality.

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:02.717
If neurophysiology doesn't
integrate with them

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:04.990
and we don't know where the problem is,

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:07.870
it may be in the brain sciences, it may be

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:09.690
in the computational theories,

01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:11.240
maybe everything's on the wrong track,

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:14.050
that's often happened in
the history of science too.

01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:15.360
You know, you don't know the answers

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.870
until you find the answers.

01:11:16.870 --> 01:11:19.660
But there are no questions
about the reality

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:23.380
and calculating devices
and observer relativity

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:26.340
and so on, they simply do not arise

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.700
for reasons which are well understood.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.220
We have a couple of centuries of history

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.580
of the hard sciences from which we ought

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.230
to be able to learn some
lessons, including these.

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:40.950
And they apply in this
case as in earlier cases.

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:42.010
- [William] As a theoretical chemist,

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:43.910
thank you for transcending
some boundaries.

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:44.743
Moving along.

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:47.500
You mentioned yesterday
that a number of theories

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.430
of biolinguistics are, quote,

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:52.180
pointless or obviously misguided.

01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:55.406
Why then do other scholars
continue to pursue them?

01:11:55.406 --> 01:11:57.400
(audience laughs)

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.950
- Gotta ask the other scholars.

01:12:00.210 --> 01:12:03.970
I can't, it depends, I mentioned
a few and gave some reasons

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:05.040
why I think they're misguided.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.560
Incidentally, those were not
theories of biolinguistics,

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.870
those were theories of language

01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:13.540
which deny that language
is a part of the world.

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.410
- [William] I see.

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.473
- I think that's seriously misguided.

01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:19.920
- [William] You have disqualified Quine's

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.650
radical translation
paradigm, calling it a new,

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:26.410
quote, mythological, epistemological
dualism, closed quote.

01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.823
Could you explain this more?

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:30.190
- Well, the radical translation,

01:12:30.190 --> 01:12:31.600
there's a little misunderstanding of this,

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.653
the radical translation paradigm,

01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:37.790
the fact that, this will
only be intelligible

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:39.440
to those of you who know this stuff.

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:43.300
But Quine's conclusion about what he calls

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:47.360
indeterminacy of translation
that comes from this paradigm,

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:50.540
I don't disagree with that conclusion.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.510
I think the conclusion is correct,

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.560
it just seems to be a truism.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.260
That's what I thought when
I was a student of Quine's

01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:59.460
in graduate school 50 years ago,

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.450
and we argued about it
then and I still think so,

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:04.340
it's true, but it's a truism.

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.900
In fact, it's just one example

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:11.640
of underdetermination
of theories by evidence,

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.750
known to be a truism at least since Hume.

01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:16.800
Quine's argued that there's
nothing more involved,

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.590
but I don't think he's demonstrated it,

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:20.830
you can look at the literature and see.

01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:23.550
As for the radical translation paradigm,

01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:25.806
that's an approach to
the study of language

01:13:25.806 --> 01:13:30.520
that we would never adopt in
the study of anything else,

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.540
say, insect navigation or any topic,

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.320
you would never adopt that paradigm.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.500
In that case you have to ask

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.700
why do you oppose it for human language?

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.380
Well, as far as I can see, that's a kind

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:46.550
of methodological dualism.

01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:49.260
It's saying we somehow have to approach

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:52.820
higher human mental faculties by methods

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:55.140
that we would never use anywhere else

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.160
in studying the physical world.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.420
Now, that's not old-fashioned
metaphysical dualism,

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:04.460
it's something much worse,
methodological dualism.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.300
Metaphysical dualism, you
know, mind-body dualism,

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.580
that was a scientific theory.

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:12.293
It was a substantial scientific theory,

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.430
it was the early scientific revolution,

01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:21.560
Galileo through Newton, it was
a serious scientific theory

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:24.300
that was a conception of matter

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:29.220
in terms of a mechanistic
picture of the world,

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:33.200
what's called contact mechanics,
common sense mechanics,

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.880
things interact if they're in contact,

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.360
what we all intuitively believe

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.130
even if we've taken a physics course

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:42.063
and know that it's false,
we still believe it

01:14:42.063 --> 01:14:45.000
because we can't help it, it's our nature.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.730
So contact mechanics was developed,

01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.760
gave a picture of matter.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:53.180
There were clearly some things
it couldn't accommodate,

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.620
it's Descartes' point and he was correct.

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:58.330
He therefore postulated
a different principle

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:00.690
to account for them, that's science,

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:02.630
you know, it's the
right way to do science.

01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:05.760
He was shown to be wrong
in a surprising way,

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.340
namely matter doesn't exist, okay,

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.520
therefore you can't, doesn't matter,

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.190
it's of no interest that other phenomena

01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:15.560
don't fall within the concept of matter

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.970
because nothing does.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:19.480
Okay, so that ends metaphysical dualism,

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:22.150
there's no more mind-body problem.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:25.180
Methodological dualism is just pernicious,

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:28.330
there's no reason why
we should study human

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:32.640
higher mental faculties in suicidal ways

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.900
which we would never use
in studying other topics,

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.340
why should we do that?

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:39.490
That's a kind of a methodological dualism

01:15:39.490 --> 01:15:42.203
which has no saving graces
as far as I can see.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.140
- [William] Thank you
so much, and thank you

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.960
for a couple of wonderful presentations,

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.983
please join me in thanking Dr. Chomsky.

01:15:49.983 --> 01:15:52.983
(audience applauds)

01:16:00.668 --> 01:16:03.835
(introspective music)
