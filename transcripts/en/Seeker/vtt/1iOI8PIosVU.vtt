00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:04.430
When you hear the words “particle accelerator”,
the first thing that probably pops in your

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.089
mind is the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.690
I mean it is the most powerful atom-smashing
machine on the planet, charged with unpacking

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.800
the fundamental mysteries of our universe…

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.460
I went there once, it’s pretty awesome!

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.699
Particle accelerators do exactly that: accelerate
particles.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.289
Basically, charged subatomic particles move
through a circular pipe.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.199
As they whip around, the strength of the electric
field keeping them contained increases.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.090
More energy, faster particles.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.109
And more faster, more better.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.860
At the LHC, particles make 11,000 laps every
second for about 20 minutes till they reach

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.780
their optimum energy level and collide -- that’s
so fast!

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
Scientists use this high-energy tool to better
understand the laws of physics, and find explanations

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.490
for theories to explain matter, space, and
time.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.870
Even though the L-H-C is the biggest, it definitely
isn’t the only particle accelerator out

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.870
there.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.570
In fact, you probably live not too far from
one!

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.890
There are over 30,000 particle accelerators
all over the world doing a variety of jobs

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.909
that sometimes have nothing to do with particle
physics.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.060
For example, if you’re in Paris, France
admiring the towering glass pyramid at the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.310
Louvre museum, there’s a particle accelerator
15 meters below you.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.310
Yep.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.789
In the basement, physicists use their particle
accelerator called AGLAE for cultural preservation.

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.509
AGLAE scans priceless museum artifacts, uncovering
what they’re made of, and making sure that

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.509
they are the real deal.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.710
Want more specifics?

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.930
OF COURSE YOU DO.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.759
These scientists used AGLAE to identify the
minerals in the eyes of a famous 4,500 year

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.880
old Egyptian sculpture called “The Seated
Scribe.”

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.880
I've seen it.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.880
It's awesome.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.280
For all 3 of you art history nerds out there,
it’s made of black rock crystal, white magnesium

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.280
carbonate, and iron oxide.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.979
And it is super cool.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.119
How about another, yes please.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.009
No one likes contaminated food right?

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.639
Well, you can thank your friendly neighborhood
particle accelerator for zapping any traces

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.689
of e-coli or salmonella from your groceries.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.390
You've likely heard of foods being irradiated.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.049
Scientifically speaking, without radiation
nothing would grow on our planet -- in that

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.420
all light is radiation, but I digress.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.470
Grocery Irradiation works by shooting a stream
of high energy particles into the food, thus

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.000
killing all bacteria while maintaining the
quality of the produce.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Easy.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.560
It's sort of like pasteurizing milk or canning
food, except scientists are using laser beams

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560
plus amazingness.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.750
So, if you see this symbol next to a bag of
spinach, it means it’s been treated with

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:31.750
a particle accelerator.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.700
And that you should probably get excited at
the store and tell everyone.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.950
Some of the most ubiquitous accelerators aren’t
cyclical ones like the Large Hadron Collider,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.000
they’re linear.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.140
A straight line, like a launch device for
a but instead, they're launching particles.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.819
These are called "linacs" or "Linear Accelerators"
The longest linac in the world is at the SLAC

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.180
… it's buried underground and if you’ve
ever driven on a section of highway 280 in

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.780
California, you’ve driven RIGHT OVER IT.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.780
WHAT.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.069
Linacs like the one at the SLAC are used by
hospitals to kill cancer!

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.940
Proton therapy utilizes a particle accelerator
that fires a beam right at a patient’s tumor.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.340
This was a break away from conventional radiation
therapy using x-rays, since proton therapy

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.939
can target tumors without causing any extensive
damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.800
Doctors are able to adjust how deeply the
protons penetrate the patient's body, which

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.319
is why it's such an optimum technique.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.930
This kind of treatment is critical for head
and neck tumors, which are surrounded by the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.340
brain stem, spinal cord, tongue, etc … basically
super important structures that you’d ideally

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.970
want to keep intact.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.230
And these are just some of the problems particle
accelerators are tackling.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.909
You can find them helping scientists discover
new drugs to treat major diseases, inspecting

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.439
shipping cargo … the list truly goes on
for this unsung hero in science!

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.420
So we know all matter is made up of particles,
but...what the heck are particles?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.390
Julian will give you a crash course in subatomic
particles right here.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.659
And do you live next to a particle accelerator?

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.810
Have you ever visited one?

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.590
