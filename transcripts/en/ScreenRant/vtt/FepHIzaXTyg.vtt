00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.670
Disney may be a major studio, but it started
small, which meant its animators had to bring

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.241
people, animals, and magical creatures to
life better than any one.

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:20.930
When they did just that - and didn't have
the budget to bankroll million-dollar movies

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.689
- the animators decided NOT to start from
scratch.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.770
Instead, they traced over animation that had
already been released.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.290
And if you think it's just a case of copying
a handful of frames, we've got a surprise

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.290
for you!

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.690
Here are Screen Rant's 5 Recycled Movie Scenes
In Disney Films.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.690
Robin Hood

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.219
Nobody throws a party like Robin and his Merry
Men, and a good party means plenty of dancing.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.789
Over the years, Disney's animators had delivered
more than a few musical sequences in a ton

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.170
of films, and decided to make Robin Hood into
something of a highlight reel.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.960
Maid Marian gets her moves from Snow White
over three decades earlier, with a few dashes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.250
of Duchess from The Aristocats just to be
safe.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.289
Lady Kluck and Little John do their best impression
of Baloo and King Louie from The Jungle Book,

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.980
showing that dance moves don't always change
with the times.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.980
The Jungle Book

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.270
It's no secret that animators tend to look
at their own pets when designing animals or

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.780
magical beasts, but man's best friend takes
the cake in Disney films.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.729
That means the animators knew they could use
puppies from 101 Dalmatians as the basis for

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.079
their wolf pups in The Jungle Book.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.790
But even more time was spent turning Arthur's
slobbering dogs from the Sword in the Stone

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.960
into Mowgli's grown-up brothers and sisters.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.670
Since dogs aren't exactly skilled at hiding
their feelings, we can probably let this one

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.960
slide.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.140
The Sword in The Stone

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.850
Some movies can take bits of animation here
or there, but where do you draw the line between

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.409
saving time, and just skipping work?

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.560
Disney couldn't always decide, if The Sword
in the Stone is anything to go by.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.189
When the movie's climax called for an epic
jousting match, the animators decided to check

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.119
the archives for footage to fit.

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.789
They found it in the Disney Classic "The Truth
About Mother Goose."

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.240
And by found it, we mean copied it completely,
shot for shot.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.829
The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.280
When Disney decided to lump together smaller
featurettes starring Winnie the Pooh into

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.490
one theatrical release, they ran into a bit
of a problem: the collection, released as

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.750
The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, didn't
have an ending.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.590
But with some fast-thinking, and even faster
hands, they came up with a solution.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.850
The answer was to craft a new ending starring
Winnie and his owner, Christopher Robin.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.830
The pair's farewell loses some of its magic
when you realize it's a direct tracing of

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.880
an entire sequence from The Jungle Book.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.300
Apparently, a love of bears wasn't all that
Mowgli and Christopher Robin had in common.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.300
Beauty &amp; The Beast

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.790
It was the evil witch Maleficent who made
sure that Sleeping Beauty's 16th birthday

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.780
wouldn't be a happy one, sending her (and
the entire kingdom with her) into a deep sleep.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.430
It all worked out in the end, when Prince
Phillip woke her with true love's kiss, and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.980
the pair announced their love with a dance
so perfect, it sent them into the clouds.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.760
There's no way to top a dance like that, so
when animators had to match it with Beauty

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.340
&amp; The Beast thirty years later, they didn't
even try.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.250
They simply traced Beauty and the now-human
Beast over the couple, and assumed fans wouldn't

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.070
mind seeing a true love's waltz all over again.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.310
Those are the bits of recycled Disney footage
that caught our eye, but what other scenes

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.090
or characters have always stuck out to you?
