00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:02.115
- [Lecturer] In this
video I want to talk about

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:04.285
the lives of Frankish women

00:00:04.285 --> 00:00:06.831
who lived during the Carolingian Dynasty

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:10.162
in the eighth and ninth century.

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:13.305
You can see here in blue
the Carolingian Dynasty

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:16.304
and the Carolingian Dynasty ruled over

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:17.970
much of the former territory

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.913
of the Western Roman Empire.

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:23.863
After the fall of the
Western Roman Empire,

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:26.969
Europe was controlled by
many decentralized kingdoms

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.186
including the Carolingian Dynasty.

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:32.326
And in this context,
powerful clans and families

00:00:32.326 --> 00:00:34.576
became increasingly important.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.856
This undoubtedly had effects
on the lives of women

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:41.015
who were often the heads
of these households

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:45.898
and who helped manage the
complex economy of these clans.

00:00:45.898 --> 00:00:48.529
I want to look at a primary source

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:50.037
that might give us some insight

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:52.683
into the lives of women at this time.

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.855
I want to read something
written by Dhuoda,

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.842
the Duchess consort of Septimania

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:59.599
and the Countess consort of Barcelona.

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:01.207
Dhuoda was a noble woman

00:01:01.207 --> 00:01:02.920
and in the excerpt we will read

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.087
she is addressing her son.

00:01:07.807 --> 00:01:12.112
She wrote a manual
called the Liber Manualis

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:16.537
which is meant to teach
her son certain values.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:18.727
Let's read it together and talk about it.

00:01:18.727 --> 00:01:21.460
The purpose of this
was to instruct her son

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.043
on proper behavior.

00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:27.115
I'm not reluctant to
teach you as well as I can

00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:28.380
how you should fear, love,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710
and be faithful in all ways to Bernard,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.176
your lord and father,

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:35.431
both when you are with him
and when you are apart.

00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.726
On this matter, you have a
teacher and the wisest authority,

00:01:38.726 --> 00:01:40.046
namely Solomon;

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:43.218
he chastens and advises
you, my son, saying,

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:46.650
"God has honored the father who
flourished in his children."

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.917
And again, he who honors his father

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:51.097
shall rejoice in his own children

00:01:51.097 --> 00:01:53.072
and shall live a longer life.

00:01:53.072 --> 00:01:56.286
He who obeys his father
will give heavenly solace

00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:58.944
to his mother and he who honors his father

00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:02.924
is like one who lays
up many good treasures.

00:02:02.924 --> 00:02:05.847
He who fears the lord honors his parents.

00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:08.325
You then, my son, honor your father

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:09.885
and pray diligently for him

00:02:09.885 --> 00:02:12.002
so that you may reach an advanced age

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:14.502
and live on earth a long time.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.551
If we look at this excerpt we can pull out

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:20.752
some information about the society

00:02:20.752 --> 00:02:22.585
in which Dhuoda lived.

00:02:23.432 --> 00:02:26.465
First of all, she's writing this

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:28.826
in order to instruct her son.

00:02:28.826 --> 00:02:30.561
And this is really representative

00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:33.501
of the way in which women at this time

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.913
were important as the heads of household

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:37.802
and important in educating their children,

00:02:37.802 --> 00:02:41.040
particularly, their
children's moral education.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.937
And as we see here, she talks a lot about

00:02:43.937 --> 00:02:45.831
certain Christian values.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.998
She says that his wisest
authority and his teacher

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:57.605
is Solomon who's a biblical figure.

00:02:57.605 --> 00:03:01.286
So, here she is referring
to Christian ideas

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:04.394
and she even notes that
God has honored the father

00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:06.522
who flourished in his children.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:09.036
And she uses these biblical references

00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:11.561
in order to advise her son

00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.398
to be a better son to his father.

00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:17.565
And she really emphasizes this respect

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:21.638
and love towards the father.

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:23.961
Now, why this emphasis?

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:27.108
Well, it makes sense that
she's emphasizing the father

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:28.572
because around this time

00:03:28.572 --> 00:03:30.608
patrilineage became more important

00:03:30.608 --> 00:03:32.773
and patrilineage is basically

00:03:32.773 --> 00:03:35.640
descent that goes to
the line of the father.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.077
And this might seem like something

00:03:37.077 --> 00:03:38.533
that's always been around

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.918
but this was a shift from this broader,

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:45.473
extended clan into a smaller family unit

00:03:45.473 --> 00:03:47.700
where there is a father
and a mother and children,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.434
rather than so many other family members.

00:03:50.434 --> 00:03:53.647
For Dhuoda to enforce this respect

00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:55.665
and deference towards the father

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:58.878
is perfectly in line with this value of

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:00.621
a smaller family unit.

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:02.563
And these families were very important

00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:05.070
especially these powerful families

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.332
because they were the
fundamental social unit

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.999
in Frankish society.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:15.255
To summarize some of the
insights that we can gain

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.148
by looking at this excerpt,

00:04:17.148 --> 00:04:19.321
mothers played key roles in households

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.867
particularly as the moral
educators of their children.

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:25.947
The ones who are
responsible for making sure

00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:29.087
their children understood the moral ideas

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:30.585
of their society.

00:04:30.585 --> 00:04:33.482
And secondly that
patrilineage really defines

00:04:33.482 --> 00:04:35.271
smaller family units and within that

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:37.087
fathers and mothers were important.

00:04:37.087 --> 00:04:39.915
But in this excerpt,
Dhuoda's really reinforcing

00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:43.555
the respect and deference
towards the father.

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:45.311
And through this excerpt we can also see

00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.617
the importance of Christian values

00:04:47.617 --> 00:04:49.955
which are really informing the advise

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.103
that she gives to her son.
