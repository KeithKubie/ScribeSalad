00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.400
In this session we're going to
talk about protocols.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.990
Protocols are like contracts
that objects, strucs, or

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.060
numerations can follow,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.940
and if something follows a protocol then
it abides by everything in the contract.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.210
Another way of saying it is a protocol
describes a conforms to relationship.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.810
Let's get started.
