00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.820
What if you or someone you loved was born
an inherited disorder and you were told it

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.230
could be cured by a relatively simple treatment
that included genetically correcting your

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.240
DNA?!

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.130
Would you do it?

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.030
Hey gene-ees, it’s Trace for DNews.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.929
With new gene editing technology emerging
from Carnegie Mellon and Yale Universities,

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.200
genetic engineering may be up in us sooner
than you think...

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.970
Researchers at Carnegie Mellon's Center for
Nucleic Acids Science and Technology (say

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.489
that 10 times fast!) have developed a way
to treat inherited blood disorders using synthetic

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.210
molecules called peptide nucleic acid molecules,
or PNA.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.989
PNA is a biomolecular structure created by
researchers that can mimic DNA as it is structured

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:45.989
similarly.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.100
Think of PNA as a blank document that scientists
add a genetic code to.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.809
PNA can be designed to bind to specific parts
of a gene sequence, which allows scientists

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.000
to fix a malfunctioning piece of DNA that
is the cause of a disease.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.470
In this particular case, they are fixing the
gene that is responsible for a blood disorder.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.820
So, in this new study, scientists coded the
PNA to target haematopoietic stem cells that

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.670
make other blood cells.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.980
They then injected it into a living organism.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.070
The PNA slipped into the cells, found the
site of the problem, and then bound itself

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.340
to the malfunctioning DNA to form a PNA-DNA-PNA
triplex chain, ‘mending’ it by correcting

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.430
the sequence.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.240
Right now, this technique is used to treat
inherited blood disorders.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.690
According to the World Health Organization,
nearly 5% of the world is born with inherited

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.320
hemoglobin disorder, like sickle cell anemia
and Beta thalassemia.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.180
Beta thalassemia disrupts the creation of
hemoglobin and causes extreme anemia, stunted

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.700
growth, and enlarged organs, among other ailments.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.950
Until now, there had been no real ‘cure’
for Beta Thalassemia, but this new gene editing

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.909
technique may be the answer.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.420
In mice, researchers have seen a 7% success
rate in curing Beta thalassemia.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.440
This may sound low, but other gene editing
treatments have only been .1% successful.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.410
Also, in a disorder like Beta thalassemia
a 100% cure is not necessary to regain improved

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.410
health.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.220
Even if the person isn’t cured, they may
be able to produce more hemoglobin to help

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.830
alleviate their condition.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.470
The FDA has approved this synthetic nucleotide
technology after testing it on mouse and human

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.470
bone marrow.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.160
The technique has advantages over the other
gene editing treatment you may have heard

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.700
of, CRISPR-Cas9, in two ways.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.550
First, CRISPR cannot simply be injected into
the body like this new PNA gene with the correcting

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.550
process.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.050
With CRISPR, cells have to be removed to receive
treatment in the lab and then they are injected

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.250
back into the body.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.470
Second, with CRISPR, once the cells are in
the body, there is a chance that the enzymes

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.550
will indiscriminately cut the DNA at the wrong
place, thus rendering the treatment useless

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.660
and it could be potentially harmful.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.000
This does not happen in this new treatment.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.280
The technology has excited scientists as it
can possibly lead to developments in curing

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.310
other genetically inherited blood disorders,
like sickle cell diseases that affect 100,000

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.310
Americans.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.570
And hopefully other diseases in the not-so-distant-future!

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.300
