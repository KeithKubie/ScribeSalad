00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.170
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.756
As promised, I'm Patrick Anderson.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.266
I review books for the Post and all
of us at the Post are very proud

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.386
to be part of this event and
very grateful to all of you

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for being here over the years.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.303
It's a pleasure to introduce our
next speaker, a prolific novelist

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.543
who is best known

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.660
for his prize-winning tales
of horror, Peter Straub.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.026
Mr. Straub was born in Milwaukee,
the son of a salesman and a nurse.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.913
He was struck by a car when
he was seven and hospitalized

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.170
for several months, an experience
that gave him an early understanding

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.843
of the random dangers and
perhaps the horrors of this world.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.150
His father wanted him
to become an athlete.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.156
His mother thought he should
be a doctor or minister.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.810
But he found out, he loved books and
decided to be a writer which he did.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.073
Mr. Straub has published
more than 20 novels.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.920
The fifth ghost story

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.230
in 1959 brought him national
and international fame.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.320
&gt;&gt; 1979--

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.906
&gt;&gt; 1979, I'm sorry.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000


00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
[ Laughter]

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.146
&gt;&gt; I wrote one in '59--
[laughs], in '79.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.280
His other novels include Koko,
Hellfire, Mr. X, his most recent,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.736
A Dark Matter, and two
collaborations with Stephen King,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.916
The Talisman, and The Black House.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.530
There were rumors of an upcoming
third collaboration with Mr. King,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.290
which perhaps, he will
tell us about.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.043
It's a pleasure to present
to you, Peter Straub.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.910
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.220
It's nice to see you all here.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.353
No matter whom you came to see,
it's great to see you [laughs].

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.020
Anyhow, it's a great group.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.336
I'm seeing all the very,
very terrific writers.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.170
It's a pleasure just to
look at Martha Grimes.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.630
The instructions we had were--

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.256
A, not to read and from
our work that is, no, yes?

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.923
We're kind of guided
in that direction.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.000
And we're told really
just to kind of speak

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.823
in an informal way about ourselves.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.093
So believe me that is actually what
I absolutely what I intend to do.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.006
But the bit my kind introducer
gave you is from my website,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.203
and I never intended that to
stand as a general introduction

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.176
of my life [laughs]
though it is very accurate.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.570
My father did expect me for as long
as possible, he held to the belief

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.313
that it was possible
for me to be an athlete.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.846
He looked at me and he saw a
Green Bay Packer, [laughs].

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.386
You know, he-always did have a
very rich fantasy life, my father.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.820
My-mother knew that I had
zero interest in football.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.790
All she wanted desperately was

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.026
that I would somehow turn
out to be a good person.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.600
There are so many little clues

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.810
as though maybe I might
not be absolutely good

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.890
but when I married this
wonderful woman I am married to

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.510
and I settled then I actually had
a kind of a career for myself.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.670
She was really relieved.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.403
And actually, you know,
I'd gone on through schools

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.006
in the nicest most
regular possible fashion.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.600
But there was always this
question, when I was a kid

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.200
of what I'll be good for or good at.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.276
I always did really well in school

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.673
and I always really,
really loved reading.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.236
And my parents got
really behind that.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.703
My parents read to me
immensely when I was a child.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.516
I remember being on their laps and
then pointing at the comic strips

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.823
in the newspaper, the Sunday
comics and going through those.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.103
Reading books to me out loud.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.833
And that must have fit into
the real hunger that I had

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.056
to read as a small child.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.060
I remember the immense frustration--

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.233
what I did experience as
the immense frustration

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.833
of not being able to read.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.703
I remember pointing at street signs
and saying, "What does that say,"

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.363
and they would say, the word is
A-U-E-R, and they would say, Auer,

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.990
and I would say, "hour" like
you know, an hour on a clock.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.350
You know like our house?

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.416
It didn't make any sense.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.106
I did the same with billboards.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.493
So what does that say, you know.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.320
And very kindly and as
sweetly as possible,

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.860
they always read these
things to me to a point

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.883
where they read the same comic
books to me over and over,

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.033
so that I had them memorized.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:07.416
And then, I pretended to
read these comic books

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.630
to other children, to my friends.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.963
And one day, the most
miraculous thing happened to me.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.070
I was about five years old.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.870
I was looking along,
pretending to read,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.536
and I realized that I was reading.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.093
That I was reading the words,
I was speaking the words

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.846
that were right in front of me.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.573
And by that time, I saw them so
often that I could recognize them.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.720
So, there I was, you know, launched.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.273
I want it very much.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:35.073
I couldn't wait to go to school.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.506
Because I thought, surely in school,
it's where they just give you book

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.346
after book after book
and you read better

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.600
and better books as you go along.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.546
And then you read more and
more interesting stuff.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.320
So I went along and I
went to kindergarten.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.713
And I was really bummed
because in kindergarten,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.596
what they mainly had us do
is take construction paper

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.936
and little baby scissors and
cut out things like elephants.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.270
Then, I remember going home and
telling my mother, I just hated it.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.830
There wasn't any point, you know.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.896
I never have to cut out
elephants in my real life.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.613
I didn't like doing it.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.896
I want to read books
so I read them at home.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.166
When I got to first grade,
and I thought, okay now this.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.480
At last, we're going to
have some relief here.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.486
We're going to get
real books and we did.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.860
But the books we got
were Dick and Jane.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.586
Anybody here remember?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.096
Great books weren't they?

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.630
Thrilling plots, amazing
style but it killed me--

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.633
I mean, I think I've fairly spent
a lot of time being really angry

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.603
as a kid but it was
because of stuff like this--

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.146
I looked at Dick and Jane which
we were told to read in school

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.446
and I opened it up it said--

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.423
&gt;&gt; Run, Dick run.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.290
&gt;&gt; Exactly!

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.556
Yes! Run, Dick run.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.290
And then, there's see Spot run

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.756
and the next page was the
page that really killed me.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.890
There's a picture of Spot, the dog
running and it said, See, see, see.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.690
And I thought, nobody
ever said that.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.860
That's the dumbest, most insulting
thing I've ever seen in my life.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.326
And fortunately I discovered the
school library, and then I was off.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.276
In every school I went to I
ripped through their library

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.106
like it was the gateway to
heaven, which of course, it was.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.696
There's a description that
Charles Dickens wrote of himself

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.090
in middle life, about his childhood.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.433
And remember, Dickens
had a very unhappy--

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:38.966
I mean because he was
Charles Dickens,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.633
it was a very unhappy childhood.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.966
For someone else, it might
have been a very ordinary,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.366
almost satisfying childhood.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.900
His father did go to
debtors' prison.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:48.900
But when you go to
a debtors' prison,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.833
the whole family moved in with you.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:52.700
You know, they ordered meals out.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:54.543
A lot of conversation,
there wasn't any work to do.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.163
You just languish there until
somebody manages to get enough money

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.550
so you pay your debts
and then you got out.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.483
But what killed Dickens was
that, because he knew himself

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.013
to be something other than
the perfectly ordinary product

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.173
of Victorian London.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.483
What killed him was he had to leave
school or wasn't allowed to go there

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:16.833
and was put to work in a
blacking factory where they made

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.160
like shoe polish, Warren's Blacking.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.016
It really hurt him and it really
made him, but in mid life,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.446
he was talking about this era in
his life and he spoke of himself

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.013
of getting home from the blacking
factory and reading as if for life,

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.586
reading to save his life.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.253
I think, when I read that,
I felt this recognition,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:49.320
not that I'm comparing myself with
Dickens, but I certainly recognized

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.690
that impulse and that mood
and that kind of rapture.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.590
There is no doubt that I read
and learned about the world.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.586
I read to learn about what
adults were actually up to

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.423
but I also read to escape.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.430
So, I could go somewhere else,
somewhere where I would be led along

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.890
through a series of episodes
and the scenes and the ballrooms

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.806
and dining rooms and living rooms,
and on ships and through jungles,

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.276
you know, all that sort of things.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.303
It was still not clear.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.036
It's clear I was very good at that

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.000
and I was also good at
talking about books.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.940
But what was that good for.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.540
It seemed, really that my only hope
for a successful adult life was

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.086
to go to graduate school and
become an English professor

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:49.773
which didn't sound so bad to me.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.346
And when I got to college, I
noticed, I liked English professors.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.373
And I thought they were cool.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.806
They were different
from the science people.

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.786
They are different from
the business people.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.363
I guess it just occurred to
me what I really liked was

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.750
that it was evident that
they had inner lives.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:14.313
That inside themselves, they were--

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.046
inside those people are different
worlds, very well inhabited,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.380
well upholstered and interesting.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520
I loved that.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.440
So, I did-- I majored in English.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.176
I went to graduate
school at Columbia.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.010
I got an MA.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.610
Then I ran out of money.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.510
I wanted to get married.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.710
So, I married, thank
God, the right person.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.083
And I taught at my old
boy's school for three years

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.990
until we made enough money.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.990
Then we made our big break.

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:54.656
And we moved from Milwaukee
to Ireland

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:56.656
where I was a graduate
student at UCD,

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.856
University College
Dublin, a great place.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.323
Ireland itself is a great place.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.856
Dublin was a great place.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.190
This was 1969.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:09.190
The minute we got off
our crappy student boat,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:14.270
which was called the MS Aurelia,
the only ship of the Cogedar line.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.640
If you ever signed up
for an ocean crossing

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.040
and you see the boat
belongs to the Cogedar line,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.486
I advise you to go look elsewhere.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.043
It was dandy if you're
20, but otherwise not.

00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.570
Anyhow, we fell into a world that
was-- that didn't exist in Milwaukee

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.316
or if it did it was
not accessible to us.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:40.866
It would've been, it
would certainly--

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.166
it would have existed in New York,

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:45.766
but it would not have
been accessible to us.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.633
It was a world composed of
painters and poets and writers

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.606
of elite kinds, of
sculptors, this intense hive

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:56.313
of people all working very, very
[inaudible] way at making art.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:00.226
And so, we're the most
natural thing in the world.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.400
One problem with my childhood
was that, it was implicit in it

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.353
that if you called yourself an
artist, you were by virtue of that,

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.776
insanely self-deluded and
self-important and ridiculous,

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.323
you know, "He calls
himself an artist."

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.126
You know, my father
thought that was just

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.726
like the worst thing you could do.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.543
Anyhow, here we were with
these people who were just--

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.240
who were rooted in
their own talents.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.730
This was extraordinary
helpful to me.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.153
I was publishing.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.686
I was writing a lot of poetry
with which I was obsessed.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.350
And I published a good
deal of poetry in Ireland.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.640
And I worked away with my
thesis, but it wasn't that good,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.260
my thesis, my dissertation.

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:58.543
And when I brought 200 pages of it,
my thesis-- my dissertation adviser,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:00.740
a wonderful scholar
and a brilliant man,

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.243
named Denis Donoghue,
who's still with us.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:05.170
Denis Donoghue took
about three weeks

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:06.816
and he called me in his office.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.390
And he said, "Mr. Straub, this work
has no connection with the subject

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:18.636
that you said you were
going to write about.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.363
And also, I must say, although
it's very well written,

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.846
it's written like a book.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.550
It's not written like
a dissertation.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.210
This won't do.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.436
You have to go back and,"
and oh boy that's it.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.583
Now, fortunately, this
was a-- I mean--

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.526
I must have been really arrogant to
think I can convince Denis Donoghue

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.210
that my 200 pages about
Anthony Trollope were really

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.320
about D.H. Lawrence which
was what I told him I read

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.380
about but I couldn't fool him.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.320
So what I did was I took
out from my desk a novel

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.136
that I've written in
the previous summer.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.876
I'd written this novel because,
although, I was deeply interested

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.543
in poetry, I also-- I always had

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.776
and you would understand I could not
really mention this to my parents,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:13.886
because they would have
taken this as a sign

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.686
of self delusion and
self aggrandizement.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.086
I have always really secretly
thought of myself as a novelist.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.406
And it seemed to me that
novels represented a sort

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.010
of territory that I half understood.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.993
They represented a kind of
version of home territory for me.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:35.330
I could not have expressed
this to my parents.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:36.730
I could barely express it to anybody

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.063
because I didn't exactly
know what I meant

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.386
but that is very much what I felt.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.386
So, one summer, instead of writing

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:49.463
yet more doomed words
about Anthony Trollope.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:55.310
I wrote a novel according to
Graham Greene Principle that I read

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.416
about in the End of the Affair.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.006
The narrator at the
End of the Affair,

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.610
is a novelist named Maurice Bendrix.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.323
Maurice Bendrix says
writing a novel is easy.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:13.270
You just write 500 words
a day, drip, drip, drip.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.643
And at the end of the
year, you have a novel.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:17.960
I thought, well, I'm going learn.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.226
I'm going to take Graham
Greene's word and I went off

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.613
to the same place where I did
my doomed work on Trollope,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.926
the National Library of Dublin.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.963
And I brought along
bound notebooks that is--

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.453
account books as it were
with lined numbered pages.

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.716
And I wrote until I figured
I had about 500 words.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:44.846
And then I counted them to make
sure I had at least 500 words.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.540
If I had 550, I'd say,
that was a good day.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.820
If I was having a really good day I
may write 600 but then, I thought,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:55.986
no I don't get to count that
extra 100 for tomorrow's work.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.613
It doesn't take very
long to write 500 words.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.933
Anyhow, I did this and I got to the
end of the novel in like six months.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.190
And I didn't know what
to do with it.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.420
So, I typed it up.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.683
And I sorted it away thinking
there might be something

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:16.423
in there and there might not be.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.913
When Denis Donoghue lowered the boom
on me, I asked a friend of mine.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.333
I asked a person I know,
he wasn't even a friend

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.933
if I could send the
book to his publisher.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.440
The publisher I like because they
published John Updike, the novelist,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.893
with whom I was at that
time, more or less in love.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.100
And so, I mailed it off.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.423
And they took it.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.556
Thereby, saving my life, resolving
my doubts about my own future.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.833
The funny thing about this book
was it was called Marriages.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.803
Over there at the signing sections,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.330
I must have signed six
copies of this book.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:58.373
It was published in
1973 in an edition,

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.706
in the American edition
of maybe 2000.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.716
At least half of those
went to libraries.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.416
The other half should
have disappeared

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:10.923
but some people, some
people have them.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.776
Some people read them.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:15.843
One person even told
me, they liked it.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.643
This was a novel which I
was following with my nose

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.676
but went to the deepest fog.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.476
I had no idea how really to
do what I most wanted to do.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.093
So this was my system, apart
from the 500 words a day.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.493
I thought because I loved the
work of the poet John Ashbery,

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.416
I thought I could write a novel

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.793
that would be the equivalent
of an Ashbery poem.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:46.833
I thought narrative was old
fashioned and old hat and obsolete.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.686
I wanted to write a book of
glittering fragments all lined up.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:59.550
That would make its effects through
a sort of associational poetry.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.643
I wasn't that good, but what
I did was, I wrote a kind

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.943
of conventional imitation
of Fitzgerald, let's say.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:15.576
A very good model, if you want to
steal from somebody or you want

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.953
to imitate somebody, you can't
do better than that style.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.350


00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.953
It had one exciting part, in
which a guy seated at a cafe table

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.946
in the South of France, sees
a man from his hometown,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.116
walking down the main street of
this little town, [inaudible].

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:39.716
And he's riveted because he
knows-- actually that man is dead.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.813
That man was a neighbor of his,
but who was killed in prison

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.113
after having shot another
man in their hometown.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.046
So he says to his girlfriend,
I'm sorry, I--

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:52.203
this is very interesting but I have
to-- I have to follow that guide.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.070
The most interesting part of that
book, it had to do with the narrator

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.030
of the novel Marriages, following
this man, he knows to be dead,

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.630
down a long, long, long spooky
road into the amphitheater alley.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.163
Then into the amphitheater
and into a little blind alley,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.736
into a little room carved out
from a stone on the inside

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.346
of the amphitheater where he
doesn't see the man at all.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.346
It's just a piece of paper with
some enigmatic words on it.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.213
Now, I should have known from that,
that my directions in life where,

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.916
would be more narrative than I
wanted to be, more about story,

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.973
about mystery, about
matters like that.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.280
And before long, they were.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:39.970
I see-- I have less than
10 minutes now to go,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.950
and if you want any questions,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.373
we have about five--
four or five minutes.

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.990
If you have any questions,
I'm here to answer.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.430


00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:54.616
If you don't, you don't--
[laughs], but I'll give you time.

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:58.510
[ Silence ]

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.296
&gt;&gt; Could you talk about your future
collaboration with Stephen King?

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:11.570
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.783
If I had more time, I would have
spoken endlessly about Stephen King.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.223
He was a fascinating brilliant guy.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.526
Back when we were both largely
unknown, and had published just

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:33.276
like two books, Stephen King was
sent my first supernatural book,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:38.903
a ghost story called-- a sort

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:41.836
of Henry James type of
a story called Julia.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.676
And he wrote a wonderful
blurb for it.

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.740
Different from all the other
blurbs in that he saw--

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.660
he actually understood
what I was about.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:51.706
A year and a half later,
I published another book,

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:53.453
he wrote a two-page
letter to my publisher

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.916
that showed absolutely he
understood what I was talking about.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.696
So, I went into a bookstore
in London.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.443
I bought a book by him.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.643
It was called Salem's Lot.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.460
When it was first being published,
I had no idea what it was about.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.960
And it-- it blew me off my chair.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.380
It was so good.

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:14.446
So, I wrote him.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:15.723
He wrote me, we lived
London at that time.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.636
The King's moved to England.

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:20.836
We got together.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.703
Well Stephen likes-- even I--
we liked each other very much.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:23.950
The only problem would be this
thing, with Stephen King is

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:27.880
that he talks too much and he
talks so fast and he says so much.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.833
And he has so much energy.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.300
It was a little tiring sometimes.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.053
Anyhow, but a week after week,
we've gotten to know each other.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.013
He said to me, look
we could have some fun

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.896
if we write a book together.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.030
Let's do that.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.030
I said, sure!

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:48.030
Let's do it.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.296
I agree. And we looked at
our schedules and we saw

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:53.163
that we couldn't begin to work
for another four years [laughs].

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.230
It was because he owed
four books and I owed two.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.576
This is the difference
in our methods.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:01.120
But anyhow, four years
later, we got together.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.840
We'd-- by that time already worked
out quite a program for our book

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.750
and we launched them together
and we finished it together,

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.120
a very rare experience
for any novelist.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.393
You know, to work side
by side with another one.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.580
Especially another one who is loved.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.380
It was a great, great experience.

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.076
And we continued to be friends.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:25.280
Yes.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.480
&gt;&gt; 'm actually a very dedicated
horror and mystery novel reader.

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.956
Sorry-- the thing is-- I want
to-- I want to know-- oh great--

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:43.370
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:46.286
&gt;&gt; I want a suggestion of what
to read next, because I learned

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.720
about you through Stephen
King and Peter Straub--

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.010
You know what.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.010
There's a--

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:57.076
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.210
&gt;&gt; There's a very good
writer named John Langdon,

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.810
who wrote a knockout novel.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.046
It's like a really, really brilliant
literary horror novel called House

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.640
of Windows.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.106
&gt;&gt; Actually, I mean
one of your solo--

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.173
&gt;&gt; Oh, one of my books?

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah/

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.240
&gt;&gt; I would read Mystery.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.706
It's not a horror story at all,
but it's got all the feelings.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.373
It's a very complex novel.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:27.660
It's a novel about a very complex
crime that touches the characters

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:29.710
of the people who are
involved in it.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.576
And it's an odd book but I'm very,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:34.590
very pleased that I thought I think
I did something different and kind

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.796
of new there and I
recommend it very highly.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.180
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.580
I'll try and find it.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.496
&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks.

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:49.430
&gt;&gt; Hi Peter!

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.563
Long time no see.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.163
You didn't talk about your
love affair with jazz however.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.990
&gt;&gt; No I just-- do we have
another hour or another week?

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.603
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about the
genesis of your ideas?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.120
I mean, how do you--
how are these born?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.300
&gt;&gt; Mostly, to the extent
that I have ideas.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.910
They begin with a kind of a
lousy little idea that could come

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:18.510
from like a stock pot of any novels.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.403
Oh, somebody is missing and his
parents have to go find him.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.423
That's the-- - I wrote a novel,
the third it was called Koko

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.910
and it's one of my best books.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:35.176
What happens is a long process of
stewing and evolution in which,

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.283
but-- when I think about it for
a long time, I eventually think

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.616
about all the characters for a good
time and I set off on a little road

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:50.843
that goes somewhere I suppose I
know of, but in fact that I don't.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:57.423
Almost always, the little road takes
me elsewhere and the story changes.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.180
Whatever is underneath
the story finally comes

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.660
up at a certain point
in almost every book.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.680
After I've been working for
about a year, I say to myself,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.026
"That's why I wanted
to write this book."

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.670
You know, I recognize some--
something that has been on my mind,

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.750
some-- some deep inner matter.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:16.356
That's one of my two or
three themes, you know,

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.663
like I keep returning to
that always surprise me anew.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.620
It's a real evolutionary process.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880


00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.153
&gt;&gt; Hi! You are who
I came to see today.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.343
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you!

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:34.390
&gt;&gt; I've been a fan of
yours for years [applause].

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.563
The Talisman, one of my
favorite books of all time.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.240
I've probably read
it 20 or 30 times.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.840
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow, fabulous.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.243
&gt;&gt; I've read it and I try to
figure out what part you wrote,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.770
what part did Stephen King wrote.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.463
And I can't figure it out.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.570
How do you-- how do
you write like that?

00:25:57.570 --> 00:25:58.660
&gt;&gt; That-that is very-- there
are some people who can do that.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:00.813
The only one I know who is
really infallible is Neil Gaiman.

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:04.310
Neil Gaiman once startled
me by proving that he knew

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.116
who wrote what in our books.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.690
But Stephen and I in Talisman
especially did a dirty trick

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:12.610
on everybody.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:14.833
At a certain-- certain points,
we imitated each other's styles.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.386
&gt;&gt; Oh it' not fair [laughs].

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.120
&gt;&gt; And that made it fun.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.540
&gt;&gt; Also, Steve put on jazz allusions
so to make people think I wrote them

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:25.513
and so, then I wrote in
allusions that kind of rock

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.086
and roll I knew he likes.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.456
Because we didn't want people
to know who wrote what.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:33.466
We didn't want people
to divide the book up.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.233
The only really funny thing that
ever happened was [laughs] one

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:45.016
of those like reviewer sites long
before Amazon wrote that they knew

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.210
which part I wrote because the
parts I wrote sucked [laughs].

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.243
So he said, so every time I
came to the part that sucked,

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:57.796
I know that Peter wrote
that [laughs].

00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.770
&gt;&gt; None of that book sucked
it was my favorite book.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.623
Thank you very much.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.026
&gt;&gt; That's about it.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.093
Thank you very much.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.776

of the Library of Congress.
