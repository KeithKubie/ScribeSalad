00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.168
- [Announcer] This UC SD
TV program is presented by

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:06.499
University of California Television.

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:07.799

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:14.387
To keep up with the latest programs.

00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:21.531
(upbeat piano)

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.809
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.142
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.129
long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.370
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.699
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.782
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.490
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.948
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:53.031
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.628
We shape the future

00:00:55.628 --> 00:00:59.890
from our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.608
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:07.775
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:11.439
An exploration made possible

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.522
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:34.318
(ethereal piano music)

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.206
- Good afternoon, this is a great turnout.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:14.454
On behalf of UC San
Diego, it's my privilege

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.867
to welcome you to Symposia.

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:20.037
This really represents what's
best about universities.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:22.907
To go beyond boundaries,
to think outside the box,

00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:27.316
and to try develop novel
ways to improve human health.

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:29.856
This also represents a
collaboration between UC San Diego

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:31.998
and Arizona State University.

00:02:31.998 --> 00:02:35.577
Which speaks even more
highly about our directors.

00:02:35.577 --> 00:02:38.308
Because it's so difficult
to work across campuses.

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:40.340
But I think this project is so exciting

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.479
and has gotten such enthusiasm,

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.860
that I think the two
directors and all of you

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.860
deserve my appreciation.

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.259
And hopefully what will come out of this

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.640
is a completely novel way
of thinking about diseases.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.109
There's been so many advances in diseases,

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.968
but so many diseases are
still largely unsolved.

00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:01.490
And by taking an anthropological approach,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.689
hopefully entirely new ideas,

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:06.590
understanding disease pathogens,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.646
maybe even new drugs
will come out of this.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.048
So I have a little time,
I'm going to sit with you

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:13.469
and learn something which
is unusual for a dean,

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.900
so hopefully I'm still educatable.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.957
I look very forward and
congratulations to all of you.

00:03:16.957 --> 00:03:18.200
Thank you so much.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.450
(ethereal piano music)

00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:30.480
- Good afternoon and welcome
to this 25th CARTA Symposium.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.798
We're very glad to see you all here.

00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:33.238
My name is Pascal Gagneux.

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:35.409
I'm the associate director of CARTA.

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.660
Among the oldest questions

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.819
that we humans have asked ourselves.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.402
Figure, who are we?

00:03:41.498 --> 00:03:43.586
What are we doing here?

00:03:43.586 --> 00:03:45.646
Where did we come from?

00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:48.058
How did we get here?

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:50.318
And where are we going?

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:53.198
Two of these questions can be addressed

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.079
in a scientific fashion,

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.630
and form the core of Anthropogeny.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.459
Where did we come from
and how did we get here?

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.709
The study of human origins.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:08.329
CARTA is a UCSD/Salk Center
for Academic Research

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.818
and Training in Anthropogeny.

00:04:10.818 --> 00:04:14.029
The Co-Directors are
Ajit Varki, Fred Gage,

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.398
and Margret Schoeninger.

00:04:15.398 --> 00:04:18.328
Our Management Services
Officer is Linda Nelson.

00:04:18.328 --> 00:04:20.676
Our Community Relations Director

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:23.549
is Ingrid Benirschke-Perkins.

00:04:23.549 --> 00:04:25.717
We have very much needed help

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:28.278
from Computer Systems
Programmer, Kate Kaya.

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:30.980
And Program Coordinator, Jesse Robie.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.346
Anthropogeny is at the intersections

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:36.608
of the humanities and
the natural sciences.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.179
And we believe that the
only way to address these

00:04:39.179 --> 00:04:42.468
two important questions
is to draw on evidence

00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:44.810
from all these very different fields,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.309
which is only possible with a dialogue,

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.476
ideally learned early in one's career.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.370
Mission Statement is the following.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.571
We want to use all rational
and ethical approaches

00:04:56.571 --> 00:05:00.989
to seek all verifiable facts
from all relevant disciplines,

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:05.499
to explore and explain the
origins of the human phenomenon.

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:08.201
And we want to do so
while minimizing complex

00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:11.089
organizational structures and hierarchies,

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:14.781
and avoiding unnecessary
paperwork and bureaucracy.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.089
In the process, very importantly,

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.391
we also want to raise
awareness and understanding

00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.499
of the study of human origins
within the academic community

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:24.980
and the public at large.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.729
This is the first
co-sponsored symposium between

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.369
CARTA and the Arizona State University

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:32.951
Center for Evolutionary Medicine.

00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.421
You will hear from its
director in a few moments,

00:05:35.421 --> 00:05:37.061
Dr. Randall Finesse.

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:40.439
But we before we start, we
need to express special thanks

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.850
to our major sponsor,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.288
The G. Harold and Leila Y.
Mathers Charitable Foundation

00:05:45.288 --> 00:05:50.140
of New York, and Howard
Chester the Executive Director.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.807
We also need to thank many
people who have contributed

00:05:52.807 --> 00:05:56.640
to the fund in memory
of late James Handelman.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:02.260
And many other people who have helped us.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.849
For example, closed
captioning the Symposium at

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.180
a webcast live and then
put on YouTube and iTunes

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.400
for people to see.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.159
We have other key supporters
like Annette Merle-Smith,

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:19.326
that help support the Anthropogeny
Graduate Specialization.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.131
And many individual
supporters who over the years

00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:27.048
have contributed to our enterprise.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.880
And lastly this would
not be possible without

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.908
very able support from the UCSD-TV crew,

00:06:38.908 --> 00:06:43.075
Voice &amp; Video team, and the
Mandeville Center support team.

00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.718
And as I mentioned, George
Svoboda who was kind enough to

00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:50.385
come and play the guitar for us.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.580
(audience applause)

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.919
