00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.220
 I think I have a solution. 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.660
 On an unknown issue 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.800
 This is a question that no one will look for answers. 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.220
 But I think I found one 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.460
 There is a thing called 10958 problem 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.360
 In order to express this question, I decided to start with a little math trick. 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.160
 Some digital techniques 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.280
 Just like those great digital tricks, you have to start by picking a number. 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.080
 Can you give me a three-digit number first? What do you like to pick, pick one? 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.640
 [Brady: "814."] 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.480
 814, interesting, no problem. 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.280
 Then can you give me a single number? Which number do you like? 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 He can be one of these three digits, or it can be brand new, any number you like. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.960
 [Brady: "2."] 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 2, no problem. This is what I am going to do next. 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.320
 So, I can tell you 814 equals 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 22 times (2 plus 2 plus 2) to the 2nd power plus 22 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.660
 If you don't believe it, we can test it again. 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.840
 2 plus 2 plus 2 is 6. I think this is known as this 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.660
 Then the square of 6 is 36 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.880
 So we need 22 by 36 plus 22 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.520
 22 times 36 equals 792 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.900
 Add 22 equals 814, end! 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.200
 You give me a three-digit number, then I can write his formula and just use the one you gave me. 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.780
 Do you want to do it again? 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.820
 [Brady: "Good"] 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.560
 no problem! What three digits do you want this time? 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.680
 [Brady: "998."] 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 998! You gave me a big, but not so big number. 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.780
 What is the number of the one you plan to use? 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 We used 2 last time. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.860
 [Brady: "1."] 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.240
 1, oh my god, you are really -- now, obvious 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.100
 I can cheat and write directly, equal to 1+1+1+1... 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100
 That's right, and I can finish this formula there. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.440
 Because you have chosen an even number, 2, so I can also write 2+2 last time... 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.040
 But the goal of this trick is to write it in the shortest formula. 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.520
 So I can write 998 equals 11 minus 1, which is 10 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.680
 Plus 1+1+1 power, 呃

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.000
 Hey, I wrote two plus signs, then when he is a big plus, Oh, that’s a pretty plus. 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.920
 Then, that is 10 to the 3rd power, 1000 minus 1 minus 1, then I did it! 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 We succeeded in making 998 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.920
 I can do it all day. 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 In fact, I will 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.820
 But everyone will close the film soon. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.620
 I can tell you why I can easily calculate the three digits you gave me with any number you gave. 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.880
 Because I have a stack of paper underneath 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.900
 Have all the combinations in it 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.940
 So this is a one-digit representation of natural numbers 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.460
 One person is called Taneja 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.560
 I must have missed it. He is a Brazilian 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.480
 So I definitely missed his name. 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.320
 This is a lot of three-digit forms and how to write them out using formulas. 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.680
 So this is all three digit numbers and 4 is used to write the formula 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.960
 Then look here, use 6 or 5, any number you want to check 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.280
 So the reason I can write these is because I am cheating 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.600
 If you want to cheat, this is very straightforward. 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.440
 You need 1 or 2 months to remember these 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.580
 Then you can cheat in your head! 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.580
 This is a wonderful thing to do, you know, the human brain 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.420
 You can remember your cheats and cheat, and you can watch cheat sheets at any time without anyone knowing. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.500
 This is a loophole in life. 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.380
 You can cheat by memory 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.340
 [Brady: "This is called learning."] 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.360
 Also known as...learning, you can learn from himTM, then you do it, yes. 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.880
 [Brady: "So do we know that these are the shortest words? I mean, how does he use some rigorous way to prove that those are the shortest ways?"] 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.400
 This is a great question 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.620
 I don't make 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080
 He said that these are the shortest 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.640
 I forgot if he said that these are the "real" shortest 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.180
 Or the shortest one he found 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500
 He only said that there must be the shortest formula 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.480
 I don't know how he confirmed these 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.280
 So if you believe this guy 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.200
 These are the shortest, but they may, I mean... 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.560
 I believe in him 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.680
 Does he stop here? 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.160
 Oh, no 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.320
 No, no, no, he took another step forward. 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.140
 So let's continue to look at other tricks. 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.660
 Try any number below 11111 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.460
 [Brady: "7415."] 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.220
 7415, no problem. So I can tell you that this number can be written as 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.820
 This is another book, this one is a bit thicker. 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.480
 So, this book is probably more than 160 pages, and then I have to use it directly this time. 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.420
 Let us look for it 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.480
 [Brady: "Do you remember this one?"] 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.480
 I don't have time to remember this one, you know 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.320
 You know, if I can take a vacation on the beach, I can sit there and remember this one too. 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900
 Hey, you picked a great number! 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900
 This requires subtraction 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.140
 Not all numbers will be subtracted 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.740
 [Brady: "You didn't ask me the number this time, my one is a number"] 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.500
 You don't need to choose a single digit this time, because we have to use all the digits this time. 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.040
 So you say 7415, 7415 can be 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.980
 Negative 1 plus 2 by 3456 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.420
 Add 7 times 8 times 9 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.080
 or 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.040
 He equals 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.800
 Brackets 9 brackets 8 times 7 plus 6 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.120
 Multiply by 5 brackets by 43, last bracket 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 Multiply 2 plus 1 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:38.760
 Ok, so this is your number written in ascending order 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.760
 That is, 1 to 9 are in order 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.080
 Or can also be written in descending order, that is, from 9 to 1 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.820
 Use only multiplication, addition, division, and subtraction 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.820
 There is a power 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.340
 So, using only simple calculations, this guy also found 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.760
 All numbers less than 11111, only simple arithmetic symbols, ascending and descending ordering methods 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.160
 [Brady: "This guy is legendary!"] 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.300
 This guy is very legendary. I like this guy. 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.260
 And he just did it. Also placed directly on the network. You can find his files directly. 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.820
 That's right, if it's me, I will post it. But I will give a free version 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.520
 You can only get the ascending version but you have to pay to get the descending order. 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.340
 This is a paid version 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.160
 That's right, or you can't get the middle part 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.480
 Now, you may have discovered the name of this film. 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.380
 This has a problem 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.440
 Also known as the 10958 problem 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.240
 If you query, let us look at 10958 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.080
 So this should be at the bottom of the right 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.780
 So he is here. This is 10958 written in descending order 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.700
 But if we look at his ascending order, 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.100
 He has not been discovered yet. 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.780
 [Brady: [pour a breath]] 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.540
 This is the only gap where all numbers are less than 11111 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.400
 This is the first difference that you see. When you look at it, everything starts from 1 and until the end, the calculations are there. 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.260
 Then you stop in one place: not found yet 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.260
 [Brady: "So this is like Achilles' ankle"] 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.840
 That's right, Achilles's ankle. This is the last piece of the puzzle, right? 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.480
 It’s like, you know, this is a little bit, you are like, I have done it all once. 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.420
 Except that little bit 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:21.040
 Just like before, I don't know how detailed he is on making this form. 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:27.280
 So he thinks this can't be done. But he did not completely rule out that others would not finish him. 

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.520
 and so 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.080
 I am not a person who will give up, give up something like this. 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.880
 Try at least once, right? 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.880
 This is the spirit. This is my philosophy 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.440
 This may be an impossible goal, but you let go and then you feel the fun, no matter what. 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.900
 [Brady: "Like your previous movie 'The Parker Square Philosophy'?"] 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.860
 Yes, he is, you may struggle for a difficult goal. 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.440
 But you let go, even if you may not succeed 

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.220
 I don't want to make you too excited. 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.300
 This is not a perfect answer 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.300
 However, I think he is. He is the perfect answer. 

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.140
 But others may argue with me. 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.020
 [Smooth Keyboard Music] Why not try it yourself? Create 10958 using 1 to 9 ascending order or see Matt's clever solution (on the screen or in the description link) 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:22.540
 One divided by the other, we get pi. Pi is rarely counted in this way because he is very inaccurate
