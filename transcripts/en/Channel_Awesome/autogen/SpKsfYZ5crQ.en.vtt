00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 align:start position:0%
like oh yeah okay cuz you just sort of
 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.990 align:start position:0%
like oh yeah okay cuz you just sort of

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
assume like she's tall and fits short or
 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.309 align:start position:0%
assume like she's tall and fits short or
something<00:05:51.029><c> but</c><00:05:51.389><c> it's</c><00:05:51.569><c> like</c><00:05:51.750><c> no</c><00:05:51.930><c> like</c><00:05:52.139><c> she</c>

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
something but it's like no like she
 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.059 align:start position:0%
something but it's like no like she
actually<00:05:52.469><c> is</c><00:05:52.830><c> older</c><00:05:54.560><c> and</c><00:05:55.560><c> that</c><00:05:55.710><c> would</c><00:05:55.889><c> be</c><00:05:56.039><c> a</c>

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 align:start position:0%
actually is older and that would be a
 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.070 align:start position:0%
actually is older and that would be a
little<00:05:56.219><c> weird</c><00:05:56.460><c> yeah</c><00:05:56.699><c> just</c><00:05:57.000><c> like</c><00:05:57.180><c> it's</c><00:05:57.479><c> that</c>

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
little weird yeah just like it's that
 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.059 align:start position:0%
little weird yeah just like it's that
doesn't<00:05:58.229><c> be</c><00:05:58.529><c> different</c><00:05:58.919><c> age</c><00:05:59.069><c> wise</c><00:05:59.310><c> age</c><00:05:59.550><c> at</c><00:06:00.180><c> 13</c>

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 align:start position:0%
doesn't be different age wise age at 13
 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't be different age wise age at 13
which<00:06:02.069><c> is</c><00:06:02.219><c> why</c><00:06:02.400><c> I</c><00:06:02.430><c> think</c><00:06:02.819><c> you</c><00:06:03.509><c> know</c><00:06:04.110><c> a</c><00:06:04.379><c> million</c>

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 align:start position:0%
which is why I think you know a million
 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.269 align:start position:0%
which is why I think you know a million
and<00:06:05.610><c> thirteen</c><00:06:06.089><c> marcelina</c><00:06:06.870><c> Finn</c><00:06:07.319><c> would</c><00:06:07.949><c> just</c>

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
and thirteen marcelina Finn would just
 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:12.740 align:start position:0%

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 align:start position:0%
go better you know you know she's she's
 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.290 align:start position:0%
go better you know you know she's she's

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
18 and too old you know I just think a
 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
18 and too old you know I just think a
million<00:06:15.539><c> it's</c><00:06:15.900><c> it's</c><00:06:16.500><c> such</c><00:06:16.860><c> an</c><00:06:17.039><c> age</c><00:06:17.310><c> gap</c><00:06:17.639><c> that</c>

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
million it's it's such an age gap that
 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.939 align:start position:0%
million it's it's such an age gap that
it's<00:06:18.270><c> like</c><00:06:18.449><c> it's</c><00:06:18.629><c> so</c><00:06:18.870><c> far</c><00:06:19.169><c> that</c><00:06:19.349><c> as</c><00:06:19.500><c> you</c><00:06:19.650><c> saw</c><00:06:19.830><c> it</c>

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:19.949 align:start position:0%
it's like it's so far that as you saw it
 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.950 align:start position:0%
it's like it's so far that as you saw it
comes<00:06:20.159><c> around</c><00:06:20.310><c> again</c><00:06:20.729><c> to</c><00:06:21.029><c> being</c><00:06:21.180><c> okay</c><00:06:21.539><c> so</c><00:06:21.599><c> that</c>

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
comes around again to being okay so that
 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.949 align:start position:0%
comes around again to being okay so that
that's<00:06:22.139><c> my</c><00:06:22.940><c> theory</c><00:06:23.940><c> on</c><00:06:24.089><c> that</c><00:06:24.209><c> I</c><00:06:26.120><c> agree</c><00:06:27.120><c> they</c>

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:27.959 align:start position:0%
that's my theory on that I agree they
 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.660 align:start position:0%
that's my theory on that I agree they
