00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's just review what we've defined in terms of our API.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have a function match and a function search,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and they both take a pattern and a text,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and they both return a string representing the earliest longest match.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But for match the string would only return if it's at the start of the string.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
For search, it'll be anywhere within the string.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If they don't match, then they return none.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We've also defined an API of functions to create patterns--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
a literal string, an alternative between two patterns x and y,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
a sequence of two patterns x and y, and so on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's sort of the API that we expect the programmer to program to.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You create a pattern on this side and then you use a pattern over here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
against a text to get some result.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then below the line of the API--sort of an internal function--we've defined matchset,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which is not really designed for the programmer to call it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It was designed for the programmer to go through this interface, but this function is there.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It also takes a pattern and a text.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Instead of returning a single string, which is a match, it returns a set of strings, which are remainders.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
For any remainder we have the constraint that the match plus the remainder

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
equals the original text.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here I've written versions of search and match. We already wrote matchset.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The one part that we missed out was this component that pulls out the x, y and op components out of a tuple.

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I've left out two pieces of code here that I want you to fill in.
