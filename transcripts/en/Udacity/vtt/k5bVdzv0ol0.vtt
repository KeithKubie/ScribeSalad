&gt;&gt; So, Michael what have we learned?

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.060
&gt;&gt; That.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.190
&gt;&gt; I think you're right. Okay, well, Michael, I was happy to be able to share

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.225
some of this with you and to remind myself of something I did 20 years ago.

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.020
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it answered the concern that you

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.580
had, so it fit into the over all structure.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.220
&gt;&gt; Excellent, oh, it fit into the structure. Well done, Michael.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see what I did there.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very well done. Well, I will talk

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.600
to you later Michael. Thank you so much for listening.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.180
&gt;&gt; Sure, thanks.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.010
&gt;&gt; Bye.
