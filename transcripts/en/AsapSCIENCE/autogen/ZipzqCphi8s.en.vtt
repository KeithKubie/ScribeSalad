 They are intelligent as a two-year-old human child, dogs understand more than 150 words, 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.480
 They prepare to number 5, and note simple errors as 1 + 1 = 3, and dogs have the ability to solve spatial problems. 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.809
 They know the hidden targets, find the shortest route to the park 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.770
 And deal with mechanisms such as door skis and simple machines. 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.090
 On the idea, dogs are not fully color blind as most people think, but unlike us we have three ... 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.399
 Colored receptors in our eyes, while dogs have only two, as a result 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.450
 They see black, white, blue, and yellow. While their brains do not read red and green. 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.030
 Instead they see "gray" 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.149
 Among the 75 million species of dogs in America, Labrador is the most popular, but the most ... 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.770
 The smarts are "Border Collies", "The Boudels" and "Germaine Shepards", whatever, 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.409
 These are intelligence standards compared to us, dogs are cleverly intelligent in other ways. 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.499
 You may have heard about drug-seeking dogs, but you've learned that dogs can feel 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.849
 Seizures, reveal low blood sugar, and cancer? In one study, dogs show that ... 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:54.909
 It can detect 30 out of 33 prostate cancer by sniffing the urine, and it is reasonable ... 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.079
 Dogs have a high and sophisticated ability to smell to detect variability and variability 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.179
 Organic compounds combined. 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.029
 The sense of sniffing dogs is higher by 10 thousand to 10 million than humans sense of smell depending 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:10.599
 On the offspring, the liquid that secrete from their noses helps them to sniff by holding the chemical smell 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.750
 In a thick layer in their wet mucus on their noses, in fact, for the dog there is a difference between breathing 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.650
 And sniff, fold a tissue called a "fold of the wings" separated from entering the air 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.069

 The same hormones respond to the love and care of our children 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.629
 They are an important part of our lives, actually understand the best friends of both women and men!

 Unless you love cats, so you should see our scientific discussion about ... 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.010
 Cats against dogs, we try to explore who is the best! 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.480
