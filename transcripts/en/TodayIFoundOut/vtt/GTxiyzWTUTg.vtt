00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.320
For those who don’t know, Will-o’-the-Wisps,
also called “ignis fatuus,” Latin for

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.810
“foolish fire”, are balls of light that
are seen hovering over swamps at night and

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.279
look similar to flickering lanterns, with
the light often being blue in color.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.800
Several theories exist as to its cause, including
bioluminescence; that is, the glow is caused

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.990
by something natural like fireflies or honey
fungus.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400
Another, somewhat oddball, theory is that
barn owls might fly over swampy areas and

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.239
reflect light from the moon or other sources
off of their white plumage, making it look

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.440
like a bobbing lantern.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.950
However, one of the most accepted theories
was more or less discovered by Allesandro

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.340
Volta, who discovered methane in 1776.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.490
He believed that lightning mixed with the
swamp gases caused the ghost lights.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.930
His theory was extremely controversial at
the time and often disregarded because of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.739
the unlikeliness of spontaneous combustion
and because the theory did not explain why

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.680
Will-o’-the-Wisps appeared to retreat when
approached.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.350
With technological advances, we can prove
Volta’s theory was more or less correct.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.700
Will-o’-the-Wisps are caused by burning
gases—called “swamp gas” or “marsh

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.780
gas”—that develops from the breakdown
of organic matter in persistently wet areas.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.930
The movement of the wisps is usually disregarded
and it is explained that the gases disperse

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.180
when approached because of the movement in
the air.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.380
The normal decomposition of organic matter
in open air is called “aerobic decomposition.”

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.890
Like all organic matter, plants and animals
are largely made up of carbon, hydrogen, and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.890
oxygen.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.369
When decaying in the presence of oxygen, the
by-products of the decomposition are water,

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.010
carbon dioxide, and energy, or heat.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.450
In swampy or marshy areas, aerobic decomposition
is often unable to take place.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.500
Instead, the dead matter is buried beneath
water and saturated soil where it continues

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.570
to decompose in the absence of air.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.190
The matter is broken down by anaerobic bacteria,
the by-products of which are methane, carbon

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.250
dioxide, nitrogen, phosphines, and other chemicals.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.610
It is believed that, as the gases rise from
the soil and water and escape into the atmosphere,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.400
the methane mixes with the phosphines and
creates the blue lights seen hovering over

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.719
the swamps.

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:18.469
Phosphines are flammable, toxic gasses that
can burst into spontaneous flame in the presence

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.469
of air.

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.499
As it burns, it produces a dense white cloud,
which could give the flame more substance.

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:29.860
Mixed with methane, the effect is the Will-o’-the-Wisps
that inspired so many stories.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.279
The name “Will O’ the Wisps” has a similar
meaning to “Jack O’ Lantern” (“man

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:36.279
of the lantern”).

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:40.799
In this case, coming from the definition for
“wisp” (bundle of sticks or straw used

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.379
for a torch), thus “Will of the Torch”.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.499
In this case, one of the principle legends
behind the name concerns Will Smith… no,

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:52.540
not that Will Smith, but rather a guy named
Will who was a particularly evil blacksmith.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.639
There are a variety of versions of this legend,
but the basic idea is that when he died and

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.660
attempted to get into Heaven, Saint Peter
gives him a second chance at life, but he

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.540
blows it and ends up being doomed to walk
the Earth forever, not unlike the Irish legend

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.120
of Stingy Jack.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.489
Also like the Jack O’ Lantern legend, the
Devil gives Smith an ever burning lump of

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.909
coal to use as a light.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:43.359
But in this case, it is also to keep Smith
warm in cold, damp places

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:43.719
like marshes.
