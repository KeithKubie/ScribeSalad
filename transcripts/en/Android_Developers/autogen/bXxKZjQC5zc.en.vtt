00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.000
 I'm Lewin, CEO and founder of DivMob. 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.960
 I have a small team of game developers in Ho Chi Minh City. 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.980
 The company started three years ago and was staffed by five people. 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.000
 Today, we have a team of forty employees, 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.080
 Our games have been downloaded more than 40 million times. 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.760
 The most important game among our games is Epic Heroes War. 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 (Vietnamese) &lt;i&gt; I'm Minh, I'm a game designer at DivMob. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000
 Epic Heroes War is popular for its easy play. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.760
 Users can take a large number of heroes from many cultures 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.240
 You can also fight online battles with other players around the world. 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.460
 Initially it was the source of most users who pay from the US and European countries. 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.360
 $ Or more dollars were paid for jewelry and upgrades within the game. 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.000
 But in emerging markets like Vietnam, the dollar is worth a lot of money. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.680
 In one dollar in Vietnam you can buy a full lunch. 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:09.200
 We have always tried to try this price model in markets such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia. 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.720
 I'm Fok, an official at DivMob Technology. 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.160
 We're very happy with Google's decision to lower costs for less than the dollar. 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 We have lowered our prices in certain markets because we believe that no one is buying because of prices. 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.820
 To support new prices, we only needed to set the product price within the app 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.120
 On the Google Developer Console. It's easy in management. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.460
 To highlight new prices, we've created a leader-facing feature 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.480
 We provided it to users 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.160
 Priced less than $ 1. 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.680
 It has helped us convert a lot of free game users to paying users. 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.400
 We have achieved immediate success. 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.280
 Our daily dealings increased to 300%. 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.680
 In addition, the number of users paying three times more than doubled. 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.720
 This is important because users who pay are becoming more interactive and their income can be consistently monetized. 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.500
 Today, six of our top 10 markets 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.520
 In terms of number of transactions 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.600
 The system uses prices below $. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.920
 I always seek to give freedom of innovation to my team. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.880
 We work together, eat together and play football together. 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.080
 Here we are succeeding together. 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.640
 Now what is our next goal? It's an easy goal. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.120
 We strive to create the best possible game.
