Slender Man which just seems like an odd
 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.000
Slender Man which just seems like an odd
choice it's a little distasteful after

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010
choice it's a little distasteful after
 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.729
choice it's a little distasteful after
the events of the stabbings that the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739
the events of the stabbings that the
 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.830
the events of the stabbings that the
stabbing that happened in 2014 and in

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840
stabbing that happened in 2014 and in
 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.690

import taste for us it also just seems

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810
import taste for us it also just seems
 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.229

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.460
with this movie and the tone of it even
seems very odd I'm not sure if it's

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470
seems very odd I'm not sure if it's
 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.430
seems very odd I'm not sure if it's
going to be a straight-up horror film
