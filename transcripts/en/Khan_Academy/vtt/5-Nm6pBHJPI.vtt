00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.070
- Teachers are the single
most important actor

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.340
in students' learning.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.320
Hi, I'm Sal Khan, Founder of
the not-for-profit organization

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.390
Khan Academy.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.460
And I just want to tell
all you teachers out there

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.300
that we have an exciting
program for this summer.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.740
It's called Khan Academy Teacher Training.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.480
And we want to do everything that we can

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.290
to ensure that you have the content,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.200
the software, the tools, and the training

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.300
to best meet the needs of your student.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.260
And so Khan Academy Teacher Training

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.650
is a learning program that'll
take you about an hour

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.830
that allow you to learn
from other teachers

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.620
who are successfully using Khan Academy

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.400
and seeing gains in their classroom.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.640
You'll get guides on how to
use it in your classroom,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.740
and we'll also encourage
you to have a plan

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.560
for how you might want to implement it.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.090
If you complete this roughly one hour,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.730
you'll get a certificate and a chance

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.790
to come visit us so that we can learn more

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.650
from each other.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.070
So I encourage you to
participate this summer.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.020
I think together we can
really make a big difference

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.461
for learners everywhere.

00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:59.128
(upbeat instrumental music)
