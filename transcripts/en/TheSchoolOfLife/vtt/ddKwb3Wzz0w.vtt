00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.680
We're repeatedly given messages that we
live in sexually enlightened times.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.940
That we belong to a liberated age and
therefore the implication is that we

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.590
ought by now, to be finding sex a
straightforward and un-troubling matter

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.810
we're not after all Victorians or prudes.
The standard narrative of our release

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.980
from past inhibitions go something like
this. For thousands of years

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.760
right across the globe due to a devilish
combination of religious bigotry and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.870
pedantic social customs people were
afflicted by a ridiculous sense of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.120
confusion and guilt around sex.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.940
They thought their hands would fall off if
they masturbated.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.980
They believed they might be burned in a
vat of oil because they ogle [look at] someone's ankle.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.940
They had no clue about erections  or
clitorises. They will see that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480
sometime between the first World War
and the launch of Sputnik 1,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.500
things change for the better. Finally
people started wearing bikinis, admitted

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.670
to masturbating, grew able to mention
cunnilingus in social context, started to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.239
watch porn films, and became deeply
comfortable with a topic which had

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.200
almost unaccountably been a source of
needless carotid frustration

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020
for most of human history.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
It seems almost inconceivable now how
hung up our ancestors had been.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.760
Sex came to be perceived as a useful, refreshing,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.979
and physically reviving pass time: a bit like tennis.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.610
The one that could sit perfectly well
within the context of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570
bourgeois [middle class] family life once the kids were in bed.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.870
This narrative of enlightenment and progress, however flattering

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.020
it may be to the modern age, conveniently skirts an unbutching fact.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.900
We remain hugely conflicted, embarrassed, ashamed, and ought about sex.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.800
Sex refuses
to match up simply with love

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.700
and remains as difficult to subject as ever, with

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.899
one added complication: it's meant to be so simple.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.779
In reality, none of us approaches sex

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.380
as we meant to: with a cheerful, 
sporting, non-obsessive, clean, loyal

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.260
well-adjusted outlook that we
convinced ourselves is the norm.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.840
We are universally odd around sex, but
only in relation to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.380
some highly and cruelly distorted ideals of normality.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.670
Most of what we are sexually remains
very frightening to communicate to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.370
anyone whom we would want to think well of us.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
People in love constantly, instinctively, hold back from

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.540
sharing more than a fraction of their desires and tastes out of a fear,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.460
not without foundation, 
of generating intolerable disgust in their partners.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.800
In the choice between being loved and being honest, most of us choose the former.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.560
But we are then burdened by sexuality, 
which refuses to stop haunting us.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.760
We suffer, and yet may find it easier to die without having had certain conversations.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.760
The priority seems evident: to find a way to talk

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.920
to ourselves and our partners about
who we really are, to tell one another

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.640
without setting off catastrophic panic,
offense, or fear

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.540
what sex really makes us want. It may be 
someone else or them in a uniform.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.940
At the heart of the dilemma is how
simultaneously to appear normal

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.460
and yet achieve honesty about our sexual appetites.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.140
Our commitment to feeling normal is important and touching.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.280
It means being, or at least trying very hard to be: patient, gentle,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.660
considerate, Democratic, intelligent, and devoted to treating people with

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.579
respect and loyalty, and yet, our sexual imaginations simply refuse

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.679
to bow to any normative parameters.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.020
To start the list, here
are just some of the unpalatable truths

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.320
that stir in our sexual imaginations.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.160
It's very rare to maintain sexual
interest in only

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.520
one person, however much one loves them, beyond more than a few years.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.400
It's entirely possible to love one's
partner and regularly want to have sex

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.270
with complete strangers. One can be a
kind, respectable, and democratic person

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.490
and at the same time want to flog, hurt,
and humiliate a sexual partner

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.620
who'll be on the receiving end 
of a very rough treatment.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.000
It may be easier to be excited by
someone one dislikes

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.900
or thinks nothing of, then by someone one loves and respects.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.180
Though we may try
to tame them, our sexual desires remain

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.820
often an absurd, irreconcilable conflict
with many of our highest commitments and

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.630
values. We need to admit to ourselves
that whatever the self congratulation,

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.010
sexual liberation has never, in fact,
happened.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.910
This is about more than the ability to
wear a bikini. We remain imprisoned,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.350
fearful, and ashamed, sometimes with few
options but to life for the sake of love

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.540
true liberation is a challenge that
remains before us as we patiently build

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.220
up the courage to admit to the nature of
our desires and learn to talk to our

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.410
loved ones with pioneering honesty about
the contents of our own minds.
