00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.040
Up through now,

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.390
you've only seen a limited range
of the data that can be stored.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.039
There's actually a lot more and
you see some of it here.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.930
If you view this screen in
your own HealthAlt account,

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.840
you'll see the full list
of data categories.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.140
It's quite extensive.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.780
I want you to focus now on this item,
the Continuity of Care Document, or CCD.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.350
You should know what it
is from lesson five.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.780
By clicking here, a patient can
upload their CCD into HealthAlt once

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.070
they have it, something you're going to
do yourself in the next class activity.
