00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.350
Okay, the correct answer here is the normal

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.590
CCR5 allele is dominant. Because all you need is

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.350
one allele to produce normal CCR5 protein that can

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.550
reside on the surface of T cells and allow

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.690
HIV infection. Thus masking the effect of this CCR5

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.660
delta 32 allele. So, if we used the symbols

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.900
we've used all throughout the course up until this

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.495
point to represent dominate and recessive, the regular CCR5

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:27.930
allele would be dominant, or the plus symbol.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650
And the CCR5 delta 32 would be recessive, or

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.120
the minus symbol. And the reason is because

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.740
the dominant CCR5 allele masks the effect of the

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.250
recessive CCR5 delta 32 allele. As long as

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.010
you have one of these dominant alleles here, then

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.850
HIV is going to be able to latch on and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.950
infect the T-cell. You must be homozygous recessive before

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.380
you have no protein available on the surface

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.721
of T-cells for HIV to latch onto and affect.
