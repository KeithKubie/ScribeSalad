00:00:06.822 --> 00:00:10.548
In 1997, a French woman named 
Jeanne Calment

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:16.981
passed away after 122 years
and 164 days on this Earth,

00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.354
making her the oldest known 
person in history.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.170
Her age was so astounding

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.733
that a millionaire pledged $1 million
to anyone who could break her record.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:30.796
But in reality, living to this age 
or beyond

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:34.169
is a feat that very few,
maybe even no humans,

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:36.179
are likely to accomplish.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:39.631
Human bodies just aren't built
for extreme aging.

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:42.692
Our capacity is set at about 90 years.

00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:46.352
But what does aging really mean

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:50.132
and how does it counteract
the body's efforts to stay alive?

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:53.162
We know intuitively what it means to age.

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:55.725
For some, it means growing up,

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.858
while for others, it's growing old.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:04.199
Yet finding a strict scientific definition
of aging is a challenge.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.358
What we can say is that aging
occurs when intrinsic processes

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:11.898
and interactions with the environment,
like sunlight,

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:15.663
and toxins in the air, water, 
and our diets,

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:17.754
cause changes in the structure

00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:20.982
and function of the body's 
molecules and cells.

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:23.724
Those changes in turn drive their decline,

00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:27.544
and subsequently, the failure
of the whole organism.

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:31.439
The exact mechanisms of aging
are poorly understood.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.923
But recently, scientists have identified
nine physiological traits,

00:01:35.923 --> 00:01:38.254
ranging from genetic changes

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:41.361
to alterations in 
a cell's regenerative ability

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.221
that play a central role.

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:48.629
Firstly, as the years pass, our bodies
accumulate genetic damage

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:51.127
in the form of DNA lesions.

00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:54.259
These occur naturally when the body's
DNA replicates,

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.174
but also in non-dividing cells.

00:01:57.174 --> 00:02:02.098
Organelles called mitochondria
are especially prone to this damage.

00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:06.002
Mitochondria produce 
adenosine triphosphate,

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:07.603
or ATP,

00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:11.196
the main energy source for
all cellular processes,

00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.662
plus mitochondria regulate
many different cell activities

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:18.721
and play an important role
in programmed cell death.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:21.120
If mitochondrial function declines,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.869
then cells and, later on, whole organs,
deteriorate, too.

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.902
Other changes are known to occur
in the expression patterns of genes,

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:32.370
also known as epigenetic alterations,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.288
that affect the body's tissues and cells.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:38.683
Genes silenced or expressed
only at low levels in newborns

00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:41.812
become prominent in older people,

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:44.534
leading to the development
of degenerative diseases,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:48.119
like Alzheimer's, which accelerate aging.

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.592
Even if we could avoid all these harmful
genetic alterations,

00:02:52.592 --> 00:02:55.404
not even our own cells could save us.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:58.415
The fact remains 
that cellular regeneration,

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.212
the very stuff of life,

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:02.400
declines as we age.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.093
The DNA in our cells is packaged
within chromosomes,

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:11.932
each of which has two protective regions
at the extremities called telomeres.

00:03:11.932 --> 00:03:14.931
Those shorten every time cells replicate.

00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:17.462
When telomeres become too short,

00:03:17.462 --> 00:03:20.123
cells stop replicating and die,

00:03:20.123 --> 00:03:23.185
slowing the body's ability
to renew itself.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:26.935
With age, 
cells increasingly grow senescent, too,

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:30.474
a process that halts the cell cycle
in times of risk,

00:03:30.474 --> 00:03:33.385
like when cancer cells are proliferating.

00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:36.620
But the response 
also kicks in more as we age,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.568
halting cell growth and cutting short
their ability to replicate.

00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:44.475
Aging also involves stem cells
that reside in many tissues

00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:49.382
and have the property of dividing
without limits to replenish other cells.

00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:52.750
As we get older, 
stem cells decrease in number

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.217
and tend to lose 
their regenerative potential,

00:03:55.217 --> 00:03:59.728
affecting tissue renewal and maintenance
of our organs original functions.

00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:04.098
Other changes revolve around cells' 
ability to function properly.

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:08.498
As they age, they stop being able to do
quality control on proteins,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:12.851
causing the accumulation of damaged
and potentially toxic nutrients,

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.555
leading to excessive metabolic activity
that could be fatal for them.

00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:20.597
Intercellular communication also slows,

00:04:20.597 --> 00:04:24.009
ultimately undermining 
the body's functional ability.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.105
There's a lot we don't yet 
understand about aging.

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:32.193
Ultimately, does longer life
as we know it come down to diet,

00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:33.400
exercise,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.405
medicine,

00:04:34.405 --> 00:04:35.965
or something else?

00:04:35.965 --> 00:04:39.094
Will future technologies,
like cell-repairing nanobots,

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:40.587
or gene therapy,

00:04:40.587 --> 00:04:43.311
artificially extend our years?

00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:46.405
And do we want to live longer
than we already do?

00:04:46.405 --> 00:04:50.375
Starting with 122 years as inspiration,

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.434
there's no telling where our curiosity
might take us.
