00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:12.417
The discovery of an alien monolith 
on planet RH-1729

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:17.018
has scientists across the world 
racing to unlock its mysteries.

00:00:17.018 --> 00:00:22.020
Your engineering team has developed 
an elegant probe to study it.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.501
The probe is a collection 
of 27 cube modules

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:30.921
capable of running all the scientific 
tests necessary to analyze the monolith.

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.994
The modules can self-assemble 
into a large 3x3x3 cube,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.965
with each individual module
placed anywhere in the cube,

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.841
and at any orientation.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:47.600
It can also break itself apart 
and reassemble into any other orientation.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.092
Now comes your job.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:51.431
The probe will need a special 
protective coating

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.612
for each of the extreme
environments it passes through.

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:57.993
The red coating will seal it against 
the cold of deep space,

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:00.741
the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat

00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:03.948
as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729,

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:09.388
and the green coating will shield it 
from the alien planet’s electric storms.

00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:14.249
You can apply the coatings to each of
the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.863
in any way you like,

00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:19.349
but each face can only 
take a single color coating.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:22.035
You need to figure out how you 
can apply the colors

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:26.159
so the cubes can re-assemble themselves
to show only red,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.162
then purple,

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:28.483
then green.

00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:32.350
How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.723
so the probe will be able 
to make the trip?

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:45.458
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:49.331
You can start by painting the outside 
of the complete cube red,

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:51.341
since you’ll need that regardless.

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:55.767
Then you can break it into 27 pieces, 
and look at what you have.

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:59.645
There are 8 corner cubes, 
which each have three red faces,

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:02.775
12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces,

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.741
6 face cubes, which have 1 red face,

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:09.632
and a single center cube, 
which has no red faces.

00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:13.199
You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red 
at this point,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.830
so you’ll need the same number of faces 
for the green and purple cubes, too.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.578
When you’re done, 
you’ll have painted 54 faces red,

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:22.166
54 faces green,

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.348
and 54 faces purple.

00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:29.873
That’s 162 faces, which is precisely 
how many the cubes have in total.

00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:32.154
So there’s no margin for waste.

00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:36.182
If there’s any way to do this,
it’ll probably be highly symmetrical.

00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:38.182
Maybe you can use that to help you.

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:40.036
You look at the center cube.

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.889
You’d better paint it half green 
and half purple,

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.063
so you can use it as a corner 
for each of those cubes,

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:48.423
and not waste a single face.

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:52.429
There’ll need to be center cubes
with no green and no purple too.

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.153
So you take 2 corner cubes 
from the red cube

00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:58.625
and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple,

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.921
and the 3 blank faces of the other green.

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.264
Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes 
that each have 1 face painted red.

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:09.325
That leaves 5 empty faces on each.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:11.043
You can split them in half.

00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:13.616
In the first group, 
you paint 3 faces green

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.284
and 2 faces purple;

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:19.113
In the second group, 
paint 3 faces purple and 2 green.

00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:20.362
Counting on symmetry,

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:24.274
you replicate these piles again
with the colors rearranged.

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:26.604
That gives you 6 with 1 green face,

00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:28.151
6 with 1 red face,

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.623
and 6 with 1 purple face.

00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:32.559
Counting up 
what you’ve completely painted,

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.495
you see 8 corner cubes in each color,

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:37.356
6 edge cubes in each color,

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:39.385
6 face cubes in each color,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.420
and 1 center cube.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.663
That means you just need 6 more edge cubes
in green and purple.

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:50.602
And there are exactly 6 cubes left,
each with 4 empty faces.

00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:54.591
You paint 2 faces of each green 
and 2 faces of each purple.

00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:58.942
And now you have a cube that’s perfectly 
painted to make an incredible trip.

00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:01.747
It rearranges itself 
to be red in deep space,

00:04:01.747 --> 00:04:05.148
purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere,

00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:08.457
and green when it flies through 
the electric storms.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.279
As it reaches the monolith,

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.207
you realize you’ve achieved 
something humans have dreamt of for eons:

00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:16.044
alien contact.
