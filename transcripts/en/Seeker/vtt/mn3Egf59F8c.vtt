00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
This Dnews episode is brought to you by Domain
Dot Com!

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.040
Someone on the DNews team recently posed the
question, “What happens to you if you fall

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.300
into a black hole?”

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:19.140
As it turns out, horrible, horrible, awesome,
horrible stuff.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.489
Hey there space cadets, I’m Julian, welcome
to another episode of DNews.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.140
Today we’re going to talk about Black Holes,
itty bitty single points in space with so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.380
much mass that even light cannot travel fast
enough to escape their gravitational pull.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.340
Supermassive black holes are at the center
of galaxies and they are enormously massive,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.660
billions times more so than our sun.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.450
Stellar black holes are much smaller and are
the remnants of ex-stars.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.680
And you thought your ex was clingy.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.930
Don’t worry though, the closest stellar
black hole to us, Cygnus x-1, is over 6000

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.980
light years away and would only really be
dangerous if you got within 14 thousand miles

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.980
of it.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.980
Phew.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.530
I should say Cygnus is a black hole candidate,
it’s kind of hard to detect black holes

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.640
because they swallow light and we can’t
see them directly.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.920
So what happens if you cross that threshold
into a supermassive black hole?

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.140
You’ll have gone over the event horizon,
and from there there’s no going back and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.479
things get freaky-deaky.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.340
Let’s assume you jumped in head first, because
you’re the adventurous sort.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.960
Even though your head is just a few feet from
your….

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.469
feet…. the force of gravity is way stronger
on it.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.600
At first you wouldn’t notice anything, but
as you get close to the center your head gets

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.740
pulled and squished, your whole body gets
stretched out.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.789
The technical term is, “spaghettified.”

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.509
Nope, that was not one of my bad jokes.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.719
Eventually you’re just a stream of atoms
on your way to join the singularity.

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.740
With stellar black holes this will happen
to you long before you cross the event horizon,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.389
so someone could actually watch you get stretched
out.

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.029
They’d have to wait a while though.

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:54.729
As you accelerate and get near a massive object,
time for you slows down compared to a stationary

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.909
observer that’s much farther away.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.139
you wouldn’t notice it for yourself, but
everyone else would seem to be aging really

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:01.139
fast.

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:04.229
If someone wanted to watch you fall into a
supermassive black hole, they couldn’t.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.220
As you got closer, to them you would be moving
more and more slowly.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.260
Right at the edge of the horizon you would
seem to stop.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.700
You would get dimmer and turn red as the light
waves you reflect gets pulled and stretched,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.900
eventually becoming too long to see.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.580
You would fade to black.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.300
And if movies have taught me anything, that’s
always the best way to end it.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.770
Whoa hey I’m not done yet!

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.500
I have to tell you that no domain extension
will help you tell your story like a DOT COM

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.140
or DOT NET domain name.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.030
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%
off Domain Dot Com’s domain names and web

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.030
hosting when you use the coupon code DNEWS

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.810
If you want to learn more about time dilation,
Trace covers that for you in this video right

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.810
here.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.930
Would you jump into a black hole?

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.060
Let us know in the comments!

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.630
Please don’t though, because we like having
you around.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.280
Thanks for watching DNews!

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.310
Ok, NOW you can fade.
