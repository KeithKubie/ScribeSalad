00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.470
So let's just review what
we've seen with budget lines.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.840
Let's say I'm
making $20 a month.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.870
So my income is $20 per month.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.825
Let's say per month.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.290
The price of chocolate
is $1 per bar.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.730
And the price of
fruit is $2 per pound.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.420
And we've already
done this before,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.750
but I'll just redraw
a budget line.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.050
So this axis, let's say this
is the quantity of chocolate.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.820
I could have picked
it either way.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.170
And that is the
quantity of fruit.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.810
If I spend all my
money on chocolate,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.550
I could buy 20 bars
of chocolate a month.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.600
So that is 20.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.310
This is 10 right over here.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.740
At these prices, if I
spent all my money on fruit

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.950
I could buy 10 pounds per month.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.420
So this is 10.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.720
So that's 10 pounds per month.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.010
That would be 20.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.245
And so I have a budget
line that looks like this.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.286
And the equation of this budget
line is going to be-- well,

00:01:04.286 --> 00:01:05.410
I could write it like this.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.340
My budget, 20, is going
to be equal to the price

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.430
of chocolate, which is 1, times
the quantity of chocolate.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.810
So this is 1 times the
quantity of chocolate,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.670
plus the price of
fruit, which is

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.517
2 times the quantity of fruit.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.100
And if I want to
write this explicitly

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.140
in terms of my
quantity of chocolate,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.680
since I put that
on my vertical axis

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.220
and that tends to be
the more dependent axis,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.540
I can just subtract 2
times the quantity of fruit

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.480
from both sides.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.700
And I can flip them.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.590
And I get my
quantity of chocolate

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.300
is equal to 20 minus 2
times my quantity of fruit.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.610
And I get this budget
line right over there.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.450
We've also looked at the idea
of an indifference curve.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.140
So for example,
let's say I'm sitting

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.390
at some point on my
budget line where

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.200
I have-- let's say I am
consuming 18 bars of chocolate

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.060
and 1 pound of fruit.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.770
18-- and you can
verify that make sense,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.170
it's going to be $18
plus $2, which is $20.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.480
So let's say I'm at this
point on my budget line.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.960
18 bars of chocolate,
so this is in bars,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.170
and 1 pound of fruit per month.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.240
So that is 1.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.820
And this is in pounds.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.686
And this is chocolate, and
this is fruit right over here.

00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:22.060
Well, we know we have this
idea of an indifference curve.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.380
There's different combinations
of chocolate and fruit

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.921
to which we are
indifferent, to which

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.960
we would get the same
exact total utility.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.140
And so we can plot
all of those points.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.994
I'll do it in white.

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:33.410
It could look
something like this.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.160
I'll do it as a dotted line, it
makes it a little bit easier.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.800
So let me draw it like this.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.160
So let's say I'm
indifferent between any

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.270
of these points, any of those
points right over there.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.770
Let me draw it a
little bit better.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.710
So between any of these
points right over there.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.650
So for example, I could
have 18 bars of chocolate

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.900
and 1 pound of fruit,
or I could have--

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.420
let's say that is
4 bars of chocolate

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.620
and roughly 8 pounds of fruit.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.550
I'm indifferent.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.500
I get the same
exact total utility.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.420
Now, am I maximizing
my total utility

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.410
at either of those points?

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.370
Well, we've already
seen that anything

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.200
to the top right
of our indifference

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.870
curve of this white curve right
over here-- let me label this.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.240
This is our indifference curve.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.450
Everything to the top right
of our indifference curve

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.280
is preferable.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.340
We're going to get
more total utility.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.250
So let me color that in.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.720
So everything to the top right
of our indifference curve

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.930
is going to be preferable.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.730
So all of these other
points on our budget

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.604
line, even a few points
below or budget line,

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:42.660
where we would actually
save money, are preferable.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.660
So either of these
points are not

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.550
going to maximize
our total utility.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.280
We can maximize or total utility
at all of these other points

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.570
in between, along
our budget line.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.140
So to actually maximize
our total utility

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.300
what we want to do is find
a point on our budget line

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.863
that is just tangent, that
exactly touches at exactly one

00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:05.820
point one of our
indifference curves.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.560
We could have an infinite
number of indifference curves.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.640
There could be another
indifference curve

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.510
that looks like that.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.450
There could be another
indifferent curve

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.500
that looks like that.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.958
All that says is that we are
indifferent between any points

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:14.860
on this curve.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.260
And so there is an indifference
curve that touches exactly

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.792
this budget line, or exactly
touches the line at one point.

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.500
And so I might have
an indifference curve

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.530
that looks like this.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.230
Let me do this in a
vibrant color, in magenta.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.610
So I could have an indifference
curve that looks like this.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.280
And because it's tangent, it
touches at exactly one point.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.410
And also the slope of
my indifference curve,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.118
which we've learned
was the marginal rate

00:04:40.118 --> 00:04:45.620
of substitution, is the exact
same as the slope of our budget

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.320
line right over there,
which we learned

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.440
earlier was the relative price.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.690
So this right about here
is the optimal allocation

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.780
on our budget line.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.260
That right here is optimal.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.120
And how do we know
it is optimal?

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.750
Well, there is no other
point on the budget line

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.090
that is to the top right.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.340
In fact, every other
point on our budget line

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.200
is to the bottom left of
this indifference curve.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.740
So every other point on our
budget line is not preferable.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.710
So remember, everything
below an indifference curve--

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.835
so all of this shaded area.

00:05:19.835 --> 00:05:21.460
Let me actually do
it in another color.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.380
Because indifference
curve, we are different.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.463
But everything below an
indifference curve, so all

00:05:25.463 --> 00:05:29.370
of this area in green,
is not preferable.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.480
And every other point
on the budget line

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.090
is not preferable to that
point right over there.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.510
Because that's the only point--
or I guess you could say,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.010
every other point
on our budget line

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.270
is not preferable to the points
on the indifference curve.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.260
So they're also not preferable
to that point right over there

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.570
which actually is on
the indifference curve.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.880
Now, let's think
about what happens.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.310
Let's think about what
happens if the price of fruit

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.480
were to go down.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:04.790
So the price of fruit were to
go from $2 to $1 per pound.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.610
So if the price of fruit
went from $2 to $1, then

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.790
our actual budget line
will look different.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.362
Our new budget line.

00:06:11.362 --> 00:06:13.070
I'll do it in blue,
would look like this.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.180
If we spent all our
money on chocolate,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.280
we could buy 20 bars.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.040
If we spent all of our money
on fruit at the new price,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.460
we could buy 20 pounds of fruit.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.120
So our new budget line would
look something like that.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.840
So that is our new budget line.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.210
So now what would be
the optimal allocation

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.990
of our dollars or the best
combination that we would buy?

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.270
Well, we would do the
exact same exercise.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.030
We would, assuming
that we had data

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.282
on all of these
indifference curves,

00:06:48.282 --> 00:06:49.990
we would find the
indifference curve that

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.520
is exactly tangent to
our new budget line.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.910
So let's say that this
point right over here

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.830
is exactly tangent to
another indifference curve.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:01.980
So just like that.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.270
So there's another indifference
curve that looks like that.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.180
Let me draw it a
little bit neater.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.910
So it looks something like that.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.890
And so based on how the price--
if we assume we have access

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.980
to these many, many, many,
many, many indifference curves,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.110
we can now see based
on, all else equal,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.090
how a change in
the price of fruit

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.750
changed the quantity
of fruit we demanded.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.890
Because now our optimal spent
is this point on our new budget

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.540
line which looks like it's
about, well, give or take,

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.810
about 10 pounds of fruit.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.640
So all of a sudden,
when we were-- so let's

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.060
think about just the fruit.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.560
Everything else
we're holding equal.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.030
So just the fruit, let's
do, when the price was $2,

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.600
the quantity demanded
was 8 pounds.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.520
And now when the price
is $1, the quantity

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.205
demanded is 10 pounds.

00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:55.580
And so what we're
actually doing,

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.530
and once again, we're kind of
looking at the exact same ideas

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.650
from different directions.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.160
Before we looked at it in terms
of marginal utility per dollar

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.130
and we thought about
how you maximize it.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.190
And we were able to
change the prices

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.539
and then figure out and derive
a demand curve from that.

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:12.080
Here we're just looking at it
from a slightly different lens,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.860
but they really are
all of the same ideas.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.280
But by-- assuming
if we had access

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.870
to a bunch of
indifference curves,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.880
we can see how a change in
price changes our budget line.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.610
And how that would change
the optimal quantity

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.244
we would want of
a given product.

00:08:28.244 --> 00:08:29.910
So for example, we
could keep doing this

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.429
and we could plot
our new demand curve.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.220
So I could do a demand
curve now for fruit.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.730
At least I have two points
on that demand curve.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.010
So if this is the
price of fruit and this

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.872
is the quantity demanded of
fruit, when the price is $2,

00:08:42.872 --> 00:08:44.400
the quantity demanded is 8.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.000
And when the price
is-- actually,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.610
let me do it a
little bit different.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.820
When the price is $2--
these aren't to scale--

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.905
the quantity demanded is 8.

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:58.687
Actually let me
do it here-- is 8.

00:08:58.687 --> 00:08:59.770
And these aren't to scale.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.710
But when the price is $1,
the quantity demanded is 10.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.625
So $2, 8, the quantity
demanded is 10.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.570
And so our demand curve,
these are two points on it.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.010
But we could keep changing
it up assuming we had access

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:15.630
to a bunch of
indifference curves.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.150
We could keep changing
it up and eventually plot

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:23.640
our demand curve, that might
look something like that.
