00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.540
When there are decades of comic book history
to pull from for a superhero blockbuster,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.530
it's impossible to adapt all the fan-favorite
moments and characters.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.740
But that doesn't stop the directors, writers,
stars and crew from filling the movies with

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.790
details and jokes that the average fan might
miss out on - but not anymore.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.200
If youâ€™re a fan of our Hidden Details In
movies series, stick around until the end

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.750
for links to our other great videos!

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.349
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Hidden Details
In Movies SUPERHERO EDITION.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.720
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.360
When Peter Parker finally decides to find
out what his father was up to before he disappeared,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.219
all the clues point towards a single word:
Roosevelt.

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.329
One possible answer Peter comes across is
the Roosevelt Island Tramway.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.839
In the original Spider-Man movie, Green Goblin
made Peter choose between saving Mary Jane

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.100
and one of that exact tramway's cars.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.589
Fans may be torn on which version of Spider-Man
was best, but it's nice to see the reboot

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.320
give the original a nod.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.059
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.789
In the world of all time greatest movie pairings,
Paul Newman and Robert Redford are at the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.789
top of the list.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.050
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid made them
massive stars, and The Sting led them to the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.550
top of the box office.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.600
The pair would remain lifelong friends until
Newman's death in 2008, ending the hopes that

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.149
they'd share the screen one more time.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.000
But when Redford landed the part of the villain
in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.920
crew made sure to honor his famous partner.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.521
When Redford's character is seen getting a
carton of milk from his refrigerator, Newman

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.840
makes a cameo, with a bottle of the late actor's
"Newman's Own" marinara sauce making sure

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.610
that Butch and Sundance ride again (even if
it's just for a second).

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.610
Man of Steel

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.049
Most of General Zod's soldiers are left to
the background, without names or lines.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.350
But it's hard to miss the oversized Kryptonian
that eventually teams up with Faora to beat

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.579
Superman to a pulp.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.430
But his name, or how he became a giant is
never explained - unless you know your comic

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.560
Kryptonians.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.760
The soldier is Nam-Ek, who in the comics tried
to unlock the healing powers of the Rondor,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.590
a Kryptonian animal with horns that healed
all sickness.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.200
When he tested his results on himself, he
became a massive, super-strong monster.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.689
The same story is secretly at work here - but
you CAN catch a glimpse of the Rondor grazing

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.509
outside Jor-El's citadel.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.470
Thor: The Dark World&nbsp;

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.360
When the action is over, Thor's girlfriend
Jane Foster is left waiting, not knowing when

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.960
the hero will return to Earth.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.270
She only had to wait until the end of the
credits, when the two share a passionate kiss

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.940
- a more passionate kiss than fans have ever
seen.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.160
That's probably because... it's not Natalie
Portman kissing him.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.390
When it came time to film the scene, Chris
Hemsworth was available, but Portman wasn't.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.800
Luckily, Hemsworth's wife, Fast &amp; Furious
actress Elsa Pataky was travelling with him.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.570
With her profile close enough to work, she
threw on the wardrobe and a wig, and the couple

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.490
gave audiences a kiss that could never be
faked.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.430
The Dark Knight&nbsp;

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.760
In the world of Hollywood action movies, a
ticking clock or timer is usually pretty useless,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.500
with minutes or seconds passing as slowly
or quickly as the movie demands.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.550
So when Batman decides he only needs two minutes
and thirty seconds to steal a Gotham criminal

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.390
out of a Hong Kong skyscraper, audiences knew
it was a random number.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.460
Or was it?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.810
Bruce Wayne is nothing but punctual, since
he infiltrates the building, grabs his target,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.830
and waits for the explosives to open his exit
- two and a half minutes later, almost to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.830
the second.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.590
We wish every comic book movie was as easy
to trust.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.100
The Wolverine

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.090
Marvel fans know to keep an eye peeled for
a cameo from comics legend Stan Lee in almost

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750
every film starring even one of his characters.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.730
But when Wolverine broke off from his X-Men
colleagues for a standalone adventure in Japan,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.720
a cameo gag didn't quite fit with the serious
tone.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.570
The Wolverine doesn't feature a Lee appearance,
but when Logan is found living in the wild

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.860
with only a few items to his name, one of
them is a bottle of "Stanley's Whiskey".

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.380
Still a clear nod to the Marvel Comics creator.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.910
Avengers Age of Ultron&nbsp;

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.410
Aside from giving Marvel's biggest heroes
a chance a supervillain to fight, the age

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.970
of Ultron also introduced fans to the African
nation of Wakanda - and a potential villain

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.310
for its hero, Black Panther.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.130
Apparently the effects team was doing some
homework of their own.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.430
When Bruce Banner investigates Klaw's brand,
the text on screen is actually the first two

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.610
paragraphs of the Wikipedia page on the fictional
country's history.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.510
That means Banner learned the current "Black
Panther" is T'Challa before the rest of the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.560
team even knew the hero existed.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.560
Ant-Man

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.870
It isn't just fame or fun that convinces some
actors to take a superhero role, but a chance

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.000
to make a movie their kids can actually watch.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.150
With Ant-Man, star Paul Rudd gave them much,
much more.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.180
When the ex-con gets out of prison, he can
only find work at a Baskin Robbins, using

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.959
the fake name "Jack", and working with someone
named Darby.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.820
They weren't random choices: those are the
names of Rudd's two children, making a cameo

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.340
in the movie... in name only.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.340
Iron Man&nbsp;

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.199
When director Jon Favreau brought Iron Man
to the movie world, he brought Pepper Potts,

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.710
Happy Hogan and more Marvel characters along
with him.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.560
But one didn't make the cut: Bambi Arbogast,
Tony Stark's trusty and sometimes overbearing

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.560
secretary.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.500
Since the movie's Tony didn't spend much time
in the office, Bambi wasn't needed.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.300
But Favreau and Robert Downey, Jr. didn't
forget her, making a brief reference in Iron

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.130
Man 2, and in Iron Man 3, confirming that
she does exist in the movie universe - just

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.729
slightly off screen.

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.150
X-Men: Days of Future Past&nbsp;

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.830
Mystique might have kicked off the terrible
future of this X-Men reboot, but she also

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.860
took the time to extract a group of young
mutants from Saigon.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.270
To do it, she disguised herself as a US Army
Colonel - before she was forced to rely on

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.340
her fists and feet.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.229
It's a heroic act, but when you notice that
Mystique has disguised herself as "Colonel

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.180
Sanders", the founder and mascot of Kentucky
Fried Chicken, it's clear she was still having

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.180
fun.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.710
Those are the small details that comic book
movie fans probably missed, but which ones

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:25.740
have we left out?
