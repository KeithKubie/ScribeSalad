Welcome, Lisa.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:00:57.960
LISA LEWTAN: Thank you, Joyce.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.500
Was there ever a time
of your life where

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.190
you thought you were so cool,
only to look back and think,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.860
was I out of my mind?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.150
For me, it was August, 1994.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.760
I was 31 years old.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.800
I see you doing the math.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.790
I had just had my
second baby, and I

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.860
was working at a tech company.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.480
It was a tech company that I
co-founded with my boyfriend,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.000
who, yes, was now my husband.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.130
We just moved into our
first house in the suburbs.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.440
There I was in my new house,
nursing my newborn baby son.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.100
I had a phone kind of stuck
in between my shoulder

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.160
and my head, because I had a
few things going on at work that

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.050
just couldn't wait till later.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.400
And I had my arm pointing
to some BU students

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.450
that I just hired for the day
to help unpack some boxes so

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.885
that I could focus
on the office, all

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:09.169
while my daughter was--

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.680
I don't know-- reading
"Goodnight Moon" or something

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.360
by my leg.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.480
It was multitasking
at its finest.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.900
I had mastered it.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.140
Woohoo!

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.520
Three days later, I ended
up in the emergency room,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.610
and my life would
never be the same.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.220
I'm here today to share
my story with you.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.870
It's a story that I
talk about in my book,

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.440
and it's a story that eventually
led me to write the book.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.470
And it's a story that could
actually change your life.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.510
Let's go back to the beginning.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.920
I grew up in New York.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.810
I was one of four kids--

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.810
two girls and two boys.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.220
And in my family,
they didn't care

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.690
about how rich somebody was
or how pretty they were.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.620
It was all about
how smart they were.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.390
I think it was an
Eastern European thing.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.770
Anyway, it was very
clear also in my family

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.330
that the boys were really smart.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.350
I was smart, but
they were smarter.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.720
And truth be told,
they were really smart.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.030
One ended up going to
MIT, and the other one

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.960
ended up at Wharton.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.410
And it made me feel like,
even though I was smart,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.560
I just never was going
to be smart enough.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.150
Another thing in my
family-- and maybe

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.400
you can relate to this one--
was tears were weakness.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.210
Keep it together.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.650
Hold it together.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.270
Be tough.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.230
And so when my report
card would come

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.810
and I'd take the walk of
shame to my dad's office,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.270
and I'd be holding back the
tears because I got a B,

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.960
I learned how to not cry, to
be tough, keep it all together.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.000
I had a lot of
ambition growing up.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.110
I wanted to be
somebody really big.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.320
But I always remember
my parents saying to me,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.460
don't get your
hopes up too high.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.024
You might be disappointed.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.440
And another thing
that they always

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.820
said to me again and again
was don't be a quitter.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.760
And I took these things
very much to heart

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.310
and carried them with me.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.370
And so by the time I got
to be an adolescent I just

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.890
didn't feel so great.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.870
I thought about it.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.882
I was smart, but
not smart enough.

00:04:46.882 --> 00:04:53.910
And I was skinny, but that felt
not that interesting to me.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.840
I looked around at the
other kids at school,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.870
and they were athletes,
and dancers, and musicians,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.080
and I was none of those things,
and I felt that I was not

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.370
good at anything.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.870
In fact, I thought I
was inherently boring.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.920
I might even be the most boring
person on the entire planet,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.600
I thought.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.840
And I can laugh about
that now, but at the time

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.830
as an adolescent it was
extraordinarily painful.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.000
I literally felt like I
had a big sign on my head.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.010
You're not good enough.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.060
You're boring.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.909
You're a loser.

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.700
And I know you know
what I'm talking about,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.760
because we all have that
I'm not good enough thing

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.310
in some flavor or another.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.720
And so I needed to hide
because these feelings were

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.720
so painful for me, and I didn't
know what to do with them.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.500
And so I started to
get busy, and I just

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.050
started doing more
and more things.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.900
And it was fascinating
because the more things I did,

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.670
the less time I had
to think about all

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.380
those horrible thoughts.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.110
And then something
else amazing happened.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.080
I had all these cool
things to talk about

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.060
because I was doing
so many things.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.460
It was like this crazy win-win.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.130
And so by the end of high
school, I was a class officer.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.460
I was working at Szechuan
Cuisine Chinese takeout.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.260
I was on kick line.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.660
I was planning the prom.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.110
I was founder of the
Greco Roman Culture Club.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.730
I was that annoying girl that
was in charge of everything,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.230
and you know what?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.678
I was finally good at something.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.510
And so around the same
time, I started getting

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.570
these weird mystery ailments.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.050
Started off first there were
hives that would come and go--

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.910
really itchy red things--

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.250
and my mom would say, oh,
it's just stress, honey.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.620
Don't worry about it.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.330
Later on, I started getting
these horrible stomachaches.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.640
Yes, worse than
childbirth, I can say now.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.680
And I would be rushed
to the hospital.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.260
They would do tests and
tests, and I'd start vomiting

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.380
violently all over the place,
and they thought my appendix

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.240
burst, but it hadn't.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.140
And they didn't know what was
wrong, and they'd send me home.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.950
And my mom would say, it's
probably just stress, honey.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.170
And so I learned that
stress was something

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.140
that wasn't a big deal.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.590
Stress was something that
could just be ignored.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.640
I went off to college,
which I've now

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.820
renamed Superwoman
Training Academy,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.470
because while my friends were
out partying and having fun,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.670
I was majoring in being busy.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.870
By the time I was a
senior in college,

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.750
I was going to school full time.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.200
I had three separate part time
jobs totaling over 40 hours

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.340
a week.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.270
I took a class at
another college

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.710
nearby in fashion just for
fun, because I liked it,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.780
and they didn't offer
it at my college.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.970
And my roommate and
I were designing

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.660
these decorative accessories
just for fun on the side.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.200
I was insane, but
it was the only way

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.630
to stay sane for me
because it helped

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.810
me distract all those
awful feelings of I'm

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.060
not good enough.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.710
And I had so much to prove.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.950
I thought it was to my parents,
but it was really to me--

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.830
that I was smart enough,
and that I could suck it in,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.670
and that I was going
to be somebody,

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.680
and I wasn't going
to be a quitter.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.275
Luckily, I learned
how to ignore stress.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.470
Well, it worked out really
well, because a year after I

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.900
graduated college, I
was selling software

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.280
to the fashion industry in New
York-- two things that I loved.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.650
My boyfriend-- he was
up here in Boston,

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.850
and he quit his banking job,
and he started teaching himself

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.850
a new thing called dBase III.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.780
It was on an IBM PC, and these
were pretty new around then.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.140
And so when the bank hired
him back as a consultant,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.740
he got this project
that was going on,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.220
and he got tired of our back
and forth New York-Boston thing.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.440
So he said, please,
please, please

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.770
move to Boston
just for one year.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.000
I promise we'll move to New
York when it's all over.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.690
Now, I loved my job,
and I loved New York.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:28.130
But I loved my boyfriend,
and so off I moved.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.180
There was no tech for the
fashion industry in Boston,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.730
and the tech for other
industries at that time

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.220
was for mainframe computing
and mini computers.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.000
It was really boring.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.740
So I went to the headhunters
and said, I can sell.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.230
What can you find me?

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.180
And they said, come work for us.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.010
No, I wasn't interested.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.560
And so when my boyfriend
said, "I think other people

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.480
might need databases.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.100
This is kind of a new thing.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:58.130
Can you help me
sell my services?"

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.380
I thought, eh,
it's for one year.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.690
What the hell?

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.310
And so I said sure.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.180
And in 1986, Lewtan
Technologies was born.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.520
I was 23 years old.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.500
Stuart was working at
the Bank of Boston.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.460
We hired a couple
of contractors,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.960
and I set up our first office
at the Statler Office Building

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.610
in the Back Bay.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.500
It was 200 square feet.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.590
I had a desk.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.120
I had a computer, and I had
a phone, and that was it.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.790
The only software that we
had heard of at the time

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.080
was called Lotus 1-2-3 and
WordPerfect Word Processing.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.130
That was it.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.070
Can you imagine
life without Google?

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.885
So tech in the '80s was crazy.

00:10:38.885 --> 00:10:40.010
We didn't have cell phones.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.150
We didn't have email.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.120
We didn't have laptops.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.300
We didn't have Google.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.850
I can't even imagine
our life before Google.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.470
And we didn't have respect.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.260
Today, when kids in their
20s start a tech company,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.930
venture capitalists
are like, woo hoo.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:54.890
Not then.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.650
We would walk into a
meeting with bankers.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:01.040
We had ended up in this field
called asset securitization.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.350
It was this banking area.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.982
We provided software.

00:11:04.982 --> 00:11:07.190
They would look at us, and
they'd see these two kids,

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.795
and they would
walk out the door.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.710
My superwoman training came
in really, really handy,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.060
because as our company grew
from 20 people to 30 people,

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.910
I had to wear a lot of hats,
and I was doing everything.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.120
I was doing sales and marketing,
contract negotiation--

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.860
because we were a
bootstrapped company,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.660
and we couldn't afford lawyers.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:30.630
I did the accounting
and the finance,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.610
the hiring, human resources.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.860
And let me tell you something.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.370
When you have to hire
people-- really smart people--

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:39.220
to work really long hours,
for really little pay,

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.560
and no equity, that was tough.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.120
But I did it.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.680
I did all the
facilities planning

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.630
because we moved every
year, year and a half

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.710
as we were growing--

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.150
all the event planning.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:50.025
It was endless.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.410
And our typical days--

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.130
we would drag ourselves to work,
grab something at Au Bon Pain,

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.940
eat it at our desk,
bring in some pizza

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.460
because there were no
healthy options around.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.900
Eat it at our desk.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.070
Maybe go out to dinner at night.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.620
Many nights, however,
truth be told,

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.450
we would get a pint of Ben and
Jerry's Phish Food ice cream

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.580
and eat it with two spoons.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.680
And then we'd go, [VOCALIZING]
fall asleep, get up,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.780
do it again, and again,
and again, and again.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.930
The stress was relentless.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:31.640
We had no free time at all.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.640
Stuart worked seven days a week.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.350
I worked six days a
week, and the day off I

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.460
was doing laundry
and paying bills--

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.160
nothing fun.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.680
We didn't have any
time for friends,

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.190
which was a good thing,
because I didn't really

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.000
have any friends.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:44.900
I moved to Boston.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.360
Never had time to make any.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.960
We didn't have any money because
all the money we were making we

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.020
were putting right back
in to fund our company.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.390
There were times we even
went to our savings account

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.210
and took out our wedding
money to pay employees,

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:02.000
because quitting just
wasn't an option.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.840
And we didn't have time for
fun, or rest, or self-care.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.450
Now, truth be told, this was
the '80s, and I don't even know

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.030
if self-care existed--

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:14.000
the term-- but even if it
had, I wouldn't have done it

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.180
because I was too busy.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.460
And then there was
the female factor.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.710
Now, I know there's all
sorts of issues for women

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.720
now with equal
work and equal pay,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.240
but there were other issues,
too, and I think many of them

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.420
still exist today.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.160
I would go to these
banking conferences,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.930
and there would be
500 men in the room,

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.982
and I would be the only woman.

00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.440
Now, some women
might have thought,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.440
hey, that's kind of
cool, but not me.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.970
I looked around, and I
thought, I shouldn't be here.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.140
I am not smart
enough to be here.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.790
I want to be invisible.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.840
And I literally walked
around like this.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.000
I had no female mentors.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.490
Women in my mother's
generation never worked.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:00.070
Women my own age were
still in entry level jobs.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.160
They weren't running
tech companies.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
We didn't have networks.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.660
We didn't have
online communities.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.990
We had nothing.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.210
And so I had that super
pressure that I put on myself.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:10.930
Don't quit.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:11.800
Suck it up.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.070
Be somebody.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.340
And I kept going, wearing
my superwoman cape,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.430
and kept going, and going,
and going till I got pregnant.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.150
I remember we'd finally
gotten interoffice email.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.040
I emailed Stuart.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.330
Just working on this proposal.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.580
I swear it will be done
soon, and then we'll

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.970
get out of here, because the
contractions are starting.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.760
We rushed to FedEx,
and we made it just

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.220
at the 7:00 PM cutoff, grabbed a
bite at a restaurant next door,

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.260
and the contractions
were going like crazy,

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.650
and 24 hours later,
I was a mother.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:57.540
I was an exhausted,
terrified mother.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:05.760
I was a mother who had
never changed a diaper.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.390
My baby cried all the time.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:08.080
She was hungry.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.371
I was feeding her all the time.

00:15:09.371 --> 00:15:10.040
I was a mess.

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.350
I was so tired and exhausted.

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.200
My husband looked at
me and thought, never

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.330
seen her like that before.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.180
My mom, who had come to help,
looked at me and thought,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:22.310
I've never seen her
like that before.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.880
And so I hid in the
bathroom, pretending

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.370
that I was taking a sitz
bath, where I was really

00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.300
negotiating a contract
with Ford Motor Corp

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.980
that I had left off
two days earlier.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.280
Two weeks later, I
went to the doctor.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.850
They looked at the baby,
and they looked at me.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.830
They wrote on her chart,
"Failure to thrive."

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.300
Apparently I had
been so depleted

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.710
that I was starving my child.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.660
I wasn't making any breast milk.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.740
Although they wrote on her
chart, "Failure to thrive,"

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:12.230
the truth is I was
failing to thrive, too,

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.460
but I was too busy to notice.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.090
I came back.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.200
I rushed back to work
as soon as I can--

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.600
somewhere that I
could feel competent--

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.170
but things had been growing,
and I had a different role.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.230
Suddenly we had hired two
people to take my job.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.980
I couldn't travel.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.989
I couldn't stay late.

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:30.280
I couldn't do all those things.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.550
When I was at work, all I
could think about was my baby,

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.920
and when I was with my baby,
all I could think about

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.960
was I was screwing up at work.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.945
I couldn't win.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.810
On the outside, people
think, huh, what a hot shit.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.990
Young, new child, running
this tech company--

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.360
woo hoo, she's got it together.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.290
But on the inside, I was a mess.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.120
I had no friends.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:54.960
I had no life.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.070
I was so sad.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:02.240
I had no time for me, and I felt
like I just wasn't good enough.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.920
It's just stress.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.810
Don't be a quitter.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.420
And so I kept going,
and going, and going.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.180
And a couple of years later,
it was time for baby number two

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.029
and a new house.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:19.510
There I was.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.560
We had just moved
into our new house.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.170
I was nursing my newborn son.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.911
I had the phone in between
my head on my shoulder,

00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:28.369
because, you know,
I had some stuff

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:29.840
to get done at the office.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.090
My hand was pointing.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.430
You know where I'm going, right?

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:39.876
But you don't know
how I got there.

00:17:39.876 --> 00:17:41.750
Couple of days after we
moved into our house,

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.150
we packed up the
kids and we went down

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.700
to New York for my
brother-in-law's wedding.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.860
My daughter was going
to be the flower girl.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.710
My husband was the best man.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.130
I stuffed my post-partum
body into that black gown.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.170
I got the hair done.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.270
I put on the lipstick,
the bracelet, the sandals.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:03.575
And all of a sudden,
time stopped.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.145
My hand started tingling.

00:18:16.659 --> 00:18:19.080
It started moving up my arm.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:29.510
I got really dizzy,
and I noticed

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:33.170
I couldn't see peripherally.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.320
I was rushed to the
North Shore Hospital.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.570
I was hysterical crying.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.380
Here I was in this gown with
mascara streaming down my face.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:56.460
I was a mess.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.290
I had no idea.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.830
I felt like I was an
alien in my own body.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.400
I had always kept it together.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.320
I always had been OK.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.130
What the hell was going on?

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.560
I cried because my
daughter was so excited.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.210
She was supposed to
be the flower girl.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:12.668
And I cried because
my husband, who

00:19:12.668 --> 00:19:15.350
was supposed to be the
best man, was right there,

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:19.370
and noticed he happened to have
the wedding ring in his hand.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.610
I cried because I didn't
know what was going on,

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.760
and I was terrified.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.140
Five hours later, the resident
said to me, a woman your age

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.210
can't lose her
peripheral vision.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.670
I don't know what's
wrong with you.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.200
Probably just stress.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.930
I think you're going to be OK.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.960
But I was not OK, and I
knew that I would not be OK.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.170
And with those
words, he broke me.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.740
For two years-- two whole
years after that night--

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.220
I had repeat incidents
again, and again, and again.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.050
I called them wavy gravies.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.550
They'd come, and
I'd get tingles.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.390
I'd get lights.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.820
I'd get dizzy and cry.

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.860
And then a minute
later I was fine.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.320
And sometimes I had these
episodes up to 10 times a day.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.460
Here I was.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.360
I had a baby.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.170
I had a toddler.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.310
I had a new house.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.270
I had a business.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:18.230
And I had a husband who was
still working 80 hours a week.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:20.870
What I didn't have
was any support.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:22.670
I had no family anywhere nearby.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.860
I had just moved,
and I had no friends.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.690
I found somebody to
help with the kids,

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.000
but nobody to help with me.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.120
It never occurred to me.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.970
Doctors were frustrating
beyond belief.

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.070
They just couldn't tell
me what was wrong with me.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.110
They kept writing
me prescriptions,

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.020
and I kept refusing to take them
because they couldn't tell me

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.820
what was wrong with me, and
it was driving me insane!

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.250
But because I was taught
don't be a quitter,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.870
I kept going and going.

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.280
I kept going to work.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.390
I kept going home.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.840
I kept going through the
motions, all the while praying

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.050
that they would find a brain
tumor and just put me out

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.830
of my misery.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.690
And it's around then
I met my best friend.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.800
She was really sweet.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:18.680
She was always there for me,
and if I just needed a break

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.500
or something, she showed up.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.250
Always exactly what
I need her to be.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.840
Her name was food.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.190
Food has a way of
doing that, doesn't it?

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.930
It can be your confidant,
your best friend, your lover--

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:34.454
whatever you want it to be.

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:35.870
And for some people
it's not food.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:39.440
For some people, it's wine,
or shopping, or gambling.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.630
For me, food came
at the right time.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.900
I started thinking
about food all the time.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:46.820
Breakfast, I started
thinking about lunch.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.340
At lunch, I started
thinking about dinner.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.190
It became a source
of pleasure for me.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.110
It wasn't that I was
eating it all the time,

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.520
but I was thinking--

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.800
I was obsessing about
it all the time.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.920
It was like there was
an Instagram feed going

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.340
through my brain of
delicious yummy things

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.840
that I could dream about.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.550
It was pleasure.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:11.420
It was this fantasy world
in a world that seemed

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.040
too hard for me to deal with.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.820
I eventually got
tired of being tired.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.250
I got sick of being sick.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.520
I thought to myself,
there's no Web MD.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.600
There's no Google.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.850
I didn't think that then,
but I'm thinking that now.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.480
What am I going to do?

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.474
And then it occurred to me.

00:22:32.474 --> 00:22:33.920
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.020
We come up with
creative solutions.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.410
And so I took the matters
into my own hands,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:41.789
and I looked at
it like a project.

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:43.580
I started reading
books-- books, and books,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.996
and books on
anything that I could

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.730
find related to the topic.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.800
I looked at the prescriptions
that the doctors

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.870
had prescribed,
trying to understand

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:52.340
what it was that
they hadn't meant

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:54.320
to treat in the first place.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.550
Xanax?

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.230
What?

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.890
I was so confused.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.490
I researched family histories.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.550
Grandma had a nervous breakdown?

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.850
I was so confused, but I started
connecting dots, and connecting

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:11.240
more and more dots, and then
the craziest thing happened.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.610
Somebody told me there's
this weird thing that

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.940
happens called an ocular
migraine-- that you

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.250
get these flashing
lights and weird stuff.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:21.230
And so I started
reading about migraines.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.490
And in this one book about
migraines by Oliver Sacks,

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.750
it said people who get migraines
when they're adults sometimes

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.094
had stomachaches when
they were teenagers

00:23:32.094 --> 00:23:34.010
where they would get
very violent stomachaches

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:35.780
with vomiting.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.630
And I was like, oh my god!

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:43.520
The first mystery ever
of my life was solved.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.480
I called up my
parents screaming,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.670
and then I knew from that moment
that every single thing had

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:51.870
gone on in my body-- there
was an answer for it,

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:54.230
and I was going to find it.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:58.700
I started planning experiments,
and I figured it out.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.190
In my case, I had
severe exhaustion.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.020
Duh.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.060
I had crippling anxiety.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.600
Who know?

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.640
I always sucked it up.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.130
And this weird disposition to
migraines-- now, in my case,

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.980
it was ocular, abdominal.

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.270
I never even had a headache.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:19.250
But so now that I knew
what had gone wrong,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.260
how did I make it right?

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.250
There were no coaches.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:23.865
There were no books
on this stuff.

00:24:23.865 --> 00:24:26.150
There was no Google.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:32.330
And so I thought, I need to
just start experimenting.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:34.130
Of course I was
still going to work,

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.550
still taking care of my kids.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.540
And I started paying
attention to my own body.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.390
I started experimenting-- food,
and stress, and breathing,

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.070
and relaxation, and
positive thinking.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.820
And you name it, I paid
attention, and I experimented.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.290
I hacked it.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.589
Now, you'll notice I separated
sugar from food, because I

00:24:54.589 --> 00:24:55.880
don't think of sugar as a food.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.770
I think of sugar as a drug--

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.140
a very powerful drug.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.350
And I figured out that I kind
of needed to slow down and stop

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.390
being a super hero.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.550
Now, you might think
that's really obvious,

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:11.450
but it's never obvious
to ourselves, right?

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.360
It's obvious to
everyone around us.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.020
This was shocking for me.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.240
It never even occurred to me.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.190
And what a difference it made.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.980
Stopped getting
the wavy gravies.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.540
I had more energy, joy.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.820
I had a third baby.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.870
And it was finally time
for me, after 12 years,

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.810
to leave Lewtan Technologies.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.050
I continued my hacking,
and I continued my passion

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.610
with health and wellness.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.850
And eventually I said,
I'm going back to school.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.520
I studied holistic
nutrition, and I became

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.990
a health and lifestyle coach.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.940
But three months into
going back to school,

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.530
the strangest thing happened.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.240
Clients started showing up.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.460
They were successful,
powerful go getters.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.704
They were so smart, but they
didn't know how to relax.

00:26:02.704 --> 00:26:04.120
They didn't know
how to calm down.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.870
They didn't know how to take
care of themselves, in a way,

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.000
and thought they
might be burning out.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.280
Sound familiar?

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.862
And I understood it
in a way-- in a way

00:26:13.862 --> 00:26:15.570
that only somebody
that's gone through it

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.650
could really understand it.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.250
And so I started my company,
Healthy, Happy, Hip,

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.190
and I started offering
them courses, and retreats,

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.622
and all sorts of programs to
help people with this issue.

00:26:26.622 --> 00:26:28.830
And then I wrote this book,
"Busy, Stressed, and Food

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.560
Obsessed," so that I
could help more people.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.020
And I started
hosting a radio show

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:37.110
so I could interview other
health and wellness rock stars

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:39.735
and bring that knowledge
to my people, as well.

00:26:42.216 --> 00:26:44.090
Now, the name of the
book is "Busy, Stressed,

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.260
and Food Obsessed," but
you can fill in the blank.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:47.510
Are you wine obsessed?

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.070
Are you prescription
drug obsessed?

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:54.240
We all use these
things to distract.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.220
I didn't want to
think about my life,

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.320
and originally I
distracted with being busy.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.600
Later on, I
distracted with food.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.950
Many of us are distracting.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.470
What are you distracting with?

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:10.360
So how do you not
end up like me?

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.400
Don't do what I did.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.080
Don't ignore your warnings.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.790
Your body is talking to you.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.000
When something's wrong, it
means you need to listen,

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.240
or you'll end up
injured or sick.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.380
Don't live in stress
mode all the time.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.700
We're not supposed to do that.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.960
We need to bring it down.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.970
Take a break.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.530
Don't isolate yourself.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:35.800
Surround yourself
with friends, support,

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.500
and don't sacrifice that
fun and tranquility.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.590
It nourishes your soul in a
way that nothing else can.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.120
Connect your own dots.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:46.960
Investigate.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.860
What's going on in your life?

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.140
What's working for you?

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.610
What's not?

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.810
Do these experiments.

00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.850
What happens if I
eat differently?

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.020
What happens if I go to
bed a little bit earlier?

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.980
What happens if I remove
the sugar from my life?

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.540
And look inside.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.000
Look at your own baggage.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.700
I was holding onto that stuff.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.780
I'm not smart enough.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.210
I have to suck it up.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:11.230
I'm not a quitter.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.670
I want to be someone.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.650
I thought it was trying
to make my parents happy,

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.140
but it was my own stuff.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.950
In some ways, you guys
have it much easier now.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.840
You can work from anywhere.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.250
You've got role models.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.330
You've got mentors.

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.940
You've got this amazing
startup culture.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.690
You've got tools, and
apps, and coffee bars.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.580
It's really fun.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.060
But in a lot of ways
it's harder now.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:44.654
You've got social media
coming at you from everywhere.

00:28:44.654 --> 00:28:46.570
And the fact that you
can work from anywhere--

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.330
you're more reachable than ever.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:53.620
You guys-- you can't turn it
off for a minute, can you?

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.170
We live in this
frenetic, crazy culture.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:59.730
Everybody wants
instant gratification,

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.210
and we really don't know how to
turn off that adrenaline rush.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.590
But that is why it is
more important than ever

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:19.180
for you to slow down and listen
to what your body wants to say.

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:24.100
Let your body know that
it is not in danger.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:30.120
Let your body know that
you have a choice in how

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.720
you want to respond to this
environment that you are in.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.920
Don't be afraid of the feelings.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.420
I used to run as far as
I could away from them.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.318
Now I invite them to tea.

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.940
I listen.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.090
What are you here
to teach me today?

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.180
What can I learn from you today?

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.250
I know how hard it
is to bring it down,

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.150
and I designed a little one
minute tool for my clients

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.120
that I'm going to share
with you really quickly.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.670
If you have a phone
or a book, grab it.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.590
Anything rectangular will do.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.060
And you're going
to work with me.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.130
I'm going to give
you a quick demo.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:26.160
We're going to say
in, hold, out, hold.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.250
Touching something makes
a really big difference.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:36.735
In, hold, out, hold, and then
we're going to slow it down.

00:30:36.735 --> 00:30:46.100
In, hold, out, hold.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.680
And then we're going
to close our eyes

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.630
and say the words to ourselves.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.243
I'll demo it once, and then
you can all do it with me.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.700
That was roughly 30 seconds.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.750
Doing it for one minute
literally can bring your body

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.540
out of stress mode,
can clear your brain

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.930
and set you up for a
meditation practice.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:18.680
For those of you who did it,
did it take your mind away

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.270
for just a second?

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:23.930
The combination of the tactile
touch and the saying in,

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:27.260
hold, out to yourself
seems to work very well

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.700
for people who have trouble
quieting their brain.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:42.400
So in 2004, 18 years after we
started Lewtan Technologies,

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.320
we sold it.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.380
And I'm very grateful to say we
made a lot of money doing so.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.170
And I know that doesn't
always work out that way,

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.530
so I'm particularly
appreciative.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.210
Couple of years
later, Stuart went on

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.060
and founded another business,
another tech company

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.740
called Zintro.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.890
I went on, eventually
started my business,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:04.650
Healthy, Happy, and Hip.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.270
Two of my kids so far
work in tech already,

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.370
and my third is in
college, and she'll

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.260
end up in tech, too, no doubt--

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.020
maybe even here.

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.270
I'm not going to lie to you.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.640
I'm still really busy.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.110
I'm really busy, and I'm
doing a lot of cool things.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:25.780
And that overwork
kind of mentality--

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:27.550
it definitely creeps up--

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.700
that workaholic thing.

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.710
And I have to really
be careful about it,

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.740
but I'll never ever
go back to that place.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:39.070
I will never let myself ever
get back to that place--

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:43.600
that dark, dark place--
and I'll tell you why.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:49.570
Every single day, I take
time to look inside.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.780
I take time to slow down
to connect with my body,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.540
with my mind, with my
spirit, and ask them,

00:32:55.540 --> 00:33:00.510
what do you need to be OK?

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.380
And I listen.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.630
And when I need to rest,
I rest, and I fill my body

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.530
with the most wonderful,
highest quality foods

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.340
that I can get my hands on.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.150
And I don't obsess about
food anymore because I'm

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.000
filling my life with
joy, and with friendship,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.620
and all those yummy
things that nourish us.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.440
But the most important
lesson that I have learned--

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.360
the most important lesson that
I want to leave you with today--

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.910
is that I know
for sure that I am

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:43.490
and that I always
have been good enough.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:48.676
And so are you.

00:33:48.676 --> 00:33:51.146
Thank you.

00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:53.616
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:00.199
I'm happy to take any
questions if anybody has any.

00:34:00.199 --> 00:34:00.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:01.470
LISA LEWTAN: Hi.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:02.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming here and talking

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.750
about your book.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.120
I really look forward
to reading it.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.550
So yesterday, last
night, I told my wife,

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.460
oh, there is this person coming
who wrote an amazing book,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.230
and I looked up the
reviews on Amazon.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:15.750
And there's something
about sugar,

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.565
and food as an obsession,
and mindful eating,

00:34:18.565 --> 00:34:19.440
and blah, blah, blah.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.542
And she's like, oh,
that sounds interesting.

00:34:21.542 --> 00:34:22.500
What is the book about?

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.791
And I said, well, I don't know.

00:34:23.791 --> 00:34:24.690
I'll find out.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:29.010
So my question for you is,
when I meet family or friends

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.139
and I say, hey, I read
this amazing book,

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.659
I think you would also enjoy
it, and they say, that's great,

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:34.889
what is it about?

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.270
It's about?

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:37.290
How do you summarize it?

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.429
LISA LEWTAN: So that's
a great question,

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.239
and I really focused
on one part of the book

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:44.219
because I felt like
it was something

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:47.230
that you all could really
relate to really well-- this

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.389
busy, stressed.

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:52.350
And that's how I ended up
being in this field of health

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.520
and wellness.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.300
And the book shares a lot of my
personal stories and struggles,

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.930
but it gives you a
step by step strategy

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.600
for looking inside
and experimenting

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.830
with your own mind and body to
understand who am I as a person

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:10.350
and who am I as
an eater, and how

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.310
to experiment to find out what
is going to make you personally

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.600
thrive.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.610
Now, because I do
work a lot with food,

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.070
I did talk about food a
lot, but as I mentioned,

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:24.450
this could really apply
to just about anything.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:25.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:29.300
[APPLAUSE]
