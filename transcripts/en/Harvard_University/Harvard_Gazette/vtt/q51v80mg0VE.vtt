00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.880
When audiences come to see one of our

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.200
performances, they will see a fully

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.950
polished professional orchestra and the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.410
most gorgeous of Lowell House chandeliers

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.790
flanked by the one of the most

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.800
professional sets that Boston has to

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.010
offer. What they will not see is the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.869
intense behind-the-scene work that is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.090
done predominantly and foremost by the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.800
students of Harvard College.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000
Lowell House Opera is New England's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.920
longest-running opera company and it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.140
produces a fully staged opera once a

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.330
year in the wonderful setting of Lowell

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.180
House's beautiful dining hall.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.300
If you're putting on an opera with a regular opera

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.170
company, you sort of know who your

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.480
singers are going to be, you definitely

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.160
know who your orchestra is going to be. In this,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.059
we're almost reinventing every year.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.250
We hold auditions for the singers, we

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.809
have no idea who's going to show up;

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.729
volunteers from the community, from the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.259
student body, we have several faculty

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.479
members playing in the orchestra, and so,

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.789
you know, there's a lot of behind-the-

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.009
scenes work just to physically rehearse

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.220
this extremely difficult music.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.100
Before the show every night, we have to take out

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.910
all of the tables and chairs from the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.380
dining hall because everyone has been

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.690
eating dinner here, so we politely

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.580
ask everyone if they could leave and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.899
if they're still eating, we have a room

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.550
that they can go to, and we take all the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.500
tables and chairs out, set up all the

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
space for the orchestra and the audience,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.759
and then after the show is over and the

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.530
audience has left, we take everything back

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.360
in and set it back up again so people can

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.560
eat breakfast in the morning.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.979
This is Celeste, wonderful Celeste, her character is

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.650
kind of this very mystical purple and

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.770
silver nymph. Right now we're going in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.130
and I'm just creating this exaggerated

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.930
and fantastical look that looks great

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.369
when you're pretty far away from the

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.290
stage. So my main role has been publicity;

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.900
posters, invitations to literally the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.909
entire school, all of the Facebook stuff,

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.280
magazines, sending out press releases, and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.509
then I've also been doing some prop

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.759
stuff so I made this little thesis

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.280
binder for the composer and I've

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.480
been running around to find other

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.890
various things; there's some blue

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.329
lipstick back there, an inhaler, all

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.360
sorts of random things

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.900
that I've had to acquire. So basically the actors

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.000
are professionals, but then there's us

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.620
kind of running everything else.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.480
What's incredible about this opera is that it's

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.580
such an intersection of some of the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.310
most amazing artists in Boston and some

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.110
of the best talent in the performing

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.970
arts here at Harvard College, all of whom

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.980
do it for no money and all of whom do it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.320
purely out of a labor of love. And that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.270
intersection, I think, is really at the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.440
core of the learning experience for the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.810
students who get to see all limits,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.250
because they're so involved in the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.470
creative and logistical aspects that go

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.300
into making this professional opera.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.480
And so really seeing where you are as a

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.340
student and where you might see yourself

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.220
in the future, it gives A. a vision for us

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.989
to think, what could I do in this field?

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.820
But also say, how can I improve myself

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.980
in it and get better at contributing

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.989
to this field as best as I can. I'm hoping that

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.209
what we can advocate for as people leave

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940
Harvard is some of them will become

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.080
phenomenal musicians, some of them will

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.390
become amazing singers and have huge

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.200
careers, but many people will hopefully

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.930
leave with a love of the art form of

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.870
opera in a day when we see too many

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.330
opera houses closing down and too much

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.850
opera being aimed at an elite audience,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.540
and what we're trying to say is that

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.760
opera is something that is extremely

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.730
accessible and I think that's part of a

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.280
broad-based education.
