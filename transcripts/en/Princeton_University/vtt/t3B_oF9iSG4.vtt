00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.540
JOSHUA SHAEVITZ: We have
these intuitions for how

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.400
things work in the real world.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.160
They're all based on the
rules that science imposes

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.340
on matter and materials.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.470
And so making the connections
to the underlying science,

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.535
I think is very powerful.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.010
There isn't any
magic it turns out.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.170
It's all based on science.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.070
So we have our coffee molecules.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.430
The coffee molecules are going
faster than the air molecules.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.970
On average, they will be
imparting positive energy

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.340
to the air molecules.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.270
And that's going to
happen over and over.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.590
And so then on average,
you lose energy to the air

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.486
and you cool down the coffee.

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:48.750
The seminar sort of struck me
as a way of introducing science

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.550
to non-scientists.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.640
And I don't mean subject
matter exactly, oh,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.250
how does the ball
roll down hills,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.920
or why did chemical
reactions happen, but more

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.560
how science actually
works in the real world.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.290
Who decides what
science gets to be done?

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.610
Who funds science?

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.350
And that for
non-scientists, this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.650
was almost maybe more
important than understanding

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.450
a few nitty-gritty facts.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.211
ALICE XUE: I feel like classes
in high school are very focused

00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:17.460
and don't really teach you
what science is in general.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.430
Like, you might have a
chemistry class or a bio class,

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.640
but you might not know what
scientists nowadays are doing

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.299
or what methods they
used to figure out

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.090
those kinds of things
that you're learning.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.780
SYLVIE THODE: And
in this course,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.910
we have people from
sciences, politics.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.520
I think almost every realm,
we have a very, very diverse

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.200
group.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.350
And then Professor
Shaevitz brings it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.808
back to what we
were talking about.

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:39.120
I think that's a very important
aspect to have in that course.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.224
ALICE XUE: He sort of
wants to include everybody.

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:42.890
And I think it's very
interesting how it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.141
bridges all those disciplines.

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.140
HARRISON CERUTO: I think
Professor Shaevitz does

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.610
a good job
facilitating, you know,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.961
conversation, and
debate, and discourse.

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:51.210
But we're also still learning.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.960
And it's still a lesson.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.030
So I think it's a good kind
of back-and-forth environment.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.405
JOSHUA SHAEVITZ:
I wanted to have

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:58.380
them sort of engaged in
kind of a hands-on way

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.200
with various aspects of the
way science is really done.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.710
And one of the
major projects that

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.440
sort of has spanned
the entire semester

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.410
is a scientific proposal
to bust the myth.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.250
They had to choose a
common myth to, motivate

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.960
why it was an
interesting question,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.850
and discuss the
history of the myth,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.030
and to propose a
scientific experiment that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.200
will bust the myth, as the
MythBusters would say.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.580
And as part of the
semester-long process,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.460
we did a grant review panel,
which is part of the way

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.370
that we, as a society,
decide what science

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.970
gets focused on or done.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.240
So I think that in many
ways connects really

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.876
to the way that we as scientists
do things in the real world.

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:41.735
SPEAKER 1: This is a good one.

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:42.610
SPEAKER 2: Thank you.

00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:50.220
SPEAKER 3: Oh, it looks
cool from the bottom.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.130
SYLVIE THODE: So my proposal
is on whether or not

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.280
the house in the Disney Pixar
movie "Up" could actually fly.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.620
I proposed building a scale
model and then seeing

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.380
if you could lift the
house of the model

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.755
with normal-sized
party balloons.

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:03.671
And when I was doing
research for my proposal,

00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.630
there's this whole new
theory about these giant,

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.540
giant balloons.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.510
The theory is that you
could lift something

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.920
like a plane that's fallen.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.110
You have real-life
applications for this idea

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.610
of lifting something heavy.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.132
And it sounds very
simple, but it's

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:17.340
applicable in the real world.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.990
And I think just
by doing research,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.970
even though this one is a
little bit whimsical,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.220
it just gives you more
information on that subject.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.120
JOSHUA SHAEVITZ: My real hope
is that we can in some small way

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.430
just change the way
the public thinks

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.330
about science, scientists,
and the scientific endeavor.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.080
The ability of the public
to critically analyze

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.000
some of this information
on their own,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.630
where did it come from, can
they look in a little deeper,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.420
how can they compare different
types of information that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.550
are coming from opposite
sides of the spectrum

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.520
in the public sphere, that's
something that I really think

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.040
is important and
doesn't happen much.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.000
SYLVIE THODE: When I see
things in the news that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.500
has to do with science
or something like that,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.442
now I can sort of read it and be
able to glean more out of what

00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:00.150
they're saying, because
I've been exposed

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.358
to scientific writing and
the scientific methods that

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:03.180
are often used.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.410
HARRISON CERUTO: There is
a purpose beyond science.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.890
You know, we'll never know
when we need something.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.860
Twenty years from now
that research could

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.780
lead to some groundbreaking
cure for a disease

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.832
or some new innovation designs.

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:13.290
JOSHUA SHAEVITZ:
What we're partly doing

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.529
is we're trying
to link sociology

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.790
and the way governments and
economics works with the way

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.420
science is done, the way things
have been discussed in history.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.480
We had some nice lectures
on historical perspectives

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.480
about evidence, and science,
and mythological uses of myth.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.980
Bringing these
connections together,

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.550
I think, takes what could be a
disparate set of broad topics

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.280
as a liberal arts education
and puts them together

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.230
into a real, synthesized
view of human knowledge

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.930
and human behavior
and existence.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.280
