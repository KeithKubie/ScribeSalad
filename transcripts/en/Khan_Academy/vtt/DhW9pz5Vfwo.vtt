00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:02.359
Voiceover:The three points plotted below

00:00:02.359 --> 00:00:05.022
are on the graph of y is
equal to b to the x power.

00:00:05.022 --> 00:00:07.245
Based only on these three points,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.692
plot the three corresponding points

00:00:09.692 --> 00:00:11.095
that must be on the graph

00:00:11.095 --> 00:00:13.390
of y is equal to log base b of x

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.811
by clicking on the graph.

00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.835
I've actually copy and pasted this problem

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:19.812
on my little scratch
pad so I can mark it up

00:00:19.812 --> 00:00:20.576
a little bit.

00:00:20.576 --> 00:00:22.615
What is this first function?

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:24.845
This first function is telling us

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:31.349
so x, and this is y is
equal to b to the x power.

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.209
When x is equal to
zero, y is equal to one.

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.003
That's this point right over here.

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:44.188
When x is equal to one, b to the one power

00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:46.273
or b to the first power is equal to four.

00:00:46.273 --> 00:00:48.414
y is equal to four.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.956
Another way of thinking of this

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:54.204
y or four is equal to b to the first power

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:56.576
and actually we can do
[said] must be four.

00:00:56.576 --> 00:00:58.719
That's this point right over there.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.741
This point is telling us
that b to the second power

00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:04.170
is equal to 16.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.737
When x is equal to two,

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:09.103
b to the second power, y is equal to 16.

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:12.719
Now we want to plot the
three corresponding points

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.872
on this function.

00:01:13.872 --> 00:01:16.112
Let me draw another table here.

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:19.234
Now it's essentially the inverse function

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:20.808
where this is going to be x

00:01:20.808 --> 00:01:26.648
and we want to calculate y
is equal to log base b of x.

00:01:28.094 --> 00:01:30.106
What are the possibilities here?

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:31.877
What I want to do is think ...

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:33.604
Let's take these values

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:36.494
because these are
essentially inverse functions

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:38.663
log is the inverse of exponents.

00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:49.038
If we take the points one, four, and 16.

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:53.592
What is y going to be here?

00:01:53.592 --> 00:01:59.424
y is going to be log base b of one.

00:01:59.424 --> 00:02:02.494
This is saying what power
I need to raise b to

00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:03.636
to get to one.

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:05.651
If we assume that b is non zero

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:06.974
and that's a reasonable assumption

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:09.328
because b to different
powers are non zero,

00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:13.965
this is going to be
zero for any non zero b.

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:16.760
This is going to be zero
right there, over here.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.542
We have the point one comma zero,

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:19.928
so it's that point over there.

00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:22.159
Notice this point
corresponds to this point,

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.022
we have essentially
swapped the x's and y's.

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:26.577
In general when you're taking an inverse

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:32.398
you're going to reflect over
the line, y is equal to x

00:02:32.398 --> 00:02:34.884
and this is clearly
reflection over that line.

00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:36.566
Now let's look over here,

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:40.616
when x is equal to four
what is log base b of four.

00:02:40.616 --> 00:02:42.811
What is the power I need to raise b to

00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:43.973
to get to four.

00:02:43.973 --> 00:02:45.232
We see right over here,

00:02:45.232 --> 00:02:47.642
b to the first power is equal to four.

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:49.093
We already figured that out,

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:51.775
when I take b to the first
power is equal to four.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:55.195
This right over here is
going to be equal to one.

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:59.623
When x is equal to
four, y is equal to one.

00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:02.564
Notice once again, it is
a reflection over the line

00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:04.041
y is equal to x.

00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:09.214
When x is equal to 16

00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.956
then y is equal to log base b of 16.

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:18.186
The power I need to
raise b to, to get to 16.

00:03:18.186 --> 00:03:19.400
Well we already know,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.341
if we take b squared, we get to 16,

00:03:22.341 --> 00:03:24.475
so this is equal to two.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:28.830
When x is equal to 16, y is equal to two.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.503
Notice we essentially just
swapped the x and y values

00:03:31.503 --> 00:03:33.151
for each of these points.

00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:34.669
This is y, this is a reflection

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.423
over the line y is equal to x.

00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:40.816
Now, let's actually do that
on the actual interface.

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:43.167
The whole reason is to
give you this appreciation

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:45.090
that these are inverse
functions of each other.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.710
Let's plot the points.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.030
That point corresponded to that point,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.721
so x zero, y one

00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.710
corresponds to x one, y zero.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.697
Here x is one, y is four

00:03:56.697 --> 00:03:58.902
that corresponds to x four, y one.

00:03:58.902 --> 00:04:01.378
Here x is two, y is 16

00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:06.262
that corresponds to x 16, y is two.

00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:08.352
We got it right.
