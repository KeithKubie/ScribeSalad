00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.519
It’s never been possible to predict the
course of an actor’s career years in advance,

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.660
but these days, blockbuster franchises can
turn the unlikeliest men and women into certified

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.840
action stars.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.140
No one expected to see the lovable Chris Pratt
make the leap from Parks and Rec to the buff

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.570
star of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy
and Jurassic World.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.500
But he’s just the latest in the long line
of actors who have transition from comedy

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.619
or drama to blockbuster action, and never
looked back.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.180
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Unlikely Action
Movie Stars.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
Will Smith

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.242
The Fresh Prince got his start rockin’ the
house in one corner of his homebase in the

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:40.000
late 1980s before landing his own TV show.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.310
Known more for his comedy skills, he wasn’t
exactly the type of actor you expect to go

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.239
see guns blazing against a backdrop of explosions
and mayhem.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.860
But 1995 saw him teaming up with Michael Bay
and Martin Lawrence for Bad Boys, and he’s

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
kept up his action chops ever since with films
like &nbsp;Independence Day, Wild, Wild, West,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.649
I Am Legend, I, Robot and the upcoming Suicide
Squad.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.990
But no matter what, he’ll always be Uncle
Phil’s troublemaking nephew to us.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.990
Kate Beckinsale

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.740
After starting her career in the UK in the
early 1990s, Kate Beckinsale managed to leverage

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.610
the exposure she enjoyed in Kenneth Branagh’s
Much Ado About Nothing into roles in films

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.860
like The Last Days of Disco, and 2001’s
Pearl Harbor.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.369
But Beckinsale did away with her celebrity
persona to star as the gun-wielding vampire

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.009
‘Selene’ in Underworld, a slick Gothic
actioner that ballooned into a four-film franchise.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.619
She hasn’t made a habit of appearing in
many action films since, but seeing her show

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.979
up in films like Total Recall always reminds
us she has just as much action experience

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.229
as her male co-stars.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.229
Matt Damon

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.719
Starring in 1997’s Good Will Hunting – and
earning an Oscar for writing it, too – Matt

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.190
Damon was immediately cemented as an award
level talent on the rise.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.000
Roles soon followed in other acclaimed, high-profile
dramas like Saving Private Ryan and The Talented

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Mr. Ripley.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.690
But a few years later, Damon decided to try
something outside his comfort zone: the role

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.980
of CIA Assassin Jason Bourne.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.180
Today, Damon still A-lists with the best of
them, but when he’s not starring in pictures

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.200
like True Grit, and The Departed, he’s more
than happy to sling guns in films like Elysium.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Zoe Saldana

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.940
Having practically cornered the market on
mainstream sci-fi these days, with turns in

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.480
James Cameron’s Avatar and J.J. Abrams’
Star Trek, it’s tempting to forget Zoe Saldana’s

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.200
skills in big screen action, as well.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.510
The Losers and Colombiana didn’t set the
movie world on fire, but the actress showed

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.980
how just capable she is when the bullets and
blades start flying.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.610
As Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy, Saldana
reaffirmed her penchant for playing lethal,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.610
morally grey anti-heroines.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:40.610
However, her early filmography betrays her
contemporary interests: Drumline, Center Stage,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.610
and a supporting role in Britney Spears’
Crossroads aren’t exactly early indicators

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.610
of a late-stage turn toward kicking ass, but
Saldana pulled it off all the same.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.610
Bruce Willis

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.819
Bruce Willis is practically the definition
of “action hero” these days, having established

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.090
himself as one of the biggest action stars
of all time with the Die Hard series and a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.440
slew of films ranging from The Fifth Element
to The Last Boy Scout.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.850
But Willis’ made his name in comedic films
and TV shows like Blind Date and Moonlighting.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.220
Even after Die Hard 2 hit theaters, Willis
would appear in comedies like Death Becomes

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.320
Her and Bonfire of the Vanities.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.110
Today, it’s almost impossible to distinguish
him from his action persona, but there was

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.470
a time when the very idea of putting Willis
in such a film would have been laughable.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.470
Nicolas Cage

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.510
It’s easy to imagine a world where Nicholas
Cage never starred in The Rock , Con Air,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.080
or Face/Off –instead focusing on more comedies
like Raising Arizona, Fast Times at Ridgemont

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.239
High, and Vampire’s Kiss (among many, many
others).

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.020
But The Rock secured Cage’s name in the
realm of big screen action above all other

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.020
genres.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.939
Even today, he’s sure to show up in the
odd Kick-Ass, Ghost Rider or Drive Angry alongside

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:43.030
indie films like Joe, eclectic offerings like
Adaptation, or thrillers like Matchstick Men.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.190
There was a time when action films were his
bread and butter, but now it’s best to forget

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.190
about designations like “action star”
or “comic actor” altogether.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.190
Uma Thurman

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:56.400
Uma Thurman first began her professional career
as a model, but she cut the indelible image

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.350
of Beatrix Kiddo into audiences’ brains
at the end of a Hanzo sword with both of Quentin

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.439
Tarantino’s Kill Bill films.

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.159
Hard to imagine her on the catwalk when she
seemed so at ease lopping off limbs and plucking

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.390
out eyeballs.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.730
Yet there was once a time when Thurman wasn’t
a vengeance-fueled martial arts master.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.239
She played Venus in Terry Gilliam’s The
Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and helped

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.710
Timothy Hutton get his life back on track
in Beautiful Girls.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.915
No wonder her transformation into a hardened
killer (and desperate mother) for Tarantino’s

00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:20.690
violent homage to kung fu and Western cinema
took viewers by surprise.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.690
Keanu Reeves

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.590
Starring in Speed, The Matrix and its subsequent
sequels made Keanu a fixture in action cinema

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.290
for all time, with his most famous lines as
the mystical Neo now summing up his entire

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.290
career.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.409
Before all that, though, viewers knew Reeves
for his laid back surfer dude persona, and

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.660
his early history with teen films and dark
comedies.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.529
Reeves didn’t look, act, or sound like an
action hero – but when he packed on the

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.899
pounds and shed his hair for Speed in 1993,
he wound up assuming that mantle anyways.

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:48.280
To this day, Reeves continues taking on non-action
oriented projects – like The Lake House,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.020
Side by Side, and A Scanner Darkly – but
hard-hitting action films like John Wick and

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.330
Man of Tai Chi keep his action cred intact.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.409
Scarlett Johansson

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.160
The once and future Black Widow first drew
wide notice for her talents in another comic

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.440
book movie: the low-scale indie film Ghost
World, and earned even more praise years later

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.290
for her performances in Lost in Translation
and The Girl with the Pearl Earring.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.140
Johansson started dabbling in action in Michael
Bay’s 2005 film The Island, but in 2010,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.500
she became part of the Marvel family with
Iron Man 2, going from small supporting roles

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.669
to blockbuster notoriety.

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.091
Now, she’s making a name for herself as
a full-blown action heroine – not only in

00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:31.919
The Avengers and Captain America: The Winter
Soldier, but even a starring role in Luc Besson’s

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:32.919
Lucy.

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.919
Liam Neeson

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.180
This towering Irish actor busted a skull or
two in his day before ever bringing his particular

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.330
set of skills to the Taken series, limited
to supporting roles in Excalibur and Krull.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.570
But Neeson defined himself as a dramatic actor
through his work in projects like The Mission,

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.130
Michael Collins, and Schindler’s List.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.220
His gravitas was undeniable.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.560
Now, he sports a chip on his shoulder that
fuels his pummeling of European thugs (Taken),

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.640
and parachuting a tank out of an airplane
(the A-Team).

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.730
It seems that Rob Roy has gone from fighting
English aristocrats to wrestling wolves.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.399
Whatever fueled the shift of genres, it’s
working – and action fans get to reap the

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.399
benefits.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.399
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:15.080
Did we miss any actors or actresses who defied
the odds to become believable action stars?
