00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.330
I'm sure all of us use, routinely,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.380
services on the internet such as email through

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.230
Google or Yahoo. And perhaps purchase things

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.490
using eBay or make orders for airline reservations

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.440
and so on. And when we do that, we think of an enterprise that we are accessing

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:25.370
from our work station or laptop or personal mobile device. We think of an

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.469
enterprise as a monolithic entity. But, in

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.082
fact, if you look inside the enterprise, the

00:00:31.082 --> 00:00:34.030
enterprise, the intra enterprise view, is pretty

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.065
complicated. There's a whole bunch of services and

00:00:37.065 --> 00:00:39.665
servers that are interconnected, there may be

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.565
marketing division, the sales division, the production division,

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:47.220
inventory division, the research division, and so on.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.830
All of these constitute what an enterprise is.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.030
So internally the view of the enterprise is much

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.550
more complex than what you see from the outside

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.450
coming in and using services provided by a particular

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.650
enterprise. Things get a lot more complicated in this day

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.640
and age because when we access an enterprise, in

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.920
fact, the enterprises, they talk to one another. And

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.320
this is, what is usually called a supply chain

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.260
model, and so on. Where, the service that you are,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.800
requesting may not be serviced by, a single entity but may actually involve the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.630
entity that you're contacting, contacting other entities

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.110
in order to. Put together a solution for

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.690
a particular request, and what is even

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.360
more challenging is when enterprises merge. For instance,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.530
if three companies merge together, and this

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.290
happened a while back. There's a company called

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.350
Digital Equipment Corporation that got bought out by

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.650
Compaq and those two merged, and later on

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.815
HP bought out Compaq. And so you can see, that when things like this happen, the

00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:57.400
inter-enterprise view is much more complex. And now

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.820
when companies merge like this, the idea of

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.010
an enterprise, the idea of an enterprise, becomes

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.000
an amalgam of three different entities coming together,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.780
in this example for instance. So

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.310
the enterprise transformation challenges are many: interoperability

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.770
of the systems that constitute different

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.960
enterprises, interface compatibility when such merging happens,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.540
system evolution. You know, things are

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.620
not stagnant, now this transformed enterprise has

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.480
to continuously evolve as well. Scalability,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.400
reliability and the cost of maintaining a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.780
complex system like that. All of these things are the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.450
challenges that have to be faced both internally and across enterprises.
