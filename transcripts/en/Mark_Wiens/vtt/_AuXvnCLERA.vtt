00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:04.302
- This meal of eating all
together is called a Botram

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:07.553
and it helps to kind of
lean over so you can get

00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:09.699
a lot of food into your mouth.

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:14.134
(speaking foreign language)

00:00:14.134 --> 00:00:16.563
The flavors are just insane.

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:19.146
(island music)

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.886
Good morning everyone its Mark
Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:30.650
in Jakarta, Indonesia.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.640
Today Ken and Gratia
have invited Ying and I

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.207
to go on a family trip with
them to a place called Punchak.

00:00:39.207 --> 00:00:42.374
(inspirational music)

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:53.233
We are driving towards Bogor,

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:57.784
which is about 30 minutes to
an hour depending on traffic

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:00.279
but this morning, traffic
looks pretty light,

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.348
so we should be there pretty soon.

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:05.515
(inspirational music)

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:19.945
Made it to Bogor and we kind
of drove through the city

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.636
to the other side and
we're still in the city

00:01:22.636 --> 00:01:25.074
but it feels like countryside here

00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:27.294
and our first stop we are at a place

00:01:27.294 --> 00:01:30.089
that serves Laksa Bogor.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.672
Oh not noodle okay.

00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:34.053
- Rice noodle.

00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:36.946
- [Mark] Rice noodle okay.

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:39.613
- [Man] And it's been fermented.

00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:46.815
- So she puts rice, cakes
in the bottom of the bowl

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:51.645
and then a bunch of bean
sprouts and then rice noodles

00:01:51.645 --> 00:01:53.212
and then after that.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.617
Also that's the Laksa curry sauce.

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:58.281
It looks very thick.

00:01:58.281 --> 00:01:59.938
That looks awesome.

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:02.236
Oh I think I can smell some ginger

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:04.455
and maybe tumeric in there.

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:06.622
That steam smells amazing.

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:10.378
(engines whirring)

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.348
I got my bowl of Laksa Bogor

00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:17.368
and there are actually
rice cakes on the bottom

00:02:17.368 --> 00:02:19.869
plus the noodles and
then she added in a bunch

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:21.598
of bean sprouts and some vegetables

00:02:21.598 --> 00:02:24.153
and then she topped it
with some other seasonings

00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:27.854
and then added in the curry sauce and then

00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:32.747
on the top is some shredded
coconut, which has been,

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:33.785
it's been cooked, stir-fried?

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:35.368
Oh deep fried okay.

00:02:42.253 --> 00:02:44.386
Oh that is wonderful.

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:48.219
It has a really fragrant
ginger, maybe ginger,

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:52.428
and lemongrass kind of flavor to it

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:53.868
and then also that coconut.

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:56.523
The coconut really comes in nicely.

00:02:56.523 --> 00:02:57.716
Oh that's nice.

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:02.137
It's kind of a, kind of
like a sweet herbal flavor.

00:03:02.137 --> 00:03:04.718
Okay they also have some
Sambal, which you can add.

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:07.551
I'm gonna try some of this Sambal.

00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:15.006
And I think that is
rice cake on this bite.

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.912
Mmmm, yeah that is a
spicy Sambal actually.

00:03:25.398 --> 00:03:26.231
Oh yeah.

00:03:27.338 --> 00:03:29.386
It is spicy and a little bit sour

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:32.787
and it's very popular to eat
the Krupuk, which are crackers

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:36.579
with the curry and so I have
reached the bottom of the bowl

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.288
and you can dip it into
all that rich coconut milk

00:03:40.288 --> 00:03:41.288
curry sauce.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.602
Oh that is good.

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:49.506
The cracker is really crispy

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:53.673
but then it just kind of soaks
up all of that curry sauce.

00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:59.244
That was really good and a
much different type of Laksa,

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:01.439
a much different mixture of ingredients

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.363
than any other type of Laksa
I've ever had in Malaysia

00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:05.593
or Singapore.

00:04:05.593 --> 00:04:06.426
Hello.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:12.207
We just drove down the
street just a couple minutes

00:04:12.207 --> 00:04:15.390
and we are at our next
food stop, which serves,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.217
it's called Toge Goreng,
which is fried bean sprouts

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:23.984
but it is some kind of interesting
dish that is very famous

00:04:23.984 --> 00:04:25.317
from right here.

00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:30.532
They are cooking over a wood fire

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:34.294
and then there is a big
bowl full of bean sprouts.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:38.127
Okay so he first grabs
some, oh some rice cake

00:04:44.681 --> 00:04:46.093
and then he's gonna go in for some,

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:47.434
he chooses some of the bean sprouts

00:04:47.434 --> 00:04:50.221
from the boiling water
there so he puts them

00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:51.823
onto the rice cakes.

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:54.493
Oh and then he's just
grabbing a handful of noodles,

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:58.952
just quickly blanching them
and then into the bowl.

00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:02.202
And then he dumps out all of the water.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.449
And then on, I think that's some tofu

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.221
and then he goes on with some,
I think it's soybean sauce.

00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:13.957
Oh and something in a Heineken bottle.

00:05:13.957 --> 00:05:16.387
These guys are so good at what they do

00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:18.485
that I bet they could
make this entire dish

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.703
with their eyes closed.

00:05:19.703 --> 00:05:23.196
They do it so rhythmically
and so expertly.

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:25.950
I just got my bowl of the dish

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.834
and although the name
is fried bean sprouts,

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:31.044
it's actually not fried at all,

00:05:31.044 --> 00:05:34.013
it's boiled bean sprouts or
just blanched bean sprouts

00:05:34.013 --> 00:05:34.846
with a bunch of different ingredients.

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:38.445
And then they also served
some Sambal in the spoon

00:05:38.445 --> 00:05:41.701
so I will just sort of mix it around.

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.685
I guess I gotta, I gotta try
some of those bean sprouts

00:05:43.685 --> 00:05:45.852
and some of the rice cake.

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:51.150
Mmmmmm, oh yeah.

00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:56.034
That has a very unique flavor.

00:05:56.034 --> 00:05:59.202
I think from that fermented bean sauce.

00:05:59.202 --> 00:06:02.155
Yeah it has a little bit of
a fermented flavor to it,

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:05.238
definitely, kind of, not quite cheese

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.625
but starting to get to the cheese flavor

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.749
and then it's kind of sweet
and salty at the same time

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:12.582
as well.

00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:14.863
And then those bean
sprouts are really crisp

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:17.681
but then you've got
pieces of soft rice cake

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:20.014
and silky soft tofu as well.

00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:30.842
That's a very interesting
mix and a lot of textures

00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:32.252
going on.

00:06:32.252 --> 00:06:33.793
Definitely the key to that dish

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.700
is the fermented soybean sauce.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.127
That's where most of the
flavor was coming from

00:06:38.127 --> 00:06:40.146
and they said that they grill the soybeans

00:06:40.146 --> 00:06:41.970
right here in this area.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.163
That's where all the flavor was

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:45.061
and then the beansprouts
and the other tofu

00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:47.646
and the rice cakes just
kind of give it some body

00:06:47.646 --> 00:06:49.676
and some texture.

00:06:49.676 --> 00:06:52.843
(inspirational music)

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:12.693
Hello.

00:07:12.693 --> 00:07:16.860
We have just arrived to the
country home in the rice fields

00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:21.237
and this is where we're gonna
spend I think most of the day

00:07:21.237 --> 00:07:24.399
just relaxing here and
enjoying the countryside.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:25.285
It's really beautiful.

00:07:25.285 --> 00:07:27.952
We are in the rice paddy fields.

00:07:29.706 --> 00:07:31.377
Oh I didn't even know.

00:07:31.377 --> 00:07:32.664
This is a Durian tree.

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:35.167
I'm standing right
underneath a Durian Tree.

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:36.620
I was just walking around.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.759
I didn't even realize I
was standing underneath

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:39.926
a Durian tree.

00:07:43.073 --> 00:07:46.573
(clucking and chattering)

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:50.600
- [Man] The round one is Misro.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.433
- [Mark] Misro.

00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:52.700
- [Man] The long one is Combro.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.533
- Combro.

00:07:55.325 --> 00:07:59.408
And it's deep fried some
kind of cassava fritter.

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:04.356
Mmmmm.

00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:11.610
That is really crispy and then
kind of gooey in the inside

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.777
and then in the middle is
I think it's soybean right?

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.763
It looks like minced meat
but it's actually soybean.

00:08:19.763 --> 00:08:20.596
Oh that's delicious.

00:08:20.596 --> 00:08:24.763
This one is supposed to be
the sweet one called Misro.

00:08:28.032 --> 00:08:30.331
It tastes kind of like
honey but it's palm sugar.

00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:33.477
And now having some coconut
water and coconut meat

00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:34.515
straight from the coconuts.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:37.395
These are young coconuts,
so the meat is very soft.

00:08:37.395 --> 00:08:39.432
And I think these came from a tree right

00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:41.265
around here somewhere.

00:08:47.065 --> 00:08:49.796
Coconut is one of the
greatest things in the world.

00:08:49.796 --> 00:08:53.963
Oh that's just pure buttery
coconut and it's not too sweet,

00:08:55.938 --> 00:08:57.771
but so creamy buttery.

00:08:59.369 --> 00:09:00.786
Oh man it's good.

00:09:04.164 --> 00:09:07.900
And that coconut meat is so
young that it just dissolves

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.223
as you eat it.

00:09:09.223 --> 00:09:10.812
I am loving this place.

00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:12.559
It is a fruit paradise.

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:14.864
There are rice fields but then
surrounding the rice fields,

00:09:14.864 --> 00:09:17.929
there are Durian trees,
there are guava trees,

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:21.929
banana trees, there are
I think a Rambutan tree.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.559
What else did I see?

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:27.944
There are some berries,
unidentified berries,

00:09:27.944 --> 00:09:30.008
but lots and lots of fruit.

00:09:30.008 --> 00:09:34.175
This is a beautiful little
jungle, rice paddy paradise here.

00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.631
And I think we are on our
way now to go to a place

00:09:38.631 --> 00:09:41.298
where they are harvesting honey.

00:09:42.775 --> 00:09:45.692
(mysterious music)

00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:51.683
we just took about a 15
minute drive from the house

00:09:51.683 --> 00:09:55.291
to an area that is home to a bee farm

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.965
and this area is famous for honey.

00:09:57.965 --> 00:10:00.882
(mysterious music)

00:10:08.788 --> 00:10:10.492
At first we walked through the village

00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:13.897
but now we are really getting
out here into the rice paddies

00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:15.921
and into the mountains in a valley.

00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:18.917
It is gorgeous walking passed the river.

00:10:18.917 --> 00:10:20.000
Hello, hello.

00:10:23.959 --> 00:10:26.185
Lots of friendly people.

00:10:26.185 --> 00:10:30.328
Yeah, wow and even the air is much cooler

00:10:30.328 --> 00:10:32.565
and not nearly as humid.

00:10:32.565 --> 00:10:35.465
There is a mountain breeze.

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:36.715
I am loving it.

00:10:37.648 --> 00:10:41.815
- The food will taste so
much better after the walk.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.013
- Oh wow.

00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:53.351
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:59.111 --> 00:11:01.528
(chattering)

00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:36.701
We got a good look at the
bees but unfortunately

00:11:36.701 --> 00:11:39.368
is not here, whoa there's a bee.

00:11:46.291 --> 00:11:47.754
We made it back to the village.

00:11:47.754 --> 00:11:50.110
I think we're gonna drive
back to the house now

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.739
and I think it's time for lunch.

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:54.156
(chattering)

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:14.991
We just arrived back to the house

00:12:14.991 --> 00:12:19.257
and we are sitting down
for a Sundanese feast,

00:12:19.257 --> 00:12:21.376
which is food from this region.

00:12:21.376 --> 00:12:25.353
This meal of eating
altogether is called a Botram

00:12:25.353 --> 00:12:28.334
and they put down a couple banana leaves

00:12:28.334 --> 00:12:31.925
and then spread rice out
into the entire middle

00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:34.740
just filling the middle of the banana leaf

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.731
and then there are side dished all around.

00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:38.275
This is incredible.

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:40.055
So all the rice is here in the middle.

00:12:40.055 --> 00:12:44.222
So you can grab some rice
to put onto your portion of,

00:12:45.268 --> 00:12:47.820
my portion of the banana leaf right here.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.682
And I just took a couple
of, these are Jengkol beans,

00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:52.415
which are similar to stink beans

00:12:52.415 --> 00:12:54.243
and I really love Jengkol beans,

00:12:54.243 --> 00:12:57.981
I'm gonna take a bite of that immediately.

00:12:57.981 --> 00:13:00.629
Oh she is serving me some
of the banana blossom,

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:02.296
banana flower curry.

00:13:10.608 --> 00:13:11.858
I love Jengkol.

00:13:13.475 --> 00:13:15.639
That's like a giant stink bean.

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:17.728
Because it's cooked it is
kind of a sticky texture.

00:13:17.728 --> 00:13:20.264
If you eat them raw, they are crisp.

00:13:20.264 --> 00:13:22.366
Oh man, that is marvelous.

00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:23.611
How is it man?

00:13:23.611 --> 00:13:25.409
- Jengkol is one of the
best things on earth.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:27.034
- [Mark] Yeah I agree.

00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:31.034
- When people say it is
stinky, I don't get why.

00:13:32.119 --> 00:13:35.459
- This is the banana
blossom with some shrimp.

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:37.361
Oh and that rice is really good as well.

00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:38.440
That rice.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.872
There are little fish.

00:13:39.872 --> 00:13:42.117
I don't know if you can see,
but there are little fried fish

00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:44.207
all mixed in with the rice.

00:13:44.207 --> 00:13:48.374
And that gives it a really
wonderful fish fragrance.

00:13:55.082 --> 00:13:57.832
Dude this food, oh thank you man.

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.079
I'm gonna grab some of this Sambal.

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:10.912
Oh yeah.

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:14.652
Oh pea eggplants okay.

00:14:19.962 --> 00:14:22.797
The way the rice is
prepared with bay leaves

00:14:22.797 --> 00:14:25.794
and with spices and is there
coconut milk in there too?

00:14:25.794 --> 00:14:26.627
- [Man] No, no.

00:14:26.627 --> 00:14:27.460
- No coconut milk.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.866
Okay so it's just spices
and herbs inside the rice.

00:14:30.866 --> 00:14:32.994
It's called (speaks in foreign language)

00:14:32.994 --> 00:14:36.699
and oh yeah and that's with
the dried fish as well.

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:38.967
The crispy, little crispy dried fish

00:14:38.967 --> 00:14:41.707
and this entire meal is ridiculously good.

00:14:41.707 --> 00:14:43.379
I've got so many things going on.

00:14:43.379 --> 00:14:47.571
I dug into this piece of grilled chicken.

00:14:47.571 --> 00:14:51.245
There is a fried catfish
and so many different types

00:14:51.245 --> 00:14:52.745
of Sambal as well.

00:14:53.944 --> 00:14:56.481
Oh man it's just insanely good.

00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:59.926
This is a Sambal with
chilis and there are little,

00:14:59.926 --> 00:15:03.395
there are little pieces of
stink bean in here as well.

00:15:03.395 --> 00:15:06.215
And it's just extraordinary flavors.

00:15:06.215 --> 00:15:08.282
And it helps to kind of lean over

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:12.032
so you can get a lot of
food into your mouth.

00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:17.401
The flavors are just insane.

00:15:19.408 --> 00:15:20.948
I just got this little fried eel.

00:15:20.948 --> 00:15:24.329
It looks like a little
cobra and it's curled up

00:15:24.329 --> 00:15:26.654
and it's deep fried and
I will add some of this,

00:15:26.654 --> 00:15:30.487
this stinky bean Sambal,
which is really good.

00:15:34.694 --> 00:15:38.027
Alright, maybe I will break him in half.

00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:42.095
Oh yeah it's just solidly crispy.

00:15:42.095 --> 00:15:44.178
I'll eat that head first.

00:15:50.049 --> 00:15:53.469
Mmmm, yeah it's just solidly deep fried.

00:15:53.469 --> 00:15:57.942
It's crispy and then all that
flavor is in that Sambal.

00:15:57.942 --> 00:16:01.692
Oh that's spicy, slightly
stinky bean flavor.

00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:03.864
It's wondrous.

00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:05.403
The food is so incredibly good.

00:16:05.403 --> 00:16:08.049
The Jengkol beans in particular,
actually everything is good

00:16:08.049 --> 00:16:12.216
but the Jengkol beans are
just unbelievable actually.

00:16:18.947 --> 00:16:22.445
I just stood up to wash my
hands and I didn't realize

00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:25.058
how full I was sitting down leaning over

00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:27.749
but when I stand up, oh man.

00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:29.249
I am feeling full.

00:16:30.692 --> 00:16:34.185
And I'm soothing myself
now with another cup

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:36.102
of fresh coconut water.

00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:43.841
Oh man, that was seriously
one of the most remarkable

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:50.332
meals both the food flavor
and also the atmosphere

00:16:50.332 --> 00:16:53.794
and the style of eating
with the entire family.

00:16:53.794 --> 00:16:57.877
This has just been an
incredible meal experience.

00:16:58.955 --> 00:17:02.734
When you're eating off of
a communal leaf like that,

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:06.050
you never, you can't really
tell how much food you ate

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.270
until you're stuffed
because there is no plate

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.701
to like see and judge
how much food you eat

00:17:11.701 --> 00:17:13.788
but you just keep on eating
and grabbing and eating

00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:16.795
and grabbing and one of the
ladies just kept serving me

00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:20.574
more and more food and I welcomed it

00:17:20.574 --> 00:17:24.741
and that was seriously just
an incredibly remarkable meal.

00:17:27.287 --> 00:17:30.120
(rooster crowing)

00:17:32.583 --> 00:17:35.500
(mysterious music)

00:17:44.304 --> 00:17:48.137
That little eel that I
just ate is right here.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.867
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:05.817 --> 00:18:08.133
There's a hook attached
to it and he has a little

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:10.368
piece of shrimp or something on the hook

00:18:10.368 --> 00:18:14.188
and then he puts that
string down an eel hole

00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:18.101
and just waits and hopes it bites I think.

00:18:18.101 --> 00:18:20.583
And he already has a couple of them.

00:18:20.583 --> 00:18:23.250
(water flowing)

00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:34.091
Okay, guava.

00:18:47.004 --> 00:18:48.004
That's good.

00:18:49.312 --> 00:18:50.895
- This one is nice.

00:18:52.365 --> 00:18:53.782
Ohh look at that.

00:18:58.477 --> 00:19:00.120
- We are walking through
the rice fields searching

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.453
for some Pomelo.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:09.499
- Pomelo.

00:19:09.499 --> 00:19:10.666
- Yes, Pomelo.

00:19:15.965 --> 00:19:19.132
Okay, we have come to the Pomelo tree.

00:19:37.569 --> 00:19:40.259
This is the full Pomelo
but it's been peeled.

00:19:40.259 --> 00:19:44.956
It has a pretty thick
skin and then pith on it.

00:19:44.956 --> 00:19:46.053
And then this is the fruit inside.

00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:49.423
It's actually, the actual
fruit inside is quite small,

00:19:49.423 --> 00:19:51.797
almost like an orange size on this one.

00:19:51.797 --> 00:19:55.964
And you typically the skin is
so thick that it's hard to eat

00:19:57.269 --> 00:19:59.602
so you peel off all the pith

00:20:01.435 --> 00:20:05.602
and then you just eat all
of the, the fruit inside.

00:20:12.172 --> 00:20:13.672
Whoa, that's sour.

00:20:19.082 --> 00:20:22.241
It's the type of sour that
makes your teeth kind of hurt

00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:24.241
instantly but I love it.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.411
So sour, but juicy and
crisp at the same time.

00:20:28.411 --> 00:20:31.497
And there is something so
amazing about eating fruit

00:20:31.497 --> 00:20:35.664
that has just been picked off
the tree just minutes ago.

00:20:36.764 --> 00:20:38.684
It just started raining.

00:20:38.684 --> 00:20:41.434
(rain trickling)

00:20:54.109 --> 00:20:56.816
- [Man] So the first shot,
you cannot hit it right away.

00:20:56.816 --> 00:20:59.172
You have to bounce it off the wall.

00:20:59.172 --> 00:21:00.863
- Since it's raining,
we getting ready to play

00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:04.122
a traditional Indonesian game.

00:21:04.122 --> 00:21:07.117
It's like, it's kind of
like billiards, like pool

00:21:07.117 --> 00:21:09.315
but it's just with your fingers.

00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:12.491
And it's just a small square board.

00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:14.757
- [Man] Just bounce it off this thing.

00:21:14.757 --> 00:21:15.727
- [Mark] You flick it or you?

00:21:15.727 --> 00:21:17.044
- [Man] Yes.

00:21:17.044 --> 00:21:20.711
(speaking foreign language)

00:21:30.393 --> 00:21:31.977
- It's really an addictive game.

00:21:31.977 --> 00:21:33.871
We just sat there for and hour and played

00:21:33.871 --> 00:21:35.220
and the time went by really fast.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.423
We're gonna head into
Bogor now I think to eat

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:42.064
and then after that we're
going back to Jakarta.

00:21:42.064 --> 00:21:45.231
(inspirational music)

00:21:58.089 --> 00:22:00.667
We made it to Bogor and
we're gonna have dinner

00:22:00.667 --> 00:22:02.306
at a restaurant called Ampera,

00:22:02.306 --> 00:22:04.973
which is a Sundanese restaurant.

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:09.301
Oh so can he just go through the buffet

00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:10.134
and choose whatever you want.

00:22:10.134 --> 00:22:13.301
- And then they cook it again for you.

00:22:21.044 --> 00:22:22.608
- And they have all the
food in buffet style

00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:24.111
but you just go through with your plate

00:22:24.111 --> 00:22:26.248
and choose the different
items that you want.

00:22:26.248 --> 00:22:28.816
The dishes are all prepared
but when you order them,

00:22:28.816 --> 00:22:32.381
then they will reheat
them, either deep fry them

00:22:32.381 --> 00:22:35.351
or steam them or whatever
method of cooking

00:22:35.351 --> 00:22:36.497
that they used to prepare them,

00:22:36.497 --> 00:22:39.110
they will reheat them
that way and then you eat

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.625
everything with rice and Sambal.

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:42.997
So what I really wanted
to try for Sundanese food

00:22:42.997 --> 00:22:47.403
is pepes and pepes are
little packets of either,

00:22:47.403 --> 00:22:50.272
it can be a mixture of
different ingredients

00:22:50.272 --> 00:22:54.010
all wrapped into a banana leaf
and I think these are steamed

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.479
and as soon as I opened
that you can smell the aroma

00:22:56.479 --> 00:22:58.147
of herbs coming out of there.

00:22:58.147 --> 00:22:59.355
This is chicken one?

00:22:59.355 --> 00:23:00.486
I think it's chicken.

00:23:00.486 --> 00:23:03.794
It looks like chicken or
it looks like chicken.

00:23:03.794 --> 00:23:05.377
Yeah, it's chicken.

00:23:08.793 --> 00:23:11.002
That has a really herbal flavor.

00:23:11.002 --> 00:23:13.554
Oh man, maybe it's that bay leaf coming

00:23:13.554 --> 00:23:16.341
in there really strongly and then also,

00:23:16.341 --> 00:23:18.841
it has kind of a clove flavor.

00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:21.764
I'm not sure if there are cloves in there

00:23:21.764 --> 00:23:24.438
or cardamom or something along those lines

00:23:24.438 --> 00:23:28.956
and then really aromatic
and then just really herbal.

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:30.760
They took the whole stink bean pod

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.500
and deep fried the entire thing

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.950
and then they sliced it in half

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:36.837
so you can have easier access
and you should just be able

00:23:36.837 --> 00:23:41.004
to just pop these out and it
has a little skin around it.

00:23:43.704 --> 00:23:44.537
Yeah.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.010
Just natural vitamins.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.797
Oh, those are pretty strong as well.

00:23:54.797 --> 00:23:55.686
Oh yeah.

00:23:55.686 --> 00:23:56.878
I'm gonna take the next
stink bean and dip it

00:23:56.878 --> 00:24:00.552
into the Sambal, dip it
into that chili sauce,

00:24:00.552 --> 00:24:01.969
the rice as well.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.808
Okay this is the original
classic with fish

00:24:06.808 --> 00:24:09.725
and it's a little, is it a mackerel.

00:24:09.725 --> 00:24:11.013
- [Man] Yeah I think so, mackerel.

00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:13.374
- oh, let me take a piece of that fish

00:24:13.374 --> 00:24:15.779
and grab some of that.

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:17.938
It looks like coconut down there

00:24:17.938 --> 00:24:21.771
on you have that stink
bean on my plate still.

00:24:27.775 --> 00:24:30.942
Wow, that fish is really really salty.

00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:35.666
Wow, extremely salty.

00:24:36.517 --> 00:24:39.767
I think that's just a pure salted fish.

00:24:41.198 --> 00:24:43.948
The fish pepes was just too salty

00:24:44.782 --> 00:24:47.820
but I think it's because
people would normally eat that

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.804
with a bunch of rice, a whole
plate of rice and just one

00:24:50.804 --> 00:24:52.275
little bit of fish.

00:24:52.275 --> 00:24:56.192
So, that was too salty for
me but the overall food

00:24:56.192 --> 00:24:57.025
was really good.

00:24:57.025 --> 00:24:59.391
We are now heading back to Jakarta.

00:24:59.391 --> 00:25:02.558
(inspirational music)

00:25:15.073 --> 00:25:18.156
The better oh, we're going down here.

00:25:20.239 --> 00:25:24.816
(speaking in foreign language)

00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:27.149
we made it back to the big city, Jakarta.

00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:29.287
But before we go back to our hotel,

00:25:29.287 --> 00:25:32.092
we are just stopping for a quick dessert

00:25:32.092 --> 00:25:34.192
along the big road.

00:25:34.192 --> 00:25:35.799
- [Man] It's Wedang Ronde.

00:25:35.799 --> 00:25:38.161
It's a ginger soup base.

00:25:38.161 --> 00:25:40.256
It's sweet and it has tapioca balls.

00:25:40.256 --> 00:25:41.103
This is a regular one.

00:25:41.103 --> 00:25:43.522
This one has peanuts in it.

00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:45.336
- [Mark] Okay, and then what is this one?

00:25:45.336 --> 00:25:47.094
- [Man] This one is called Sekoteng.

00:25:47.094 --> 00:25:49.802
It is basically the same soup base

00:25:49.802 --> 00:25:54.134
but they have like different
kind of stuff in here.

00:25:54.134 --> 00:25:56.458
All kinds of stuff,
stuff I don't even know.

00:25:56.458 --> 00:25:58.422
The jelly like small.

00:25:58.422 --> 00:26:00.960
- Oh you can smell that aroma of ginger

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.293
steaming off of those bowls.

00:26:13.887 --> 00:26:17.051
That ginger is so soothing on the throat.

00:26:17.051 --> 00:26:21.765
And then that little dumpling
is filled with crushed peanuts

00:26:21.765 --> 00:26:24.715
so as soon as you bite it,
it's kind of sticky and gooey,

00:26:24.715 --> 00:26:26.479
but then as soon as you bite it,

00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:29.093
it's like a burst of peanut
butter that comes out.

00:26:29.093 --> 00:26:31.323
Okay next one, some of these jellies,

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:33.617
it looks like that's some kind of grain.

00:26:33.617 --> 00:26:36.200
- Yep, it's called Jelly Jelly.

00:26:41.438 --> 00:26:43.269
- This one is the same ginger soup

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:47.436
but then these white things
are a type of palm fruit

00:26:48.475 --> 00:26:52.079
that is similar tasting
and feeling to coconut

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:53.746
but more gelatinous.

00:26:54.907 --> 00:26:58.832
But it's kind of a similar,
yeah it's a type of palm fruit

00:26:58.832 --> 00:27:02.999
and so that is the main ingredient
instead of the dumplings.

00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:10.836
Yeah, I like this as a dessert

00:27:10.836 --> 00:27:14.249
because of that strong ginger flavor.

00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:16.115
Ying and I just made it back to the hotel.

00:27:16.115 --> 00:27:17.980
That was a fantastic day.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.976
The highlight being that
family feast for lunch.

00:27:21.976 --> 00:27:26.143
That was just a once in a
lifetime meal to never forget.

00:27:28.047 --> 00:27:32.020
I wanna say a huge thank
you to Ken and Gratiana

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.705
as well as her entire family.

00:27:33.705 --> 00:27:35.964
