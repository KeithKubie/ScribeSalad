&gt;&gt; A BIG HAWK FLYING OVER A BABY
SQUIRREL, GOLF COURSES, AND THAT

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:12.512 line:91%
BIG HAWK COMES DOWN AND GRABS
THE SQUIRREL, DO YOU SHOOT THE

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.214 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAWK OFF OR LET HIM EAT THE

00:00:15.247 --> 00:00:19.452 align:start position:0% line:91%

THE HAWK?

(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: I THINK I AM SITTING

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.858 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE
ANALOGY IS WHAT I'M DOING.

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.228 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; HERE'S THE ANALOGY OF IT --

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:36.035 line:91%
THE WATER COMPANY, THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN FAMILIES TO FEED AND

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:36.869 align:start position:0% line:85%
NEED THE WATER.

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.371 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: RIGHT.

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:40.106 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE YOU GOING TO KILL THE
WATER COMPANY --

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:43.810 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I'M SORRY, BUT THIS
DOES NOT SOUND LIKE SCARFACE.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:48.214 line:91%
I HAVE TO BRING OUT MY ANNOTATED
GUIDE TO SCARFACE BECAUSE THIS

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:53.019 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE -- OKAY, THIS
IS FROM THE GHETTO BOY SONG,

00:00:53.052 --> 00:01:06.599 line:91%
"DAMN IT'S GOOD TO BE A GANGSTA,
FEEDING THE POOR AND HELPING OUT

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:07.466 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH THEY BILLS."

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHY YOU GOT TO BE SO BRAND-NEW,
BROTHER?

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.638 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT BRAND-NEW!

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:13.671 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE'S BRAND-NEW!
