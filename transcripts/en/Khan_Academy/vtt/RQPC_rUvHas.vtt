00:00:00.771 --> 00:00:02.299
Voiceover:Alma has developed a new kind

00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:03.331
of antibiotic.

00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:05.960
For the antibiotic to be
sufficiently effective,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.458
it has to kill at least 90% of bacteria

00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:10.651
when applied to a
harmful bacteria culture.

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:13.139
She applied her antibiotic to a petri dish

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.715
full of harmful bacteria,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.442
waited for it to take effect,

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:18.443
and then tried to estimate the percentage

00:00:18.443 --> 00:00:19.954
of dead bacteria in it.

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.498
She took a random sample of 300 bacteria

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:26.557
and found that 94% of them were dead.

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:28.974
Then she calculated the margin of error

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:30.467
and found that the true percentage of

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.689
dead bacteria is most
likely to be above 90%.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.166
So, what's happening over here,

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.560
she's trying to figure out what percentage

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.287
of the total population of bacteria died.

00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:41.991
Maybe there's something
about this bacteria,

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:44.288
maybe when you look at it from, you know,

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:45.115
the naked eye,

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:46.603
you can't tell whether the bacteria

00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:47.937
died or not.

00:00:47.937 --> 00:00:50.878
So, she decides to estimate
the true percentage

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:55.705
by sampling 300 individual bacterium,

00:00:55.705 --> 00:00:58.271
or by sampling ... I always forget the

00:00:58.271 --> 00:00:59.019
singular case.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.304
By sampling 300 bacteria,

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:04.163
and then in her sample she found that 94%

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.398
of them were dead.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.851
Then the margin of error tells us,

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.601
because the margin of
error says it's unlikely,

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.226
or that it's very likely that the true

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:14.633
percentage is above 90%.

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:16.573
That means that given that you sample

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:17.866
300 bacteria,

00:01:17.866 --> 00:01:20.545
it's very unlikely that
the true percentage

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.016
is below 90%.

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:24.147
So, she could feel reasonably confident

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:25.961
that in her petri dish,

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.481
more than 90% of the population

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:31.139
did indeed die.

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:33.159
Now, let's answer these questions.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.308
What type of statistical
study did Alma use?

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.515
Well, she used a ...

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.138
she's trying to estimate a parameter

00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:43.271
for population, in this case,

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:44.828
the parameter was the percentage of

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:46.954
all of the bacteria that died.

00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:49.291
She couldn't observe that directly,

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:51.529
so instead, she took a random sample

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:53.437
of the bacteria in the petri dish,

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:54.809
and she used ...

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:57.204
she calculated the static for them,

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:58.737
94% of them were dead,

00:01:58.737 --> 00:02:00.225
and that's her estimate for the

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.661
population parameter.

00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:03.553
The percentage of the
population that died.

00:02:03.553 --> 00:02:05.160
So this is ... when you're using a ...

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.686
when you're using a random sample

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.693
to generate a statistic,

00:02:09.693 --> 00:02:12.022
which estimates a
parameter for a population,

00:02:12.022 --> 00:02:13.641
that's a sample study.

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.398
So, she ran a sample study.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:18.195
Now the next question is.

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:20.148
Is the study appropriate
for the statistical

00:02:20.148 --> 00:02:21.808
question it's supposed to answer?

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:23.578
So what was the question that she's

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:24.567
trying to answer?

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.014
Well, at least the was it's written,

00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:27.721
it seems like she's trying to answer

00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:29.543
whether or not her antibiotic works,

00:02:29.543 --> 00:02:31.112
whether it's an effective antibiotic,

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:33.517
whether it's capable of killing bacteria.

00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:35.837
You might be tempted to
say, "Okay, well look.

00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:37.108
It looks like it killed ...

00:02:37.108 --> 00:02:39.304
it killed more than 90% of the bacteria,

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:41.143
or very likely it killed more than 90%

00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:44.192
of the bacteria given ...
given the sample size,

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:45.858
and the margin error and all that."

00:02:45.858 --> 00:02:48.345
Even if it is indeed the case,

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:51.313
that 95% of all the bacteria died,

00:02:51.313 --> 00:02:53.940
it doesn't necessarily
mean that it was caused

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.924
by the antibiotic,

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.356
maybe it was caused by the plastic in

00:02:56.356 --> 00:02:57.050
the petri dish.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.104
Maybe the air in the petri dish was

00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:00.439
too cold or went bad,

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:02.093
or maybe it was handled in a weird way.

00:03:02.093 --> 00:03:03.684
Or, maybe that bacteria was just a bad ...

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:06.651
a bad culture,

00:03:06.651 --> 00:03:08.750
and it somehow it just spontaneously

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.784
died on its own.

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:12.129
She can't say with confidence that it

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.864
was definitely ... it was definitely

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:15.101
the antibiotic.

00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.733
In order for her to make that statement,

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:20.734
she would have to run a proper experiment.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:22.640
She would have to have a control and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.555
a treatment group,

00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.980
where everything is equal except for the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.423
treatment group has the treatment.

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:28.900
So if she had 2 petri dishes

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.762
that were kept in the same conditions

00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:34.118
with the same lightning, the same air,

00:03:34.118 --> 00:03:38.348
the same material that the bacteria

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:40.394
is growing on, everything the same,

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:42.678
except for the treatment group,

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:45.562
has the antibiotic applied to it.

00:03:45.562 --> 00:03:48.429
Then she saw that in the treatment group

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:51.037
that most of the bacteria died while in

00:03:51.037 --> 00:03:52.578
the control group, most of the bacteria

00:03:52.578 --> 00:03:53.289
didn't die,

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:55.346
then she could say, "Okay. It looks

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:57.702
like the antibiotic caused the bacteria

00:03:57.702 --> 00:03:58.575
to die.

00:03:58.575 --> 00:04:00.644
That there was actual causality here."

00:04:00.644 --> 00:04:03.109
So, she would have had
to run an experiment.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.754
The most appropriate statistical study,

00:04:06.754 --> 00:04:08.518
or the most appropriate study

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:11.187
would have been a proper
controlled experiment.

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:12.315
Where you have a control group,

00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:13.772
where they don't have the antibiotic,

00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:14.796
and a treatment group,

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.211
where they do have the antibiotic.

00:04:17.364 --> 00:04:18.310
Let's see what are the choices here.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.388
Where they say is the study appropriate?

00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:23.569
So, yes because she is appropriate study.

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:24.461
No, I don't like that answer.

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.079
No, because she can't know for certain

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.530
that the true percentage of dead bacteria

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.908
is above 90%.

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:30.577
Well, I'm not going to click on that,

00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:32.335
because even if she knew for certain

00:04:32.335 --> 00:04:33.964
that the true percentage of the dead

00:04:33.964 --> 00:04:35.834
bacteria were 95%,

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:37.953
she can't feel confident that it was due

00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:39.288
to the antibiotic.

00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:40.694
Once again, it could be caused by the

00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:41.446
air conditioner.

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:43.418
It could have been
caused by the petri dish.

00:04:43.418 --> 00:04:44.898
It could have been caused by the lighting

00:04:44.898 --> 00:04:45.665
in the room.

00:04:45.665 --> 00:04:47.564
So, no, because the study didn't have a

00:04:47.564 --> 00:04:48.983
treatment and a control group.

00:04:48.983 --> 00:04:50.820
Yeah, I would go with
that one right over there.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.223
Yes, because she found that the antibiotic

00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:54.297
killed more than 90% of harmful bacteria.

00:04:54.297 --> 00:04:57.120
Once again, even if she knew for sure

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.195
that more than 90% of the population

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:00.356
had been killed,

00:05:00.356 --> 00:05:02.722
she doesn't know that it was caused by

00:05:02.722 --> 00:05:03.305
the antibiotic.

00:05:03.305 --> 00:05:04.481
It could have been caused by a whole

00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:05.314
bunch of things.

00:05:05.314 --> 00:05:06.920
If she had a controlled group

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.570
that had the exact same conditions

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.274
and the bacteria didn't die,

00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:12.980
then she could feel better

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.365
that it was the bacteria death

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.047
was due to the antibiotic.
