00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:03.075
 

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:06.555
The U.S. has broken a 25-year-old
record for measles cases

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.800
this year with more than

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.460
New York City has been hit particularly hard and fake news is playing a huge role.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.340
Since October 2018, over 400 people
have come down with measles in the city.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.220
The message today for all New Yorkers is to take measles seriously.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.460
We cannot allow this dangerous disease to make a comeback in New York City.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.620
We have to stop it now.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.020
Some members of the Orthodox Jewish community

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.540
The reasons for this vary but it's largely due

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.160
City officials have declared

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.460
if vaccinations orders are ignored.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.140
The Orthodox community 
overwhelmingly believes in vaccination.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.960
This community, like most other communities
in the United States

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.780
vaccinate their children.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660
[The] vast majority of people vaccinate their children.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.000
But some community members recently interviewed distrust measles vaccines.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.360
[It's] true that a lot of people have measles and measles is not a very good thing,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.360
but the vaccine is also not a very good thing.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.000
And it's everybody's option to do what he wants.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.300
People are beginning to question why I should subject my three-year-old

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.075
to toxins when it's not going to protect him or her.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.200
While these are a minority of views in the community, they have City Hall worried.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.840
The only way to stop this outbreak is 
to ensure that those who

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.920
that those who have not been 
vaccinated get the vaccine.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.060
But when community vaccination rates

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.200
I think the people themselves should do it on their own.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.700
They should realize that the children are up

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.860
to hazard conditions if they don't do it. That's all.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.540
Solomon Feuerwerker is a former Hasidic Jew.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.800
He says that while there are factors within

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.960
Orthodox Jewish communities

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.400
that allow for measles outbreaks to take place, community members that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.100
don't vaccinate aren't any 
different than people in other areas.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.640
I don't think there's anything super unique about

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.740
the people who end up not vaccinating.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.100
It's driven by the same kind of fears 
and the same misinformation.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.400
At the same time, community insularity has

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.400
played a big role in the spread of the disease.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.220
Children spend a lot more time 
together and around a lot of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.080
other children whether it's at school where they spend

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.500
more time at school daily

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.260
which always increases the chance for transmission.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.380
in Orthodox communities.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.840
There's certainly misinformation.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.340
People, for the most part, are pretty unplugged

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.740
from the larger media system.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.740
They have their own newspapers in Yiddish, they have their own magazines.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.380
is targeted at the Hasidic community.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.240
Its pages spread debunked claims about vaccinations causing autism.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.440
The magazine provides commentary by rabbis from the point of view of Jewish religious law.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.100
Some members of the community have said they get the majority

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.680
of their news from WhatsApp groups.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.440
There are a lot of these groups and people 
spend a lot of time

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.460
a lot of time sending around information there, and again, there's no one vetting

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.600
this information, there's no one running these groups,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.460
it's a just a random group that people got added to.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.540
And the misinformation

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.080
In 2017, the Somali community in Minnesota was a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.340
whose parents had concerns about autism.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.280
Faith leaders in the community pushed 
members to get vaccinated

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.400
and the following year, vaccination rates improved.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.740
But misinformation has continued to spread 
in other communities.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.540
Meanwhile, the state of New York has responded 
to the misinformation

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.980
by producing its own magazine.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.200
Tzim Gezint urges Hasidic parents to 
vaccinate their children.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.860
It's often the only resource available to the community advocating this position.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.600
There's a level of fear and mistrust.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.800
Not of the government specifically, but of any sort of outside coming

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.860
and tell us information.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.840
There's a fear that people will receive information that is

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.180
harmful to their belief system in some way.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.160
continue in the hopes that 
more people will get vaccinated.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.560
There's no question that we've had a respectful, highly communicative

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.540
engagement with the community.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.120
But the bottom line is to recognize that this is something that's now become

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.860
even more urgent and we have to take additional steps.
