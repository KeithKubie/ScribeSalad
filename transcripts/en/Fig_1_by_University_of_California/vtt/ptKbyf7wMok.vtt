00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.169
looking at past trends we could guess
that we're going to be wanting to send

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.170
more and more data at higher higher rates so
if you upload a video to Facebook for

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.050
example, Facebook is storing your video
until someone asked for it. So if you

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.869
suddenly say now I want to see my dog
bouncing down the hall again now

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.189
Facebook has to figure out where they
stored it and get all that data bring it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.679
right to your computer almost as fast as
you asked for it or if suddenly this

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.020
video goes viral and everybody across
the united states wants to see your dog

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.250
bouncing down the hall Facebook has gotta be
able to figure out how to get that data

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.920
to everybody as fast as they can as soon
as people ask for it. We're running up

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.680
against the limit of what electricity
can do. Regular electric wires you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.860
try to get more and more data on
there they start to heat up and the

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.100
wires also start to interfere with one
another and so what we found is that if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.829
we send data down these fiber optics
made out of glass that can transport

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.960
light from one place to another

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.810
then suddenly we can fit a lot more
information on one strand of glass than

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:08.990
we ever could

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.030
on a wire. We want to try and use those
same advantages that we got from fiber

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.470
optics not only between computers but
now within computers as well.  We want to

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.460
make lasers at or about a hundred times
thinner than the diameter of a single

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.750
human hair so these lasers need to be
microscopic to fit in well among all the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.409
other microscopic components on the chip
and so there's lots of researchers who

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.520
are working on how to shrink all these
components down and get them to talk to

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.350
each other.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.000
the lasers that we're making now are
actually circular and that's called a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
whispering gallery laser and it's named
after the whispering galleries in

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.610
cathedrals that have big domes and if
somebody is standing in the right spot

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.080
clear on the other side of the cathedral
they can actually hear you even if you

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.170
whisper because the sound waves are
bouncing along the edge of this

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.180
cathedral and reaching the listener on
the other side. In the same way in

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.350
these circular lasers that we've set up
we actually have set up our cavities so

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.600
the light bounces around the edge of the
cavity and ends up at the original spot

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.920
right in step with it.  So the pictures
are pretty too actually go as I'm sitting

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.500
there at my computer sort of testing out
these different laser designs I'll get

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.720
to see these pictures of flowers and
these sort of wonderful circularly

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:38.360
symmetric patterns coming up on my
screen that's very satisfying

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.270
 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.290
