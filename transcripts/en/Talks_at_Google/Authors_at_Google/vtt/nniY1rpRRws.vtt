[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:10.059
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.400
MARC HAGAN-GUIREY: Thank you.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.010
And thanks very much
for coming, guys.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.290
Obviously, I'm here to talk
to you about my new book.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.060
The full title is "Journey
to The Last Jedi, Star Wars

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.710
Kirigami," which I'm
still quite excited about.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.270
And I'm going to take
you through quite

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.680
a short presentation.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.930
I would normally do it
over the course of an hour,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.346
but we haven't got
that much time.

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:31.890
So excuse me if I don't
really stop to breathe

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.240
or anything for a bit.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.020
And if I'm sort of bungling
it, just kind of nod and smile,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.659
and pretend I'm making sense.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.075
And so before we get started,
obviously, with the workshop

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.170
stuff, I'm just
going to take you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.060
through what the
fundamentals of kirigami

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.250
are, and also,
how I got into it.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.510
And this is quite
nice, actually.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.960
I did my first Comic
Con a couple of weeks

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.490
ago, which was a
big deal for me.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.820
And I managed to pull a
crowd of like 40 people.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.240
So I was really chuffed by that.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.290
But they'd put me in a room
with a capacity of 1,500 people.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.390
And when you get 40
people spread out

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.034
amongst that kind
of space, it was

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.200
kind of a bit disheartening.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.760
So it's actually really
nice to do something that

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.140
is a little bit more intimate.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.170
So thank you, and welcome.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.510
And so kirigami-- you've
probably already done

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.050
it before.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.960
It's basically cutting
and folding paper.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.680
And I'm sure all
of you have done

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320
or have made snowflakes
at Christmas.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.470
So you're already
masters at kirigami.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.390
And the difference with
the stuff that I do

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.890
is I make kirigami--

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.010
like, architectural replicas.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.110
Normally kirigami is
used to make things

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.200
like the Eiffel
Tower or Empire State

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.530
Building, something like that.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.500
But I find my niche
in making stuff

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.420
from movies and more kind of
pop culture related stuff.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.910
So basically, it's a piece
of paper with a horizon.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.400
And then you cut--
and then you're

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.030
extruding blocks from it.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.052
So these are the scorelines.

00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:00.010
You're not cutting the
whole way through these.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.440
You're just scoring
on this side.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.490
You're scoring on
the opposite side.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.850
And then you fold it
up and extrude a shape.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.290
And then, that's basically it.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.544
But what I do is, I start
to add more detail to it.

00:02:09.544 --> 00:02:10.919
And you can add
things like this.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.180
And then you've got a super
accurate representation

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.930
of the Google headquarters,
where you just

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.096
have that little door there.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.090
But with a little bit
of time and patience,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.890
and starting to build
upon those blocks,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.830
you can start to create models
that are a little bit more

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.910
detailed.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.150
And two questions
I'm asked quite often

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.740
is, how you got started in this,
and also, do you make mistakes.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.980
And the answer is yes,
I always make mistakes.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.294
And I should pretend that
I'm quite Jedi about it

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:40.960
when it happens.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.970
But I actually have massive
tantrums and clear my desk.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.450
So you are forgiven
if you do that today.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.840
I completely understand.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.680
I started making kirigami
about five years ago.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.010
I'm a digital designer, and
I work on big platform builds

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.730
at the moment.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.480
And I was a bit fed up.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.890
I was seven years
into my career,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.940
and I kind of wanted to get back
and do the stuff that I used to

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.960
as a kid.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.170
And as a kid, I used to
make stuff all the time.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.290
My currency, as a kid, were egg
carton boxes and toilet roll

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.880
tubes.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.070
And basically, every time
my mom would come home

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.050
from doing the groceries,
I'd immediately

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.000
be decanting cornflakes
into Tupperware boxes

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.330
so that I could have
that box and make

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.995
a fortress, probably,
for He-Man and Skeletor

00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:26.120
and all that kind of thing.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560
So that's basically what I did.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.840
And even now, as an adult,
when I'm putting a toilet roll

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.830
tube into the recycling
bin, I'm going,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.850
oh, I could make a light
saber out of that really well.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.190
Except, well, I don't
do that anymore.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.614
But people do--

00:03:39.614 --> 00:03:42.030
I do often think about where
was the kind of turning point

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.530
for me.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.330
What was it that really
kicked this all off for me?

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.130
And there's some
people that I will

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.220
be forever grateful
to that introduced me

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.330
to the catalyst of
this adventure for me.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.270
And it's these guys.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.160
This is S Club 7, one of the
greatest pop acts of all time.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.050
And it will make sense in
a minute, bear with me.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.110
So I'm a huge fan of
Frank Lloyd Wright.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.970
And so you know who
Frank Lloyd Wright is--

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.160
an American architect
whose major work

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.620
is around the 1920s and 1930s.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.890
And basically, when
I was in LA once,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.980
I pretended to be
a multibillionaire

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.940
and walked up to a Frank
Lloyd Wright house,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.020
having convinced Christie's real
estate that I was very wealthy

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.390
and was about to buy
one of his buildings.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.780
But that talk is for
the extended version.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.530
In case you don't know
Frank Lloyd Wright,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.870
you probably are quite
aware of some of his work.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.980
He designed and
built Falling Water,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.510
probably one of the most
famous residential buildings

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.880
of all time.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.950
A little fact is that he'd
been blagging the whole time

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.950
to his client that he had
completed the designs for it

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.060
over the course of
a couple of years.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.942
And when they said--

00:04:49.942 --> 00:04:51.900
they wrote him a letter
to say they were coming

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.510
to come and review the plans.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.396
And he got the letter on the
day that they were arriving.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:59.520
And he basically kicked
everybody out of his studio

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.149
and spent 30 minutes
sketching it up.

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:03.940
And then they arrived
and he presented them

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.510
in a 15 minute sketch turned
into the most famous building

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.830
of all time.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.550
He also designed the
Guggenheim in New York.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.180
And so I went to see this
Frank Lloyd Wright house,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.690
having blagged my way in.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.400
This is the Ennis House.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.150
It's part of his textile
block series of buildings.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.140
Basically, it's
like a big Lego kit.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.069
It was pre-cast concrete blocks
slotted on top of each other.

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.860
Absolutely amazing,
there was four of those

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.400
in LA and around that area.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.510
And I've been obsessed
with the building

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.490
since I first laid eyes on it.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.660
And it was really damaged
by an earthquake in 1993,

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.330
and his buildings don't
weather that well.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.530
So he often used granite
that he'd taken from the site

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.730
and mix it in with concrete.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.730
And that made it quite
susceptible to weathering

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.950
and made it quite weak.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.482
And so the Foundation that
owned the building had basically

00:05:58.482 --> 00:06:00.190
run out of money, and
the building itself

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.560
was about to slide off
the side of the hill.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.590
And then they decided to
put it on sale in order

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.964
to raise the funds and save the
building from being destroyed.

00:06:08.964 --> 00:06:10.630
And that's when I
came in and was, like,

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.726
hello, I'm very rich.

00:06:11.726 --> 00:06:13.100
Can I come and
see this building?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.420
I need to see it now.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.050
And it was really, like-- it
was an amazing moment for me.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.680
A life changing moment, in fact,
in walking around that space--

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.590
it was just it was like an
out-of-body experience for me.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.754
It was very spiritual.

00:06:24.754 --> 00:06:26.920
But at the same time, I'm
walking around saying, oh,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.044
and how's the plumbing,
and how is the electricity?

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:32.310
I was trying to pretend that
I really was going to buy it.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.530
And so this house itself
has a long history

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.220
in Hollywood of being used
for various locations.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.110
Some of you might
recognize it from--

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.430
that's really bad on
the screen that big--

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.840
might recognize it from "Blade
Runner," Deckard's apartment.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.840
You can see the
original gates there

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.370
and some of the interior shots.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.700
Most of it, of the interior,
was actually a set piece,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.550
but some of the exterior shots.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.115
And also it was used in a
1959 Vincent Price film "House

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:03.824
on Haunted Hill."

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:05.323
And if you haven't
seen this, you've

00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:06.625
really got to watch this film.

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:07.250
It's brilliant.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.980
It's proper, like,
skeletons on strings.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.010
And I can't think-- a
proper old camp movie.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.960
And other films
it's been used in

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.970
are, like, "Beverly Hills
Cop," "The Rocketeer,"

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.410
"The Day of the
Locust," and this

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.250
is the TV show within the
TV show of "Twin Peaks."

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.380
It was the set
within that as well.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.690
And you know, its influence
is still seen today

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.210
with film sets and TV sets.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.900
You can still see how it's been
influential to sets, so again,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.350
with "Game of Thrones."

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.080
But the music
connoisseurs amongst

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.300
you will know that S Club
7 filmed their 2001 smash

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.860
hit, "Have You Ever Loved and
Lost Somebody" at the Ennis

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.470
House.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.132
And that was the first time
that I saw that building

00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:50.590
and was completely
obsessed with it

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.550
and found out as much
as I could about it.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.230
So that ended up
being quite a game

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:57.720
changing, life changing moment.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.290
There's me doing my best S
Club 7 impression at the house.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.140
So when I came home from LA,
having seen the building,

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.760
I wanted to make a memento to
commemorate the experience.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.050
And I knew that I wasn't
going to make something out

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.024
of toilet roll tubes.

00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:15.190
And I didn't want to make
something digital as well,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.773
because I'd kind of
had enough of just

00:08:16.773 --> 00:08:17.920
working in digital formats.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.220
And I wanted to rediscover
the joy of making stuff again.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.050
And I came across the
art form of kirigami.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.000
And this was the very
first one that I made.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.280
And I thought, well, I know.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.970
I'm going to make some
more buildings that I love.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.309
And oh, by the way, I do
have a Frank Lloyd Wright

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.159
book that's out at the
moment, if you want to.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.019
Makes a great Christmas present.

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:40.179
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:41.820
So I was set aside--

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.230
I started making some
other kirigami models.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.910
This is the Addams
Family mansion

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.560
from "The Addams Family" movie.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.810
And this is the house
on "Amityville."

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.400
I mean, these are
all big things,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.760
big movies from my childhood,
all the normal films

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.415
that 12-year-olds are in
to, like the "Amityville"

00:08:57.415 --> 00:09:00.164
and "The Exorcist" and so on.

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.330
So once I'd started making
these bunch of buildings,

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.330
I realized I had a theme,
and I called that Horrorgami.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.962
And that turned into--
that's "Ghostbusters"--

00:09:07.962 --> 00:09:09.670
and that turned into
my first exhibition.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:15.310
I got a deal with a gallery
to make, to do an exhibition.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.710
And that also led
to a book, which

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.900
is a really good Christmas
present as well, if you

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:23.530
want to buy, you know,
subliminal Jedi mind stuff

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.710
going on here.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.880
So naturally for
me, I've always been

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.040
obsessed with "Star
Wars." so I was always

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.220
going to start making stuff.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.780
But because the exhibition
had done so well,

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.510
and I'd had a really positive
reaction from the media for it,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.650
I began to think, well, maybe
I could do this officially.

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:45.670
Maybe I could really do
something with Lucas film.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.740
I basically did what
it says not to do

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.540
on the Lucasfilm
website, which is don't

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.280
send any unsolicited material.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.070
But I did it anyway.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.210
And a couple of weeks
down the line, I

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.430
got a phone call from the
global head of marketing

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.760
who was interested to
do something with me.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.400
And these are some-- so
that's obviously Leia and R2.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.730
And then you've got a close
up of the Millennium Falcon--

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.490
try saying that
with a dry mouth.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.530
And then, I found a couple
of years after that,

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.180
I've been continually
talking to them.

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.040
And then I find myself on
the set of "The Force Awaken"

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.230
trying to not get in the way.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.210
And then accidentally bumping
into JJ Abrams, kind of maybe

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:24.710
on purpose.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.414
Like, oh, sorry, but
he was really nice.

00:10:27.414 --> 00:10:28.580
And he sort of juts into me.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:30.530
And he's, like, oh, who are you
here with and what do you do?

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.988
And I'm, like,
well, as it happens,

00:10:31.988 --> 00:10:34.037
I have my iPad with me.

00:10:34.037 --> 00:10:35.370
And I'm going to show you some--

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:36.290
well, he did.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.800
I wasn't that annoying.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.400
But then he says, oh, I'm
a massive paper art fan.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.390
I'm, like, oh, really?

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.610
And then he basically
frogmarched to me

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.630
across the set of Starkiller
Base, over to Kathleen Kennedy,

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.870
to interrupt her to say, you've
got to look at this guy's work!

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.720
It's amazing.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.540
And I'm, like, oh!

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:00.290
So it was the only
time I've ever had

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.067
a business card in my pocket.

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:03.650
And I took out this
business card that

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.952
was all tattered and dog-eared.

00:11:04.952 --> 00:11:06.410
And I'm handing
this going, oh, I'm

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.600
a professional paper artist,
and here's my business card.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.780
It was really embarrassing.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.140
But anyway, somehow that card
made its way down the ranks,

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.640
and I ended up working with
Lucasfilm on this new book.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.290
And these are some
other pictures.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.840
So I did do an exhibition
of Star Wars kirigami,

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.100
but I did that without
them, because I wanted

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.680
to kind of push ahead with it.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.170
And obviously, I didn't
call it Star Wars kirigami.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.230
It was called Cut
Scene, and kirigami

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.390
inspired by that
"Spaceball" movie, you know?

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.390
I did it very carefully.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.460
And I think they
appreciated that.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.710
And when they did call
me, I was like, I'm sorry.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.180
I'm not breaking any laws, am I?

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.638
And they were,
like, no, no, we do.

00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:47.540
We want to work with you.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.772
And that's how the
book come around.

00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:52.681
A piece like this-- so this
is the carbon light freezing

00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:53.180
chamber.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.610
That took two years
to get that one right.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.380
And then, of course, as I
said, this led to this book.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.470
So you know, for me, this kind
of whole adventure of kirigami

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:07.340
has been a bit more than
just creating these books.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.040
It's about getting people
to start making stuff again.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.080
And mindfulness is a
really kind of-- it's

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.550
a word you hear an awful lot.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.680
And it's a bit icky now,
but, actually, I really

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.040
do believe that spending
some time to just make stuff

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.930
is a really, really
nice feeling.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.930
You know, switch off your
phone, and turn off your TV

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.700
and enjoy that process.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.200
So I'm really glad
that you're here,

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.460
and I'm able to share
that with you now.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.804
So I'll shut up now we can do
the Star Destroyer kirigami.

00:12:34.804 --> 00:12:36.021
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:36.752
Thank you.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.390
So basically, it's
really straightforward.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.910
The black lines you cut.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.310
The blue lines you score on
the back, and the red lines,

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.268
you score on the front.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:51.280
So I think you've all practiced
just cutting through the paper.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.520
You know how much pressure
you need to use now, yeah?

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.580
No?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.220
Can I hear you?

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.970
