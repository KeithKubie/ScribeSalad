00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.580
- [Instructor] We are
now going to continue

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.250
our discussion of factor markets.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.950
And we're going to go beyond

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.880
just thinking about labor as a factor.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.450
In fact, in this video,
we're going to start

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.570
thinking about capital as well,

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.700
which we know is another one
of the factors of production.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.500
But just as a little bit of review,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.790
we've already thought about
it from a firms perspective

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.707
on what is the rational
amount of labor to hire

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.000
based on the marginal
revenue product of labor

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.470
and based on the marginal
factor cost of labor.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
So, in the horizontal axis,
we have the quantity of labor

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.570
hired by the firm.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.550
And in the vertical axis,
you have the wage rate,

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.200
wage rate, which you could
view as the price of labor.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.930
And we've seen this multiple times.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.530
You are likely to have a downward sloping

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.490
marginal revenue product curve, MRP.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.870
And I'm going to be very specific

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.630
that this one is the marginal
revenue product of labor.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.410
And then we have the
marginal factor cost curve.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.400
And if we're assuming that this firm

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.470
is in a competitive, perfectly
competitive labor market,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.640
well, they're just going to have to pay

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.060
whatever the wage is in the market.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.200
And so, that's why we have
a horizontal line there,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.400
so that's the marginal
factor cost of labor.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.340
And we've talked about multiple times

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.710
that it's rational for
the firm to keep hiring

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.210
as long as the marginal
revenue product of labor,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.800
as long as the incremental revenue

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.190
that the firm gets for
each of those people

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.620
or each of those units
of labor that they hire

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.346
is higher than the incremental cost

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:40.280
of each of those units of labor.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.970
And so, it'll keep hiring until
these two lines intersect.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.260
And so, it would be rational for it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.030
to hire that quantity of labor.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.890
I'll do this is the labor for the firm,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260
and I'll put a little star over here,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.890
so that quantity of labor.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.710
And we can draw an
analogous thing for capital.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.060
So, this is how a firm
thinks about that input,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.900
how it thinks about labor.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.200
But we could also do
something similar for capital.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.480
Or we could do it for land as well.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.670
But hopefully, so this
is going to be the firm,

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.530
the firm as you think about capital.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.300
And we'll see that they
have analogous axes.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.320
The horizontal axis right over here

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.970
is going to be the quantity not of labor,

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.100
but the quantity of capital.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.900
And then the vertical
axis, the price of capital,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.720
you could view that as the rent rate,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.300
rent rate, if you're thinking about maybe

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.120
you're renting some type of machinery.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.760
And so, you will have your

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.930
marginal revenue product of capital.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.350
We could still imagine that
you have diminishing returns,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.240
so that's why it's downward sloping,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.970
so marginal revenue product.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.550
And we typically use a K for capital,

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.850
just so we don't get the C
confused with other things.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.270
And then we have our marginal factor cost,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.760
which is really just, and
we'll assume, once again,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.620
that this is a perfectly
competitive capital market,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.530
so you just have to pay
whatever the market rate

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.640
for renting that capital is.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.550
And so, that would be the marginal

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.690
factor cost of the capital.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.900
And so, once again, it makes sense

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.030
to keep bringing on more
and more and more capital

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.840
as long as the incremental
revenue that you get

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.010
from each of those extra units of capital

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.010
is higher than the cost of each

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.670
of those extra units of capital.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.660
And so, here, it would
be rational for the firm,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.900
if we're just looking at the dimension

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.250
of capital to product this much.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.610
So, this would be, actually, let me,

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.240
this would be the capital,
the quantity of capital

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.600
for the firm to employ.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.140
Now, an interesting question that might've

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.450
already crossed your minds are,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.900
is that firms have a
certain amount of resources

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.530
that they are going to think about,

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.750
well, how much do I put in labor

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.610
versus how much do I put into capital.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.738
So, they don't just think
about these dimensions

00:04:00.738 --> 00:04:04.530
of how much inputs of
these factors they want,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.560
they have to think about
them relative to each other.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.350
And to help us think through this,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.800
let's say that we are at
a certain level of output.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.200
So, let's say that our output right now,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.763
I don't know, our current output,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.050
our current

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.383
output

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.730
is, I'm just going to make up something,

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.580
1,000 units per day.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.240
And at our current output,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.850
we know what the marginal product of labor

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.360
and the marginal product of capital is.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.360
Let's say that we know that
our marginal product of labor

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.300
at this output, remember it changes,

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.700
as we have different output

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.140
and we bring on more
labor or more capital,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.140
so our marginal product of
labor at that level is 90 units.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.370
So, another way to think about it,

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.850
for every incremental
unit of labor we bring on,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.080
we're going to be able to
produce 90 more units of output,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.420
so this is, and then let's
say that the price of labor,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.127
which is the wage rate, is equal to $10,

00:05:12.127 --> 00:05:14.340
$10 per unit of labor.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.600
So, let me call this output units,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.640
output units.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.190
And let's say that the
marginal product of capital,

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.930
let me do this in a different color,

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.860
the marginal product of capital right now

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.440
is 80 output units,

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.273
output

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.033
units.

00:05:33.033 --> 00:05:36.100
So, every unit of this factor of capital,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.890
we are able to produce an
incremental 80 output units.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.090
And let's say that the price of capital,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.103
which would be the rent, is equal to $5,

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:51.060
$5 per input unit of the factor.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.060
So, right at this moment, if
I have an incremental dollar,

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.850
would it be more rational
for me to add more labor,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.640
or would it be more rational
for me to add more capital?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.513
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.750
Well, to think about which
one is more rational,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.670
you just have to think about which one

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.400
do I get more of a bang for my buck.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.950
So, per dollar, how many
output units do I get

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.760
when I put a dollar into labor

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.400
versus, per dollar, how
many output units do I get

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.420
when I put that dollar into capital?

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.000
So, let's do it first for labor.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.520
So, if you want your bang
for the buck, so to speak,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.230
you would just take your marginal,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.980
let me do this in a different color,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.520
if you want your bang for buck,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.360
you would just take your
marginal product of labor,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.180
so your output, and
divide it by the price.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.840
So, this is gonna tell
you output per dollar.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.721
And so, in this situation,
it's 90 output units,

00:06:45.721 --> 00:06:50.490
we could say widgets for a
general term for output units,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.270
output units, over $10,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.330
over $10.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.050
And so, this is going to be equal

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.860
to nine output units per dollar.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.500
So, this is equal to nine output units

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.350
per dollar.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.430
So, that's our measure
of our bang for our buck

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.940
when we put an incremental
buck into labor.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.960
Now, what about for capital?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.900
Well, our marginal product of capital

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.840
divided by the price of capital,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.300
right at this moment, remember it changes

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.710
depending on our output level
and different combinations,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.200
is going to be equal to 80 output units

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.313
divided by $5,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.570
which is equal to 16 output units

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.010
per dollar.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.840
So, which one would I get
a better bang for my buck?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.820
Well, right at this moment,

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.530
I'm getting a better bang for my buck

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.380
from investing in capital.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.090
Every extra dollar I put,
I get 16 output units.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.720
So, it'd be rational for this firm

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.820
that wants to maximize its
profit and reduce its cost,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.980
if it has an extra dollar to invest,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.270
it would put it into capital.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.450
And so, maybe it puts it into capital,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.340
and then it gets a little bit more output.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.290
And then the marginal product of capital

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:10.510
is likely to go down.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:12.420
And so, you could imagine, at some point,

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.120
these things might be equal,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.630
and then the firm might be
indifferent between the two.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.970
And then maybe, at some point,
if they kept adding capital,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.830
then maybe you get a better bang

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.290
for your buck from the labor.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.010
In general, a firm would wanna keep

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:29.320
investing in one or the other

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.940
until these two things
are equal to each other.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.700
So, big picture, you would
look at the marginal product

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.900
of the factor divided by
the price of the factor,

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.610
and then you'd compare that
to the marginal product

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.220
of the other factors divided by the price

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.490
of those other factors.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.810
And whichever one has the
best bang for the buck,

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.000
that's where it would be
rational to invest in.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.340
And then you have, in some ways, your,

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.040
one way is a very efficient combination,

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.030
is if you get to that point
that you're indifferent,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.870
when the marginal product
divided by the prices

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.940
of the various factors
are equal to each other.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.640
So, for example, if I were to tell you

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.560
that we are at a different
point of production,

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.850
let me cordon this off,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.350
so if we're at a different
level of production,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:14.130
where our marginal product of labor

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.930
is equal to, I'll call it 10 widgets,

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:18.120
this saves time,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.813
and let's say that the price
of labor is equal to $5,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.180
and let's say that the price
of capital is equal to $10,

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.220
what would have to be the
marginal product of capital

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.760
for me to be indifferent
between labor and capital?

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.770
Pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.930
Well, in order for me to be
indifferent right over here,

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.330
that means that my
marginal product of labor

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.020
divided by price of labor

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.910
needs to be equal to my
marginal product of capital

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.080
divided by my price of capital.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.390
And so, I would have 10 over five

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.870
would have to be equal to my

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.980
marginal product of capital over 10.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.150
So, 10 over five, this is
two widgets per dollar.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.870
And so, if I want two
widgets per dollar over here,

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.733
this has got to be equal to 20.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.280
So, at this point, I'm
indifferent between producing,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.110
between bringing on more
capital versus labor,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.160
because in either case,
every dollar I bring on,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.290
if the marginal product of capital is 20,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.320
then I'm able to get
two widgets per dollar

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.923
of investing in either factor.
