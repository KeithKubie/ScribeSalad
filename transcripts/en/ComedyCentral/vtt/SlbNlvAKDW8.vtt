00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:10.210
IN WHICH CLARENCE DARROW
ASKED SCIENTISTS TO EXPLAIN

00:00:10.244 --> 00:00:12.679
THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION.

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:14.615
BUT THE JUDGE
IN THE SCOPES MONKEY TRIAL

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.751
WAS JOHN RAULSTON,
AND HE BELIEVED...

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:21.321
- I HAVE BEEN CALLED ON
BY GOD

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.257
TO BE THE JUDGE
IN THIS CASE.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.894
SO I DON'T CARE WHAT ALL
THESE SCIENTISTS HAVE TO SAY.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:30.130
THEY CAN'T GIVE TESTIMONY.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.132
- SO CLARENCE DARROW DECIDED...

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:36.537
- OKAY, ALL OF MY WITNESSES,
THEY CAN'T GIVE TESTIMONY,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.741
SO I'LL ASK SOMEONE
WHO'S AN EXPERT ON THE BIBLE

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.643
TO GIVE THE TESTIMONY.

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:44.578
HEY...

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.780
[laughs]
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME? BRYAN.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.016
I KNOW YOU'RE ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS CASE,

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.953
BUT WHY DON'T YOU GO
ON THE WITNESS STAND,

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.389
AND I'LL QUESTION YOU
ABOUT THE BIBLE.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:02.696
- NOW, WILLIAMS JENNING BRYAN
WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.766
HE WAS, LIKE...
- OH, MY GOD.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.369
I'M GONNA DESTROY YOU
AS A WITNESS.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.271
I WILL GO
ON THE WITNESS STAND.

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:13.140
- NOW, THE JUDGE DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO DO THIS.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.476
THE JUDGE WAS PRESI--
PRESIDENTIAL.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.645
[laughs]

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.216
[laughing]

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.751
WHEN CLARENCE DARROW PUTS
WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:26.153
ON THE BIBLE, HE ASKS...

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:30.090
- DO YOU BELIEVE ALL THE STORIES
OF THE BIBLE LITERALLY?

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.160
- AND THE FIRST ANSWER
OF WILLIAMS JENNING BRYAN IS...

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.496
- YES. THE BIBLE IS LITERAL.
I BELIEVE IN IT LITERALLY.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.132
- AND THEN, ASKING HIM
SPECIFIC QUESTIONS...

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.301
- WHERE DID CAIN'S WIFE
COME FROM?

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.637
HE MADE ADAM AND EVE,
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.340
THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE,
AND CAIN FINDS A WIFE.

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:48.775
WHERE DID--
WHERE DID CAIN'S WIFE COME FROM?

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:51.478
- WILLIAMS JENNING BRYAN
GETS FLUSTERED AND SAYS...

00:01:51.512 --> 00:01:56.517
- WELL, I--I LEAVE THAT
UP TO YOU AGNOSTICS TO FIND OUT.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.252
- THAT'S ALL CLARENCE DARROW
NEEDED.

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.555
- SO YOU'RE NOT INTERPRETING
THE BIBLE LITERALLY.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.091
AND HE GOES ON TO DESTROY

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.426
WILLIAMS JENNINGS BRYAN
ON FACTS.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.128
- GREAT.
ARE YOU STILL SPINNING,

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.563
OR HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.631
- WELL, I'M...

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.466
- I'M DIZZY.
- MM-HMM.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.501
- I FEEL WEIRD.

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:17.704
I FEEL LIKE I THINK I KNOW
WHERE I'M GOING, AND THEN...

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:20.340
- I GET UTTERLY CONFUSED
ABOUT...

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.609
- WHERE I THOUGHT
I WAS GOING.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:25.512
I KNOW...
[laughs]

00:02:25.546 --> 00:02:28.081
I'M GONNA GET FACEBOOK
RESPONSES FOR THIS.

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:29.750
- THIS WAS THE COMPLETE
DESTRUCTION

00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:31.652
OF WILLIAMS JENNING BRYAN.

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:35.155
AND WILLIAMS JENNING BRYAN
LOOKS LIKE A FOOL.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.158
BUT WILLIAMS JENNING BRYAN
KNOWS...

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:44.097
- I HAVE THE MOST AMAZING
CLOSING ARGUMENT TO MAKE.
