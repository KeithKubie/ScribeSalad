00:00:00.356 --> 00:00:02.252
- [Voiceover] A circle
is centered on point B.

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:03.391
We see that right over there.

00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.135
That's the center of
this big, blue circle.

00:00:06.364 --> 00:00:08.728
Points A, C, and D lie
on its circumference.

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:09.383
We see that.

00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:13.216
Points A, C, and D lie
on the circumference.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:16.035
If angle ABC...

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:20.391
So ABC; So that's this
central angle right over here;

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:23.275
measures 132 degrees.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.305
Alright, so this is 132 degrees.

00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:28.402
What does angle ADC measure?

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.811
A, D, C.

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.841
So let's think about
how these are related.

00:00:33.023 --> 00:00:35.607
ABC is a central angle.

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:39.212
ADC is an inscribed angle.

00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:42.043
And they intercept the same arc.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.397
The arc AC.

00:00:43.397 --> 00:00:46.773
They both intercept this
arc right over here.

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.538
And we know from the
inscribed angle theorem

00:00:51.723 --> 00:00:54.784
that an inscribed angle
that intercepts the same arc

00:00:54.784 --> 00:00:58.208
as a central angle is going to
have half the angle measure.

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.744
And it even looks that
way right over here.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.629
So if ABC-

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.083
if the central angle is 132 degrees,

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:06.674
then the inscribed angle
that intercepts the same arc

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:07.859
is going to be half of that.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.128
So half of 132 degrees is what?

00:01:11.128 --> 00:01:13.276
It is 66 degrees.

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:17.978
We can check our answer,
and we got it right.
