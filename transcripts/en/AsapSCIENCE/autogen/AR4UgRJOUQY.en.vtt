00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
 We all exaggerate and lie, but when we are alone online 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.805
 Our Google search record quickly reveals the truth 

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.960
 Using more than 3 billion searches a day 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.480
 We can discover a lot about human desires and our secret concerns 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.320
 So how much does this data reflect you? 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.660
 First, people suffer to have sex 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.020
 Searches for "sexless" are 3.5 times more than "unhappy marriages" 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.600
 And 8 times more common than "marriage without love" 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.140
 Despite the prevailing assumption that women's sexual appetite is lower than that of men 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.960
 The likelihood of women looking for the phrase "my friend does not want to have sex with me" is twice that of men 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.080
 Who are looking for "my girlfriend do not want to have sex with me" 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.400
 If you are worried that you do not have sex as much as others do 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.480
 They know that they are exaggerating too 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.580
 In view of gender (between man and woman), an expanded referendum found that 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 Women say they have sex 55 times a year, using a condom 16% of the time 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.960
 Which means 1.1 billion condoms a year 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 Similarly, men claim to use 1.6 billion condoms 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.360
 While in America, only 600 million condoms are sold per year. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.260
 The lack of sex may be rooted in the lack of self-confidence in the body 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.660
 Not surprisingly, men search Google for their bars 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.220
 More than any other member, 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.100
 In fact, even more than their total search for lung, liver, foot, ear, nose, throat and brain are combined. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300
 In return for every search conducted by a woman about her partner's penis 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200
 There are 170 searches by the man about his penis. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.600
 But, men, do not worry too much about the issue of size 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.580
 40% of women complain that the penis is too large to be painful. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.320
 When a woman conducts a research related to her disability 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.920
 By 30%, the questions relate to the opinion of others, especially the smell 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.400
 Also, women are looking for how to make a better lymphoma, twice more than men. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.740
 When a man is looking for oral sex tips 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 They are looking for how to perform for the partner 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.560
 Just as much as they are looking for how they perform for themselves. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.360
 Speaking of pornography, it is among the top 100 searches on Bourne 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 There are 16 searches for men incest, and 9 for women 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.360
 Such as "brother and sister", "father's wife", "father and daughter", "real brother and sister" 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.420
 Pornographic searches can also answer important questions about sexuality in humans. 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.740
 In America, a 5% share of research among men relates to male relativity 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.900
 But survey data and Facebook reports show that only 2 to 3 percent of men know themselves as gay 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.000
 Number of men who identify themselves as gay in public 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.640
 Doubles in Rhode Island, the most supportive state for gay marriage 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.420
 Compared to Mississippi, a less supportive state. 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.540
 One explanation may be that those living in less forgiving states move to more tolerant states 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.840
 But statistics show that this interpretation only applies to half of this difference 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.020
 Unfortunately, millions of Americans are hiding their truth. 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.420
 Combine this with Google's autocomplete data, which is calibrated based on the most popular research 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.940
 You'll find that once you start typing "Do my husband" 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.040
 Will be added to "gay" 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.860
 Women write this with a probability of 10% greater than they say "Does my husband betray me" 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.940
 It is the second most common choice. 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.160
 In 21 states out of 25, where the phrase "Is my husband gay" more prevalent. 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.020
 Support for gay marriage was below the national average. 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.060
 This also applies to transgender meetings on Krajigslist 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.480
 Where ads from men are looking for more men in less forgiving states 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.100
 Up to the maximum in Kentucky, Louisiana and Alabama 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.360
 Google AutoComplete will not suggest some words, which it thinks are inappropriate 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.260
 Such as "cock" or "porn", but if you say "Is it normal to want to .." 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.740
 Google used to complete the word "kill" 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.360
 Similarly, only a few want to acknowledge remorse for having children 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.660
 But adults with children are 3.6 times more likely 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.960
 In telling Google to regret having children of adults without children 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.020
 Who regret not having children. 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.020
 Google also tells us how racism is still alive and well 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.280
 The prefix with the letter "N" appears in searches with the same proportion as the "Lakers" 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.940
 And "hemorrhagic", of which 20% includes the words "jokes" 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 On the first night of Obama's election in 2008, most analyzes were focused on 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.300
 Praise for this historic night 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.480
 One out of every 100 searches for Obama's word 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.400
 The term KKK, or the word N, is included 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.840
 Typically, many assume that most racism exists in the southern states 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.400
 But the highest results of racial research were in northern New York, western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.140
 Statistics scientist Net Silver found the highest statistical correlation to predict Trump's basic support 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.120
 It was not unemployment, arms, religion, or immigration 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.560
 But he was searching Google for the word N 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.020
 Facebook data scientists used personal status publications to measure total happiness for a day 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.960
 Christmas seems to be the happiest day of the year 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.420
 This appears in Gallup surveys and Google searches as well 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.200
 But it is also necessary to be skeptical of what people see on social media 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 The respected Atlantic magazine has 1.5 million followers on Twitter 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.520
 While there are only 18,000 followers of the National Enquirer, the magazine Nimeema 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.960
 But both have the same proportion of paper and virtual distribution. 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.900
 Or imagine the difference between a woman and her husband on Facebook and what he describes on Google 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.880
 On Facebook, the most commonly used phrases to describe a pair are 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.220
 Best, favorite friend, wonderful, great, very tender 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.480
 While the top searches on Google related to the pair will be 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.420
 Gay, idiot, gorgeous, annoying, lame 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.400
 We decided to take a look at the history record of each of us 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.060
 We discovered very interesting things about each other 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.340

 Research in this episode relied on the wonderful book "All People Lied" 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.720
