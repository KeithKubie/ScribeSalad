Finally, there's a Resources page.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.040
Resources are a simple folder
structure for documents, etc.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.660
In this class, for example, we see
an image, a PDF file, and transcripts.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.150
&gt;&gt; Different classes will use
the resources folder differently.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.620
You'll often see course readings here,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.940
past exams here, other assignment
files here, solutions here, etc.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.440
Some classes will even have you
upload files to the Resources

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.010
folder to share with your classmates.
