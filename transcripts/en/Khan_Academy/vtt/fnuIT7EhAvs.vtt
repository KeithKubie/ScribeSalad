00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.137
Solve P equals 2l plus 2w for l.

00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:07.970
So this right here,
this is just the formula

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.290
for the perimeter
of a rectangle.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.480
Perimeter is equal
to 2 times the length

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.060
plus 2 times the width.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.940
But they just want us to solve
this equation right here,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.750
solve for l.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.670
So let's do that.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.900
So we have P is equal to
2 times l plus 2 times w.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.650
So we need to solve for l.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.106
So let's isolate all of
the l terms on one side.

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:30.730
And the best way, we
could just do that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.670
by leaving it here
on the right and then

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.637
getting rid of this 2w.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:35.220
And the best way to
get rid of this 2w

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.217
is to subtract it
from the right.

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:39.300
But if you're going to
subtract it from the right,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.050
you also have to
subtract it from the left

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.100
if you want this
equality to hold.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.500
So you have to also
subtract it from the left.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.127
And so the left-hand
side becomes P minus 2w.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.830
And the right-hand
side, you get--

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.290
this 2w minus 2w cancels out.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.620
You just have a 2l.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.120
And then if you
want to solve for l,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.080
you just have to divide both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.850
You just divide both sides
of this equation by 2.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.800
And we have isolated our l.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.100
We get l is equal to
P minus 2w over 2.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.160
Or if we wanted to
write it the other way,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.350
you could write l is equal
to P minus 2w over 2.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.742
And we are done.
