people about how would you know when a
robot was at the point that it had

robot was at the point that it had
 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.140

enough of a sense of itself and its

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.700
it will be an interesting question and

it will be an interesting question and

it will be an interesting question and
and it won't just be an intellectual

question because one of the fascinating
 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.340
question because one of the fascinating
things about robots is there's been a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350
things about robots is there's been a
 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.039
things about robots is there's been a
whole series of experiments that show if

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049
whole series of experiments that show if
 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:02.369
whole series of experiments that show if
you create a robot that moves but just

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379
you create a robot that moves but just
 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.170
you create a robot that moves but just
looks like a whole bunch of gears and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180
looks like a whole bunch of gears and
 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.840
looks like a whole bunch of gears and
you give someone a sledge hammer and say

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850
you give someone a sledge hammer and say
 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.200
you give someone a sledge hammer and say
smash it they'll smash it if you put a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210
smash it they'll smash it if you put a
 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.660
smash it they'll smash it if you put a
little furry cover on it so now it moves

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670
little furry cover on it so now it moves
 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.460
little furry cover on it so now it moves
but it looks organic or it looks more

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470
but it looks organic or it looks more
 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.370
but it looks organic or it looks more
organic they won't hit it and so as soon

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380
organic they won't hit it and so as soon
 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.779
organic they won't hit it and so as soon
as you begin to make robotic forms look

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789
as you begin to make robotic forms look
 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:23.700
as you begin to make robotic forms look
more like organic forms whether you make

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710
more like organic forms whether you make
 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.550
more like organic forms whether you make
them humanoid whether you make them more

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
them humanoid whether you make them more
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.389
them humanoid whether you make them more
animal appearing people are very very

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399
animal appearing people are very very
 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.609
animal appearing people are very very
reluctant to harm them so we already

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619
reluctant to harm them so we already
 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.520
reluctant to harm them so we already
have robots that in one sense or another

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530
have robots that in one sense or another
 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.160
have robots that in one sense or another
are being treated like animals not like

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170
are being treated like animals not like
 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.410
are being treated like animals not like
robots right because really there's no

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420
robots right because really there's no
 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.389
robots right because really there's no
reason not to smash a robot I mean

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399
reason not to smash a robot I mean
 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.609
reason not to smash a robot I mean
except for the expense of it it's no

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619
except for the expense of it it's no
 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.109
except for the expense of it it's no
different than smashing your toaster

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119
different than smashing your toaster
 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.029
different than smashing your toaster
right nobody would say oh it's wrong to

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039
right nobody would say oh it's wrong to
 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.340
right nobody would say oh it's wrong to
smash your toaster and yet as soon as

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
smash your toaster and yet as soon as
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.590
smash your toaster and yet as soon as
you begin to give the appearance of of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600
you begin to give the appearance of of
 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.679
you begin to give the appearance of of
some sort of life to robots

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689
some sort of life to robots
 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.929
some sort of life to robots
people begin to project onto it the

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939
people begin to project onto it the
 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.389
people begin to project onto it the
feelings that they project onto life so

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399
feelings that they project onto life so
 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.859
feelings that they project onto life so
as robots get more and more

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869
as robots get more and more
 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.359
as robots get more and more
sophisticated as they look more and more

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
sophisticated as they look more and more
 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.000
sophisticated as they look more and more
humanoid emotionally we're going to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
humanoid emotionally we're going to
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.250
humanoid emotionally we're going to
begin to want to treat them more like

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260
begin to want to treat them more like
 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.590
begin to want to treat them more like
human beings and that's why the question

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600
human beings and that's why the question
 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.540
human beings and that's why the question
is so difficult because there is the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550
is so difficult because there is the
 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.449
is so difficult because there is the
question of when do they deserve it

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459
question of when do they deserve it
 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.890
question of when do they deserve it
divorce from our emotional reaction to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900
divorce from our emotional reaction to
 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.370
divorce from our emotional reaction to
that when do they actually

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
that when do they actually
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.320
that when do they actually
reach the point of having an internal

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
reach the point of having an internal
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.830
reach the point of having an internal
life for example and that we don't

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840
life for example and that we don't
 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.230
life for example and that we don't
really know the answer to that because I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240
really know the answer to that because I
 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.510
really know the answer to that because I
know that I haven't I know that you have

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520
know that I haven't I know that you have
 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.460
know that I haven't I know that you have
an internal life or that anyone watching

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470
an internal life or that anyone watching
 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.260
an internal life or that anyone watching
this has an internal life because I have

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
this has an internal life because I have
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.210
this has an internal life because I have
one and I'm a human being in your in

human being so I assume you have one too

to create a thinking creature the moment

to create a thinking creature the moment
when that creature has an internal life

difference between those two things is a

difference between those two things is a
very very difficult question and one

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890
very very difficult question and one

very very difficult question and one
