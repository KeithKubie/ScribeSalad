JOSH HUDGINS: Good morning.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.390
So I'm Josh Hudgins.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm a Product Manager
on Drive.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.700
This is my esteemed colleague,
Steve Bazyl, a Developer

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.450
Advocate for Drive.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.350
We're going to spend a few
minutes this morning talking

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.250
about your apps and getting them
noticed inside of Google

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.445
Drive and the value Drive
can deliver to

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:20.695
your app as a platform.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.920
So I'm going start
with this quote.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.450
"The best computer you have is
the one you have when you want

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.060
to get something done." And
this speaks to how we're

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.060
increasingly living in
a multi-device world.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.020
I think that's a reality that
pretty much everybody here

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.420
would be familiar with.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.870
But the part of that I really
want to focus on is when you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.700
reach for whatever device is
near you to do something,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.120
users are increasingly expecting
to only be able to

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.650
do what they want on that device
but that their data is

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.980
also on that device as well,
that if they don't have the

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.110
data they need when they reach
for their tablet or their

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.930
laptop synced across all their
devices, it's increasingly

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.070
being viewed as a bug,
as a lack of feature.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.080
So one of the things we can
deliver to you in Drive as

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.800
part of a platform
is that ability.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.030
But there are lots of platforms
that can do that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.880
sort of syncing functionality.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
So what I want to talk about
this morning is why I think

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.620
Drive is the right one and some
of the unique values that

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.840
Drive brings to the table as a
platform to help you acquire

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.780
users but also deliver the
features that users expect, in

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.640
terms of data synchronization.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.230
So Drive is a platform that does
sync all these things.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.260
And this was the original
marketing position end of

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.430
Drive was all your stuff synced
in the cloud, safe

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.820
wherever you want it.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.570
Why it's growing so rapidly and
what makes it unique and

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.430
what our users are really coming
to like and enjoy about

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.320
the product is that we provide
you not only with standard

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.960
syncing and storage but
also a very rich

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.440
experience in the cloud.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.250
You don't have to download your
files to a device to do

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.240
something with them.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.070
And there's a lot of different
ways we do this.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.170
One of the ways is Preview.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.070
You don't have to download
your file and have local

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.110
software in order to view
most file types.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.620
Drive offers out-of-the-box on
the web previews for over 4 of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.350
the most common file types
that users store.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.390
You can also comment
on anything.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.960
You can comment on things in
Docs, Slides, and Sheets, the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.660
applications native to Drive.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.330
Or you can comment on things
like images or Word docs or

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940
Excel spreadsheets or
PDFs or anything.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.470
So you can collaborate
with other users

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.945
around any type of file.

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:20.160
We also have some really
interesting search

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.370
capabilities.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.850
Whenever you upload anything
into Drive, especially things

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.200
like images or PDFs, we will OCR
them and extract text that

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.000
makes it searchable.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.780
But we also run that
image through the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.660
Google Goggles' backend.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.080
Which means if you have, say, a
picture of Mount Everest, it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.200
will recognize that when
you search for Everest.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.670
Some really, really cool stuff
that's unique to Drive.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.760
You can share anything
with other users.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.675
You can share things that you
can edit with an app.

00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:46.400
You can share images.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.640
You can share any file type in
Drive with other users and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.290
work with those users
on things.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.450
And then the thing I want to
focus on this morning that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.675
makes it a unique experience
in the cloud are apps.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.890
Now from the very beginning,
Drive has been about apps.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.890
Before Drive was Drive,
it was a suite of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.220
products called Docs.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.570
These were collaborative
web-based applications that

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.230
let people work together
in the cloud.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.720
So Drive, over time,
increasingly became the fabric

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.010
that tied these apps together.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.810
And then it was rebranded Drive
last year and launch.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.680
And these apps are still
the core part of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.920
what makes Drive special.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.970
So when we sat back and looked
at that, we decided it made a

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.600
whole lot of sense to not
limited users to just those

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.070
apps but open up the platform
for anybody to build apps like

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.415
those on top of Drive
as a platform.

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:32.660
And that's what I want
to talk about.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.860
You can integrate with Drive
in a lot of different ways.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.600
You can have, say, an Android
app and use Drive as a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.080
harddrive in the cloud.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.210
But one of the most unique and
I think interesting ways you

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.340
can integrate with Drive is you
can take your web app and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.060
make it deeply integrated in
the Drive UI, and it will

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.230
appear just like the native
Drive apps, like Docs and

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.455
Slides and Sheets.

00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:53.690
And it turns out that users
love this feature.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.900
The apps that we've launched,
we're up to over 150 of these

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.020
kinds of deeply integrated
apps.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.600
And users are using them and
installing them like crazy.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.520
The weekly install growth
rate is growing 8%

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.660
on average per week.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.330
Users are really, really
happy with it.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.850
So Drive is a platform.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.160
Joseph Walla, the CEO of
HelloFax, recently wrote a

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.170
very interesting article for
all things D, talking about

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.040
the value of Drive as a platform
in terms of cheaply

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.700
delivering users.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.250
And it was a really interesting
article, and I

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.750
want to focus on this quote.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.790
"350,000 installs worth of
Google integrations.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.800
Didn't spend the single cent
to acquire them." And that

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.210
speaks to the value of Drive as
a platform and its ability

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.350
to deliver users to your
app, as app developers.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.600
So it can deliver the users.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.540
But what's even more interesting
than the fact that

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.730
you can gain users by
integrating with this as a

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.620
platform is the type of
user you can gain.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.380
And what I want to focus on is
the quality and the unique

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.600
characteristics of
these users.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.870
So we talk to our
partners a lot.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.520
And we asked them, what kinds
of usage patterns are you

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.530
seeing for your users that you
acquire through Drive, versus

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.500
users that you might have
acquired through your

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.560
traditional user acquisition
channels?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.800
I have a few case studies
I want to share.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.510
The first one is SlideRocket.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.920
So they compared their Drive
users to their non-Drive users

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.010
and saw some very interesting
patterns that we'll see

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.270
repeated throughout
the case studies.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.990
The Drive users were three
times as active.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.290
And they were over three and
a half times more likely to

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.590
create a presentation.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.210
And then something that will
be interesting when we talk

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.090
about acquisition channels in
a minute, 26% of the users

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.500
they acquired came through one
SlideRocket user through Drive

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.950
sharing a presentation with
another Drive user.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.170
The next one is Lucidchart.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.600
Lucidchart has been
very successful

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.210
on the Drive platform.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.260
And they have very similar
patterns to their numbers.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.780
And this speaks to an element
I think is also even maybe

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.620
even more important than
engagement, and that's the

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.150
ability to monetize
your conversion.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.375
The users that Lucidchart chart
acquires from Drive,

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:57.920
versus the ones they acquire
through traditional channels,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.110
convert 40% more often.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.360
They create three times
as many documents.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.850
When used within the enterprise,
the teams are 50%

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.560
larger, and they spend four
times as much time in the app,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.320
which is a really remarkable
set of characteristics.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.460
So the users they acquire
through Drive tend to be much

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.650
more monetizable and
much more engaged.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.440
These are very valuable users
they're acquiring.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.710
And the last one is HelloFax.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.280
And we talked about HelloFax
a second ago.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.470
And you see something
similar is there.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.080
Drive users create over a
quarter more faxes than

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.950
non-Drive users.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.120
And they send twice as many
documents out for signature.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.950
So these users that they're
acquiring through these

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.990
channels, very valuable, very
engaged, high-quality users.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.960
So what do we do in Drive as
a platform to deliver these

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.290
users to your app?

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.150
And then Steve will talk about
how you can best take

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.890
advantage of these acquisition
channels.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.310
I just want to walk through a
handful them and just give you

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.910
a sense for the things we do to
deliver these high-quality

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.060
engaged users.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.070
This is something we launched
in Q1 of this year.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.680
And we totally re-architected
the Drive Create menu.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.820
In the past, if you have any
experience with this as a

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.810
platform, if you were a
third-party app, you were

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.230
difficult to discover.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.070
You were buried under
a submenu.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.460
We were highlighting our
first-party apps.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.440
Now you can see the way
it looks today.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.630
You have the first-party apps
there in the left column.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.580
But as users install
more apps, these

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.820
are given equal billing.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.950
Very discoverable, very easy to
find after if you install

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.820
it, and it really centers the
message that we're trying to

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.040
convey that this
is a platform.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.660
We really want users to engage
with your apps, with

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.150
third-party apps, and the new
Create menu reflects that.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.850
Another really interesting
aspect of this feature, you'll

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.380
notice down at the bottom the
Connect More Apps button.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.210
In the past, surfacing the store
where you could find

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:45.740
Drive apps was very difficult.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.160
But now it's almost impossible
to miss.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.130
And that drives more and more
users to the listing.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.330
In fact, when we compared the
install rate for the month

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.090
prior to this feature launch to
the month after, we found

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.480
that users were installing these
apps at a 68% increased

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.160
rate after the feature
launched.

00:08:05.004 --> 00:08:08.550
Another way we're helping you
succeed on our platform is if

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.080
you have any experience, if
you've use the Drive platform

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.100
as a Drive app before, you
remember we had an install

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.000
flow that wasn't entirely
optimal.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.540
It was based on the
Chrome Web Store.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.620
So when a user installed
the app, you got

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.990
a Chrome app installed.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.980
And then you also had the app
installed into Drive.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.280
And that was a bit confusing
to users.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.960
Well, we fixed all that.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.430
Now when you click that giant
Connect More Apps button in

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.160
the Create menu, you
get this, an

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.650
in-context Drive app widget.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.980
It doesn't force the user to go
off to a separately-branded

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.770
Chrome Web Store.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.530
It's an in-Drive installation
process.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.590
And the flow is really
smooth now.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.420
So I can simply connect
an app.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.370
And you can see you get this
nice dialogue here.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.510
Floorplanner was connected.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.500
And then it's going to promo
the user back to the Create

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.810
menu so that they can find
how to launch the app.

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:55.900
So we're really hoping to
simplify that process so users

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.580
can install apps easily and then
discover how to use them

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.830
in the app more easily.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.350
I think this may be the
most important one.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.460
And that's the things we do
around the sharing flow.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.380
In this example, in
uses Lucidchart.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.030
So imagine I create a Lucidchart
diagram, and then I

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.210
want to share it with
some colleagues

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.940
that I'm working with.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.320
They don't have the
app installed.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.070
They may never even have
heard of Lucidchart.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.810
But when I share it to them,
they'll see this here in this

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.480
little highlighted
box on the left.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.650
That's the "Shared
With Me" view.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.380
And the Lucidchart item
shows up there.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.300
Now as a recipient of that,
I may not even know what

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:28.820
Lucidchart.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.420
Is.

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.980
I don't know how to go find
it and install it.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.600
But fortunately, we take
care of that for you.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.220
As soon as you click on that
item, it will pop up this

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.380
Lucidchart install dialog.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.520
All the user has to do is like,
yeah, that sounds great.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.700
Connect and done.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.770
You can open that diagram that
someone shared with you and

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.850
begin editing it right away.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:47.660
So that's a great user
acquisition channel.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.920
Because people in Drive
love to share

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:50.875
things with other users.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.830
And as they start to share,
installs of your app can

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.250
spread with those sharing
networks, which is an

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.800
incredibly valuable feature.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.430
The last one is some things
we're doing with

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.960
the new Drive Previewer.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.040
If you use Drive, you might have
noticed that we launched

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.050
a new in-context Preview
with the black

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.380
lightbox-style viewer.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.720
And this allows you to preview
tons of different file types

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.480
right there in the
context of Drive.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.470
There's a feature that's coming
where you can click

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.030
Connect More Apps down
there on the bottom,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.150
off the Open menu.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.230
And depending on what you're
looking at, if you're looking

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:23.200
at an image--

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.690
In this particular example, the
user is looking at some

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.715
sort of audio file.

00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:29.880
When they click it, it's going
to show you the apps

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.160
specifically scoped to be able
to do something with

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.090
that type of file.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.830
So if a user's looking at a
type of file and it like,

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.940
there's not much I can do with
this, they can easily go look

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.910
for apps that can do something
more with it.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.340
And that's where your app can
really step in and provide a

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.500
much better experience for
that type of file.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.810
So that's how we're helping
deliver more

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.170
users to your app.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.070
And now Steve's going to come
talk about different ways you

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.540
can take advantage of
Drive as a platform.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.555
STEVEN BAZYL: Thanks, Josh.

00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:02.290
As Josh showed, there's a lot
of opportunity for apps that

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.450
integrate with Drive.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.170
And I want to talk to you
about how to take

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.040
advantage of that.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.220
I'm not going to do a detailed
walk through how to

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.180
build a Drive app.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.640
Honestly, it's really not that
hard and between the

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.260
documentation on
developers.google.com, the

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.130
sample apps that we have on
GitHub, I'm pretty sure

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:20.990
everyone in this room is going
to be able to figure it out

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.360
without too much difficulty.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.420
That said, I do want to talk
about the general process for

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.110
building an app, because there's
a few things that you

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.680
do along the way that have a
significant impact on how

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.370
users perceive your app.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.310
And if done right, your chances
of being noticed by

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.040
users and adopted, as you saw
with vendors like HelloFax, is

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.200
dramatically better.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.270
If you don't do these things
well, the chances of your app

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:50.060
being discovered by users
is close to nil.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.010
So in terms of building a Drive
app, the process is

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.860
pretty easy.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.200
And for those who have used
Google APIs before, you've

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.220
probably been to the Google
APIs console.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.000
It's a really easy tool for
where you create your project.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.100
This is where you just tell us
about your app, tell us how

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.360
it's connecting, which
APIs it's using.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.110
And it's also where you can
figure how your application

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.260
integrates with the Drive UI.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.230
It's pretty easy to
create a project.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.310
And once you do that, one of the
first things they're going

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.770
to do is configure OAuth.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.070
Hopefully everybody here
is familiar with OAuth.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:25.850
It's just a protocol for you
to securely access our APIs

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.780
and the users' data.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.920
And to create an OAuth client
ID, you just need to provide a

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.550
few bits of information.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.590
It's basically some branding
information to identify your

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:38.640
application, the name, icons,
what type of application it

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.500
is-- in this case, we're talking
about web apps--

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.450
and where it's hosted.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.300
Pretty easy stuff.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.730
And then once that's done, you
get a client ID and a secret

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.030
that's generated for you, and
use that in your code.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.990
The other thing that comes into
OAuth is the level of

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.000
access that your application
needs.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.560
And the reason why I want to
bring up this is all of this

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.980
information is presented
to users at a

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.420
really critical time.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.040
It's when they're being asked to
make a judgment call about

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.000
whether or not they trust your
app to access their data.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.230
And you usually see a
screen like this.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.660
So in this case, this
is Lucidchart.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.790
They actually did everything
right here.

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.750
They asked for a very, very
small amount of access, just

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.140
the files that the user created
or they chose open.

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.490
They have really nice branding
information.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.295
There's really not that much
reason to think that this app

00:13:30.295 --> 00:13:33.190
is untrustworthy.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.830
You'd be surprised with the
number of apps that I've seen

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.060
that have things like "test"
or "staging" in their name,

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.090
because the developers never
went back and actually updated

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.850
this information, or they
have a broken icon.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.370
But more significantly is
the level of access.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:49.540
And that can actually have a
dramatic impact on whether or

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.010
not users are going to click
Allow Access or No Thanks.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.720
Drive offer a pretty broad range
of scopes for the level

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.470
of access you have to Drive.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.090
You can ask for very restrictive
access, just

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:08.360
individual files that the user
chooses to share with you,

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.460
various levels of read-only
access to metadata to content.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.880
And then at the opposite end,
full access to the user's

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.450
Drive, where you can do pretty
much anything you want.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.820
If you ask for a lot of access,
you really should have

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.210
a good reason to do it.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.850
And it should be clear from what
your app does why you're

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.320
asking for that level
of detail.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.110
Users really do pay
attention to this.

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:36.530
And we've seen apps that have
requested just far, far, far

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.040
too many permissions for what
the app was really designed to

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.570
do and have seen the
accept rates for

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.305
these installs to drop.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.360
So once you've done OAuth,
there's one other thing you

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.150
have to do, which is just turn
on access to Drive API.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.920
And then once you've done
this, you've actually

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.970
completed basically the
first couple steps of

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.540
our Quickstart examples.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.920
And if you haven't used the
Drive API before, I would

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.720
encourage you to actually go and
go to the documentation.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.610
And right at the top of the page
are a set of Quickstarts.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.910
And they're in different
languages, different

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.590
server-side languages, some
mobile ones as well, and they

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.780
take about five minutes
to get up and started.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.690
And what you saw of just
creating that OAuth client is

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.450
probably three or four minutes
of that exercise.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.290
It's really easy.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.450
The nice things with these
Quickstarts is they give you a

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.720
platform where you can
experiment with the API.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.230
Because you're up and running
with a working application in

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.870
just a few minutes, and then
you start learning the API,

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.740
modifying that code, and getting
a better feel for how

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.490
it works in the language
of your choice.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:43.580
So let's fast forward and say
that we've done this.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.260
We've played with
the Quickstart.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.560
We've learned how do reading
and writing of files, and

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.440
everything's good.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.400
And now we're ready to actually
integrate our app in

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.530
the UI so that we can do all of
the things that Josh showed

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.550
you, where I can create a file,
I can open things and

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.800
launch my application.

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.620
When you enable the Drive SDK
in the console, you get an

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.760
additional page in
the console.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.250
And there's really two sets of
information that you need to

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.050
provide here.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.870
One is largely cosmetic.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.230
It's a lot of information
about your app name,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.490
description, and icons.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.630
And these are things that
affect how your app is

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.960
presented to the user
within Drive.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.900
When you're developing, you
don't have to pay too much

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.250
attention to these.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.350
But when it comes to going into
production, make sure

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:30.770
that these are high-quality
images, that the description

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.500
of your application is short
and it's concise, it's

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.330
reflective of what
your app does.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.480
Because these are some of the
things that are show to users

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.730
in those different scenarios
that Josh showed you.

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:48.230
The other bit of information
that you need to provide is

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.790
information about how your app
connects with Google Drive.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.640
And this is more the
functional section.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.110
And there's two things, really,
the URL for your

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.140
application.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.260
When somebody clicks Open
or the click Create,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.110
where do they go?

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.520
The other thing that's really
important is the types of

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.210
files that your application
can work with.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.420
And the reason I want to point
is it can actually have a

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.230
dramatic impact on the
user experience.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.701
There are two sets of files
here that we have.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.669
We have what we call default
types, and we have what we

00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:18.280
call secondary types.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.910
And for either one, you can do
MIME types or file extensions.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:21.910
And we take the union.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.069
So it works they way
you would expect.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.810
But the difference between
default and secondary is

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.069
important to understand.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.860
If you put a file type in the
default section, that means

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.550
every time a user clicks on a
file of that type your app is

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.975
going to be the default
action.

00:17:35.975 --> 00:17:40.370
If it's in the secondary type,
it means that your app can

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:42.730
open that file but the user
would have to do it a

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.030
right-click or a contextual
open.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:49.410
The reason this is important is
we see far too many apps be

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:53.470
overzealous about claiming file
types and making their

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.310
app the default for them, things
that really aren't

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.430
appropriate for that
application.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.400
And to give you an example of
the extreme of where this

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.990
would be bad is suppose I built
an online printing or

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.540
fax application.

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:12.910
If I put 20 different document
types as the default, that

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.390
would just annoy the
user to no end.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.430
And the consequence is either
that user is going to have to

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.820
go into the Settings, and
they're going to have to

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.240
change the configuration to
make my app no longer the

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.360
default, or worse, and probably
more likely, is

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.170
they're just going to uninstall
my app because it's

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.190
just not behaving correctly.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.520
So you really want to be
thoughtful here about which

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.640
files you want your app to be
the default for and which ones

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.580
you just want to be capable of
opening, and probably err on

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.820
the conservative side.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.290
If you become the default, you
can significantly change the

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.080
behavior of how Drive
works for that user.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.900
And if not done right, it can
be a really negative change

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.150
for those users.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.210
And here you can see this
is just the view.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.560
If you're a secondary type, you
appear in the Open With.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.310
So you can still open files,
just one click removed in

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:00.560
order to protect the
user experience.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.040
So let's fast forward
a little bit more.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:06.900
We've written some code.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.440
We handled these URLs.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.370
And we configured everything
in the SDK settings.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:13.170
We need to install our app.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:14.750
And there's two ways
you can do this.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.670
We have one through the Install
mechanism that Josh

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:20.160
showed with embedded Chrome
Web Store widget.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.840
A simpler way-- and this
is a great way

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.270
to do it for testing--

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.640
is to OAuth.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.200
And so you can just authorize
your application, include one

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.410
additional scope called the
drive.install.scope, and your

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.230
app will be enabled, and you get
all those cool features.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.530
And the nice thing is this
actually works really well in

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.680
production too.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.470
So when you combine it with
something like the Google+

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.510
Sign In button, you can actually
have a really amazing

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:46.060
experience where I can go to an
application, I can sign in,

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.100
and I get things like the
Drive app installation.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.400
But I also get things like
over-the-air installation if a

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.360
multi-platform app.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.940
And it's just with one click.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.390
So it's a really nice
user experience.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.370
And it's something that, if you
have a lot of users coming

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:03.110
to your site directly, they
can benefit from the

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.110
integration with Drive without
having to go through

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.910
additional steps in order to
go to Drive and install the

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:09.500
app separately.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.360
So you can actually just do
this all in one gesture.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.740
The other way, though,
as I mentioned, is

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.700
a Chrome Web Store.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.325
And Josh showed you what
that widget looks like.

00:20:18.325 --> 00:20:20.730
And we're doing an embedded
view of Chrome

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.680
Web Store for Drive.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.410
But the way that you configure
that application and the way

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:27.140
that you provide those assets
is still through

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.690
the Chrome Web Store.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.460
And a lot of the rules for the
Chrome Web Store, in terms of

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.510
how you construct your app,
what you need to provide,

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.230
still apply for the
Drive case.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.330
A couple things I want
to point out.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.250
Again, the process for doing
this is not difficult.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.170
And you can go to the
documentation and go to the

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.210
Chrome Web Store console, and
you'll figure it out.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.050
But I do want to point out some
of the things that users

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.830
see so you'll understand, the
information that you're

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.840
providing, how that reflects in
Drive and how we show apps.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.380
Of course, we have the different
tile images and the

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:57.840
short description of
your application.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.610
And these are the first things
users are going to see when

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.570
they're trying to discover
applications.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.200
It's a little known fact about
these images when you create

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.140
an entry in the Chrome Web
Store, and that's that they're

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.030
all manually reviewed.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.950
There's actually strict
guidelines about what these

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:17.770
images can contain in order
for them to be approved.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:20.070
You don't want these images
to be rejected.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.110
If you do, the chances of your
app being discovered by a user

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.970
are effectively zero.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.760
You will appear below every
other app that has done the

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.920
process correctly.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.420
And worse, you will get these
little teeny tiny tiles that

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.850
really just show your icon and
your application name.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.110
As a user, I have very little
incentive to go and click on

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:41.510
any one of those apps.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.700
Those are simply
not appealing.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.630
And knowing that those
developers didn't go through

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.230
the proper steps in order to
make their app interesting to

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.490
me throws a lot of doubt into
my mind whether or not that

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.670
app is really worth using.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.060
So some of the things that can
get those images rejected are

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.990
things like too much text, too
little text-- if the font

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.550
sizes are too small
and unreadable--

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.330
the images are blurry,
if they're too busy.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.260
Generally, you can go to
the Chrome Web Store

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.630
documentation, and there's a
list of six or seven different

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:17.680
criteria for what makes
a good image.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.610
And there's some examples of
some bad images and some good

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.380
images that you can use
as a reference.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.190
These are not difficult
things.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:28.670
It probably takes you an hour
or two to have a really nice

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:30.210
image crafted up for you.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:31.280
But it works.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.150
And the difference between going
through this correctly

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.660
and skimping on this is
dramatic, in terms of how

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.340
users perceive your app.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.870
Of course, you still have to
get the Detail page right,

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.820
providing a nice icon, quality
screenshots, a detailed

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.080
description.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.220
And more importantly, in the
description of your app,

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.410
certainly explain what it does,
but also explain why the

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.010
integration with Driver
is useful for users.

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.250
We've seen a lot of applications
that just talk

00:22:58.250 --> 00:23:03.220
about their application, but
users just don't know why the

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.430
integration with Drive
is any better.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.640
And these are apps that are
providing tremendous value.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.930
But they just do such a poor
job at explaining it.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.370
Again, take the time
to craft this.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.600
This is just a few minutes of
work but, again, has such a

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.490
huge impact on how users are
perceiving your app and

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.370
whether or not they're likely
to connect it to Drive.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.335
So far, a lot of this has been
focused on first impressions.

00:23:25.335 --> 00:23:27.440
This is all surface stuff.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.850
And at the end of the day,
that's great for getting

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:32.040
people to try your app.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.380
But really you want people to
love your app and use it and

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.100
be engaged.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.620
And one of the things
with platforms--

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.870
this is true for Drive--
it's a meritocracy.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.000
We don't pick winners.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.410
We don't pick favorites.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.710
We rely on the users to
tell us which apps

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.460
are the best apps.

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.640
And they do that by providing
ratings and reviews for the

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.550
apps that they try.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.010
So it's up to you, as
developers, to build

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.350
applications that users
are going to love.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.410
And there's a few things in the
Drive API that you can use

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.040
to make sure that your
integration with Drive is as

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.320
good as it can be.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.830
And I'm going to go through
a couple of those--

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.780
there are going to be two that
are very simple things that

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.860
you can do--

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.750
and then talk about some of
the deeper features in the

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.990
Drive API that you can use to
provide a really amazing

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.470
experience.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.390
So that's what you
want to get to.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.970
You want to get to five stars.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.410
So the first is something
Josh talked about.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.430
The Drive UI has been
evolving towards

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.290
having very rich previews.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.760
We have a grid view for when
people are browsing files

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.100
along with this lightbox-style
way of quickly previewing and

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.750
navigating through
your content.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.500
We do a great job at providing
previews for a lot of

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.220
different formats.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.200
Third-party content,
though, is a little

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.420
bit difficult sometimes.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.630
And this is what users see if we
don't know how to make that

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.450
content previewable.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.420
When you're developing your app,
take a look at how your

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.830
content that your app creates
appears in this view.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.350
And if we're not being able to
provide a preview for you,

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:07.690
there's actually something
really simple that you can do

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.745
to fix this.

00:25:08.745 --> 00:25:12.010
It's a little-known feature
in the Drive API.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.710
We actually allow
you to provide

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.180
thumbnails for your images.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.790
And I would actually say the
term thumbnails is probably

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.360
inappropriate, because
these images can

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.580
actually be very large.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.580
It can be up to two megabytes.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.790
And we encourage you to provide
these images in as

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.300
large as a format as you can
within that two megabyte limit

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.710
so that when somebody views a
file and they're going through

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.860
and doing a grid view or they're
in the lightbox, they

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.060
will see a preview of your
content that's appropriate for

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.490
your application and for
that content type.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.860
It's really easy, just a base64
encoded P&amp;G image.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.590
It's part of the metadata.

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:48.030
So if you can generate a
preview, check it out.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:49.440
Make sure your content
looks correct.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.920
If it doesn't, provide us an
image, and then we'll show

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.650
that to a user in these
different views.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.490
It's a really easy thing to do,
makes the integration with

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:57.740
Drive a lot more seamless.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.200
Similarly, search is really
important for Drive.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.740
Search your Drive pretty
much on a daily basis.

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.860
We do a really good job on all
sorts of different content.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.610
Even with images,
we can do image

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.310
recognition of landmarks.

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.030
We can do OCR, recognize text.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:19.420
And of course, different
content, document formats are

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.990
all really well indexed.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.800
But again, we have the
same problem with

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.000
some third-party types.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.040
We just simply don't know how
to index that content.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.410
So when you're developing, again
try searching for the

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.190
content that you create, and
make sure it's discoverable.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.450
If it is, great.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.570
You don't have to do anything.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.580
If it's not, a very simple
thing you can do is just

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.930
provide us alternate
text to index.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.570
And when you upload your files
or when you update them, you

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.110
can just provide us a block of
text, fairly large even, up to

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:53.050
about 128k, and we will index
that as if that were the

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.490
content of the file.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.980
If your file happens to be text
format and you just want

00:26:57.980 --> 00:26:59.900
us to index it as-is, there's
a query parameter.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.130
You can just say, treat this
content as indexable.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.630
We'll ignore the type of file
and just try to index it as

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:07.510
best we can.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.750
So again, it's a really
easy thing to do.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.710
It's just a little
quick checkmark.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:12.550
Try searching for
your content.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:17.330
If it doesn't work the way you
expect, you can fix it.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.540
So two really easy things that
can make the user experience

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.660
for integrated apps much
more seamless.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.000
So there's a couple more things
I want to talk about.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.340
These are a little bit deeper
usage of the API, but I think

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.350
they're really important.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:33.290
And mostly they come around the
concept of collaboration.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.730
Josh talked a little bit about
sharing, and sharing is very

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.490
popular in Drive.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.050
And it's a great way for people
to learn about your app

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.720
and discover it.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.670
But more important than sharing
is, once you share it,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.880
being able to work together.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.920
And there's two features
of the API that I

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.000
want to talk about.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.345
And these are ways that we can
help you build applications

00:27:54.345 --> 00:27:58.400
that have amazing sharing and
collaborative experiences.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.130
The first is the
real time API.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.440
This is something we launched
about two months ago.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.340
It is a super fun API.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.955
I have been having a blast just

00:28:05.955 --> 00:28:07.160
building samples for this.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:12.090
It is just crazy cool what you
can do with very little code.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.380
There's a bunch of sample apps
up on GitHub, a couple apps in

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.270
the sandbox.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.560
Actually, yesterday
we had Ganter.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.610
Today, I believe we have
draw.io, which is a

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.620
diagramming app.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:26.840
And then tomorrow is Neutron
Drive, which is an IDE.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.430
And all three of these are using
the API to provide the

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.480
same type of collaborative
experience that we provide

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.960
within Docs, but they're doing
it within their own app.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.830
And for those who are interested
in this API,

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.710
there's actually a really great
talk later today from

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.420
Brian and Charles, two
engineers that

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.190
have worked on this.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:46.570
And they do a fantastic job
going into how the API works,

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.200
some of the complexities and
the problem that they're

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.110
trying to solve, and why having
a really beautiful,

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:54.580
simple API for doing this
is so valuable.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.980
So definitely check it out.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.630
But it's a great way to go
from just simply sharing

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:04.130
content to making that content
interactive and collaborative.

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.820
The other way you can do this
is using the Comments API.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.650
Josh mentioned commenting as a
feature of our own editors.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.630
It's also part of
the Drive API.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.780
You can actually add commenting
capabilities to any

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.270
application and any file
stored in Drive.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.680
And it's really easy to do.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.140
You do have to provide the UI
for it, but you do get all the

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.900
same features.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.910
You get the ability to have
the state for threads, at

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.120
mentions, email notifications.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.500
All the things that go into the
document commenting that

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.470
you see in Drive and Docs today,
again, can be used in

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.150
your application.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.470
So these are just two examples
of things that you can do to

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.970
make your application an amazing
experience for people

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.270
who use Drive.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.130
There are some other things in
Drive as a platform that are

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.110
little bit lower-level, more
technical things that are

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.800
coming out or have launched
recently, things like private

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:59.440
application data, metadata for
files, which is really awesome

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.610
for things like workflow
applications.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.170
And we've got things like Push
notifications launching in the

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.360
next few weeks.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.350
The point of this, though, is
Drive really is a platform

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:13.240
that you can build amazing
applications with, that have

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:19.850
just incredible experiences
where you can annotate docs,

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.925
you can have amazing
collaborative experiences.

00:30:22.925 --> 00:30:26.370
In fact, the last collaborative
app I built, I

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.990
didn't even have a server for.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.680
The content is hosted
on GitHub, so I'm

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.070
using GitHub Pages.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.030
And it's a fully persistent,
collaborative, real time

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:41.815
application that lets people
work on to-do lists, and it's

00:30:41.815 --> 00:30:44.690
like 100 lines of JavaScript,
a little bit more than that,

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.730
but it's really not that much.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:48.410
But it's just hosted
on GitHub Pages.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:53.790
And just that idea that I can
build something that is along

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:59.220
the lines of Google Docs or
presentations or Slides and

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:02.770
not have to worry about servers
or anything is kind of

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.020
an amazing concept.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.230
So one thing, before
we go to questions.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.890
I think what we've seen today
from applications that are

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.622
integrated with Drive is really
just version one.

00:31:18.622 --> 00:31:20.310
There are some great apps
that people have built.

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:21.070
I love some of these.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.950
I love HelloFax.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:23.430
I love Lucidchart.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.650
These are apps that I have
installed on my own personal

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:29.400
account, and they're great.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.740
But with things like the real
time API and some of these

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.850
deeper features, there's still
a huge opportunity for

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.120
applications to build unique,
amazing experiences for people

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.490
who use Google Drive and fully
exploit the platform and build

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:47.790
apps that are as good, or if not
better than any of the ON

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.230
apps that we've built
ourselves.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.290
And I think there's a ton of
potential for this and things,

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.540
everything from education--

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.380
especially with what you've
seen with WebGL and "The

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.540
Hobbit" at the keynote, to
build, why can't I have 3D

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.740
collaborative modeling or Cat
editing, and how that can

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.460
transform different industries
that are so used to being able

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.070
to work in these legacy
applications, just one user at

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.110
a time, sharing files around,
shipping them via FTP.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.580
There's a huge opportunity.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.120
And the challenge for you is to
go and build something that

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.940
is the next Google Docs,
or if not bigger.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.916
And Josh?

00:32:25.916 --> 00:32:26.650
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.210
STEVEN BAZYL: I think we're
ready for questions.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.350
JOSH HUDGINS: Questions.

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.340
We have two mics here
in the center.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.450
So if you do have questions,
please go to the mics.

00:32:39.415 --> 00:32:39.910
AUDIENCE: Hi, Steven.

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:43.400
A quick question around
MIME types.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.200
We'd love to be able to do
something very similar to

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.910
folders, to basically have typed
folders, and this is a

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.590
container of our type, which
holds things that we hold,

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.140
additional metadata,
et cetera.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.240
Is that something you
can comment on?

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.670
STEVEN BAZYL: I would love
to chat more about

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.850
what you want to do.

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:02.860
Certainly, you can
do things with

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.390
folders and create folders.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.810
We actually even have Open
With on folders now.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.185
So you can open them with
your application.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.390
But in terms of being able to
have different types, it's not

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.260
something that we've
really discussed.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.570
But I would love to hear more
about what the particular use

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.520
case is, what you're
trying to do.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.500
And maybe there's ways to
do it with what we have.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.140
And if there isn't, it's
definitely something

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.380
we could look at.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.375
But I would have to really
understand more about what the

00:33:31.375 --> 00:33:32.320
use case is.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.080
JOSH HUDGINS: Let's talk
more after about that.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.830
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
that the level of

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.150
permission you ask for
have an impact on

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.390
the conversion rates.

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:44.460
Do you have some harder numbers
so that we can--

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.640
It's difficult to A/B test that
kind of thing and change

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:49.090
it after the fact and stuff.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:54.500
So being able to make a more
informed choice on the

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.330
permissions that we ask for
and being able to actually

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.750
inform trade that off would
be really helpful.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:00.680
STEVEN BAZYL: I don't
have them with me.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.070
I actually did chat with one of
the engineers on the Auth

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.960
team a couple days ago about
this, because I actually did

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.855
want to find those
numbers myself.

00:34:07.855 --> 00:34:11.460
And I also want to get some
metrics on things like

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.920
branding and so on, what the
actual quantitative impact is.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.489
So I am, actually, trying
to get those numbers.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.050
As soon as I get them, I'll
try to share them on the

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.880
community, assuming
I can share them.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.280
But yeah, I do want to actually
get that information

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.355
out as soon as I can.

00:34:30.355 --> 00:34:32.015
I just don't have it
with me today.

00:34:32.015 --> 00:34:32.270
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.746
Thanks.

00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:35.130
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:36.980
AUDIENCE: I noticed recently
in the Chrome Store there's

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.130
advertisements now.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.050
How do you do that?

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:39.780
STEVEN BAZYL: What was that?

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.750
AUDIENCE: I've noticed that
there's advertisements in the

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:42.909
Chrome Store.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:46.610
It'll have the apps on the
front page, and it'll say

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.170
advertisements.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.330
How do you do that?

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.956
How do you get into that?

00:34:50.956 --> 00:34:51.969
STEVEN BAZYL: That
I don't know.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:54.409
Josh, do you happen to
know about that?

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:56.290
JOSH HUDGINS: I don't
know the precise--

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.500
I know kind of high-level about
how that program works,

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.080
but I can't tell you the
exact URL to go to.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.580
But let me find that out and
then follow up with you.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:02.726
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:02.726 --> 00:35:05.250
So there's a page that you can
go to to sign up for it?

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:05.470
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:07.570
It's like a type of ad product
that you can--

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:08.040
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:08.510
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.980
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.860
Thanks.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:11.330
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.400
My question is on the
permission side.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.950
So if we are building an app,
can we actually build some

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:22.900
sort of UI within the sharing
window, like an expiration of

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:28.170
sharing after something or even
with a password protect

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.440
or something like that.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.380
STEVEN BAZYL: Not directly
with Drive.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:38.040
I've seen people build other
tools around Drive using the

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.380
API to do things like that and
provide some automation.

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:44.960
Actually, we had a hackathon
about three

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.350
or four months ago.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.920
And one of the hackathon
participants built an app like

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:54.040
that where they would do things
like tying down sharing

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:58.930
and so on and additional
password protection on links.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.150
So you can do it
with the APIs.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.220
It's just not a feature
of Drive.

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:02.745
AUDIENCE: The APIs
are irrelevant.

00:36:02.745 --> 00:36:08.440
It's just that we're to do it
outside the Drive within

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.830
another third-party app.

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:11.600
STEVEN BAZYL: It's not
a feature of Drive.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.736
But again, you could build it.

00:36:14.736 --> 00:36:16.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.190
STEVEN BAZYL: Just
do you have to?

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.025
That's the question.

00:36:18.025 --> 00:36:18.360
Yeah.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.500
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.150
Thanks for doing this.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.840
I'm Noble.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.610
I work with enterprises
traditionally.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.745
And we've got the Google Apps
Store or that Marketplace and

00:36:31.745 --> 00:36:34.070
we also have the Chrome
Marketplace.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.110
Is there any plans to sort of
bring that to parity, to just

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.050
simplify stuff for some
of us developers.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:42.610
JOSH HUDGINS: That's
a great question.

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.310
One of the issues we're trying
to address now is if you look

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.510
at how the Chrome Web Store
widget that we've embedded in

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:51.460
Drive works today is it doesn't
do a great job of

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.370
addressing a lot of the use
cases that the Apps

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.970
Marketplace does.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.640
And so one of the things we're
working at really closely is

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.240
how we can bring the feature
sets of those different

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.310
marketplaces together to make
sure that if you do have a

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:07.250
Drive app that you want that
enterprises can use it and

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:09.870
provision it and administer it
within an enterprise and do

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.600
domain licensing and
provisioning and

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.260
that sort of thing.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:14.332
So yeah.

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:17.020
I think you'll see some things
there over time.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:17.850
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.700
And one thing to mention too is
a lot of the folks from the

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.260
enterprise side, particularly
some of the PMs working on the

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.100
Apps Marketplace, are going to
be over at the Office Hours

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.970
this afternoon.

00:37:29.970 --> 00:37:33.610
The person you'd most likely
want to talk to for where the

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:40.940
Apps Marketplace is going
is Apoorv Saxena.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.305
Apoorv.

00:37:42.305 --> 00:37:46.780
He should be over there, I
think, around probably between

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.250
about 1:30 and 3:00.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.490
I'll probably be over there.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:53.875
If he's around, come by.

00:37:53.875 --> 00:37:56.600
I'll get you introduced, and you
can get a little bit more

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.880
detail about where the
Marketplace is going

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.845
and with all that.

00:37:59.845 --> 00:38:01.600
AUDIENCE: It's 1:45.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.370
STEVEN BAZYL: What's that?

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:03.410
1:45?

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.710
OK.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.120
Oh.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.370
OK.

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:14.730
I want to know the attitude
for Google Docs

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:20.940
intercollection with Microsoft
Office's 365 and/or some other

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.470
Cloud Office applications,
such as [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:25.560
and IBM Docs.

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:33.890
And in your mind, how many
benefits can Google Docs get

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.740
from the intercollection?

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.990
Thank you.

00:38:39.455 --> 00:38:40.850
JOSH HUDGINS: The question
is about

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.792
integrating Docs with 365?

00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:45.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:46.190
JOSH HUDGINS: What specifically

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.580
are you curious about?

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:57.680
AUDIENCE: I mentioned the Cloud
Office intercollection.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:04.091
I submitted an IETF internet
draft for this topic.

00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:05.250
JOSH HUDGINS: Let's
talk after.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.220
And we can dig into it.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.160
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:09.630
JOSH HUDGINS: Thanks.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:13.510
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.490
You mentioned the importance of
requesting only the scope

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.810
that you need for your
application.

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:24.750
Are there any plans to allow us
to annotate why we need a

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.470
certain scope?

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:29.260
Because sometimes you do need
the scope, but it might not be

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.210
intuitively obvious to the user
and may reject you out of

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:36.430
hand because they think, oh,
why do they need that?, and

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.315
throw out the app.

00:39:38.315 --> 00:39:38.720
STEVEN BAZYL: Yeah.

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.930
I don't know of any hard
plans for that.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.560
I know there's a lot of
discussion going on around

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.790
there's constantly ways to
improve that and various ideas

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.840
that I've heard internally But
I can't really give you any

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.120
definitive answer.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.840
We actually had done that
before with the Apps

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.520
Marketplace.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.870
There were questions
earlier about that.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:02.040
And that's actually a feature
that's in the Apps Marketplace

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.900
is annotated scopes that are
displayed to administrators.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.510
And you get a one
to two sentence

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.860
description as to why.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.850
So we do it in some context.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:17.180
Just in terms of the
consumer-level auth screens

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.980
and approvals, that feature
has just never

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.230
been part of it.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.260
JOSH HUDGINS: I think one thing
we can do to make that

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.510
easier is make it where there's
fewer situations where

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:32.605
you have to unintuitively
request a scope that users

00:40:32.605 --> 00:40:35.230
don't understand, like in order
to implement a certain

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.860
feature We should make,
for instance, our more

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.030
fine-grained scopes work across
all the features in a

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.080
way that users expect.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.430
So if you have to request
broader access for something,

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:46.370
they understand why without
really having to dig into it.

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.700
And I think if I were going to
tackle that problem, that's

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.610
the way I'd like to do it.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:50.660
Because there's a few things--

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.880
I probably can identify some
of the scenarios you've run

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.560
into where you have to request
a wider scope than you would

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.820
otherwise need just
to implement a

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.750
certain type of feature.

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.030
And that's a lot of times
because of a shortcoming of

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.500
the implementation of the
finer-grain scopes.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.180
So over time, if we can fix to
where users, oh, it makes

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.930
perfect sense that you would
request the scopes you're

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:10.380
requesting, given what you're
trying to do as an app.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.540
I think that's probably
the high-level

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.458
direction we would go there.

00:41:13.458 --> 00:41:15.402
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:41:15.402 --> 00:41:18.760
AUDIENCE: This is kind of an
implementation detail.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:24.860
But when a user shares a file
within the Drive interface,

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:28.350
does your app get some kind of
notification so that behind

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.630
the scenes our servers can
update the permissions so that

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.340
when that shared user opens up
the file we can make sure that

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:39.530
they still have permission
and authentication?

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.900
STEVEN BAZYL: There is a change
feed that you can use

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.890
to watch for changes
to a user's Drive.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.500
So you can get some level
of notification.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:55.580
I would question more the
attempt to synchronize

00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.870
permissions, because that is
error-prone and can actually

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:04.810
create security holes, if
not done correctly.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:08.610
For a Drive app, you really
have to pick one as

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:10.200
the source of truth.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:14.110
And the recommendation is, if
you are a Drive app and you

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.940
are relying on sharing, that
you check the Drive ACLs.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.800
And you would do that just when
somebody opens the file.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:23.825
If they can read it in Drive,
that implicitly means they

00:42:23.825 --> 00:42:25.315
should be able to read it
in your application.

00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:30.630
There may be certain cases where
you do need to keep that

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.040
in sync, in which case you
would just use the change

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.900
collection to watch for changes
to that user's corpus.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.820
So you need to watch the change,
essentially, on the

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:41.580
receiving end?

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.040
STEVEN BAZYL: Right.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:42.710
Exactly.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:45.200
And then you would know, oh, a
new file is available to you.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.350
And then you can reconcile
that on your side.

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:52.020
But the easier thing
is just to not

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.960
synchronize ACLs like that.

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.870
AUDIENCE: And just leverage
the Drive's ACLs.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:56.351
OK.

00:42:56.351 --> 00:42:56.832
Great.

00:42:56.832 --> 00:42:57.313
Thanks.

00:42:57.313 --> 00:42:59.860
JOSH HUDGINS: The more generic
problem is we will be coming

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.485
out with the Push notifications
system here.

00:43:02.485 --> 00:43:04.720
And you can access it now if
you're in the Early Access

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.883
Program too, which will
solve some of

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.050
those types of problems.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:08.770
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.540
My question is about the new
recent collaboration of

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.820
Chatting and Documents.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.410
Will there be an API expanded
for our apps on that, so we

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:20.870
can do the collaborating
chat in our own apps?

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.630
JOSH HUDGINS: Using
real time API?

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.600
AUDIENCE: Can you do that
using real time?

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.290
JOSH HUDGINS: We have partners
that have implemented Chat

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:27.920
using real time API.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.370
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.820
Cool.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.070
JOSH HUDGINS: Thanks.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.100
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the service.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.250
I think it's fantastic.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.625
Currently, I think you can only
sell per user and not by

00:43:38.625 --> 00:43:39.940
a company or domain.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.761
Has there been any thought
of improving that?

00:43:42.761 --> 00:43:43.240
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.530
And this is very much along
the lines of the earlier

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.510
comments around the Apps
Marketplace versus the

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.950
ecosystem that uses the Chrome
Web Store embeddable widgit.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.400
It's something we're thinking
about quite a bit and focusing

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:53.900
on right now.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.190
So stay tuned.

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:58.430
AUDIENCE: Is there a timetable,
like within a year?

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.370
JOSH HUDGINS: Nothing I probably
want to share with

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.970
this broad of an audience.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:02.120
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.300
Thank you.

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.711
JOSH HUDGINS: So something we're
thinking about for sure.

00:44:07.559 --> 00:44:08.040
STEVEN BAZYL: All right.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.910
If there's no more questions,
we'll be up at the Office

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.240
Hours probably for the next
half hour, in case anyone

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.130
wants to stop by later.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.210
But other than that, thank
you all for coming.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.460
JOSH HUDGINS: Thanks, guys.
