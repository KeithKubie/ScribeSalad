00:00:00.242 --> 00:00:03.315
- Politicians have run
against the elite media

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:04.148
for a long time.

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:05.671
I mean think about George Wallace,

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.400
the way he campaigned
when he ran for president.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.378
He would point out the
New York Times reporter

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.286
or the Washington Post reporter.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:18.785
And that has been a favorite tactic

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.207
of many politicians over time.

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:23.137
What is different is that it is now coming

00:00:23.137 --> 00:00:24.694
from the president of the United States

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:26.630
on a very regular basis.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.146
I mean it is part of the stock
and trade of his approach

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:34.017
to de-legitimize any effort on the part

00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:37.508
of mainstream media or
whatever you wanna call it

00:00:37.508 --> 00:00:40.890
to do the kind of
journalism that we have done

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.723
for a long, long time.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.173
We have not changed our approach.

00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:48.549
We have not changed our standards.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.898
If anything, our standards
are probably higher today

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:53.564
because the consequences of being wrong.
