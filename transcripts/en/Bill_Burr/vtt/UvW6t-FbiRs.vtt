1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.520
Yeah, it was fucking raining out.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.220
This is one thing I've learned that when you go to a football game and you're

3
00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:08.020
dealing with the elements,

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.060
this is the more of a douchebag you look like the warmer you're going to be.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.320
All right. I saw the rain and I said fuck this.

6
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:24.250
And we went right to deck sporting good and I'm like, I'm buying that fucking,

7
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:28.210
I'm going to buy a rain coat with the matching rain coat slacks.

8
00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:29.380
I don't give a fuck.

9
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.480
I bought a pair of a wool socks and I was good to go.

10
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.120
So I'm with Versie and you know they only had like two raincoats left and they

11
00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:41.650
were the exact same color.

12
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.150
This fucking grape slush puppy purple.

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.140
So we both have matching extra large fucking,

14
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.980
we got the jackets and the pants like we're working at a fucking airport and

15
00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:59.260
what green we're bringing in the fucking soul plane. Right.

16
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.720
That was a purple airplane. Right. That's what we look like.

17
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.060
So we show up to the game, right.

18
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.740
Neither one of us is comfortable because neither one of us is a jets or a bills

19
00:01:08.741 --> 00:01:13.180
fan. So we're in enemy territory and it's fucking drizzling and out.

20
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:17.830
It's fucking cold. So I proceed to put on this Barney the dinosaur outfit,

21
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.550
right? And right off the bat, Versie starts pumping out outgoing man.

22
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:24.130
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna wear that. I'm just gonna wear the top.

23
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.610
I'm just gonna wear the top, trying to act like it's not raining out that bed.

24
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.900
The reality is,

25
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.320
is he didn't want to go through the hazing that he would have to,

26
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:34.780
if the two of us walked in with our purple on

27
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.280
Purple Fucking Rain Coats Times two, we would have got a ton of shit.

28
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:41.760
And I was prepared to take it. I had an,

29
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.640
I had a whole fucking silly walk I was going to be doing. I don't give a fuck.

30
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.980
So he punked out. So, uh, we ended up walking in and put my head's cold, right?

31
00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:54.690
All I have is a baseball cap on. So I'm like, fuck, I gotta buy a head.

32
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.810
Can I buy a bill's who gives a fuck there? And last pace mail by a bill's hat.

33
00:01:57.811 --> 00:02:01.510
And then I saw this, this one with a Patriot logo on it. I said, fuck it.

34
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:06.430
I'll get that. Once I put that one on, I'm nice and warm. We go to, we'll call,

35
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:07.540
we pick up our tickets.

36
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.920
We go into that high school football stadium that they have out there that I

37
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.340
actually love. It looks like an old school football stadium.

38
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:18.550
You know what I like about that football stadium that's about the size of a

39
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:22.990
football stadium that holds real fans. You know what I mean? All these,

40
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:25.510
these new ones that hold like 100,000 fucking pets,

41
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:26.910
all the bandwagon shit heads.

42
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.550
You know when you're all in for the real fucking fans show up all and three,

43
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:35.470
right? So we walk into the Goddamn stadium with love and life, right?

44
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.620
I'm already laughing at Versie cause I know damn well what's going to happen?

45
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.880
He's going to walk out there.

46
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:43.600
There's going to be some shitty little plastic seat that's going to be covered

47
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.860
in fucking water and the only way he's going to be able to absorb it is through

48
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:50.740
his God damn jeans and his fucking bbds.

49
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:53.140
And then he's going to be sitting there with a wrinkled up,

50
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.700
nuts sack that's going to be getting hypothermia by second quarter.

51
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.920
Why do I know this? I've been there.

52
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.810
So we've got a couple of bears.

53
00:03:02.811 --> 00:03:06.260
We get this fucking beef on a stick or whatever the fuck they call it.

54
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.530
We're good to go. We go in there, sit down,

55
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.510
he sits basically down in a fucking puddle. He tried to stick a newspaper down,

56
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:18.280
which is a very absorbent and a, I dunno.

57
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.040
We sat there and I had hope for about eight seconds in that game and the jets

58
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:26.090
came down and just fucking Jew. They just kicked the shit out of him.

59
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.190
Christ. They kicked a shit out of 'em and uh,

60
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.120
hey, it was just over. So we, so immediately,

61
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.290
our solution is just to start drinking the way we drank at the masters.

62
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.600
We're like, fuck it. Let's, let's, let's get going here, right?

63
00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:46.250
So we'll make a trip after trip and all of a sudden I gotta take a Piss, right?

64
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.190
So I go and I'm standing in line and all of a sudden this,

65
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.200
this fucking six foot five goofy looking jackass,

66
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.390
one of those guys who's like six foot five but you still think he can take them

67
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:03.210
cause he's just covered in baby fat. You know,

68
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.950
he's got a couple of whiskers on his chin and his cheeks are rosier than St Nick

69
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.150
, right? And he's got this Jersey on and this big stupid,

70
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.320
I'm a buffalo bills fan with the horns on it and stuff. You know,

71
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:20.970
he's the Wacky Guy, so I'm not even thinking shit. Right.

72
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.410
This is bill's jets. I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm not talking any shit.

73
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.333
I'm fine.

74
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.930
I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat and all of a sudden this big goofy

75
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:34.910
jackass starts going, wait, wait, what's what? Yeah. Will Your patriots fit?

76
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:38.440
Do you like the rats? We got to [inaudible] the rats.

77
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.260
He likes the fucking rats and the shit. Right? And I'm like, yeah, you know,

78
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:46.320
whatever. He starts giving me shit. I start giving him shit back.

79
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.320
And then the weirdest fucking thing happened. I,

80
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.400
by the time I get in to the actual men's room,

81
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.931
I've talked,

82
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:59.640
I've given these people so much fucking shit that actually there's bills and

83
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:04.510
jets fans at a bill's and jets game. They're playing each other. They stop,

84
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:05.690
stop giving each other shit,

85
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:10.160
and they teamed up together and started giving me shit.

86
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.280
Right? And then I just said, I don't know what I was thinking.

87
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.630
I felt like I was on stage cause it was like a crowd. I wasn't thinking like,

88
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.590
Hey, you know what, Bill,

89
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.910
you really haven't had a fight outside of your family since maybe playing so

90
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.720
fucking street hockey in the sixth grade. I didn't give a fuck.

91
00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:30.620
I'm going to goddamn bathroom waiting to take a piss in a goddamn trough by the

92
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:33.110
way. And a,

93
00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.440
and then they just started giving up fucking just one dude such go on.

94
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.850
Tom Brady Sucks Dick.

95
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.500
He shocks Dick and he's like miming it like ridiculously well. So I'm like,

96
00:05:42.501 --> 00:05:44.050
yeah, you know buddy, you do that real wealth.

97
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.450
Because I learned it by watching Tom Brady. I'm like, Oh yeah,

98
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.350
did you rent that portal? You fucking fag gets a little uglier,

99
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.010
gets a little uglier than this other dude. What the fuck do you do it?

100
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.520
I came up with the hell he was saying to me and I said, look, I'm sorry.

101
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:01.670
You guys have never won a super bowl. You know?

102
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.890
Then the jets fan pipes in. I go,

103
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:06.110
do you realize the last time you guys won a super bowl,

104
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.080
Charlie Chaplin was still alive? Do you understand that?

105
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.030
Do you know what cars look like the last time you won? You fucking morons.

106
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.140
And then, uh, then this other guy goes, the, we've won three super bowls.

107
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.080
I'm sorry. Right? And then the guy goes, well, you didn't play in the games.

108
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.610
I go, neither did yo.

109
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.060
Then he's just standing there with his dumb look on his face. Like, oh,

110
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.340
that's where I keep staring for with, you've got nothing

111
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.670
forgetting that I don't know how to fight.

112
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.220
So all of a sudden it's my turn to Piss. I take my dick out, I'm ready to Piss.

113
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.170
And one of these fucking pussies pushed me in the back hoping that I was pissing

114
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.200
at the time. Fortunately, I wasn't. So I turn around,

115
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.610
I put my dick away cause I'm a gentleman. I said, well gee,

116
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.800
I goes and how you guys do it out here? Really? I go,

117
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:55.010
which one do you guys push me? Like I'm gonna fall like I'm fucking Jackie Chan.

118
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.550
And for some reason none of them said anything.

119
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.160
I don't know if it was my purple on purple rain coat or the look of fire in my

120
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:04.311
eye,

121
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:09.230
but I'm a fucking 42 year old balding redhead talking shit in there and none of

122
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:11.390
them said anything. So now it's kind of funny to me.

123
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.110
I felt like I was in like the world series of poker and I went all in and I

124
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.550
didn't have a hand whatsoever. So I don't know who the fuck pushed me.

125
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:23.840
But that's what I mean. Come on. Bitchy is move with the fucking week.

126
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.270
How do you do that? How do you do that? How do you,

127
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:29.600
how do you push another man when he's got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss

128
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.000
into a fucking trough? I mean, how do you get lower than that?

129
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:34.370
Do you guys have any ideas? How do you get lower than that?

130
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.570
So then after none of them said anything, I go back and I started taking a piss.

131
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:43.571
And then that other dude who was miming somebody sucking a dick unbelievably

132
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:46.460
well right next to me.

133
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.010
We one of those stupid hats that has the toggles on the side and he's still

134
00:07:52.011 --> 00:07:54.350
trying to give me shit and I'm going to to go fuck yourself.

135
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:56.630
And then he just starts screaming over and over again.

136
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.470
Are you looking at my Dick? Are you looking at my deck?

137
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.770
Like maniacally, like five times.

138
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.440
I just sort of stared at him like, why do you keep going this, this gay angle?

139
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:12.560
Like why is there always a, I dunno.

140
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.540
I think he was one of those guys. He was Kinda in the closet. And then, uh,

141
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.430
so he just goes to football games and he gets really drunk trying to just kill

142
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.310
the families. I think he liked me is what I'm saying.

143
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:27.920
So if he's listening to this, I'm sorry. Uh,

144
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:32.450
I'm spoken for you fucking pants. You fucking believe that.

145
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.420
First of all, what's wrong with me?

146
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.500
I really replayed all of that in my head cause once I got out of there I was

147
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.460
like, I really started thinking like, what?

148
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:44.090
What did you think you were going to do in there?

149
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.710
They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying things. Clint Eastwood would say, what?

150
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:50.330
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?

151
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:52.640
Like I don't know if I've said this before in a podcast,

152
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.420
a public bathroom is the worst fucking place to ever get into a fight.

153
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:00.240
There is nothing soft.

154
00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.690
There's everything is porcelain pipes that concrete floor and then it has a mist

155
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.790
of piss and shit. It's just a fucking, it's the worst.

156
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.600
It's the worst place ever. You know,

157
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.770
not to mention it usually starts evidently when one person as begun,

158
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:17.850
the pissing process.

159
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

160
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.890
<v 0>So, uh, you know, older, little bit wiser.</v>

161
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.880
So then I'm standing in line to go get some more alcohol cause God knows that's

162
00:09:30.881 --> 00:09:32.680
what you need after an incident like that.

163
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.810
And I was just kinda just sitting there thinking like, all right,

164
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:39.730
now how should I have played that?

165
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.720
It w it should have ended when the dude with the water buffalo hat started

166
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:48.720
giving me shit. What I should should've done was roll with it.

167
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.540
I should you like the Patriots. I should have been like, Yay. You know,

168
00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:55.630
you guys scored 30 on this last week, man. You guys look great man.

169
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.990
Now I bet the jets, I mean, I bet against the jets.

170
00:09:58.991 --> 00:10:02.970
I hope you guys should have just ended it with that and did it. I've,

171
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.700
I sh I should, uh, I should have extended in all of branch.

172
00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:08.290
That's what I should have done in the future.

173
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:11.830
That's what the fuck I'm gonna do because, uh,

174
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.050
that was a, a, that was a potentially ugly situation. But fortunately,

175
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.760
um, I think the people who were doing it, you know,

176
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:26.890
had jobs and no one wanted to get sued and no one was willing to take it to that

177
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:30.580
level. Uh, and when I say fortunately,

178
00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:32.380
I mean for me and my face.

179
00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

180
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.361
<v 0>Oh,</v>

181
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:42.230
do you know how bad that would have been to get stomped in that fucking purple

182
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:47.150
on purple rain coat lay in there with my dirty fucking patriots hat

183
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.660
and my team wasn't even playing. I would have lost the lawsuit.

184
00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:57.320
They would have been like, let me get this straight. You're a patriots fan.

185
00:10:57.321 --> 00:11:01.040
You are a patriots hat to a bill's jets game and you somehow managed to get the

186
00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:04.670
shit kicked out of you. What the fuck did you say? You know,

187
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.000
that's one of the great things about being a guy is you actually have to take

188
00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.150
responsibility for your, for your actions. See, you won't be like,

189
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:15.700
there's no excuse. There's no reason. I don't care what happened. You know,

190
00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:19.490
and he had a girl, which is true. You don't need a fucking girl.

191
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:23.780
But there no learning in that. There's no lesson. You know?

192
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.900
Even my best friends would have been like, yeah,

193
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.880
those guys are fucking assholes in the, but you know,

194
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.280
they would've been an awkward pause and it'd be like, dude, what the fuck?

195
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.360
He talking shit for by yourself at a game when your team isn't even fucking

196
00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:40.400
playing, what's wrong with you? You're 42 years old, get your shit together.

197
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.690
And they would have been right.
