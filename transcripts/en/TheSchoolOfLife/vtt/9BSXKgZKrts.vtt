00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:10.870
Your fears are right: you probably won’t ever find the right person. It seems
harsh to say it just now but the right partner

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.160
for you doesn’t really exist: there are
just different varieties and degrees of wrongness.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.420
It’s not your fault or theirs. Anyone, however
lovely they seem at first, will turn out to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.070
be maddening, difficult and deeply disappointing
in a few – but to you very important – ways.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.219
You are carrying the burden of Romanticism
and are suffering from it gravely. You have

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.920
been made sick by the beguiling – but fatally
oppressive – fantasy that there’s a specific

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.329
person you are meant to be with who will end
the longing, who will be your soul-mate, sexual

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.839
companion, chauffeur, housekeeper, co-parent,
business partner and best friend. You see

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:04.229
them so clearly in your mind. That’s because
you made them up. But they don’t, in fact,

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.740
exist. Advertising, films and music have done
their utmost to convey to us that people do

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.420
eventually, after a little heartache, find
their ideal other, their long-lost twin. It’s

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.530
a very powerful idea to lean on when you’re
trying to sell a stranger a concert or movie

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.880
ticket. But it isn’t true. The number of
people around the world who are profoundly

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.780
emotionally, sexually, practically and intellectually
happy with a partner, for more than a brief

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.530
period, is tiny. These lucky souls could,
if gathered, comfortably fit on a small island

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.950
in the Maldives. You’re unlikely to be among
them – and won’t win the lottery either.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.509
This doesn’t have to be the end. There’s
a more mature idea of love around that stresses

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:58.479
how invariably compromised all good relationships
are. Compatibility is an achievement of love;

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.210
it shouldn’t be its precondition. We manage
to live wisely and comfortably around one

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.060
another when we stop insisting that our partners
must constantly share all of our tastes, interests

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.470
and opinions. It is more than normal to be
really quite lonely in large parts of our

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.271
emotional lives. An important factor – behind
almost any decent relationship – is the

00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:27.640
capacity of each partner to manage cheerfully
on their own. Relationships don’t solve

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.980
the problem of loneliness for very long. It’s
easy to lament how awful other possible partners

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.060
are. But reflect on the ways you are difficult
to live with too. You must be to a significant

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.060
degree – not because you are unusually freakish,
but because everyone carries with them a range

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.310
of flaws and failings that show up, horribly,
on close inspection. You will to a significant

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.510
extent be ruining the life of anyone you get
together with long-term. Stop looking for

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.800
a perfect partner and start looking for that
far nicer and more enticing prospect: a good

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.010
enough one. The fact that no-one will be ideal
doesn’t mean that another person will have

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.120
nothing to offer. It’s just that what we
need from them will arrive wrapped up in a

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.020
lot of things we don’t need and don’t
want. Hopefully, the long painful single period

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.330
hasn’t just been wasted time. It’s been
a training ground for the true spirit of compromise

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.840
and gratitude that lasting

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.480
love demands.
