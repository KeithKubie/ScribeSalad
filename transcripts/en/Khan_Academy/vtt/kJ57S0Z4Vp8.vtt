00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:02.308
- [Instructor] What we
wanna do in this video

00:00:02.308 --> 00:00:04.908
is get an understanding
of how we can approximate

00:00:04.908 --> 00:00:06.696
the area under a curve.

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:07.997
And for the sake of an example,

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:11.038
we'll use the curve y is
equal to x squared plus one.

00:00:11.038 --> 00:00:13.175
And let's think about the
area under this curve,

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:15.009
above the x-axis,

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.446
from x equals negative
one to x equals two.

00:00:18.446 --> 00:00:20.257
So that would be

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:22.370
this area right over here.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.226
And there's many ways
that I could tackle this,

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.782
but what I'm going to do is

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:28.918
I'm gonna break up this interval

00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:31.379
into three equal sections

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.491
that are really the bases of rectangles.

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:36.000
And then we're gonna think
about the different ways

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.181
to define the heights of those rectangles.

00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:40.760
So once again,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.677
I'm going to approximate
using three rectangles

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:48.629
of equal

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.043
width.

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:54.715
And then we'll think
about the different ways

00:00:54.715 --> 00:00:57.618
that we can define the
heights of the rectangles.

00:00:57.618 --> 00:01:00.172
So let's first define the heights

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:02.308
of each rectangle by

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:04.607
the value of the function at the midpoint.

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:06.464
So we see that right over here.

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:08.090
So let's just make sure

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.505
that it actually makes sense to us.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.918
So if we look at our first
rectangle right over here,

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:15.242
actually let's just first appreciate,

00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:17.633
we have split up this x,

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.280
we have split up the interval
from x equals negative one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.763
to x equals two into three equal sections,

00:01:23.763 --> 00:01:26.155
and then each of them have a width of one.

00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:27.595
If we wanted a better approximation

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:30.381
we could do more sections
or more rectangles,

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.657
but let's just see how
we would compute this.

00:01:32.657 --> 00:01:35.629
Well the width of each of these is one,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:37.974
the height is based on
the value of the function

00:01:37.974 --> 00:01:39.298
at the midpoint.

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.712
The midpoint here is negative 1/2,

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:43.686
the midpoint here is 1/2,

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:46.589
the midpoint here is 3/2.

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:50.513
And so this height is going
to be negative 1/2 squared

00:01:50.513 --> 00:01:51.929
plus one.

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.505
So negative 1/2 squared is 1/4 plus one,

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:57.316
so that's 5/4.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:02:00.010
So the height here is 5/4.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.401
So you take 5/4 times one.

00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:05.838
This area is 5/4, let me write that down.

00:02:05.838 --> 00:02:08.206
So if we're doing the midpoint

00:02:08.206 --> 00:02:10.343
to define the height of each rectangle,

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:12.386
this first one has

00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:14.870
an area of 5/4.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.121
Do it in a color you
can see, five over four.

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:19.677
The second one, same idea,

00:02:19.677 --> 00:02:23.206
1/2 squared plus one is 5/4

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:24.971
times a width of one.

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:26.759
So 5/4 there.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.129
So let me add that.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.381
Plus 5/4.

00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:32.471
And then this third rectangle,

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:33.911
what's its height?

00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:36.024
Well we're gonna take the
height at the midpoint,

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:38.357
so 3/2 squared is

00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:42.340
9/4 plus one,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.519
which is the same thing as 13/4.

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.539
So it has a height of 13/4,

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.070
and then a width of one, so times one,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.669
which would just give us 13/4.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.669
So plus 13/4,

00:02:58.176 --> 00:03:00.916
which would give us 23 over four

00:03:00.916 --> 00:03:04.236
which is the same thing as 5 3/4.

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:07.417
And so this is often known
as a midpoint approximation

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:10.482
where we're using the
midpoint of each interval

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:12.642
to define the height of our rectangle.

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:14.639
But this isn't the only way to do it.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.821
We could look at the left endpoint

00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.284
or the right endpoint,

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:19.933
and we do that in other videos.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.162
And if we wanna do it just for kicks here,

00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:24.089
let's just do that really fast.

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.506
So if we wanna look at the left endpoints

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.335
of our interval,

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.054
well here our

00:03:32.054 --> 00:03:34.910
left endpoint is negative one,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.278
negative one squared plus one is two,

00:03:37.278 --> 00:03:38.361
two times one

00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:40.846
gives us two.

00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:45.126
And then here the left
part of this interval

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:46.659
is x equals zero,

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.400
zero squared plus one is one,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.150
one times one is one.

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:55.413
And now here our left endpoint is one,

00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:57.080
one squared plus one

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.359
is equal to two, times one,

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.797
our base, is equal to two.

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:04.724
So here we have a situation

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:07.325
where we take our left endpoints,

00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:10.877
where it is equal to two plus one

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:13.060
plus two or five.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.452
Well we can also look
at the right endpoints

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:16.869
of our intervals.

00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:21.024
So this first rectangle here,

00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:22.882
clearly under approximating the area

00:04:22.882 --> 00:04:24.368
over this first interval.

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.319
Its right endpoint is zero,

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:28.292
zero squared plus one is one,

00:04:28.292 --> 00:04:31.845
so a height of one, width
of one, has an area of one.

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:33.447
Second rectangle here,

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.955
it has a height of, look
at our right endpoint,

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:38.602
one squared plus one is two,

00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:41.946
times our width of one, well
that's just gonna give us two.

00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:44.384
And then here our right endpoint is two,

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:48.029
squared plus one is five,
times our width of one,

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:49.794
gives us five.

00:04:49.794 --> 00:04:51.605
So in this case we get,

00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:54.577
when we look at our right
endpoints of our intervals,

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:55.410
we get one

00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:57.888
plus two plus five

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:00.498
is equal to eight.

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:01.799
And eyeballing this,

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:03.563
it looks like we're
definitely over counting

00:05:03.563 --> 00:05:05.096
more than under counting,

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:07.929
and so this looks like
an over approximation.

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:09.856
So the whole idea here's
just to appreciate

00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:12.642
how we can compute these approximations

00:05:12.642 --> 00:05:14.245
using rectangles.

00:05:14.245 --> 00:05:15.429
And as you can imagine,

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:18.424
if we added more rectangles
that had skinnier

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:21.211
and skinnier bases but
still covered the interval

00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:23.951
from x equals negative
one to x equals two,

00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:26.296
we would get better and
better approximations

00:05:26.296 --> 00:05:27.713
of the true area.
