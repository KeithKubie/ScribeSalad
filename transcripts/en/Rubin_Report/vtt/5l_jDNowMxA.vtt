00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
[inaudible] joining me today as a Canadian businessman,

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.730
lawyer,
member of parliament,

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.680
and the founder and head of the People's Party of Canada.
Maxine Bernay,

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.900
welcome to the Rubin report.
Thanks for the invitation,
Dave.

5
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.300
I'm very happy to be with you.
I am glad you're here.

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.540
I am pretty sure how many people are there in Canada,
roughly.

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.070
I turned 87 media and 37 so I've gotten about 36 million emails that you on the

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.930
show or on Twitter.
I mean everybody in Canada seems to want us to do this.

9
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:34.440
Sit down.
So,

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.610
so I'll do my best so we shall see what happens.
Okay.

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.250
There's many reasons that I'm looking forward to this chat.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.860
And originally we were going to do this on Skype and then you were gracious

13
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:46.650
enough to say let's,
let's do this in person.
Um,

14
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.250
the fact that somebody in Canada is spreading the ideas of liberty and of the

15
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.050
individual and limited government,

16
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.280
all of those things is incredibly inspiring to me.

17
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.540
And it's war of what we need down here too.

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.950
But let's just start first with a little bit of your biography.

19
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:06.450
For people that don't know anything about you?
Yes.
Uh,
I'm a lawyer.

20
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.550
Um,
I did also of course in a businesses before,
um,

21
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.560
and I work in a private sector in Montreal,
Quebec,
uh,

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
in the financial sector.
I was VP of financial institutions.

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.310
And after that I work with the Montreal Economic Institute.

24
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.560
That's a free market think tanks,

25
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
like maybe the missus institute and the like that I was VP over there.

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.100
And in 2005,
um,

27
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.850
I had a meeting with Steven [inaudible] at that time.

28
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:40.650
He was the leader of the opposition before the election in 2006.

29
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.190
Uh,

30
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
and so he was looking for some ideas to be able to have some seats in Quebec.

31
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.680
As you know,
Quebec is the francophone part of the country.

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.210
And so we had a good chat together and I told him,
you know,

33
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.830
there's two important things that you must say to k Baker's if you want to win

34
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.570
first you must respect the constitution.
Because in Quebec,
if you remember,

35
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.170
we had the two referendum and uh,
we,

36
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.830
we still have a separate is a port,
it's called party at the provincial level.

37
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.100
So I told him,
you know,
respect the Canadian constitution,

38
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:18.810
don't interfere in provincial jurisdiction and everything will be okay.

39
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.880
And also lower taxes,
income tax,
a two k backers and all Canadians.

40
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.090
And at the end that was I think a good proposal for Quebec but also for,

41
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.290
uh,
all across the country.

42
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.120
And he decided to put that in his platform and he asked me to run with him in

43
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:41.080
2006.
So I decided to run.
And my writing,
my district,

44
00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:45.690
it is in both near Quebec city.
It's Afa role,
f urban riding.

45
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.820
And I went there because my dad was an emp under Brian Maroney,

46
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.050
uh,
for uh,
13 years.
And so when I came in,

47
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:59.770
bought in 2006 a to run,
the director of my campaign told me,

48
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.490
Maxine,
we have a problem with you.
Uh,

49
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.070
because I was working in Montreal that was not tender writing.
It said,

50
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.300
you have a name.
My Dad was very well known,
but you don't have a first name.

51
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.010
So a goal at the end of the campaign,
people must know you.

52
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.640
So I did a good campaign and a at the end,
a one and all sorts.

53
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.960
Steven Opera.
We formed a Gartman in 2006 and minority government,

54
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.160
2008 a minority government.
And I was introduced to municipal at that time.

55
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:32.161
I did a big deregulation in telecom and that's why people are had that Dame,

56
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070
the call me the uh,

57
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.050
Albert turn from Quebec because in Alberta they are very free markets.

58
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.730
And in Quebec at the plains Savalo we have a big fat and socialist government.

59
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.960
So,
and I do regret the telecom industry.
It was a big success.

60
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.670
And after that,
uh,
uh,
payments to our,

61
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:54.370
press me to be the finer fear and I was a foreign affair for a year and are

62
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:59.040
resigning.
And I came back in the cabinet in 2010.
And,
um,

63
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.550
I was a minister for Small Business and after dad,

64
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.400
a minister for a state for agriculture.

65
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.680
And so we had a majority government in 2000 and uh,
and uh,

66
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.890
11 and so we did some reform and after that in 2015 and two,

67
00:04:18.351 --> 00:04:20.980
door went in power,
uh,
and uh,

68
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.510
and still a member of parliament and our per resigning as the leader of the

69
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:30.511
party and the fine is coming ray now because they decided to run for the

70
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:33.830
leadership and create after that,

71
00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:37.440
I didn't win with the 49% of the votes and our wives,

72
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:39.160
they're mostly Bertoia and Kenny date.

73
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.330
And I had a very strong platform about individual freedom,

74
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.190
personal responsibility actually to four teams of our platform was individual

75
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:51.220
freedom,
personal restaurants,
MBT,
RF Becht and fairness.

76
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.640
And all our policies were based on these principles that was very successful at

77
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.150
49%.
And uh,
you know,

78
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.170
I was the only one to say we must abolish copwatch welfare.

79
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.950
While I'm good percent,
we might sort of saw card foreign aid and um,

80
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.930
and do a lot of changes like that on the economy and also on the immigration.

81
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.310
I had a strong platform,
so I didn't,
when I tried to work with the new leader,

82
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.240
um,
and we'll share,
uh,
trade to,
uh,

83
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.560
I wanted the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada to add up some of

84
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.170
our reforms because that was very popular.

85
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.820
And a year later he told me that,
uh,
you didn't want me anymore.

86
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.440
They won't take any of our,
of the ideas that I put forward and our,

87
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.820
so I did couple of tweets that they didn't like,
uh,

88
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:45.390
I bought it to your dog.
And so,
um,

89
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.490
I resigned from the body and in September I decided to create the People's Party

90
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:55.410
of Canada.
Yeah.
All right.
So you're your basic yeah.
Political pedigree there.

91
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.130
Uh,
is there an inherent sort

92
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.130
<v 1>of oddity of a libertarian trying to go into government where most people that</v>

93
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.350
go into government want to grow government,

94
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.650
they believe that if only their policies were instituted,

95
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.660
they could have a better government that could do more and so on versus a

96
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:18.410
libertarian comes in,
you cut regulation,
you want it to cut some programs,

97
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.760
et Cetera,
et cetera.

98
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.360
It's almost like you're trying to shrink the thing that's also your job now.

99
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:24.770
You've had real jobs also.

100
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:27.260
So I suspect you could look at it perhaps a little bit differently.

101
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.541
<v 0>Yeah.
Because you know,</v>

102
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:32.000
it wasn't a private sector before and I know that too much government,

103
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.350
it is not bringing prosperity and um,

104
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.260
kind of an Australian economist also.
Uh,

105
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.470
I like muses and all the,
you know,
my,

106
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.820
my peripheral website is Mrs Org.
So I'm,
I'm,
I'm,

107
00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:51.290
I'm a on the economy,
I can call,
you can call me battalion.
Um,

108
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.920
but um,
I'm not a really be tie in because it really brought,

109
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.570
Diana will ask for a opening borders or a norm,

110
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:02.450
more regulations or legislation on drugs.

111
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.760
And so I don't believe in that.
I think we must have a status

112
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.590
<v 1>that we'll have some regulation,
basic regulations.</v>

113
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.860
How do you figure out where that line is that that's been one of the things that

114
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:15.380
I talk about with a lot of different guests and that sort of seems to be a

115
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.710
little bit of the difference between people who consider themselves classical

116
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:22.670
liberals and libertarians where there's a little more say,
hand of the state.

117
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.910
On the classical liberal side.
Libertarians,
it's hard to know where the,

118
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.530
where the end is.
Are we,

119
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:31.600
are we just in Mad Max Mad Max was sometimes they call you mad.

120
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.830
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
so for me it's,
it's on a bod the economy,
uh,</v>

121
00:07:37.831 --> 00:07:41.640
that's the most important.
Uh,
and yes.
Um,
you know,

122
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
our social policies must be for more freedom and personal responsibility.

123
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.350
And I tried to make a big difference with the state and the economy like we did

124
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:56.190
in the past with the states and,
and religious,
you know,
uh,

125
00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:59.580
so that's always important to have this a difference.

126
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.620
And on the economy it's easy to be a libertarian and Apollo,

127
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.440
it's easier to be a difficult tie in,
in a politician,
uh,
because you know,

128
00:08:07.441 --> 00:08:10.760
it's all special interest group that are coming to you.
And they want a,

129
00:08:10.761 --> 00:08:15.570
a privilege or a or a or a more,
uh,
more,
uh,

130
00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:17.130
subsidies or things like that.

131
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.240
So I'm making the line when I'm seeing,
you know,

132
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.820
what me,
what I want,

133
00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:27.390
I want to work for all Canadians and not for a special interest group.

134
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.430
And when,
I don't know a in,

135
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:35.430
in group is coming to us and they just one to promote their privilege or to keep

136
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:38.550
their privilege,
that will be easy for me to say,
no,
I won't do that.

137
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.770
The best example or was the cocktail that we have in Canada in a,

138
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.720
in a supply management,

139
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:50.721
that's a socialist system that Pierre Trudeau put forward 45 years ago where a

140
00:08:51.901 --> 00:08:53.580
meal can pull tree and eggs.

141
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.010
The producers fixing the price and fixing the production for the Canadian
market,

142
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.390
they cannot export.
So Canadians are paying twice the price for a meal,

143
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.224
poultry and eggs.

144
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.080
If you compound that with the price that you're paying here in the US.

145
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.630
So these cartel is very powerful.

146
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.770
And when they came to me and they wanted to keep their privilege,
I say,
no,

147
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:17.670
you know,
we'll abolish that.
We'll have a transition period.

148
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.510
You'll be able to export.
I believe in a real free market.
It's,

149
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.240
if a free market is good for every industry,

150
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.780
mostly be good also for these people.
So.

151
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:29.840
So what's the counter argument on that though?
We've trued,
oh now,
yeah.

152
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.020
Not The old Trudeau,
but if our current Trudy,
yeah,

153
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.760
was giving the counter argument on why you wouldn't free that up.

154
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.340
Is that just because he doesn't believe in free market economics,

155
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:43.860
but it's because it's a powerful lobby and I'll Saudia one to keep seats also.

156
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:48.660
And they are very powerful in rural areas in the country and uh,

157
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.360
and so far they're powerful.
Second,
uh,

158
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.780
he is buying in their arguments that,
you know,
uh,

159
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.990
if we have meal from the u s or eggs from the US,

160
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.910
that won't be the same quality.

161
00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:04.911
And we need to stop that for being sure that we can control the quality of our

162
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:09.150
products.
And so that's another argument.
But for me,
you know,

163
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.320
when you have a legislation,
uh,
everybody in most respect dad,

164
00:10:14.321 --> 00:10:19.140
so if you want to export to Canada,
your eggs or your poetry or your milk,

165
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.150
you must follow the Canadian legislation and regulation.
That's a,

166
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.200
that's a no deal.
And uh,
but it's,
it's,
it's the powerful,

167
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.340
they're very powerful.
So the thinking is they want to keep,

168
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:36.600
not only to adore but are also my former party,
the conservative party of Canada,

169
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:40.600
the NDP.
Also the,
they are too afraid to uh,

170
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:46.530
to just just listen to Canadians.

171
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.320
They think that all we have a good system and they think that can again,
the,

172
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.910
the thing that can Indians don't understand that system.
They didn't,

173
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.550
that Canadian don't understand that they are paying twice the price.

174
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.520
So the more I speak about that,
the more popular it is.

175
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.460
And that was very important in my campaign for the leadership.

176
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:06.660
And it is also part of our platform right now.
So answering your questions,

177
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.950
why it all want to keep that cartel iding it's only for political reason.

178
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.400
So is the idea of liberty and personal responsibility and some of the other

179
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.550
things that you're running on are these oddly new in Canada.

180
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:22.010
And I say that because when,

181
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.800
when you started coming on my radar about a year ago,

182
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.460
I saw people started tweeting about you.

183
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.550
There were a lot of people saying something to the effect of,
wow,

184
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.100
if a libertarian is needed in Canada,

185
00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:36.120
then something really must be wrong there as if there was no need for it for a

186
00:11:36.121 --> 00:11:40.090
long time.
But maybe something unique is happening now.
Yeah.

187
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.180
And people are ready for the new ideas.

188
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.870
And I think people are fed up with traditional politicians that are seeing

189
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.890
something,
a d and d opposing the auditee,

190
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.590
a politician that tried to please the special interest group.
So what I'm doing,

191
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:56.740
you know,
I'm doing politics differently and uh,
you know,

192
00:11:56.741 --> 00:12:00.620
there is no political correctness,
uh,
for our party and seeing what,

193
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.550
what must be said for better policies in this country in Canada.

194
00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:08.500
Sorry.
And so the,
um,

195
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.810
I think people are ready and,

196
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.440
and what's happening actually right now,
you know,

197
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:16.810
it's good to have the right ideas,
but it's good.

198
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.810
It's better to have the right ideas at the right time.

199
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.210
And I think the timing is very good for us,

200
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:25.150
for me because we have a government in a,

201
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.480
in a Taiwan right now are to total Gutterman that Horace spending on a ton of

202
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.080
money,

203
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.580
huge defecit people they don't see and we don't know when they will balance the

204
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:37.510
budget.
Uh,
it must be around 20,
24,
uh,

205
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.760
and everybody knows that,

206
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:45.100
that the different set of today or the taxes of tomorrow.
So a huge deficit,

207
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:46.340
huge taxes,
you know,

208
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:50.740
Taiwan and you kind of need is social right now in Canada.

209
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.970
So people are looking for a kind of alternative and a,

210
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:59.140
and I think that timing is good for me because,
uh,
in a,

211
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:03.280
in a Paul 57% of Canadians said,

212
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.210
and maybe a month ago that they're ready to vote for a new party.

213
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.390
So we are a very new party for months and month old and they are ready to vote

214
00:13:13.181 --> 00:13:16.180
for a new party and not voting for the traditional parties.

215
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.680
Something is happening.
18 kit,
the big government in Ottawa,

216
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.710
every time putting a lot of regulations and a lot of subsidies to businesses.

217
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.520
Uh,
you know the governor,
they're loud.
Did GM a couple of years ago,

218
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.380
more than two point $5 billion and GM said,
uh,

219
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.130
two months ago that they will leave Canada.

220
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:44.250
So it's a waste of money and we're giving a lot of money to big businesses and

221
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.910
all the other politicians are saying,
yeah,
it's all key.
We Must Elf business.

222
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.060
What I'm saying,
yes we might l businesses,

223
00:13:52.061 --> 00:13:57.061
but every businesses having a fair policy that is to lower taxes to every

224
00:13:57.881 --> 00:14:02.530
businesses and not giving a subsidies and beaking winner and loser.

225
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.020
So I think people are ready for a change.

226
00:14:05.021 --> 00:14:08.980
They're seeing what's happening in our country and they know that we're not

227
00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:10.510
going in the right direction right now.

228
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.730
So let's talk a little bit about regulation,

229
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.710
because I think a lot of people think,

230
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.640
especially if they're on the left right now,
they think if you say,

231
00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.980
I'm cutting regulation,
well first they go to environmental regulations.
Yeah.

232
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.190
I think that's what they think first.
So I do want to ask me about that.
Yeah.

233
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.430
But also they think if you're just talking about a purely at a business level,

234
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:32.050
then that means that capitalism will then run a mock call.
It,
you know,

235
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.040
that all of these businesses will then start dumping in the rivers and doing

236
00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:39.400
shady deals with each other and competition will be crushed and all of those

237
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:41.530
things.
So you want to do business or,

238
00:14:41.531 --> 00:14:45.400
or environment first on the regulation front.
Yeah.
I think let's do,

239
00:14:45.401 --> 00:14:48.500
let's do business first and then,
yeah.
And then let's do business first.
Uh,

240
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.040
you know,
business most answered the needs of consumers.

241
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.280
So consumers are asking for better products and for a m products that's,

242
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.840
that will respect the environment.
Uh,

243
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.200
that's why they are asking for electric cars.

244
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:07.520
And so you don't always need regulation to force that.

245
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.250
The free markets,
the,
the,
uh,

246
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.790
the wish of the people will force businesses to adapt their practice in the

247
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:19.610
right way.
And so when you have,

248
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.030
when you have a real free market and when you have competition,

249
00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.730
it's always good at the end for the consumers.

250
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:29.720
You'll have a better products and you'll have a lower prices.

251
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.420
But at the same thing,
the way,
at the same time,

252
00:15:32.421 --> 00:15:37.100
the way that they are producing their products will change.
Right now,

253
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:41.480
you know,
people the best.
And some people are telling me,
you know,

254
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:46.000
we must have a,
you know,
cooperate to a social,
uh,
um,

255
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:50.900
uh,
uh,
corporate.
I do call that corporate social or corporate welfare.

256
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.100
No one will corporate social identity,
a corporation,

257
00:15:54.101 --> 00:15:58.210
my son be socially well.
Oh,
they have like the social awareness,

258
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.620
social awareness.
And I said,
you know,

259
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.690
not really because a corporation first must make profits.

260
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.550
If they don't make any profit,
the they won't.
They won't be able to do anything.

261
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.350
So if they are profitable,

262
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.970
it's because you want their peak consumer consumers who wants their goods and

263
00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:20.180
products.
So that's the first goal of our cooperation.

264
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:25.160
To make products and I think that you need regulation.

265
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.910
But,
uh,
what we're doing right now,
every time that something happened,

266
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:33.350
we put a new regulation,
but they must be a responsible of their actions,

267
00:16:33.351 --> 00:16:37.010
corporations and individuals or that that's important for me.

268
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.910
And I think Canadian understand that.
Yeah.
What about on the environmental side?

269
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:42.290
I think this is the big one.

270
00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.850
I think you've been for people who can understand free market economics.

271
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.733
It's a little bit more,

272
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.880
people think you just can't leave this environmental issues up to two private

273
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:51.680
companies.
Yeah.
You know,

274
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:55.790
you can sue a corporation if they don't respect the regulations.
Actually,

275
00:16:55.791 --> 00:17:00.190
you know,
clean the water.
It's very important.
But you know,
uh,

276
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:04.850
when you have facilities that are owned by the government or by the

277
00:17:04.851 --> 00:17:09.830
municipalities,
uh,
everything must be public.
If they're doing tests and,

278
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.450
and things like that.
Uh,
if the water is been on night,
when it's not public,

279
00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.170
you cannot,
uh,
you cannot sue them if they don't,

280
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:23.300
if they don't respect the regulation.
So I remember that Margaret,
or in Europe,

281
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.100
the way to clean water over there was to have a regulation saying every test

282
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:32.930
that you're doing and that was done by municipalities or public entity must be

283
00:17:32.931 --> 00:17:37.931
public and you will be responsible to be sure that you respect the regulations.

284
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.980
Should she just put a resolution on that?

285
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:45.190
Every test was public and five years later the wider Watsky nerd.

286
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:48.290
I didn't,
it was before because he didn't want to be sued.

287
00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:51.480
They didn't want to be so,
so they were responsible.

288
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.310
So when you have a real free market,

289
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:57.420
when everything is on the table and you know the information that's bring,

290
00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:01.350
usually a better quality of the water or land.

291
00:18:01.351 --> 00:18:05.430
And so you have property right for that and property rights.

292
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:09.810
It's the basics of,
of all that.
But speaking about the environment now,

293
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:12.970
the debate in Canada,
it's climate change.
Yeah.
So,

294
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.380
so everybody wants to do something about climate change.

295
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:20.620
And I'm the only party who said,
you know,
we won't do anything,
uh,

296
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.840
environment in car data share jurisdiction with provinces and the federal

297
00:18:24.841 --> 00:18:28.350
government.
And I don't believe in the Paris accord.

298
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.150
I don't believe that Canada would be able to achieve the goals that they put

299
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:35.630
into Paris accord.
And actually,
uh,

300
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:40.670
the UN and the radical environmental in Canada that said the same thing,

301
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:46.161
that Twitter one to impose a carbon tax of $20 a ton and he must impose a carbon

302
00:18:47.101 --> 00:18:51.410
tax off at least $200 a time if you want to achieve his target.

303
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.780
So at $20 at times it will be on there.

304
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:58.790
Distortion for the economy and odd working families would appear with PR your

305
00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:00.930
prices.
So that's why,
you know,

306
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.370
I don't believe in Paris accord and I think that we must not impose Paul's new

307
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.510
regulation on that.

308
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.680
We must lead provinces and a provincial government if they want to have a cap in

309
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:14.970
trade like they have here in the US and other kind of a process for that.

310
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.190
For us,
uh,

311
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.830
I want to have a program that will maybe be very strong on Clearwater or clear

312
00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:28.350
here,
something that people understand and having the property to rates,
uh,

313
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.890
that will work and more information.
You need more than

314
00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.870
<v 1>formation at the same time to be sure that people won't understand if this lake</v>

315
00:19:34.871 --> 00:19:35.980
is clear on that.
Yeah.

316
00:19:35.981 --> 00:19:38.290
So I'm glad you mentioned that because it seems to me that it's about

317
00:19:38.291 --> 00:19:41.590
information and being able to get your messaging across.
So for example,

318
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.880
the Paris accords,

319
00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:46.810
which obviously the United States pulled out of it seems very easy.

320
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.370
If you listen to the media,
it was very easy.

321
00:19:48.371 --> 00:19:50.170
We have to be part of the Paris accords.

322
00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.710
And then if you ask anyone what the Paris accords are,
they have no idea.

323
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:57.060
If you ask them when was was a binding,
is there any,
you know,
um,

324
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.890
is there anyone watching to make sure any of them this happens?

325
00:19:59.891 --> 00:20:04.050
They have no idea in the answer's no.
I just read last month that despite the,
uh,

326
00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.130
despite the US pulling out of the accords,

327
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.810
that right now the US is meeting most if not or exceeding all of the standards

328
00:20:10.811 --> 00:20:11.480
of the,
of course.

329
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.960
So how much of this is just about getting your messaging across because,
uh,

330
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.220
this will shift us a little bit to talking about the media,

331
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.530
which you've had an interesting relationship with.

332
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.730
<v 0>Yeah,
you're right about that.
You know,</v>

333
00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.470
it's all about to virtue senior link for a politician.
And,

334
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.130
but I think Canadian understand that they understand when I'm seeing,
you know,

335
00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.890
the total government,
I truly,

336
00:20:35.891 --> 00:20:40.480
right now there are a procreate or saying something to the population knowing

337
00:20:40.481 --> 00:20:44.320
that he won't be able to achieve that.
So I prefer to tell the truth thing,

338
00:20:44.321 --> 00:20:44.860
you know,

339
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:49.810
we won't sing that and we won't do to achieve that and we won't spend two point

340
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.840
$3 billion to send that to African countries to El them to fight climate change.

341
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.470
I think we must help Canadian first.
So that's part of our platform.

342
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.620
But the other party,
like the Conservative Party also,

343
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:07.060
they don't want to have a carbon tax when they want to impose more regulations,

344
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.800
uh,
on Canadian businesses.
And that's not the solution.
But they,

345
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.770
they try to please maybe the media,

346
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.960
but also a portion of the population.
And I think that,
you know,

347
00:21:19.961 --> 00:21:22.870
when you explained,
and that's what I like in politics,
you know,

348
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.960
I like to explain our policies and why we are,

349
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.370
we are having the right policies based on freedom and response.

350
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.770
Lbt and when you explain that,
the more you explain,

351
00:21:32.771 --> 00:21:37.240
I think the better people understand it and do more,
um,

352
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.070
uh,
more people will want to vote for our party.
So for me,

353
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.410
when I'm the only one to speak against the Paris accord,
uh,

354
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.230
there are a huge clientele there and it won't hurt me.

355
00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:55.180
It will help me at the end.
And,
uh,
and you know,
my,

356
00:21:55.181 --> 00:21:57.700
my deal with Canadians is be true.

357
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.690
Tell what you believe in and have some debates,
real debates.

358
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.370
And that's important for me.
So yes,
the media are playing an important role,

359
00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:11.330
but we need to use all sorts of social media and that's why,
you know,
uh,

360
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.810
I'm very pleased to be here to speak to the American audience and Canadians

361
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:20.610
audience and just tried to have a conversation with them anew.
Yeah.
Well,

362
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.340
what's the state of the media?
Yeah,
you guys have,

363
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.510
you guys have a whole different set of problems than what is going on with the

364
00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:32.440
CBC and just everything else in Canada.
I know we have to CBC,

365
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:35.740
like how your whole body language.
Yeah.

366
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:40.741
We have to CBC and the Federal Government is giving about one point $3 billion a

367
00:22:41.261 --> 00:22:45.010
year to the state,
uh,
uh,
broadcast or to CBC.

368
00:22:45.011 --> 00:22:49.760
And in French it's heads you Canada.
And I'm the only politician and it's,

369
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.860
it's a very popular policy that we must cut that because it is unfair to CBC are

370
00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.580
competing with other private broadcaster,
uh,
for the advertising,

371
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.290
uh,
and also the received money from the government.
So it is not fair.

372
00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:08.260
We must cut the CBC and a,
and what I want,

373
00:23:08.261 --> 00:23:12.610
I want the CBC to be a little bit like a PBS in the state.
If they're so good,

374
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:17.250
they will be able to have money from their viewers.
But also the CBC,

375
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.670
uh,
their editorial board are a little bit,

376
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.930
I will be very,
uh,
very kind look a bit the left ear.
So,
yeah.

377
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.880
So very,
yeah.
Yeah.
And uh,
it's worse in French door.

378
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.451
They're agile.

379
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:36.370
Canada in French are a more left ears then CBC sometimes.

380
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:41.230
So is there a reason for that?
You know,
uh,
it's like your media here.

381
00:23:41.231 --> 00:23:46.160
It's a bit,
but,
but the worst thing is it is funded by the government.

382
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.900
So if you're a,
I dunno,
a CNN and you don't receive any fumble,

383
00:23:49.901 --> 00:23:53.990
you government and you want to to be on the left,

384
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.210
if it's your corporate decision,

385
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.360
but the CBC must be more neutral and they are not.

386
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:03.350
So that's the big problem that we have in Canada.
The way to fix that,

387
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:04.280
it's first of all,

388
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.640
CBC must be a must receive money from the viewers first and second.

389
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:15.290
Uh,
the government,
if the government is giving money to CBC,

390
00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.010
we must know the,
uh,

391
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.160
what's happening and maybe the executive of the CBC must be before the

392
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:26.120
parliament once a year to explain their editorial policy.

393
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.200
But that being said,
uh,
the media,
we have the CBC,

394
00:24:30.201 --> 00:24:31.580
we have the traditional media.

395
00:24:31.581 --> 00:24:36.460
But when you're a real conservative or right wing politician,
uh,

396
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.000
you don't have the same coverage than the,
uh,
the Liberals or the left.

397
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.260
Uh,
they're having in these traditional media,

398
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.150
<v 1>do you think in a weird way that that's working to your favor now?</v>

399
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.700
Because at least in the circles that I can see,

400
00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:55.701
you seem to be the hottest Canadian politician despite the fact,

401
00:24:55.921 --> 00:24:57.060
and it's,
maybe it's fueled by,

402
00:24:57.061 --> 00:25:01.830
maybe it's not despite maybe because of the fact that you're the outsider from

403
00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:05.160
the media and people are so fed up with the media that it's like,
oh,
here,

404
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.920
here's this guy doing it,
you know,
circumventing them.

405
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.840
<v 0>And also,
you know,
um,
uh,
when the media,</v>

406
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.890
the traditional media or writing something about us or my party,

407
00:25:15.891 --> 00:25:19.940
that is not true.
I will call that.
I will.
Uh,
and I'm very,

408
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.800
very factual on,
on,
on social media and Twitter about it.

409
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.500
And,
uh,
you know,

410
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.050
I don't try to please everybody or I don't know how to please the media.

411
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.100
They have to do a job.
If they are fair,
it's okay.
If they are not fair,

412
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:39.170
I will be out there.
And,
uh,
and I will,
uh,
I will argue my case.

413
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.430
And that's not all,
all the Polish and the Polish.
I'm not doing that.

414
00:25:43.431 --> 00:25:46.910
They want to be fine with the media.

415
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.640
They don't want to have a fight with the media.
And for me,

416
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.050
I to have a fight with a jaundiced,
uh,
if a is not doing his job.

417
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.270
And I think people,
I appreciate that.
So yes,
when they're doing something,
not,

418
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.800
um,
objective on our policies,
on my party,

419
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.000
that can help me at the end because you know,
the credibility of journalists,

420
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:11.450
it is not the same with people like you on social media.

421
00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.490
People have another way to find your news and they're a little bit more critics,

422
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.530
a tower,
the traditional journalists and yes,
I agree with you.
That can help me.

423
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.730
Yeah.
As a politician,

424
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.640
are you able to debate some of your political opponents these days?
I mean,

425
00:26:26.641 --> 00:26:30.560
does anyone in Canada put these kinds of talks on a television where you can

426
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.420
actually get into the ideas with some of the people that you disagree with?
No,

427
00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.870
usually when I'm on the traditional TV in Canada,
it's all about,

428
00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.660
you know,
five minutes,
six minutes you don't want to get yeah.
Sounds like,
yeah,

429
00:26:43.661 --> 00:26:45.030
yeah,
yeah.
They wanted the only to have it.

430
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:49.500
And they don't give you enough time to insert the questions and then to go

431
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:53.520
deeper in the subject.
Uh,
but that's why I use social media.

432
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:56.820
That's why I'm prison in social media.
So,
but you know,

433
00:26:56.821 --> 00:27:01.140
I need to deal with that and I think it's going very well right now.

434
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.010
So how does this all link to just sort of a state of free speech in Canada

435
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.210
because there does something seem to be something particularly unique in Canada,

436
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.750
which is why I've had so many Canadian guests and why Canada is usually our

437
00:27:12.751 --> 00:27:14.340
second or third most viewed country.

438
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.340
Obviously there was the Jordan Peterson incident with [inaudible].
Yeah,

439
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.940
there's what happened with w uh,
Lindsay Shepherd at Wilfrid Laurier.
Yay.

440
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:24.120
You've got Gad sat up there.
Who's,

441
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:27.900
who's always fighting the battle of free speech.
Is there something,
is there,

442
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.550
is this new,
what's happening related to political correctness in Canada?
Yeah.

443
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:37.350
I think first of all,
that started 40 years ago in the university in Canada,

444
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:39.780
like in the US.
But now what's happening,

445
00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.490
there are some politicians who believe in that and with that motion m one or

446
00:27:44.491 --> 00:27:48.690
tree to be able to see 16.
Now these people that were,

447
00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.210
that were on the at school couple of years ago,
40 years ago now,

448
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.710
some of them are politicians and,
uh,

449
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.640
you have this debate right now and it's,

450
00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:03.210
it's good for us that we have Jordan Peterson and people like that.
Um,

451
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.620
we must fight,
I think,

452
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.650
when must not take for granted in Canada or freedom of expression and free

453
00:28:10.471 --> 00:28:15.250
speech and,
and we must fight.
And I'm doing that as a politician.
Uh,

454
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.980
and you know,
would,
would that build see 16,
that was crazy.
Bill.

455
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.690
You know,
Jordan,
they want to force his Jordan to,
uh,

456
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.860
speak with a trans or gender.
Uh,
not he or she bought,

457
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.260
what was the word?
Oh,
it was whatever they want.
Whatever they want.
Yeah,
yeah.

458
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:38.160
But there no obligation.
You know,
there's no obligation to please everybody.

459
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.320
And that's what this all comes down to though,

460
00:28:40.321 --> 00:28:41.750
that people just don't understand it.

461
00:28:41.751 --> 00:28:46.170
And the fundamental responsibility of government in a freezer side.
I mean,

462
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:51.120
if we were boiling all this into one thing,
that seems to me to be it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

463
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.660
You don't want the government to tell you what to do.

464
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.420
You don't want the government to tell you what to say.
You know,

465
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.830
it's the basics of our democracy.
And actually,
you know,

466
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.890
one of our candidate,
look,
I Lynn,
because we're,

467
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.820
we have a f three by elections in Canada at the end of February,

468
00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:13.440
the 25th of February.
And I will have candidates and people are party of Canada.

469
00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:18.130
We'll have candidate.
And one of our candidates look alien in BC,
um,
uh,

470
00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.260
Brunette BBC.
In that writing,
she add the Prion Shola Ball,
uh,

471
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.900
fied for,
um,
uh,

472
00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:29.730
gender against the gender fluidity in BC in discord.

473
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:34.731
It's a provincial jurisdiction they wanted to teach at school,

474
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:40.200
to young kids that if you're a boy,
you may not be a boy.

475
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.440
And if you're a,
you may not be a girl and you can choose your sex.

476
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:50.070
The state wants to impose that and to teach that to young people and look at the

477
00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:54.330
inch.
And Noah,
I don't want that.
I don't want the state to tell us what to do.

478
00:29:54.331 --> 00:29:56.500
And that must be the responsibility of the parents.

479
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.620
So you don't have to put that in the mind of a young boys,

480
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:02.560
six or seven or five years old.
So,

481
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.290
but when she decided to be our candidate,

482
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.090
all the mainstream media as all Bernie and I said,
you know,

483
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.140
she has the right to our own opinion and that's a great debate that they had at

484
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:17.470
the provincial level.
Now she's doing politics.
I've definitely level,

485
00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:22.600
but you know,
they were trying,
they were trying to look at her like,

486
00:30:22.601 --> 00:30:26.410
you know,
she may be a crazy Kenny Dade because she,
she,

487
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.420
she has some,
some opinions and strong opinions.
But you know,

488
00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.640
because I believe in freedom of speech and our candidates can have opinions like

489
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:38.890
that.
We have candidates that are pro choice.

490
00:30:38.891 --> 00:30:42.610
We have candidates that are poor life by just staying to adorn the liberals.

491
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:47.050
They don't want any pro life candidates.
So for me,
my party must be like the,

492
00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:52.090
the,
uh,
our Canadian society.
So yes,

493
00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.100
I will tolerate different point of view,

494
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:59.050
but people must be all behind our programs.
A program that's very important.

495
00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.370
But yes,

496
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:04.720
we have these debates right now in Canada about the state imposing some,

497
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:09.340
some values that a,
I think that's not the role of government.

498
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:12.330
Is it actually part of the policy of the Trudeau government that you,

499
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:15.380
if you're a pro life,
that you actually can't be,
you know,

500
00:31:15.381 --> 00:31:17.680
it's still in the party platform.
It's a party platform.

501
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:19.780
If you're a pro life person,

502
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.780
you cannot be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada.

503
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.190
And just staying to the door said that.
