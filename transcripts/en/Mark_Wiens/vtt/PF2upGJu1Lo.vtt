So right after we finish breakfast, we're heading out look at how yellow it is though. I

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.070
Think their onions in there

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.129
You can always count on the coffee to be great in Ethiopia. Ah, this is what they were blending back in the kitchen mango juice

We drove all the way through the banana fields again and then threw out of a Minch

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.670
And now we're on the other side of the city and we're going up high into the mountains

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.119
We're really getting high here gaining elevation getting into the misty peaks of the mountains the pine trees

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.860
Oh man, the views. It's really wet too and starting to just miss

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.840
We're gonna step into the main hut and it's it's spectacular the construction. They're known to look like an elephant with the front section

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.619

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.250
Really big in here you can see that the ceiling at the top there the arched ceiling

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.309
But it's really nice and warm in here compared to outside

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.809
and then the seats if you can see if you can see are made from cowhide and

Eucalyptus. Yeah, cool. I'm gonna take a take a seat

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.659
Oh, oh, yeah, they kind of like revolve and kind of recline like like hammock cow skin

This is your home. Yeah, this is your yeah. I've been I was born and raised in a house like this

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.700
so you're on endorsing  which is the elevation of

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.989
2500 meters above sea level and there is a mainly known for weaving

Okay, they weave their closes their fences. If you saw the fence is found even the house is made by

So there is a when the milky is boiling they would be putting the dabula which is the squeezed fermented kind of

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:13.800
banana false banana

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.800
Okay

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.879
So this is the false banana, yeah home false banana

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.688
We call it bula if they just brought in the plate of bula, which is the false banana

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.179
It has this sour aroma to it because it's been fermented

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.329
And then it's kind of powdery right now

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:45.589
Who is have a button taco much as in the olden days to go to Italy my token either those they are become you listen

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.709
He's just whisking that and she has this kind of fork made from bamboo

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.439
That she's stirring as she adds the false banana and then just whipping that up into

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.789
Into the porridge and you can hear that just start to bubble away and steam. Oh

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.580
Hi, Micah

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.979
Ok stepping out of the hut right now as she's making that but I wanted to see her pounding the coffee very fresh coffee less

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:18.919
Coffee leaves so they're making a coffee

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.669
Leaf drink a tea and it's very very cold for a good for cold Wow

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.769
And we think that's something I've never big

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.430
She place after she make the tea coffee leaves

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.339
And you can see the smoke coming from the top of the elephant hut there that's coming from the

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.189
The fire that we're cooking on. Ok, I'm going back into that hot to to keep cooking. Ok. This is butter. Ah

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.719
And bigger this is the garlic

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.550
Is it also called case

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.099
Vii of always immediately. Sometimes they put lemon wasn't Wow, listen up my school my dad necessary, but

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:30.919
She added in some powder fenugreek and then that's going in the burden she's still kind of whipping it up

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.230
What Mitchell made

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:49.069
Another dish that she's gonna make it is false banana also, but it's a stir-fried or fried version

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:54.470
So she had this she has this metal pan a rounded pan

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.729
she stuck over the fire and then she put the rest of that false banana and then she's just kind of

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.860
Mixing it on that hot plate

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:29.660
So she takes some of this but it's muttered also and garlic in London very spice one and then some bacon

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.399
She's now oh she's gonna make that that coffee

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.509
Leaf tea which is going on the fire right now

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.860
But I think we're gonna go get started eating and then she will put some garlic

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.629
Into the tea and the tea Wow garlic that is very spicy

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:04.810
well, oh, wow the cooking and the whole process in this Hut and the culture is just

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.230
fascinating you walk into the back of the hut here's the side of the

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:14.079
elephant hut these are the false banana trees and yeah bamboo as you can see is it's a

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.329
Lifeline I in the daughter set bamboo and false bananas are two of the most important

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.660
Substances materials both for construction for for livelihood and for food

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:37.029
Not to make it cold that is the poet that she was throwing this is the right the frame, okay

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.280
We are sitting down to eat. This is a

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.810
beautiful table full of natural herbs and flowers

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:51.759
putting like the grass like this when the guests come is like welcoming into the free Thailand Wow, so

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.149
Green is for time doing alright

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.750
It's really good

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.139
I'm gonna dig into the porridge first and well has a very like

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.560
Very sticky gummy kind of texture to it and all of that it almost looks like cinnamon on top sprinkle, but that's all the fenugreek

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:26.009
Wow the first thing I got because of that fenugreek on the top is a little bit of bitterness

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:30.568
Then you taste that undertone of the butter, which is yeah

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:36.779
It's like infused with that kind of spiciest aroma to it and almost like browned

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:40.078
So it has that that kind of roasted butter flavor to it

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:45.599
And then that's all wrapped up within the false banana porridge, which is it has a sticky texture

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.319
But at the same time it's soft. It's like gummy but also falls apart

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.509
You can tell how that would just warm you all the way to your core when it's really cold outside

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.370
We have the garlic

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:04.149
And yep

00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:10.138
The the thing I forgot to share with you with the description on that first bite is that it's quite sour

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.939
because the false banana is

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:15.839
It's fermented for underground

00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:17.649
for three to seven months

00:11:17.649 --> 00:11:22.589
and kind of just skim off the top to make sure you get some fenugreek and everybody right and you can see the way that

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:25.919
Just kind of jiggles in your spoon that texture

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.099
The texture and the flavor is really like

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:35.370
Unlike anything I've ever had before

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:42.568
There is garlic there is the spice buttery and the first burner. My product is also the same but she instead of making porridge

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:44.569
She scrambled it

00:11:46.699 --> 00:11:49.928
It's there was asked to come in Chewy

00:11:51.379 --> 00:11:56.229
This is way softer. You can see it's more like grainy. It's like in a little little poet too much

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:09.159
Wow, that's a like completely different texture each little grain is like its own stickiness like little little gummy balls

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:14.289
But then you do taste the chili in there. The butter also makes it moist little gummy pellets

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.040
Yeah you kind of got a

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.499
Kind of gummy you got to kind of work at it and chew it

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:30.729
But then as you to it you get that flavor and the garlic you will have the holy water. Hmm

00:12:32.179 --> 00:12:39.009
We use the room which you drunk mainly. Oh really, which is mainly for coffee

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:08.979
You know what it starts to sort of have the tapioca pearl

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:12.189
Texture and those little little balls to them

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:16.479
Just like a whole mouthful of them though. Okay. Yeah we can compete

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.250
Okay, we're gonna go see the false banana and also go around the

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.899
Compound a little bit the village but men you can just tell how that porridge it would just it's so filling

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:37.419
And it would just it would just sit in your stomach, but it is good

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:41.260
It's it's it really is a flavor combination. I've never had before

00:13:41.899 --> 00:13:45.638
She's gonna show us the entire process of the false banana now and false

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:48.789
banana is one of the most important foods for the doors a

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:57.550
Behind me. These are all false banana's and you can see they're giant huge trunks and then the the leaves just kind of sprout

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.300
upwards

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:05.260
But the reason that they're called false bananas is because they don't produce fruit. They don't produce bananas that you can eat

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:06.949
but

00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:11.499
What's harvested is the the stumps and that's what's used for food?

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:18.820
Ethiopia is one of the one of the the main places where you can eat false banana in this region. It's the staple

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.880
Weight so this is the stump part this is the stump part

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:32.859
So this is the stamp part which will be fermented for three months. Oh, yeah, it smells like very green banana smells like green banana

00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:35.739
It becomes very very tough fibers

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:48.698
It's really really juicy as well you can see the juice coming out of it so the better there was very green

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.610
after three months of them

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:59.469
They smell already changed into cheesy. Mmm. Yeah, it does kind of smell cheesy like a mild cheese. Oh my god has that aroma?

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:11.239
It's almost like a dough that is the result of the fermentation and now

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.359
The the process before you eat it though ever before you cook it

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.400
She still has to chop it with a knife because there's so many fibers within it so that you break those fibers

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.700
And now she's she chopped it up and is mixing it with some water

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.100
So here you're gonna eat okay

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:41.089
This is definitely a staple food and a process and even an ingredient. I've never seen anywhere else in the world

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.260
The pancake made from the false banana had actually just prepared and it's called cocoa

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.820
and now they are they're building a fire with leaves especially so they get that flame and

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:59.300
Then they put the the false minutes wrapped in banana the false banana leaves. Which come from right here

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.390
And then it's gonna cook over the fire over that hot griddle

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:19.359
As she kept on flipping she eventually took off the banana leaves and that provides a little bit of oil for the pancake

00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:23.289
But we're gonna head back to that hut where we ate before

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.029
And we're gonna drink some of the coffee with tea and then she's gonna bring that there as we're gonna we're gonna sample

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:05.380
This is again something I've never tried in something I never have never even thought of oh

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.540
Wow that's almost like a like a soup you taste

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:21.339
You taste the saltiness of it and you taste that garlic and then it has like almost like a tea undertone

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.339
Wow, that's that's something

00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:27.309
That's totally new

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.659
Wow, you can really taste the garlic

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:41.050
This is the recorded tomato source, but it's very very spicy its Chile Chile, okay

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.250
It's very spicy

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.750
Okay

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:57.790
so the kocho is served and there's a little dish in the middle part of it is hundred and then part of it is a

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.479
Chili sauce so you can eat them together kind of sweet and savory at the same time

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.150
Or you can just try one of the one of the dips

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.420
Mmm all the sauce

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.490
you can taste those spices like

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.309
I can now piece dump dunked in that honey. And that's just natural honey. Ethiopia is known for honey

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.409
Well that honey is an awesome yeah thing is loving the honey

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.699
Yeah that honey is extremely good it is

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.460
slightly sour

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:39.439
So thick and so sweet now, I'm gonna now I'm gonna try and mix of both the chili and the honey

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:51.799
That's just a beautiful combination of spicy and sweet and crunchy single bye-bye. Thank you so much

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.140
We had to race down the mountain back to a dimension because we have to catch our flight

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:13.890
