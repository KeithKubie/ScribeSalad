00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.030
&gt;&gt; Alright, what'd you get?

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.280
&gt;&gt; I say yes.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.710
&gt;&gt; And the answer, that comes from what?

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.124
&gt;&gt; Well, we both start off and cooperate. And so, you are always going to

00:00:09.124 --> 00:00:10.688
cooperate and it doesn't make any sense

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:12.620
for anyone to ever move away from cooperation.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.460
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.480
&gt;&gt; Hence, you are at equilibrium, in particular, you are at Nash equilibrium.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.700
&gt;&gt; That is correct.
