00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:02.039
- [Instructor] Okay, so
we've been talking about

00:00:02.039 --> 00:00:05.153
The Second Great Awakening and its context

00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:07.980
in early 19th century America.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.301
The Second Great Awakening was this period

00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:13.257
of religious revival that was kind of

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:16.638
at its hot point in 1820 to 1840

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:18.099
and in the last couple of videos,

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.737
we've been talking about just the nature

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:24.054
of this society that produced
The Second Great Awakening,

00:00:24.054 --> 00:00:27.290
particularly how they responded to changes

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.883
in how people related to
each other in business

00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:32.180
and also just broader social changes

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.819
like the expansion of American democracy

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.881
and the expansion of
American territory west.

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.988
So in this last video,
I want to talk about

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:44.529
some of the outgrowths of
The Second Great Awakening.

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:46.690
So why do we care so much that

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.832
there was this period
of religious revival?

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:51.468
What did it lead to in American life?

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:55.601
There are two major things
that were directly related

00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:58.971
to The Second Great Awakening
in this early 19th century.

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:01.472
New religious movements
in the United States,

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:03.953
some of which are still with us today

00:01:03.953 --> 00:01:06.649
and even more importantly
for the time period,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.326
major reform movements, including

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:12.086
the Movement for Abolition,
the end of slavery,

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:14.799
which is going to lead to the
outbreak of The Civil War.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.471
So let's look a little bit
closer at these two things.

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.165
So as we've talked about,
The Second Great Awakening

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.880
promoted both the idea that one should try

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.963
to create heaven on earth

00:01:26.449 --> 00:01:30.616
and also, a more democratic
approach to religion in general,

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:34.970
that it didn't matter who you were.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.327
If you were a man, a woman,
white, black, enslaved, free,

00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:42.791
you were still entitled to a
personal relationship with God

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:44.588
and a chance at salvation.

00:01:44.588 --> 00:01:46.728
So one of the things this
meant in this time period

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:51.110
is that there's just a lot
of religious experimentation.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.277
A lot of new American religions
emerge at this time period,

00:01:56.523 --> 00:01:58.240
some of which are still with us today,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.112
some of which are not.

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:04.595
This here is a representation
of the Shakers,

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.809
which were a religious community of,

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:09.904
they embrace kind of simplicity.

00:02:09.904 --> 00:02:12.348
They separated the sexes.

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:14.348
They practiced celibacy.

00:02:15.872 --> 00:02:20.786
Just as kind of trying to make
their daily lives more pure

00:02:20.786 --> 00:02:23.786
and unfortunately, the celibacy part

00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.672
meant that they more or
less died out by the 1940s,

00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:30.562
although there are a handful of Shakers

00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:31.977
who are still alive today

00:02:31.977 --> 00:02:33.102
and they were called the Shakers

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:34.632
because they would have these kind of

00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:36.717
ecstatic religious experiences,

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:38.820
which you can see are kind of similar to

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.901
what happened in the camp meetings.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:42.854
So even though they didn't have sex,

00:02:42.854 --> 00:02:45.149
they would kind of get out their ecstasy

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.316
in this process of
these big circle dances,

00:02:48.316 --> 00:02:50.078
which people looked at and they said

00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:51.379
they seemed like they were shaking,

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.878
so they were the Shakers.

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:54.334
On the other side of the spectrum,

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:57.488
there was the Oneida community,

00:02:57.488 --> 00:03:01.488
which was led by a man
named John Humphrey Noyes

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:04.905
and they preached the idea that

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:07.804
one should have no earthly
attachments basically

00:03:07.804 --> 00:03:10.007
and that meant also to a spouse,

00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:14.174
so they believed in what
was called complex marriage

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:18.278
or what we would really call free love.

00:03:18.278 --> 00:03:20.771
There was no such thing
as an individual marriage,

00:03:20.771 --> 00:03:22.267
that women and men could have

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.199
sex with whomever they pleased.

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.719
It's interesting that approaches to sex

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.270
were very central to
these religious movements.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.438
Probably the most important
religious movement

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:33.941
to come out of this time period

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:36.644
was the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-Day Saints,

00:03:36.644 --> 00:03:39.515
also known as the Mormons,

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:43.682
who were founded by Joseph
Smith in Rochester, New York

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.367
and Smith had a vision that
he was visited by an angel

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:52.560
who presented him with gold plates

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.816
and on these gold plates
was a new Scripture

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:57.188
called The Book of Mormon

00:03:57.188 --> 00:03:59.779
and Smith's followers
really continued to be

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.627
devoted to the religion, even though

00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:03.555
they faced a lot of persecution,

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:06.802
particularly over their
early practice of polygamy

00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:09.139
until they continued to move west

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.273
under the leadership of a
second man, Brigham Young,

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:16.098
who took over after Smith was murdered

00:04:16.098 --> 00:04:18.481
by an angry crowd in Illinois

00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:21.148
who then led the Mormons to Utah

00:04:22.877 --> 00:04:24.226
where they continue to be a major

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.827
religious group to this day.

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:27.133
Oh, and one other interesting thing

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.203
about this is the Oneida community.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:31.819
Although, it itself did not survive,

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:34.406
one of the ways that they
made money as a community

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:38.470
was by making silverware
and so Oneida Silverware

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.046
is actually the descendant company

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:44.422
of this really interesting
communal experiment

00:04:44.422 --> 00:04:47.629
and they lasted, I believe, until 2006,

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:49.525
so if you ever had Oneida Silverware,

00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:51.494
you were looking at an artifact

00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:54.174
of a 19th century religious movement.

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:57.003
So the last and probably
the most important part

00:04:57.003 --> 00:04:59.856
of The Second Great Awakening
that I wanna talk about

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:02.927
is its influence on reform movements.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:05.131
So let me give myself a little
bit more space to write here.

00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:07.485
There are several 19th
century reform movements

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:10.343
that are tied in to The
Second Great Awakening.

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:14.677
One of these would be
The Temperance Movement,

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:17.844
which hoped to reduce and or eliminate

00:05:19.237 --> 00:05:21.820
people's consumption of alcohol

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.616
and you can kinda tie this back

00:05:25.616 --> 00:05:28.931
to the idea of heaven on earth, right?

00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:32.870
How can you have a stable family home,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.369
how can you have a godly society

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.330
if everybody's drunk all the time?

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.262
But I would say the most important

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:43.941
reform movement associated
with The Second Great Awakening

00:05:43.941 --> 00:05:46.272
was the Abolitionist Movement

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:48.910
and remember that Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.759
who wrote Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:54.497
which was one of the greatest
abolition or anti-slavery

00:05:54.497 --> 00:05:56.789
advertisements in the world,

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.048
was the daughter of Lyman Beecher,

00:05:59.048 --> 00:06:01.962
one of the greatest preachers
of The Second Great Awakening

00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:05.462
and so as people came to believe that

00:06:05.462 --> 00:06:08.420
everyone's life was equally valuable,

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.259
they became more and more involved

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.155
in the idea that slavery should not exist,

00:06:15.155 --> 00:06:18.405
that people who were enslaved had souls

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.686
that were just as worthy of salvation

00:06:21.686 --> 00:06:24.672
as anyone who was already free

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:28.839
and so they also saw this
as one of the perversions

00:06:30.048 --> 00:06:33.315
of God's word and a
perversion of the family,

00:06:33.315 --> 00:06:36.748
which they saw as the central unit

00:06:36.748 --> 00:06:39.905
of American democracy and Republicanism.

00:06:39.905 --> 00:06:42.238
So slavery should not exist.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.220
People who were really
motivated by their faith in God

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.066
and their faith in trying to create

00:06:50.066 --> 00:06:52.393
heaven on earth and a better society

00:06:52.393 --> 00:06:56.257
campaigned really strenuously
for the end of slavery

00:06:56.257 --> 00:06:59.065
and ultimately, were successful.

00:06:59.065 --> 00:07:01.735
So this is a really complex topic,

00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:03.395
The Second Great Awakening.

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:06.145
If we look back at our web again,

00:07:07.476 --> 00:07:10.822
we can see that this
wave of religious revival

00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:13.611
was connected in all
sorts of interesting ways

00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:17.778
to the economic and political
changes of the time period

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:21.240
and in its way, led to all sorts of

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.110
different social changes,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:26.046
so I think it's a good example of how

00:07:26.046 --> 00:07:29.252
it's sometimes really hard to separate

00:07:29.252 --> 00:07:31.099
things that happened in the past

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:33.650
into really neat boxes, right?

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.866
That, oh, there was politics.

00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:37.030
There was religion.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.078
There was culture.

00:07:38.078 --> 00:07:39.976
There were economics, but in many ways,

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:43.433
they're all bound together
in a larger culture,

00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:47.809
within which everyday
individuals navigated their lives

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:50.063
and it's also good to show us that

00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:52.482
sometimes we don't exactly know

00:07:52.482 --> 00:07:54.515
why things happened in the past.

00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:57.053
We know that people got really interested

00:07:57.053 --> 00:07:59.158
in religion in this time period,

00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:01.744
but historians have differing ideas

00:08:01.744 --> 00:08:03.239
about why that might have been.

00:08:03.239 --> 00:08:06.916
Some say that it was a form
of trying to control people

00:08:06.916 --> 00:08:09.459
as it was more and more important to have

00:08:09.459 --> 00:08:13.626
a dutiful workforce for a
factory-based industrial society

00:08:14.546 --> 00:08:16.105
and some people say that maybe,

00:08:16.105 --> 00:08:19.374
it was just about demographic
and political shifts

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:23.053
in who had power, who had
money, and who got to vote,

00:08:23.053 --> 00:08:25.666
but we do know that The
Second Great Awakening

00:08:25.666 --> 00:08:29.018
and these ideas of trying
to improve America,

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:32.627
to improve the world, and
to create heaven on earth

00:08:32.627 --> 00:08:35.114
led to all sorts of interesting things

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:37.003
that are still with us today,

00:08:37.003 --> 00:08:40.471
including religious movements
and the end of slavery.
