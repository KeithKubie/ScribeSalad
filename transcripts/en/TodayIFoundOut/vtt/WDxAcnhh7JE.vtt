00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.160
Generally speaking, olive oils fall into one
of two broad categories: refined and unrefined,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.010
with virgin and extra virgin fitting in the
latter category, and pure and light olive

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.580
oils in the former.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.270
Olives used to make the two virgin, unrefined
oils aren’t treated with heat or chemicals,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.830
but, rather, are cold pressed; as the name
implies, this means the olives are simply

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.380
pressed and squeezed to get the oil out.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.559
Those olives that produce the highest quality
oil in terms of rich taste (though flavor

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.300
can still vary wildly based on a variety of
factors) and acidity make extra virgin olive

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.760
oil, while slightly riper olives, that are
also simply just pressed, produce virgin olive

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.760
oil.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.850
In terms of acidity, to be graded extra virgin,
the olive oil must have an oleic acid content

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.869
of less than 0.8%, while virgin olive oil
can have as much as 2.0% (or 1.5% under International

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.579
Olive Council standards).

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.670
As these unrefined products are made from
better oils, they are typically more (and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.510
in some cases much more) expensive than their
refined brethren.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.340
They are also considered better for you (at
least before they’re heated significantly),

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.530
as they retain all of their minerals, enzymes,
vitamins and phenols.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.889
The refined oils, (pure) olive oil and light,
are generally made from oils that would be

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:31.040
relatively unpalatable if bottled without
further processing.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.490
As such, they are treated with solvents and
high heat to remove undesirable odors and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.490
flavors.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.469
The process leaves a relatively neutral-tasting,
light (in color) olive oil.

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.909
Sometimes, in order to make light oils taste
a bit like the more expensive grades, a small

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.740
percentage of virgin olive oil is blended
into the refined oil, with the end product

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.790
generally being labeled simply “olive oil”
or “pure olive oil.”

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.609
Some labeled “light” olive oils are are
also blended with other oils such as canola.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.999
While the refined olive oils are less nutritious,
they are also less affected by high temperatures

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.490
when compared with the virgin oils.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.640
For comparison, the smoke point of extra virgin
olive oil is approximately 320°F (160°C),

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.470
virgin at approximately 420°F (215°C), and
light at approximately 465°F (240°C).

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.200
As such, it’s typical to use light olive
oil for things like baking, grilling, frying,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.250
and sautéing, essentially where high temperatures
are required and particularly in cases where

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.410
a strong olive taste is not desired.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.030
On the other end of the spectrum, extra virgin
olive oil is generally preferred for things

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.280
like dressing and dips, where a flavorful
oil is preferable and the oil isn’t going

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.030
to be subjected to high heats that would rapidly
degrade it.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.690
It should also be noted here that although
the label may say things like “Cold Pressed”

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.760
and “Extra Virgin” that doesn’t necessarily
mean that’s what you’re getting.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.770
In recent years, several reports have circulated
that some oils sold as “extra virgin”

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.840
were not.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.630
Beyond potentially using refined olive oil
in these containers, in some cases the oil

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.260
had also been adulterated with canola, soy,
corn or cottonseed oil.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.600
While many of these claims may well be overblown,
in 2015, Italian authorities discovered that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.870
9 out of every 20 bottles of olive oil sold
by its top exporters were tainted with other

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.310
types of oil.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.000
Among the companies allegedly selling lesser-quality
oils as “extra virgin” were Bertolli,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.790
Carapelli and Primadonna.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.570
To get around the problem of mislabeling,
in the U.S. the California Olive Oil Council

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.620
(COOC) provides olive oil grade certification
(with their seal appearing on certified bottles),

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.800
while the U.C. Davis Olive Center and the
International Olive Council have also provided

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.300
standards and support for certification processes.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.730
Beyond looking for these certifications, it’s
also important to avoid olive oils that lack

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.770
a harvest date on the label, as extra virgin
olive oil’s shelf life (if stored properly)

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.319
is generally only in the range of 18-24 months
and a lack of such data could possibly indicate

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.250
older oil being sold.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.079
Even with no such nefarious intent by the
manufacturer, picking oils that include their

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.289
harvest date on the label allows you to get
fresher oil from the selection you have available.

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:25.150
Once you get it home, it’s best to store
olive oil away from light and heat, as well

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.850
as to limit exposure to air- all factors that
will rapidly degrade the quality of the oil.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.490
Light’s ability to degrade the oil is also
why it’s common for extra virgin olive oil

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.970
to be bottled in dark or opaque bottles to
help preserve the quality from initial bottling

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:53.120
to your pantry.
