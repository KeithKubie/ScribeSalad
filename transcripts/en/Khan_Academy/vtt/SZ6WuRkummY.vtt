00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:03.230
- [Voiceover] A system of
equations and their graphs

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.493
in the xy-plane are shown above.

00:00:05.493 --> 00:00:07.725
How many solutions does the system have?

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.289
And I put the picture here on the side.

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.844
So we have, we have

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:15.339
three equations here that are presenting

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.382
relations between x and y.

00:00:17.382 --> 00:00:21.283
And so we have y-squared
is equal to x plus three

00:00:21.283 --> 00:00:22.421
so that's...

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.777
So we could even show
which ones are which.

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:27.235
This one is this one right over here.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:31.666
That's this sideways
parabola that we're seeing

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.484
right over, actually I'm
having trouble tracing it.

00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:38.051
So we have this one right over there.

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:44.068
We have y plus x is equal to negative one,

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:46.470
that's just going to be
this line right over here.

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:50.608
That is a linear equation,
so that's just this line

00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:52.205
right over here.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.255
And the last one, the last one,

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:55.867
x-squared plus y-squared is equal to five,

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:57.444
that's equal to that circle.

00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.569
Now a solution for the system,

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.649
this system that has three equations,

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.390
two of which are nonlinear.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.359
In order to be a solution to this system,

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:08.405
it needs to be a point that is common

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:12.526
to all three curves, or all three graphs,

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:13.989
or a point that's common to all,

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:16.565
or a point that satisfies
all three of these.

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:18.035
So if we see...

00:01:18.424 --> 00:01:19.794
So you might be temped to say, okay,

00:01:19.794 --> 00:01:21.559
what about this point right over here?

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:24.008
But this point satisfies the circle

00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:26.190
and it satisfies the sideways parabola,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.435
but this point doesn't lie on the line.

00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:31.472
In order to satisfy them, you have to...

00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:33.573
And this one over here, likewise,

00:01:33.573 --> 00:01:35.977
it satisfies the sideways parabola

00:01:35.977 --> 00:01:38.962
and the circle, but it
does not satisfy the line.

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:41.119
In order to be a solution for the system,

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.727
it has to be an x, y
coordinate that satisfies

00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:45.272
all of these three.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.446
And the ones that satisfy all three,

00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:49.141
how about this point right over here?

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.544
All three lines intersect
at exactly that point

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.309
or at least it looks like they do.

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:56.269
And all three points intersect
at exactly that point

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:57.407
right over here.

00:01:57.407 --> 00:01:59.903
So this solution has two,

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:03.662
or this system has two solutions.

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:06.206
The four is tricky, because
right when your eyes see this

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:09.039
you see four points of
intersection very naturally.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.361
But it's very important to realize

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.925
that this point is only, has
two of the curves intersecting,

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:16.504
not, and this one as well,

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.164
only two of the curves intersecting,

00:02:18.164 --> 00:02:19.772
not all three.
