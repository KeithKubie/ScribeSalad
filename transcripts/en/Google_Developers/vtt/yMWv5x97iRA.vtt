CHRIS YERGA: Thank
you so much, Bill.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:08.290
And thank you all for coming
here to Playtime in Shanghai.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.510
For those of you who have
some difficulty understanding

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.470
my funny accent,
this is probably

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.710
a good time to put your
translation earphones in.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.010
My name is Chris Yerga.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.020
I'm the Vice President
of Engineering at Google,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.010
responsible for
Google Play in Asia.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.670
I've been working in
the software industry

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.225
for about 25 years now.

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:36.210
But I can't imagine
any time that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.840
was more exciting than
the one right now.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.530
And the fact that we come
out here and see so many

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.650
of you, with all of your energy,
and passion, and enthusiasm

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.010
for apps and games, I
think that shows why.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.590
So we've got a lot of great
content for you today.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.230
I'm going to kick things off,
catching you up a little bit

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.110
on the latest
developments in Android.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.250
And then we'll talk a
little bit about how

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.840
you can build a global
business on Google Play.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.790
So Android, as you know, is
Google's open source operating

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.010
system.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.430
It was released
several years ago

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.090
and has had incredible success.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.150
This chart here shows the growth
in active Android devices.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.530
And we're just so pleased
that we've gotten to a point

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.180
where we have far more than a
billion active Android devices.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.720
But the other staggering
thing that sometimes I

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.970
have difficulty understanding
is that 1.5 million new devices

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.590
are running Android
and are being activated

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.470
each and every day.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.690
So 1.5 million is a lot.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.210
It's hard to get
your head around.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.980
And so we did a thought
experiment, where we said,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.000
what if we stacked all of those
1.5 million devices on top

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.470
of each other?

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.600
Would it go to the
roof of this building?

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.270
Would it go beyond the
roof of the building?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.500
It turns out that when
you stack 1.5 million

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.690
of these Android devices
on top of each other,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.640
it extends beyond the
peak of Mount Everest,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.740
indeed even above the
cruising altitude of a jet

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.470
that many of us
took to come here.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.030
So that's an Everest
worth of new devices

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.120
being activated every day.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.850
And all of those devices
represent an opportunity

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.570
for all of you, as a
way to get your apps

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.420
and games into the hands
of many, many customers.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.970
Now, success like that doesn't
happen just because of the work

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.600
that we at Google are doing.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.930
Android is the result of
a global ecosystem that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.860
includes 60 OEMs
building Android devices,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.450
329 mobile carriers that
are selling these devices

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.600
and service in
over 190 countries.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.370
And of course, the other
really important part

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.120
of that ecosystem
are the people that

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.870
are building great
apps and games

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.980
for Google Play and Android,
which is all of you.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.050
The results of that
are impressive as well.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.210
So globally, 78% of
the world's smartphones

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.970
run Android today and 62%
of the world's tablets.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.760
So that's an incredible number.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.660
And all of these people are
potential customers for you.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.630
So that's why,
today, you're going

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.570
to hear us talk about
going global quite a bit.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.350
That's because these
numbers represent

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.270
the global opportunity for
Android and Google Play.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.150
86% of those devices run
Android 4.0 and above,

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.780
giving you the chance to use
the newest APIs to really

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.060
wow people with your content.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.914
But as big as those
numbers are, there

00:04:16.914 --> 00:04:20.890
are still 5 billion
people on this planet who

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.790
don't have a smartphone yet.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.150
And so we're focused
on getting Android

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.640
into the hands of as many
of those people as possible.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.780
And so we recently
announced Android One,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.660
which is our
initiative to deliver

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.240
a powerful and beautiful Android
experience at a very low price

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.840
point that's appropriate
for many of the emerging

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.530
markets in Asia and
around the world.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.370
We're also focused on not
just getting smartphones

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.070
into everybody's
hands, but also having

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.310
Android run on as many different
device types as is possible.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.940
We recently this year announced
our Android TV initiative,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.820
which is about running
Android on what is normally

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.140
the biggest and best display
screen in your house, which

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.400
is your TV.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.900
And particularly
for those of you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.200
who are building
Android games, the TV

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.350
represents a really great
opportunity for users

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.220
to enjoy those games, not
just when they're on the go

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.340
but when they're in their
living rooms as well.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.590
And because it runs
Android, it means

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.960
that you can adapt your game
to run on the TV with very

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.130
minimal effort and investment.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.790
And then from things very big to
things very small-- of course,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.670
Android Wear is another
recently announced initiative

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.700
to get Android running on
wearable devices and devices

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.850
like wrist watches
that can not only

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.800
augment the experience
on a smartphone

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.850
with real-time notifications
and interaction,

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.870
but also integrate a variety
of health-related sensors,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.350
pedometer, all
that sort of stuff.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.990
And then finally, there's the
Android Automotive product,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.480
which is about getting Android
directly into the entertainment

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.330
system of automobiles.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.000
So across all of these
different types of devices,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.810
we're really focused
on bringing Android

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.350
to people, wherever they are,
and whatever they're doing.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.370
Now, when you talk about having
Android running on everything

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.590
from a television, to a tablet,
to a smartphone, to a wearable,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.400
it's really important also
to have a user interface

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.580
that scales between
those screens

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.355
efficiently and gives some
consistency of experience.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.980
This effort started
5,000 years ago,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.500
with the invention of paper.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.490
That actually happened
here in China.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.340
And material design
is our contribution

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.820
to thinking about
what smart paper might

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.550
look like, here in the
present, in the 21st century.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.450
We'll have some more details
about material design coming up

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.690
in the next talk.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:32.050
Obviously, on top of all
that rides Google Play.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.190
Google Play is installed on this
Everest worth of devices that

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.660
are being activated every day.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.000
And the result of that
is we have Google Play.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.790
That is your one-stop shop
for not only apps and games,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.900
but also movies, books,
whatever entertainment content

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.670
our customers want.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.350
And the results of that
have been just as impressive

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.740
as Android's own
success, with 50 billion

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.970
plus applications downloaded
in total from the Google Play

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.530
Store and an
additional 2 billion

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.710
of those being downloaded
each and every month.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.950
So now I just want to
talk a little bit about--

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.040
of those 50 billion
applications,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.890
games is an important category.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.130
Games are very popular
with our users.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.340
And one interesting
thing to think about here

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:36.440
is that games are the sort
of things that everybody

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.710
can appreciate and enjoy.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.730
And in fact, our
metrics show that three

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.940
out of every four Android users
plays games on their device.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.840
Now, that means that
games are reaching

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.520
people who probably
never really thought

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.130
of themselves as a gamer.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.640
It's very broad.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.650
And so with so many different
people playing games

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:02.420
on Android, that represents
a huge opportunity

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.700
for all of you.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.200
And we're assisting
in this with something

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.700
we call Google Play
Game Services, which

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:16.110
enables features like
achievements, high score

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.150
lists, multiplayer matchmaking,
quests, leaderboards, and more.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.450
And this is our opportunity to
provide some common services

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.690
so that you don't need to
make that investment yourself.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:35.230
And the benefits are such that
100 million new users have

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.170
adopted Google Play Game
Services in just six months,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.420
making it the fastest
growing mobile game

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.250
service of all time.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.790
And for you, the
developer, what that means

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:53.930
is when people are using Google
Play Games enabled games,

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.850
they're more engaged.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.670
So we did a case study
with one of our partners.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.620
And their own
internal data showed

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.300
that users who use
Google Play Game

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.690
Services to see what
their friends were doing

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.860
and compete on high
scores, et cetera,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:14.450
were 300% more likely to
come back after three days

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.790
and 400% more likely to
come back after seven days.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.040
So it's a way not just to
help get your app discovered

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.260
through the social connections
people have with their friends,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.306
but also to deepen retention.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.850
So we talked a lot about
the numbers and the fact

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.780
that there's a
global opportunity.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.500
So one of the main reasons we're
here today is to talk to you

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.450
and find out what we could
do for you to help you take

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.180
advantage of this opportunity.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.190
As we mentioned, you'll hear
us use the word "go global"

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.260
quite a bit today.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.390
There's a global
opportunity here,

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.000
with the 2 billion apps that
are being downloaded every month

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.770
across 190 countries.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.730
And that opportunity
has been utilized

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.730
by triple the number
of developers who've

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.150
registered with Google
Play, from the Asia Pacific

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.870
region in particular.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:21.120
So it's not just about
distributing your app globally.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.430
We at Google take
a holistic approach

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.490
through the entire life cycle.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.540
So it starts with developing
your application, as well

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.360
as distribution, and
then monetization,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.780
and closing the loop with
metrics, and analytics,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.240
and statistics, so
that you can optimize

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.560
the performance of your
app and the performance

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.780
of your business.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.610
So today, I'm just going
to spend some time talking

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.380
about three of these areas--
in particular, development,

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:55.640
international distribution,
and monetization.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.480
So as we mentioned before, in
the development of your app

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.670
and game, we highly
encourage you

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.925
to integrate Google Play
Game Services to get

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:09.530
the benefits of
discoverability and engagement

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.500
that we talked about.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.700
And there's also
additional Google services

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.620
that we encourage
you to look at.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:23.550
So AdMob has an SDK to help
monetize your app or game

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.180
through in-app advertising.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.620
And then, also,
Google's cloud platform

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.720
is an important
offering as well.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.993
Google's cloud platform allows
you to build your game or app

00:12:36.993 --> 00:12:41.690
backend, using the same cloud
infrastructure that Google uses

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.100
for our own services,
so that if you have

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.990
a very fast, successful app, and
your users grow and skyrocket,

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:55.040
that you can scale with
it by letting Google

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.040
use its expertise
to help you scale,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.880
rather than having to
do all that on your own.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.920
And another important thing
is to focus on app quality

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.220
so that you're giving your users
the best possible experience,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.885
which will then increase
your app and game

00:13:13.885 --> 00:13:17.850
rankings in the store, which
then helps you in terms

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:22.150
of getting future installs.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.110
We have a lot of services to
help you get good feedback

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.490
from your customers.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.340
We also offer alpha
and beta testing,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.100
so that you can test new
changes or new versions

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.550
of your app with a select,
small group of people first,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.820
so that you can be
sure that you've

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.180
addressed all the quality
issues before you release it

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.810
to the world.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.360
Getting ready for global
reach-- obviously,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.230
with 190 countries globally
served by Google Play,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.880
there's a lot of
different users out there.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.090
And many of them
are coming online

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.650
from emerging markets,
where Android One, we hope,

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.150
was going to assist.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.130
But the other thing is that
when you're localizing your app,

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.670
Google Play also offers,
in our developer console,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.830
the ability for you to
upload your application

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.700
and then work directly
with translation services

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.000
to get your strings
and application

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.910
localized for a variety
of different customers.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.550
Now obviously, monetization
is a topic that's

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.620
top-of-mind for many of us.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:43.200
And we've worked
tirelessly at Google Play

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.530
to increase the
amount of ways that we

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.980
offer for your customers to
pay for your apps and games.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.240
We've launched Google Play gift
cards in a number of markets.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.150
And that has been very
popular with customers.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.920
In addition, we've been adding
new forms of payment, Paypal

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.750
being the most recent example.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.490
But I think the area where
we've had some of the most

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.090
success with our customers is
through direct carrier billing,

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.990
where we work with
mobile phone carriers

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.080
to enable their customers
to charge their app and game

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.020
purchases directly
to their phone bill.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.730
And we've been working
with literally dozens

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.130
of different mobile carriers
globally to enable this.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.820
We also have-- you can
monetize, obviously,

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.370
through a paid app download,
in-app purchasing, which

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.240
is very popular.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.660
Many of our top grossing apps
utilize in-app purchasing

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.050
as their monetization strategy.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.600
We've also added the ability
for subscription billing,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.890
so that you can get a
recurring source of revenue

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:56.090
from your customers.

00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.140
The results of that
have been quite large.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.850
We announced that in the
period from June 2013 to June

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.566
of this year, we
paid out $5 billion,

00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:13.000
in US dollars equivalent,
to our developer partners.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.840
And that's a large
amount of money.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.990
But it's not just
the amount of money.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:22.290
But the other impressive thing
about that is that the growth

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:27.160
rate represents 2.5x
year-over-year growth.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.500
So it's a huge market.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.810
But it's also rapidly expanding.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.160
And we welcome
all of you to help

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.180
build apps and games to partake
in the success yourself.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.230
The way we think
about this is you're

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.660
not just building an app,
you're building a business.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.560
And Google Play is there
to partner with you

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.200
in all the ways that
we'll be talking

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.260
about today, to help you
take your app to a business.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.450
As I mentioned,
in conclusion, we

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.390
help you throughout
the entire lifecycle,

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.270
from designing, developing,
and distribution.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.819
We give you analytics
insights to help

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.069
you optimize your
app and your business

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:13.690
and expand into new markets with
Google's technology assistance.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.190
And without further
ado, we're going

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.660
to hear the first of our
deep dives in this area.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.140
I'd like to welcome Ellie
Powers to the stage,

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.669
to talk about building your
app for success on Google Play.
