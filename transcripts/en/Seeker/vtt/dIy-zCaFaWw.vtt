00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.799
Studies on human embryonic stem cells are
highly controversial, and the current law

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.940
says that embryos must be destroyed after
14-days.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.940
But why 14-days?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.040
What’s so significant about the two week
limit, and should we even keep using it?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.480
Hi there my science buddies.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.610
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.550
Human embryonic stem cells are one of the
most legally and morally contentious areas

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.550
of study.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.140
On the one hand, stem cells, both adult and
embryonic, are valuable for researching a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.960
huge range of illnesses and diseases, from
cancer to diabetes to Alzheimer’s.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.899
On the other hand, many people believe that
this benefit to medicine comes at the cost

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.649
of potential human lives.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.300
If you want a bit of background on the moral
and medical controversy surrounding stem cells,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.239
you can check out either of these videos on
screen.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.659
Originally, the 14-day limit comes from a
1979 United States Department of Health, Education,

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:50.659
and Welfare report.

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.340
A committee of theologians, psychologists,
and doctors came to a compromise: human embryonic

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.389
stem cells could be studied for two weeks
after fertilization, beyond which time the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.059
cells would have to be destroyed.

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.119
But this limit was fairly arbitrary, as at
the time, scientists could not keep embryos

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.460
alive in vitro for more than a few days.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.409
A later report, organized in 1984 by British
existential philosopher Mary Warnock, justified

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.710
the two week limit.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.840
The report states that on the 14th or 15th
day, a faint line of cells appears on the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.890
embryo, called the “primitive streak”.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.439
This, it was argued, is a moment that signifies
that the embryo has become an individual being,

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.140
as before this time the embryo could potentially
split into twin organisms.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.159
One of the reasons this stage appealed to
those who objected on moral grounds, was that

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.829
if an embryo could split into two people,
then it could not yet be an individual person.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.399
The rule codified an easy to measure mark,
coupled with an unambiguous time frame; making

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.070
the question less about conception or “a
soul”, while still allowing for a religious

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.270
and moral compromise.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.149
Additionally, a 2002 report from California
stated that less than half of all fertilized

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.719
embryos, both in vitro and in vivo, ever reach
the primitive streak, meaning that most of

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.359
embryos used for research would have been
unlikely to make it to term anyway..

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.460
But recent advances have made it possible
for scientists to keep embryos alive for longer

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.390
than two weeks, by simulating womb-like conditions.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.950
With the potential for further research using
stem cells, the question has been forced again:

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.120
is the 14-day limit still valid?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580
Some scientists say no.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.130
Arguing that they could use the research in
preventing miscarriages, infertility, and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.500
birth defects which they believe to be more
important than a more or less arbitrary time

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500
limit.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.400
For example, in 2014, researchers were able
to cure “induced Parkinson's disease”

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.760
in rats Neuroscientists used human embryonic
stem cells to create neurons that produce

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170
dopamine, which is missing in those who suffer
from the disease.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.671
Although no human clinical trials have been
done, these early results with animals have

00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:44.070
been very promising.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.130
That said, other researchers in bioethics
have pointed out that even an arbitrary limit

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.920
is better than no limit at all.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.310
As more restrictions are lifted, the very
real question becomes “where is the limit

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:30.400
on human experimentation 
in the pursuit of knowledge?”
