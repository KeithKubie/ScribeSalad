00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:01.530
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do with this video

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.254
is talk about fertilization
and development in human beings

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:07.256
or at least early
development in human beings.

00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:09.254
And this right over
here is an actual image

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:12.374
of fertilization about
to happen or happening.

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:15.218
So this right over here is a sperm cell.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.094
One of the many sperm
cells that will come from

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:20.776
a male human being, and
this right over here

00:00:20.776 --> 00:00:25.246
is the egg cell that is
inside the female human being

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:27.774
that it is actually fertilizing.

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.024
Fertilization is the
sperm cell coming together

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.889
with this egg cell and this act,

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:37.354
this is the conception
of what has the potential

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:41.384
to turn into a real organism,
in this case, a human being.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:43.898
So let's just first
appreciate the scale here.

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:46.011
Just appreciate how
small these things are.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:49.260
A distance of about that
would be approximately

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.207
one-fiftieth of a millimeter.

00:00:52.207 --> 00:00:55.365
So this is happening on a
very, very, very small scale.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:57.192
Now another thing that
you should be appreciate

00:00:57.192 --> 00:00:58.709
and something like this occurred

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:01.196
at the beginning of every one us,

00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:03.341
is that this is one of maybe

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:07.017
several hundred million sperm
cells are in competition

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:10.613
to be the one that gets to that egg cell

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:12.369
and so you should feel proud of yourself

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.887
or at least half of yourself.

00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:16.040
You won a pretty big race, think about it,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.971
there's 300 million people
in the United States

00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.312
that half of you that was from your father

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:23.854
that won a race with the
several hundred million

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:25.886
of the other sperm cells from you father

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:28.475
to get to be that DNA, that combination

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:30.884
of DNA from your father
that will then fuse

00:01:30.884 --> 00:01:32.306
with the combination of DNA

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:34.854
that's from your mother in this egg cell.

00:01:34.854 --> 00:01:37.142
And so how is that DNA packaged?

00:01:37.142 --> 00:01:39.141
Well it's packaged in chromosomes.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.311
Chromosomes are just strips of DNA

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.338
and a full set of human
DNA in most of the cells

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:47.878
in your body, you have 46 chromosomes

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.174
and it's really 23 pairs of two.

00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:52.693
In each pair, you have one from your mom

00:01:52.693 --> 00:01:54.136
and one from your dad.

00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:56.899
But it turns out that in these sex cells,

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.479
and we call these gametes right over here,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.929
let me write this down, these are gametes.

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.789
So a sperm cell is the gamete
that comes from your father

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.568
and an egg cell, or an ovum, is the gamete

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:10.715
that comes from your mother.

00:02:10.715 --> 00:02:13.254
Gametes have half the
number of chromosomes.

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:16.150
Each of these have 23, not 23 pair,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.325
they have 23 chromosomes.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.499
And so when the sperm
and the egg come together

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.038
when the egg is fertilized,
then all of a sudden,

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:26.871
you once again have 46
chromosomes or 23 pair.

00:02:27.842 --> 00:02:28.736
But what does it look like

00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:31.906
as soon as fertilization has occurred?

00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:35.168
Well, this right over here
is a picture of a zygote

00:02:35.168 --> 00:02:38.265
which is this fertilized,
you could view it

00:02:38.265 --> 00:02:40.837
as a fertilized egg,
it's now starting to have

00:02:40.837 --> 00:02:43.996
all 46 chromosomes, and
what's interesting here is

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:47.846
you can see the nuclei from the two cells,

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:49.766
they haven't completely fused yet.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:52.216
These right here, these
are called pronuclei

00:02:52.216 --> 00:02:54.927
but they will eventually fuse and that,

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:56.910
when you think about your first day

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.327
as a cell, that's when the genetic makeup

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.845
that you got form your father
and your mother came together

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:06.197
to be the genetic makeup
that would eventually

00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:08.481
give all the information
or most of the information

00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:10.731
necessary to construct you.

00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:15.340
Now as soon as this happens,
you start having cell division

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.279
so the zygote, this zygote right over here

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:18.823
through the process of mitosis,

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.525
it will then split into two,
and then split into four,

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:24.797
and you have about a cell
division or two everyday or so.

00:03:24.797 --> 00:03:28.027
And so after about two, three days,

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:30.506
you have about eight, then 16 cells,

00:03:30.506 --> 00:03:32.488
those 16 cells are called morula,

00:03:32.488 --> 00:03:34.304
and then eventually, that keeps splitting

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:36.308
and after about five to nine days,

00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:37.861
you have something that looks like this

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.089
and you can't really appreciate it

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.428
but there's two to three
hundred cells here.

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:43.155
There's two to three hundred set cells

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:45.581
in this sphere and it's
actually hollowed out

00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.873
on the inside, you can't
fully see it right over here,

00:03:48.873 --> 00:03:52.040
but this thing is called a blastocyst.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.140
And then, and notice it's still
roughly on the same scale,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.898
it's a little bit bigger
than that original egg cell

00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:06.947
that was fertilized, but
then this will continue

00:04:06.947 --> 00:04:09.739
to split and split and split.

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.737
And just to appreciate the entire stages

00:04:12.737 --> 00:04:14.574
that we're talking about, so when we talk

00:04:14.574 --> 00:04:17.053
about fertilization, we're
talking about right over here.

00:04:17.053 --> 00:04:19.117
So all these pictures that I'm showing you

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:21.360
are right in this phase,
and then if you go

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.679
maybe three, four, five, six, seven days

00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:27.601
maybe in that first week, you
get to this blastocyst stage

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.892
and so we are right over
here on our timeline.

00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:32.436
Now one thing that you
might be intrigued by

00:04:32.436 --> 00:04:35.319
is why am I starting this at week two.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.439
Well it turns out that there
is also a gestational age

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.887
and gestational age is
something that doctors

00:04:40.887 --> 00:04:44.033
and scientists will use as a measure

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:46.917
of how far long this embryo is

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.359
and eventually the embryo or the fetus is

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:50.884
and gestational age in particular

00:04:50.884 --> 00:04:52.652
is measured from the first day

00:04:52.652 --> 00:04:55.525
of the mother's last menstrual cycle

00:04:55.525 --> 00:04:57.689
which can be two weeks before

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:00.056
the actual moment of conception

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:02.433
which I am showing right over here.

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:03.629
So that's just a little technical thing

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.357
that is interesting and why you see

00:05:05.357 --> 00:05:07.655
this roughly two week shift.

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:08.824
But then we get into this phase

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:11.515
where people would
consider it to be an embryo

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:13.710
and near the end of the embryo stage,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.043
you might have the potential human being

00:05:18.118 --> 00:05:19.856
to look something like this.

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:23.401
This would be about seven
weeks after conception

00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:26.135
and you could see even
here, it is quite small.

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:28.785
This is about one centimeter in length

00:05:28.785 --> 00:05:30.807
so about the size of a blueberry.

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:32.820
But you hardly see something
that's starting to look

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.933
like a human being or at least a mammal

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.422
and one of the fascinating things

00:05:36.422 --> 00:05:38.050
about developmental biology

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.317
is that if you look at the animal kingdom

00:05:40.317 --> 00:05:41.759
especially things that are closely related

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.945
to human beings, you will
see even at this stage

00:05:43.945 --> 00:05:45.875
things look quite similar

00:05:45.875 --> 00:05:47.114
but you already start to see things

00:05:47.114 --> 00:05:49.349
that you'd recognize, you
can see arms right over here,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.410
you can see kind of an early ear,

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.644
you can see an early eye, nose,

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:57.037
even ribs it looks like, and
so this is already beginning

00:05:57.037 --> 00:06:00.198
to resemble a human being
but it is quite small

00:06:00.198 --> 00:06:02.251
and if you look at the
development of other mammals

00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:03.365
or even things that aren't mammals,

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:04.982
even things like fish, you see things

00:06:04.982 --> 00:06:08.636
that look not too different
from this at this stage.

00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:10.590
But then once you get into,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.967
you're going into the
10th, 11th, 12th weeks,

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:15.333
then people will call this a fetus.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.956
So right now, this is an
embryo, so this was an egg

00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:20.984
being fertilized, zygote,
zygote goes to morula,

00:06:20.984 --> 00:06:23.869
goes to blastocyst, you're an embryo,

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:27.786
then from an embryo, you
go into being a fetus.

00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:30.663
And so this is an image of a fetus

00:06:30.663 --> 00:06:32.106
being connected to the placenta

00:06:32.106 --> 00:06:33.662
and the placenta is really the interface

00:06:33.662 --> 00:06:35.409
with the mother's body.

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.070
And you can see even
here, it is quite small

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.573
depending on your screen size,

00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:42.439
this might be about the same
scale on my screen right now

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:44.479
this is about five
centimeters in actuality,

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.385
so this is about the size of this fetus.

00:06:47.385 --> 00:06:49.436
And the boundary between embryo and fetus

00:06:49.436 --> 00:06:52.151
isn't super well-defined
that's why you see this

00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:55.348
kind of transition point, but
most people would consider it

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:57.878
to be once you get into
about the 12th week,

00:06:57.878 --> 00:07:00.022
you're definitely a fetus.

00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:01.639
Now some interesting
things right over here

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.892
as you see the entire cycle all the way

00:07:03.892 --> 00:07:07.183
until you get to the 36th
through the 42nd week

00:07:07.183 --> 00:07:10.068
which is when most,
when what is considered

00:07:10.068 --> 00:07:14.448
kind of full term when a
baby is ready to come out

00:07:14.448 --> 00:07:17.130
but you start to see over
here, this notion of viability

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.442
which is roughly a time
where there's a decent chance

00:07:20.442 --> 00:07:22.320
that if the baby were
to come out of the womb,

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.722
they would survive on their own

00:07:23.722 --> 00:07:25.448
and this is just an interesting stat

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:27.643
that there's roughly a 50% survival rate

00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:29.245
at around the sixth month.

00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.178
But the general big idea's here

00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:32.580
and it really is mind boggling,

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.095
all of us start in this
almost grand race of sperm

00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:38.054
between hundreds of
millions of sperm cells

00:07:38.054 --> 00:07:40.739
to be the one to fertilize
your mother's egg

00:07:40.739 --> 00:07:43.360
and then that one cell, that zygote

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.593
that has the genetic information
from both your mother

00:07:45.593 --> 00:07:47.850
and father, now that that
egg has been fertilized,

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.950
it then keeps replicating until it turns

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.138
into a fairly complex
organism that is capable

00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:58.305
of making videos and reflecting
about how it developed.
