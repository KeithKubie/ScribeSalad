1
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:08.893
Uh,

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.590
like to refresh your memory by going back to talk briefly about,

3
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.230
uh,

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.230
the two classes last week on fog node and we looked at thoughtless remark,

5
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.360
um,

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.360
add the Gona seminar in Japan when he claim that the sound,

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.750
the theory is the same story told four times.

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.150
So in light of that claim,

9
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.540
we looked at the relation between Benji and Quentin as a relation of kinship and

10
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.030
variation.
The two of them are obviously brothers,

11
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.480
but they can also be seen as brothers in more than just a biological sense.

12
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.450
So this thing about,
um,

13
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
kinship and variation as the most fundamental structure of the sound,

14
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.210
the theory,
um,

15
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.270
and so far what we can see is that this structure of kin ship and variation is

16
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:16.680
pivoted on some kind of battle with time.

17
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.980
As we know Benji,

18
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.400
once caddie never to grow up,

19
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.090
he wants her always to be an innocent young girl,

20
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.610
never to become a woman.

21
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.190
He wants her always to smell like trees.
There's the signature line from Benji.

22
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.650
Um,
in many ways it is a battle for an impossible,

23
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.370
unchanging in lessons.
Um,

24
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.460
and we know that the nature of the battle is such that Benji is destined to be a

25
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.180
loser.
There's no way he can win that battle.

26
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.010
But we also know that the very fact that this is an impossible battle,

27
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.170
that Benji is destined to be a loser also means that it's going to be a

28
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.970
narrative challenge for father.
He has to do something for the loser.

29
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.540
If you are good on there,
you want to do something for the loser.

30
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.950
And so one of the challenges for Faulkner in the sound of the fury is to do

31
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.030
something for Benji.

32
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.430
If we turn to Quentin with the pretty much the same pattern,

33
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.460
repeated the same battle we're time Quentin is exactly like Benji and that he

34
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:34.710
also wants,
but Kelly and there was a grow up.

35
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.700
He wants to always to be innocent young girl and was to become a grown woman

36
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.990
with her own sexuality.
Um,
and so in that way,

37
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.760
so almost completed with play of that impossible demand from Benji.

38
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.480
But Quentin has an additional battle with time of more abstract battle.

39
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.500
And we see that in the opening of the Quentin section,

40
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.730
he takes out his watch,
he's smashes the crystal,

41
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.010
um,
and then he takes out,

42
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.580
he twists off the hands of the watch.

43
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.140
But we also know any injures his hand in the process.
Um,

44
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.010
so right to them we know that,
you know,
is a losing battle for him to,
uh,

45
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.060
but he twist off the hands of the watch and the watch takes on,

46
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.610
um,

47
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.610
that's a little logo allegory for the entire cause of Quentin section.

48
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.950
So at the end of Clinton section,

49
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.280
we know that the most offending would and that he caused the status would or is

50
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.630
the word temporary.
Um,
and by temporary,

51
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:47.290
here's one particular context in my,
uh,

52
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.280
his strategy as we are seeing as basically a secondhand tragedy is gone.

53
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.390
His own tragedy,

54
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.310
it is the second hand tragedy of Patty losing her virginity,

55
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.530
but Quentin is embracing it as his own pageant,
um,

56
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.370
and is basically finishing,

57
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.930
uh,
wrapping up his life as response to that tragedy.

58
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.490
But the fear is that that tragedy is going to pass.

59
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.440
That's not going to be a permanent tragedy for him.
Everything is temporary,

60
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.530
even the sense of devastation will go away.

61
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.170
So because temporary is the center's words or the only way,

62
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.603
uh,

63
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.850
Quentin can get around that word is to have a preemptive strike against that

64
00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:41.171
would his suicide is a preemptive strike against the word

65
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.790
temporary so that it will have an artificial permanence in his own life because

66
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.600
his life has ended at that moment and there's no possibility for it to fade
away,

67
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:56.890
to become less devastating.
Um,
so,
um,

68
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.410
in those ways,

69
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:04.411
Benji and Quentin and very much brothers in the spiritual sense,

70
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.360
um,
uh,
kind of metaphoric battle with time today,

71
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:13.790
we'll move on to Jason.
Um,
and it's a bigger challenge,
you know,

72
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.810
to think of Jason as the brother to Quentin and [inaudible].

73
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.600
Jason seems very,
very different on the face of it,
but I like to,
uh,

74
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.620
suggest that in at least one way,

75
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.670
Jason can be seen as a brother to Benji and Quentin.

76
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.880
Um,

77
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.710
in that he also has his own battle with time and is,

78
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.930
it is a battle with a larger,

79
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.140
a constellation of forces.

80
00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:48.910
So we're saying scale and lodgement,
um,
in a very significant way.

81
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.690
In the Jason Section,
uh,

82
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.720
we're seeing a much bigger picture of the United States and best scale

83
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:59.270
enlargement,
um,

84
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.300
has to do with a tug of war between the yesterday of the United States and to

85
00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.480
morrow of the United States.

86
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.650
And Jason wanting very much to cling to the yesterday.

87
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.040
It is more congenial to him in every way,

88
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.790
but at the same time he know that the tomorrow is already here.

89
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.570
In fact that tomorrow is encroaching on the present.

90
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.490
There's nothing he can do about it.

91
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:29.720
He just has to learn to cope with that tomorrow.
Very uncongenial,

92
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:34.160
very threatening tomorrow.
He has to learn to come to terms with that.

93
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.430
So the basic dynamic of Jason Section is the battle between yesterday and

94
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.990
tomorrow.

95
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
And I think that we know that it pretty much is a losing battle for Jason as

96
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:51.620
well.
Um,
because we're talking so much about yesterday and tomorrow,

97
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.680
I wanted to bring back that very important passage from Macbeth at five scene

98
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.500
five that thought in the,
took the phrase,

99
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:05.501
the sound of the fury from tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this

100
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:11.081
petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time.

101
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.720
And a lot of yesterdays have lighters.

102
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:20.530
The way to does take that it is a tale told by an idiot fury signifying nothing.

103
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.980
So father is really getting the maximum mileage from that passage is really

104
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:32.891
taking off the entire scaffolding of his novel from the Shakespeare passage.

105
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.910
Um,

106
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.800
and I like to give you a brief overview of the basic structure of today's

107
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:41.720
lecture.
Um,
the,

108
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.020
the various terms that come into play in this tug of war between yesterday and

109
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.910
tomorrow.
We know that the Horse,
um,
is,
uh,
is actually still a present,
um,

110
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.670
in the sound of the fury.
Queenie,
uh,
the hose,

111
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.480
we'll have a starring row at the very end of the novel.

112
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.850
We don't see her quite in the full yet,

113
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.670
but I promise you should have a starring role.
Um,

114
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.450
we know that all the Movio is very much here.
Um,

115
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.490
and I like to think of those,
the horse and the automobile,
um,

116
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.220
as a two directional arrows.

117
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.280
So that course is a vector is a direction directional arrow pointing back to the

118
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.880
19th century.
The very agent,

119
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.090
he'll well where to own a horse,
uh,

120
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:34.130
mixed you pilot the gen trade as well.
Civility,
uh,
of um,

121
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.970
social distinctions.
Uh,

122
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.130
the automobile is we already have seen in a gas bay,
um,

123
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
is a vehicle that to some extent bricks down or complicated social distinctions.

124
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.130
Uh,
it also brings in strangers.
So,
um,

125
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.890
the phrase that I would like to use to think about that kind of transition,
uh,

126
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.010
from the past to the,
um,

127
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.930
is the concept that I'm taking from the literary and cultural critic,

128
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.040
Raymond willingness to notion of the knowable community.
Um,

129
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.350
and how that's receding into the past.

130
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:12.000
That's breaking down to be replaced by an unknowable world of strangers.

131
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.980
And on that basis I'll talk,
uh,
talk about,
uh,

132
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.010
the basic structure really and Jason Section is to patterns of grievances to

133
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.580
patterns of injury.
As we know,
Jason is someone who feels aggrieved all the time.

134
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:31.120
He hit the,
that the whole world has done him and,
and pod in the boat wrong.
Um,

135
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.750
so he's complaining all the time.
That's his mode.
Uh,

136
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.770
but given that this is the baseline for Jason,

137
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.850
he has two different,
um,
Polly's,
um,

138
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.290
two different kinds of people,
uh,
that he's complaining about.
Uh,

139
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:50.130
one is the gnome Polly's people in his immediate environment,

140
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.120
people he knows very well.
Um,

141
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.380
and then they are total strangers who also doing him around the,

142
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:59.470
he knows nothing about,
but he's convinced a out together.
Um,

143
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:04.520
so the notion that they are strangers somewhere to get you versus people right

144
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:10.260
here who do,
doing your in right on the spot.
Um,
and so,

145
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:14.920
um,
the people who are right there as family,
you've his servants,
his father,

146
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.890
his niece,
Quentin,
um,

147
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.390
and the unknown parties including the usual suspects,
New York Jew,

148
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.260
US government,
Western Union,
Telegraph,
and of course wall straight.
Um,

149
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.870
so very familiar,
getting very close to us actually.
Um,
but,
um,

150
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.050
this is the image,
um,
that I find,
uh,

151
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.150
in some sense are kind of a capsule summary of the dynamics.

152
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.010
In the Jason Section.

153
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:45.050
You see the horse and caught the 19th century relic.
Um,

154
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.420
and then the automobile,
uh,
right coming,
right.

155
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.660
I'm almost going to run it over.
We fear.
Um,

156
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.320
and that's the situation that we get in,
uh,

157
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:59.270
the sound beginning in the Jason Session.
Um,

158
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.830
we know that Jason,
um,

159
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.380
actually is part of the future is probably tomorrow,
um,

160
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.390
in the sense that he owns the car and he's very proud.

161
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:14.420
He's seen in his car a lot and he's very proud that his is a relatively

162
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:18.540
expensive cost,
not as,
and he makes a point that,
you know,

163
00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:20.540
the people who own for us,
but his car is for,

164
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:25.180
we don't know what kind of car he has,
but,
uh,
is a call he is proud of.
Uh,

165
00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.000
and he spends a little time in,

166
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.270
but there's a basic in compatibility between Jason,

167
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.320
um,
and his car.

168
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:38.060
And this comes back to the comps and Corrs,
uh,

169
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.100
it turns out that Jason's faculty or smell is as highly developed as his two

170
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:47.910
brothers.
In his case,
the smell,

171
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:52.210
the guests to him isn't this now trees,
the smell of honeysuckle,

172
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.470
but the smell of gasoline you can stand,
there's a smell of gasoline.

173
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.650
It gives them a tremendous headache.

174
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.390
The only time he only way he can drive is by putting a handkerchief.

175
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:08.830
So in cancer over his nose,
that's only what you can drive his own car.
So,

176
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:14.170
um,
this is,
um,
his,
um,
complain about this vehicle,

177
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:19.090
uh,
that belongs to him.
He wouldn't dream of getting rid of,

178
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:20.890
but it's a burden to him.

179
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:27.230
And now I reckon I'll get home just in time to take a nice long drive after a

180
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:33.411
basket of tomatoes or something and then have to go back to Tom smelling like a

181
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:34.980
cancer,
the factory.

182
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:40.300
So my head will explode right on my shoulders.
I said,

183
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:45.070
you don't know where the headache is.
I says,
you think a food at them,

184
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.640
Carla,
if it depended on me,
of course he's complaining.

185
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.720
That is not by choice that he's in this car.
But we also know that,

186
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.210
you know,
he's proud of his car.

187
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.630
So this is just to lay out basic difficulty in Jason situation is that there's

188
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.690
attention,

189
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.180
a conflict between his own physical wellbeing and the most basic ingredient of

190
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:12.790
an automobile.

191
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:18.190
Structural in compatibility between Jason is a biological human being and the

192
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.420
mechanical workings of the car.
Uh,

193
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:28.470
but beyond that there's also something else that makes the automobile a terrible

194
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.920
threat to Jason at,

195
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.910
which is the kinds of people who come with automobiles.

196
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.030
Um,
and uh,

197
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.070
is already we're beginning to see a wall of strangers opening up right there in

198
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:49.240
Jefferson,
Mississippi.
So here's Jason.

199
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.570
I had just turned onto the street when I saw a thought coming helling to what

200
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:58.900
made all of a sudden it stopped.

201
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.540
I could hear the wheel sliding and is fluid around and back and world.

202
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.560
And just as I was thinking what the hell they were up to,

203
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:12.430
I saw the red tie and I recognize her face.

204
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.260
Looking back through the window,

205
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:20.130
I saw a rat and I recognize that red tie after all I had told her,

206
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:22.000
I forgot about everything.

207
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.500
I never thought about my head even until I came to the first Fox and had to
stop.

208
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.740
Yet we spend money and spend money on rose and damn,

209
00:14:29.741 --> 00:14:34.360
if it isn't like trying to drive over a sheet of corrugated iron roofing,

210
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.500
I like to know how a man could be expected to keep up with even the wheelbarrow.

211
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.250
Um,
in the space of two paragraphs,

212
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.880
we see that Jason has shifted his attention from his knees,

213
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:53.480
Quentin,
um,
to the government who's not keeping up the rows.
Right?

214
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.830
So,
right.

215
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:59.270
The first thing that we can say about this passage is that the word timeframe

216
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.070
isn't just a curse for Quanton.

217
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.570
It is also because for Jason,

218
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:08.630
he has a very short attention span.

219
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:13.520
He can really keep his mind fixed on the thing that he's going to complain

220
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.720
against.
Um,
and that's just a little aside.
You know,

221
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:21.170
it's not something that Jason Himself,
um,
no,
this is,

222
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:25.970
but we can say that for him is that he really does one strike against them.

223
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:26.660
Um,

224
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.100
and his battle with time that he is such a short attention span that he can hold

225
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.960
onto what the little time that he has or he can make that time last long and can

226
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.090
make you squeeze Evans last longer.

227
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.160
So not being able to make something last longer is one of the problems with

228
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.380
Jason.
Um,
but the most in,
and that's a long term,
you know,

229
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.050
kind of generic constitutional problems for Jason.

230
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.480
But the most immediate problems for him is that his niece Quentin,

231
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.830
the daughter of Catty,
is running around with Togo strangers.
Um,

232
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:03.110
and we don't know who this man is.
Uh,

233
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.420
Jason is not telling us because he doesn't know.
Um,

234
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.510
all I can say is that this is a man with a red tie and that tells him that this

235
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:12.690
man is no good.
Um,

236
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:18.010
and that quintessentially hanging out with this man wearing a red tie and he

237
00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:21.620
comes with a car that's a relatively,

238
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.990
I don't myself consider for the cheap car,

239
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:26.560
but Jason considers that achieve current.

240
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.930
Therefore there's another strike against the stranger that he's no good.
Um,

241
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.280
in the next two,
this is on page two 38 two.
Next page.

242
00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.860
We know who this stranger is,

243
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.740
not really what kind of a person he is,

244
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.370
but what kind of occupation he has.

245
00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.940
I said as far as I'm concerned,

246
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.060
the other girl to hell as fast as she pleases.

247
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.900
And the sooner the better as,
as what else do you expect?

248
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:58.901
Except every damn tromping around and cheap show that comes to town because even

249
00:17:00.441 --> 00:17:04.160
those towns jellybeans give her the go by now.

250
00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:09.490
And that shows how far the comms and fortune has fallen from being the town.

251
00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.180
Gentry.
Um,

252
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.540
Quentin has fallen so low that even the town jelly beans touch her.

253
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.730
Um,

254
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:24.380
the only way she can have some company is to hang out with strangers coming to

255
00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:28.490
town for the first time.
Um,
cheap shows.

256
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.360
It's confusing to see the drummer in the context of the chief show.
You know,

257
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:39.050
we might think that the drummer is someone who plays the drums,
but actually,
no,

258
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.240
this is a specialized 19th century,
late 19th century turn of the century,

259
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.410
early 20th century,

260
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.390
a slang word for the traveling salesman.
Um,

261
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.050
so Jason is using that theory,
distinct period,

262
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:59.730
uh,
usage,
uh,
the drama.
This is a traveling salesman.

263
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.440
We know that he's going to be there,
you know,
punished with day,
uh,

264
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.760
to keep Quentin comedy and then he'll be gone.
Um,
so,
um,

265
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.560
Jason in that way is,
uh,

266
00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:14.700
an entry point for us,
uh,

267
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.730
to that 19th century world.
Uh,

268
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:22.080
the changing well of salesmanship of marketing.

269
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:27.081
That's very important that we have traveling salesman who drive around in cars.

270
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.320
Um,
fast living,
traveling salesman,

271
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.220
all those are so new developments.
Um,

272
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.510
and um,

273
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:41.370
the other thing we can say about this drummer,
um,

274
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.410
is that he's known to Jason to the extent that he is normally law.

275
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.220
Um,
primarily because of two attributes.

276
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.280
One is,

277
00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:57.281
is the most thing that stands out from him is the fact that he's wearing a red

278
00:18:57.541 --> 00:19:00.330
tie.
That's a giveaway for Jason.

279
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.750
And the other thing is that his occupation is written on his face.

280
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:11.610
The fact that he's a traveling salesman is um,

281
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.690
clear just from anyone can see that that's what he is.

282
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:21.380
So Jason's knowledge after drama doesn't extend food and that it is a very

283
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.870
superficial knowledge,
um,
of this man.

284
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.570
Not because Jason doesn't want to know him.
Well,
maybe just it doesn't,
uh,

285
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:33.503
in any case,

286
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:38.810
that knowledge will never extend further than the color of his tie and

287
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.670
occupational label that Jason can pin on him.
Um,

288
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:49.730
it is a world that is by definition made up of our superficial knowledge of

289
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:54.090
total strangers.
People we see once and never again.

290
00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.680
That is the world that is opening up in front of Jason.

291
00:19:59.130 --> 00:19:59.610
Um,

292
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:04.170
we can decide whether or not this is a world that we like or not.

293
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.130
Um,
we have no choice.
I think that this is also the world of who we are.

294
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.930
And quite often,

295
00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.740
most of the people that we need actually our people we see once and never again,

296
00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.490
um,
that we know just by those two attributes,
what kind of clothes they wear.

297
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.260
A and w surmises as to what my occupation is they have.
So,
um,

298
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.050
Jason is,
tomorrow is in many ways our present.

299
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.160
And here I want to um,
um,

300
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.710
in to mention the work of one of my heroes really,

301
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.800
uh,
Raymond Williams,
uh,
very,
um,

302
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:41.290
influential literary and cultural critic.
Um,

303
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:46.680
he died some time ago,
um,
and um,
his classic work,

304
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.350
the country and the city.
Um,

305
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.930
in that work,
uh,

306
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.020
Raymond Williams coins the phrase a knowable communities and find one of the

307
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:02.560
chapters of the book is called knowable communities.

308
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.830
And this is what Raymond Williams has

309
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.310
a country community.

310
00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:15.090
Most typically a village is an epitome of direct relationships of face to face

311
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:23.401
context within which we can find and value the substance of personal

312
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:30.900
relationships as the scale and complexity of the characteristics.

313
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:37.150
Social organizations increase a whole community,

314
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:38.121
holy,

315
00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:42.580
knowable becomes harder and harder to sustain.

316
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.710
So Raymond Willingness,

317
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:49.711
his idea is that modernity is defined by the breakdown of that unsustainable

318
00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:57.850
utopian,
ideal,
knowable communities.
Um,

319
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.170
and uh,
he really reads,
uh,
almost off.

320
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.880
He was English.
Um,

321
00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:08.440
so he reads almost all English literature using that concept art.

322
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.370
And I'm extending his insight,
um,
to American literature.

323
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.600
And here I want to start very briefly and say a word about plagiarism.

324
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:20.770
I know that,
uh,
the first paper is coming up for you guys.
Um,

325
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.860
and I just want to emphasize how important it is to acknowledge where you are

326
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:30.490
getting your ideas from,
where you're getting your wording from.

327
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.140
Knowable community is a phrase that I could've made up myself.
Um,

328
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.440
but it is really important to acknowledge the book that you,

329
00:22:41.501 --> 00:22:44.980
or the article that you got the,
the,
the concept from very,

330
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:46.540
very important for two reasons.

331
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:52.230
One is that it is just occur to say needed recognition to the person who came up

332
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:55.630
with the idea.
Um,
if you were to come up with a great phrase,

333
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:59.770
you want people to acknowledge you.
Um,
but I think that more than that,
um,

334
00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:04.800
I think that citation or practices are not just a technicality and not just a

335
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:05.760
way to get was house.

336
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.870
Our trouble is a way to show that we're in dialogue with some one else.
Um,

337
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.360
and because Raymond Williams is such a hero for me,
um,

338
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:18.170
I actually take a lot of pleasure,
um,
in thinking that,
you know,
even though he,

339
00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.090
he didn't write about Faulkner,
um,
that actually is insights at the lie.

340
00:23:22.091 --> 00:23:23.830
So well to follow her.

341
00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.860
So it is the pleasure of having a long and extended,

342
00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:34.480
uh,
conversation,
uh,
with someone you know,
with people that you admire,

343
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:39.100
who's work you enjoy reading.
Um,
so for both those two reasons,

344
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:44.110
um,
is pleased and knowledge where you're getting your ideas from.

345
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:49.650
So I'm using Raymond Williams's idea of the knowable community.

346
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.020
Um,
I want to,
um,
think about,
um,

347
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:58.220
Jason's a structure of injury,

348
00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.830
his pattern of injury,
um,

349
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.890
and are we looking at two passages that suggest that he's still in a knowable

350
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.920
community and then we'll move on to that much more pressing.
Uh,

351
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.060
the world is going to win out in the world that is made up of unknowable

352
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:20.720
strangers,
but close,
um,
knowable community based on Jefferson,

353
00:24:20.721 --> 00:24:24.810
Massachusetts.
This is Jason.

354
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:28.730
That breakfast once the bitch always a bitch,

355
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.590
when I say I say us,

356
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.360
you're lucky if a plane I was at school is all that.
Whereas you,

357
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.270
I says she ought to be done here,

358
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.390
down there in that kitchen right now is the up there in a room gobbing paint on

359
00:24:44.061 --> 00:24:46.460
her face and waiting for six niggers.

360
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:51.560
They can't even stand up out of a chair unless they got a pan full bread and

361
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:54.410
meat to balance them to fix breakfast for her.

362
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.990
So the basic problem,

363
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.990
one of the basic problems for Jason that we know there's earlier,

364
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.760
the very short attention span is very much in evidence here.

365
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.900
He starts off complaining against his knees,
Quentin,

366
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.560
by the end of that hazard,
she's complaining about the niggers in his household.

367
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:17.380
Um,
so he can hold on to a grievance for very long to wear temporaries.

368
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.940
Definitely a course they have.
Um,

369
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.240
but even though the word temporary is a curse for Jason,

370
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.220
he actually aspires to permanence.

371
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:33.250
And we see that in the opening line of that passage once that bitch always a

372
00:25:33.261 --> 00:25:38.210
bit,
it is not a proverb.
There's no such profit,
uh,

373
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.073
you know,
the well,

374
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.350
but it has the feel of a problem.

375
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.400
It has the feel of a province like permanence and this is the small town,

376
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.130
Jason who is speaking,
um,

377
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.160
finding enormous satisfaction from making pronouncements that sound like

378
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.333
proverbs.

379
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:03.820
This is his take on and he is able to sum up the entire world.

380
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.240
Uh,
just using,
um,
seven words.

381
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.700
You can really do better than that,
a seven worst summation of the entire world.

382
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.620
So just enormous satisfaction.

383
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.090
So we can say that even though Jason is complaining nonstop,

384
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.310
even though that's his nose,
um,

385
00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.050
this is one instance where complaining,
um,

386
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:31.280
it's actually a very pleasurable activity for Jason.

387
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:32.960
He's getting a kick,

388
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:37.430
being able to say that his knees was a bitch and she will always be one.
Um,

389
00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:42.110
and he's getting a kick out of talking about the thickness of her makeup.

390
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.950
Um,
and everything that is objectionable about her gifts,

391
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.210
him enormous pleasure.
So complaining in,

392
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.560
oh no.

393
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.640
In a world of numb at quantities and

394
00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:03.220
Quinten is very much a known quantity to Jason complaining about people right

395
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:05.280
around you.
If you people in your immediate family,

396
00:27:05.281 --> 00:27:09.750
that's a really fun thing to do.
And Jason is having fun doing that.

397
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:13.140
He's having fun complaining about the black servants.
Um,

398
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.890
and in his mind as far as he's concerned,

399
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.180
Quentin,
his knees and those blacks ovens I exactly alike.

400
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:27.360
They're all good for nothing.
They are all a trial for him.

401
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.720
They all wronging him in some fashion.

402
00:27:30.721 --> 00:27:35.640
They a grain on his financial resources brain on his patients.
Um,

403
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.430
it's just a burden that he has to carry through life that he happens to have in

404
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.280
these like that and sermons like that.
He can go on and on.
Um,

405
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.330
he can go on all day like this.
Um,

406
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.320
and it would be a very happy life for him to be able to go on like that.

407
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.180
So this is the pleasure that one gets from a knowable community.

408
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.590
Um,
and I'll just give you another instance of that.

409
00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.600
I'm very much in the same vein.

410
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.720
Like I say,
if he had to sell something to San Quentin,

411
00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:12.070
to Harvard,
we're all ban a damn sight better off if you,

412
00:28:12.071 --> 00:28:17.071
so that sideboard and bought himself a one arm straight jacket with part of the

413
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:18.684
money.

414
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.320
I reckon the reason all the Compson gave out before it got to me like mother

415
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:27.180
says,
is that he drank it up,

416
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.020
at least I never heard of him offering to sell anything to send me to Harvard.

417
00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:38.220
Um,
so two complaints here,
both center on his father,
Mr. Thompson.

418
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.690
One is that his father drinks and that the uh,

419
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:46.060
in fact that it is true that the Sam,

420
00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:50.660
one of the many punctuate punctuation marks,
um,

421
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:55.730
metaphoric punctuation marks in the sound of the fury and Mr. Thompson mucking

422
00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.750
the trips to the sideboard to get the bruise.
Um,

423
00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.260
that's one of the punctuation marks in the sound of the theory.

424
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.680
So Jason isn't wrong that his father drinks and how they squandering away the

425
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:14.871
whole comms and fortune to the extent that there is one now he's squandering

426
00:29:15.331 --> 00:29:18.330
away the whole fortune by drinking.
So,
um,
Jason,

427
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:21.150
Susan has a kind of legitimate complaint,
um,

428
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.250
but the deeper complain,
um,

429
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:29.420
that goes along with the fact that his father trains is that Quentin,

430
00:29:30.781 --> 00:29:34.800
his brother was his father's favorite.
Um,

431
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.170
that his father,
um,

432
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.530
as much as he loves drinking,
he probably love,

433
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.420
loved Quentin better.
I love alcohol.

434
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:47.290
Um,

435
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:52.290
and he would go so far as to sell the pastures Benji's polishes so that Quentin

436
00:29:53.501 --> 00:29:55.810
would go to Harvard.
Of course he killed himself off the one year,

437
00:29:55.811 --> 00:29:58.240
so all the money was wasted.
Um,

438
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:03.300
and that is just even more grounds for complain for Jason.

439
00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.490
Uh,
one that's again,

440
00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.270
I have to say it's fairly understandable grievance.
Um,

441
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.220
the sense of not being loved,

442
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.690
the sense that nobody has ever done anything for him,

443
00:30:16.691 --> 00:30:21.691
that everything that could be done in that family was being done for Quentin and

444
00:30:22.871 --> 00:30:27.130
then who wasted everything.
Um,
is,
is,
it's an almost,

445
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.100
I wouldn't say it's a completely legitimate grievance.

446
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.460
There's a very understandable as a of why he's someone that nobody things about.

447
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:41.110
Nobody ever gives a thought to the wellbeing of Jason.
Um,

448
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.300
and what kinds of,
or do you get,
you know,

449
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:46.480
when nobody ever gives them thought of his wellbeing.
Um,

450
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.570
so he's in any ways Faulkner,

451
00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.860
and I'm just preparing you for the ending of the sound and fury.

452
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.740
Where do you think that even though Jason is loser,
um,
once again,

453
00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:00.760
often the dust or something for that loser.
He's a very sad loser.

454
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.180
And here we see some of the reason for that sadness is that people turn into

455
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:11.770
monsters when they feel that they are completely unloved.
Um,

456
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.880
and uh,

457
00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:17.940
but still right now along with the south today along with the constant

458
00:31:18.251 --> 00:31:19.084
complaining,

459
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.600
Jason is getting some satisfaction from the fact that he's complaining against

460
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:28.360
his father once again,
no on a day to him,
uh,

461
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.960
all know all too well in this,
in this instance.

462
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.730
So less look at,
um,

463
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.820
the breakdown of that knowable well,
um,

464
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.550
because it's satisfying to Jason,

465
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.800
that's the thing that's going to be taken away from him.
Um,

466
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:48.340
so the last thing that gives him set aside,

467
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.490
it gives him satisfaction is going to be taken away from him.

468
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.730
And the breakdown of the knowable community,
um,
comes with automobile.

469
00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.760
Um,
as we have seen,
um,
and all those things the serve,
um,

470
00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.880
intimated by the arrival of the automobile,
The New York Jew,

471
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.780
US government,
Western Union,
Wall Street.
Um,

472
00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.810
so let's look at one instance of Jason stance that he's wronged by unknown

473
00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.540
parties.
And um,

474
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.950
all of a sudden we see that the world has expanded tremendously.

475
00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.140
That even though Jason is still in Jefferson,
Mississippi,

476
00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.510
that all of a sudden New York City becomes his horizon,

477
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:35.170
becomes his reference point.
I don't see how a city,

478
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:40.410
no bigger than New York can hoe enough people to take the money away from us

479
00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:43.730
countries suckers.
Well,
I'm done with them.

480
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:49.120
They sent me in for the last time any full except the fellow that hasn't got any

481
00:32:50.091 --> 00:32:55.091
more sense than to take a juice worth for anything could tell the market was

482
00:32:55.401 --> 00:32:56.810
going up all the time,

483
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.220
the whole Damn Delta about with let it again and the cotton,

484
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:05.870
the wash right out of the ground like it was last year that they wash them as

485
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:10.871
crop out of the ground year after year and them up there in Washington spending

486
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:17.770
$50,000 a year keeping an army in Nicaragua or sounds ways,

487
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:23.190
incredible scale enlargement in the world.
Jason,

488
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:27.170
not only in New York City,
but Central America as well.

489
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.160
So we have to figure out why it is that the world suddenly opening up in this

490
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:33.260
drastic fashion.
Um,

491
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.720
and it turns out that actually closer to home,
um,

492
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.870
this actually,
um,
um,
Jewish populations that they've can,

493
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:46.490
Jewish populations,
Jewish community and Clarksville,
Mississippi.

494
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.950
So Jason could have seen these people.

495
00:33:48.951 --> 00:33:51.560
He goes to socialize with his Jewish neighbors,

496
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.510
but he's not thinking about his Jewish neighbors.
Um,

497
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.510
he also,
because he's talking about New York City,

498
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:04.310
he also could have been talking about a lower east side and has the street,

499
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:08.930
and this is a picture of Hester Street,
uh,
turn of the century.
Um,

500
00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.000
these are not very threatening people.
Um,

501
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.230
Jason could have been talking about dose Jews.
Uh,
those New York Jews.

502
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:19.580
He's not thinking about the dose instead.
Um,

503
00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.810
the noodles you,
that he has in mind,
um,

504
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.320
is very similar.
It's kind of a transnational to,
uh,

505
00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.010
this is a picture by the French painter.
They go,
we,

506
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.890
I think that we know him,

507
00:34:33.930 --> 00:34:38.090
a pelly from [inaudible] paintings of the,
uh,

508
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.060
ballet dancers.
So,
you know,
we think of him as a painter,

509
00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.860
very graceful bodies emotion,
but,
um,
he asked,

510
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:50.840
Ashley also has a whole range of paintings about social portraits.
Um,

511
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.870
and this is a painting of a Jewish French Jewish banker at the fringe tools,

512
00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:00.700
um,
stock exchange in Paris.
Um,

513
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:03.620
and the kind of the machinations,
um,

514
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:08.960
engaged in by the,
the proverbial,
uh,

515
00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.350
I Guess Transnational Ju,
uh,
always scheming and conspiring,
um,

516
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.140
for new good.
Um,

517
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:21.280
Jason's image of the New York Jew has everything in common with this antisemetic

518
00:35:22.011 --> 00:35:26.480
image and they guy was painting.
And,
um,

519
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.220
so we can see that,
you know,

520
00:35:28.221 --> 00:35:33.221
is really the whole financial world is really opening up in the Jason Section.

521
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.850
But there's one other detail that we get in,
in this.
Jason is also a guy for us,

522
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.760
uh,
to the world of the 19th 20th,
uh,

523
00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.310
basically the whole of the early 20th century,
uh,

524
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.750
because he's mentioned to Nicaragua and it turns out that that's actually an

525
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.550
accurate,
accurate mansion.

526
00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:55.850
The United States was in Nicaragua and from 1909 to 1933,

527
00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:57.803
uh,
the,

528
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.840
in 1916 getting closer to the date of the sound of the fury,

529
00:36:02.971 --> 00:36:07.470
that sound of the fury,
let me just say,
was published in 1929.
Okay,

530
00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.400
so keep that date in your mind.
1929,
but in any case,

531
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.960
in 1916,
uh,
there was the Chamorro Ryan Treaty.

532
00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:16.560
Uh,

533
00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.560
it was ratified by the US Senate in 1916 and it gave the United States exclusive

534
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
rights to build an inter oceanic and now across Nicaragua.

535
00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:33.630
Um,
the Panama Canal was ready in existence,

536
00:36:33.631 --> 00:36:37.530
but there was some thought that maybe another can now might be useful.
Um,

537
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:42.120
and the United States was claiming exclusive rights to build a canal.

538
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:42.990
Um,

539
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:47.990
and that treaty also turn Nicaragua in two a near US protect,

540
00:36:49.931 --> 00:36:54.400
right?
So that's,
Jason's complained about the $50,000 that we did,
uh,

541
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.690
spend to keep an army and Nicaragua.
So,
um,

542
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.450
Jason was someone who reached the newspapers.

543
00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:03.900
Clearly he's a good newspaper readers.
It's up on the news.

544
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.560
He has almost legitimate complaints against the US government and the foreign

545
00:37:10.831 --> 00:37:14.610
intervention of the u s government and the brain,
um,

546
00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.260
on the finances of the United States.
Um,
and um,

547
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.220
so the,
all of a sudden there's a conflation of the New York Jews,

548
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:28.380
the US government strangers,
um,
at a distance up to no good,

549
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.240
right?
So you know,
people who are far away,
you never set sight on them.
Um,

550
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:38.270
they are harming you in some fashion.
Last look at,
um,

551
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.720
another way in which,
uh,
in the here in,
in the earlier,
um,

552
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:48.180
passage when the US government has just spending $50,000 the day and they go,

553
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.260
Robert,
um,
Jason himself claims to be completely innocent.

554
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:56.670
He's just harmed by the policy of foreign policy of the United States
government.

555
00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.250
But in the next passage,
uh,
we see that actually,
uh,

556
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.840
Jason is in some sense a willing party,
uh,
to,

557
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:11.490
um,
the harm that is coming to him in a sense that he is competitors,
uh,

558
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:16.490
in the world he is complaining about.
Um,
and this is also,
uh,

559
00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:21.110
the second instance of injury from um,
a nobodies damn.

560
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.120
If I believe anybody knows anything about a damn thing except the ones that sit

561
00:38:26.581 --> 00:38:31.581
back and those New York offices and watch the country's sufferers come up and

562
00:38:32.101 --> 00:38:35.570
begged them to take the money.
Only you dead.

563
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:41.130
If it doesn't look like a company as big and rich as western union to get a

564
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:43.780
market report out on time,

565
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.550
half as quick as they'll get a wire to you saying,

566
00:38:47.551 --> 00:38:51.940
you account closed out the,
what the hell do they care about?
People,

567
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.380
they're hand in glove with the New York crowd and could see that.

568
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:02.600
Why is Jason so obsess with the Western Union and with the Telegraph as the new

569
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:10.660
we develop instrumentality of communication.
Well,

570
00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:15.690
it turns out that he's a smart investor and he wants to find out exactly how

571
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:20.860
it's also doing,
if he wants to go to invest or withdrawal as money.
Uh,

572
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:25.510
so the Western Union is crucially is relation to Wall Street is we show,

573
00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.900
but the western union is crucial in getting those reports to him on time and

574
00:39:31.751 --> 00:39:34.870
allowing him to change his investments in time.

575
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.740
And it turns out that the western union was in fact very common.

576
00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.620
The site in the south,

577
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.070
they were many telegraph officers in the south.

578
00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.310
And this is the main office,

579
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.980
the Western Union office in New York City.
Um,

580
00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.730
so once again,
Jason really knows what he's talking about.
He's naming,
um,

581
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:04.390
entities that actually was real historical entities.

582
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.680
Um,
and um,
and he is a bank.

583
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:13.940
This is a historic and on the historic Oxford Square,
um,

584
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.940
in,
uh,
Oxford,
Mississippi.
That is Jefferson as a civic.

585
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:24.280
Um,
and,
uh,
with this writer,
this is the main square in town.
So bands,

586
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.610
we're also a very important presence,
um,
in Oxford,

587
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.290
Mississippi and um,
is really Jason's,

588
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.970
um,
relationship to the banks,

589
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.410
both the local banks.

590
00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:43.470
And I'll show the national banks on Wall Street by way of the mediated by the

591
00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.650
Western Union.
Um,
that really is the main relation in his life.
Um,

592
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:54.030
yes,
he has a relation to his knees.
Clinton is a religion to his mother.
Yes,

593
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:57.490
relation.
There's black servants.
He hates them all.
Um,

594
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:02.550
and the most significant relation that he has is to his money help,

595
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.540
uh,
in Jabuti now,
uh,

596
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:11.260
by the national banks in wall on Wall Street.
Um,

597
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:12.400
so,
um,

598
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.640
and it is in that context that all of a sudden the proverb life phase phrase

599
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:22.120
reappears.
Uh,
but in a very sad,

600
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:27.370
almost have to be from Jason and Jason.
Like I say,

601
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:33.090
once the bitch always a bitch and just let me have 24 hours without any Damn New

602
00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.030
York Jew to advise me what is going to do.

603
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:44.020
I don't want to make a killing saved that the suck in this muck canvas with,

604
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.220
I just want an even chance to get my money back.

605
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.800
I think that that is the very small hole on the bottom of Jason.

606
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.080
He's not asking to make a huge sum of money.

607
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.910
He just doesn't want to lose all his money.
Um,

608
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.980
and it's such a model is hope that we know is bound to be defeated because of

609
00:42:09.981 --> 00:42:14.250
course in such a world of long distance action,
um,

610
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:18.590
and we'll operate it by total strangers with huge,

611
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.980
large scale impose no institutions.

612
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.970
Small investors are the ones who lose out.
Um,
so,
you know,

613
00:42:25.971 --> 00:42:30.380
it's a phenomenon that we recognize very well.
Um,

614
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:31.221
in that way,

615
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:36.221
I think that we shouldn't forget that just as Faulkner has a lot of sympathy for

616
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.990
Benji,
Faulkner also has a lot less than the day for Jason.

617
00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.670
It's very hard for us as readers to have any sympathy for Jason at all.

618
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:50.960
He's just such an offensive of putting kind of character.

619
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.270
Um,
but I think that that very resonant,
um,
small,

620
00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.400
I just wanted an even chance to get my money back.
Um,

621
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.800
in two in that one phrase,

622
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:05.780
Jason in many ways speaks for all of us.
Uh,
and thought the knows that,

623
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:06.320
um,

624
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:11.320
that's it is that is in many ways the most important phrase and the Jason

625
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.110
Section.
Um,
and as it turns out,

626
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:20.111
the irony of history is such that the history of the United States turn out to

627
00:43:22.551 --> 00:43:27.551
be a corridor to the sound and the fury because the same year that the sound of

628
00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:30.740
the fury came out was also the year of the crash.

629
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:35.720
And here is an image of the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

630
00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.270
Um,
and two more images.

631
00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:41.990
The crowds outside the New York Stock Exchange.

632
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:43.580
Um,

633
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.110
all those people are probably much bigger investors than Jason.

634
00:43:48.111 --> 00:43:52.430
They're right there on the spot.
They probably big investors or stop there.

635
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.210
You know,
their,
their,
their trailer is actually,
a lot of them were trailers,

636
00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.270
so they were insiders,
uh,
on Wall Street.

637
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.780
But even the insiders had the illusory sense that if you could just be there

638
00:44:06.111 --> 00:44:09.590
physically,
that that would make a difference.

639
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.950
So this proves that Raymond Williams's idea of to knowable community,

640
00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.320
it's actually a psychological demand from all of us.

641
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:26.000
All of us want to know the people we are having transactions with.

642
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:30.620
All of us are creating their work,
knowable communities right around us,

643
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:35.520
even though the actual historical circumstances are making dose,

644
00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.480
knowable communities and impossible idea in the present.

645
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:45.050
So we know that those people are there on the spot trying to recreate in vain

646
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.630
and Utopian ideal from the past.

647
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.460
And even though they are not countries suckers like Jason,
um,

648
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.240
in the sense that they are not from Mississippi,
um,

649
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.400
they resemble him in more ways than one.

650
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:01.380
So in that sense,

651
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:06.381
the Jason Section represents the largest possible scale for,

652
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.540
uh,
thoughts on her.
Uh,

653
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:13.370
it really is about the Taiwan capture,
uh,

654
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.830
by Jason's dealing news,
uh,

655
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.920
and his failed attempt to come to terms of the future.

656
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.250
To tomorrow that he's guiding us to is really no place to be.

657
00:45:25.621 --> 00:45:29.940
But I think this is for him and for lots of other people that yes,
the present.

658
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.800
Um,
but,
uh,

659
00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.880
for Jason is the problem of trying to find a resting phase,

660
00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:41.370
the sustainable or some kind of bearable plays in that tomorrow,

661
00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:45.930
that's going to be the challenge for Faulkner in the last section of the sound,

662
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:49.680
the theory.
So we'll come back,
um,
to,
uh,

663
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.090
an alternative to the automobile at the very end of the sound of the fury.

664
00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.510
And Jason's a satisfaction to that.
