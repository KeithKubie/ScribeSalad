game theory can be applied to scientific

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:07.769
game theory can be applied to scientific
 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:09.350
game theory can be applied to scientific
understanding in a lot of different ways

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360
understanding in a lot of different ways
 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.630
understanding in a lot of different ways
one of the interesting things about

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:11.640
one of the interesting things about
 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.610
one of the interesting things about
contemporary science is that it's done

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620
contemporary science is that it's done
 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.350
contemporary science is that it's done
by these large groups of people who are

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
by these large groups of people who are
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.910
by these large groups of people who are
interacting with one another

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
interacting with one another
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.250
interacting with one another
so science isn't just a lone scientist

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
so science isn't just a lone scientist
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.830
so science isn't just a lone scientist
in his lab removed from everyone else

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
in his lab removed from everyone else
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.380
in his lab removed from everyone else
but rather it's teams working together

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
but rather it's teams working together
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.180
but rather it's teams working together
sometimes in competition with other

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190
sometimes in competition with other
 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.130
sometimes in competition with other
teams who are trying to beat them out to

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
teams who are trying to beat them out to
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.300
teams who are trying to beat them out to
make a big discovery

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
make a big discovery
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.820
make a big discovery
so it's become much more like a kind of

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
so it's become much more like a kind of
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.430
so it's become much more like a kind of
economic interaction these scientists

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
economic interaction these scientists
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.860
economic interaction these scientists
are striving for credit from their peers

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
are striving for credit from their peers
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.710
are striving for credit from their peers
for grants from federal agencies and so

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720
for grants from federal agencies and so
 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.150
for grants from federal agencies and so
a lot of the decisions that they make

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
a lot of the decisions that they make
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430
a lot of the decisions that they make
are strategic in nature they're trying

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
are strategic in nature they're trying
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049
are strategic in nature they're trying
to decide what things will get funded

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
what strategies are most likely to lead
to a scientific advance how can they do

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
to a scientific advance how can they do
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.190
to a scientific advance how can they do
things so as to get a leg up on their

where scientists striving to get a claim

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
where scientists striving to get a claim
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399
where scientists striving to get a claim
can actually make science worse because

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409
can actually make science worse because
 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.680
can actually make science worse because
a scientist might commit fraud if he

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690
a scientist might commit fraud if he
 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.240
a scientist might commit fraud if he
thinks he can get away with it where a

right now scientists get credit for

right now scientists get credit for
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.690
right now scientists get credit for
publication and they're encouraged to

publication and they're encouraged to
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.179
publication and they're encouraged to
publish exciting new findings that

another scientist shows that maybe that

when we look at the scientific results

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
when we look at the scientific results

that show up in the journals that have

that show up in the journals that have
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.949
that show up in the journals that have
been published it turns out that that's

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959
been published it turns out that that's
 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.650
been published it turns out that that's
skewed towards positive findings and

people have suggested that we need to

know another scientist in your field or
maybe some scientists outside your field

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489
maybe some scientists outside your field
 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.330
maybe some scientists outside your field
but now as the area of science

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
but now as the area of science
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.539

journalism is increasing the public is

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549
journalism is increasing the public is
 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.770
journalism is increasing the public is
starting to get interested in science

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
starting to get interested in science
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.420
starting to get interested in science
and so scientists are starting to be

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
and so scientists are starting to be
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.099
and so scientists are starting to be
rewarded for doing things that the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109
rewarded for doing things that the
 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.470
rewarded for doing things that the
public is interested in this has a good

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
public is interested in this has a good
 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.930
public is interested in this has a good
side and a bad side the good side is it

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940
side and a bad side the good side is it
 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.759

means that scientists are driven to do

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769
means that scientists are driven to do
 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.890
means that scientists are driven to do
research that has public impact that

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900
research that has public impact that
 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.120
research that has public impact that
people are gonna find useful and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130
people are gonna find useful and
 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.130
people are gonna find useful and
interesting and that helps to encourage

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140
interesting and that helps to encourage
 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.380
interesting and that helps to encourage
scientists not just to pursue some

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
scientists not just to pursue some
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.449
scientists not just to pursue some
esoteric question that maybe is

esoteric question that maybe is
 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.220
esoteric question that maybe is
completely irrelevant to people's

scientists are encouraged to do things

scientists are encouraged to do things
 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.449
scientists are encouraged to do things
that will make a big splash get an

necessarily things that are good science
 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.710
necessarily things that are good science
and so one of the things that people are

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720
and so one of the things that people are
 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.090
and so one of the things that people are
concerned with is that this new

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100
concerned with is that this new
 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.580

incentive being popular with the public
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.279
incentive being popular with the public
can make scientists shift towards

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289
can make scientists shift towards
 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.440
can make scientists shift towards

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450
research that's likely to be exciting
 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.020
research that's likely to be exciting
but not necessarily true because the

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030
but not necessarily true because the
 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.940
but not necessarily true because the

later we decide that the research was
