00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.006
 - This is The Belly Room, and
 this is where it all started.

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:08.374
 - It's a very special place,

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:11.044
it's sort of a comics-only vibe.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - I think I forgot
  my jokes, fuck.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:14.580
 - So, will they, don't worry.

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.549
- Jessie's a...

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.084 size:88% position:44%
 - Fucking patience.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.452 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Let me take a
 shit on that paper,

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
 so there's something
 funny on it.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.423 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.391
 - When a joke bombs,

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
 it's like falling
 backwards through a window.

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.429 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You look like the
 hottest waitress

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.598
 in the North Dakota Denny's.

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:36.402 align:start position:0%
  - But when a joke kills
  up here in the Belly Room,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.137
 it's thunder.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.906
Joe and my mom are both
disgusting alcoholics.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:46.712
The only difference is one
funny came out of my mom.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.114
I basically want to
commit hate crimes

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:49.215
that I get a trophy for.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:53.686
What's a podcast called, WTF who
the fuck.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.188 size:84% position:42%
  - There's a thing
  called The Wave.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.224 size:84% position:42%
  They're like a gorilla
  sketch team, it's insane.

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.826 size:88% position:44%
 - [Voiceover] Yeah!

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:03.396
 - This should be really good.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:04.864
 - That's the kind of
 theatrics one does

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.365
 when they don't write jokes.

00:01:06.398 --> 00:01:07.934
 - Oh!

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.703
 - You only roast the
 ones you love, and

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:11.904 size:84% position:42%
  I mean, I don't love him.

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:14.941 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Can you scoot
 over bro, thank you.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:18.244 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Because he's Mexican,
but I like him.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:22.181 align:start size:88% position:13%
 George is no stranger
 to stereotypes,

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:26.219
 because he's stolen
 Sonys, Samsungs, JVCs,

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:30.890 size:88% position:44%
 pretty much any stereotype
 you can get out of a Honda.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.994
 - It's the loveliest kind of
 joke, because it's personal,

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.430 align:start position:0%
  because a good roast joke
  requires knowing you.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.465 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You know what Guy,
you wish you had my hair

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:40.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
  because guys, when
  they ride you,

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.335
have to grab onto your neck fat.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.270 size:88% position:44%
 (audience groaning)

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.305
 - [Voiceover] It works for us.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.107 size:84% position:42%
  - Some of these comics
  have nothing to lose, and

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.444 align:start position:0%
 everything to gain by
 killing in the roast battle.

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:53.012 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.314 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - [Voiceover] I
 like it, I like it.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.347 size:88% position:44%
  (applause)
