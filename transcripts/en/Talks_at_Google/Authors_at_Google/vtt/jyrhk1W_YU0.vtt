MALE SPEAK: So good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.050
Today we have another
outstanding

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.600
Authors at Google Talk.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.180
We're very honored to welcome
Bryant Austin

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.860
to our midst today.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.920
He is a conservationist, a
photographer first and

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.200
foremost, and really a
storyteller of the whales that

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.570
are throughout the world.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.760
He has over the past decade or
more embarked on a quest to

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.640
create large format photography

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.650
of the world's whales.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.260
And his story is extremely
fascinating, both from a

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.140
technical standpoint and for how
he is able to change the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.870
conversation of whale
conservation away from just

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.970
the whales jumping out of the
water, like the Pacific life

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.760
visual to something even more
compelling more direct, which

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.040
is these face to face
interactions with whales, and

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.450
the look in their eyes,
so to speak.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.420
So we'll invite him on stage,
and we'll also have time for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.540
some questions at the end.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.120
So please join me in welcoming
Bryant to Google.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.803
Thank you.

00:01:00.803 --> 00:01:07.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.330
BRYANT AUSTIN: Thank
you, Cliff.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.090
This is my first time here.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.225
It's pretty exciting, so
thanks for having me.

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:13.475
Oh, is this--

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.530
so I thought what I would do
is just give you a little

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.650
perspective on kind of
what led to this.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.670
I mentioned I make very big
photographs of whales.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.050
These are life size photographs,
but also very

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.280
high resolution.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.780
And it's not anything that
happened overnight.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.330
It's been an evolution, so I
look forward to sharing that

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
with you today.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.460
For the past 10 years with
whales, I've wanted to create

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.310
something that would move and
inspire someone who has no

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.590
interest in whales.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.890
Someone who may eat whales.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.440
And I wanted to see if that
might be possible.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.080
And so I started this probably
in 1998, actually.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.160
And I'd been an artist since
I was five, a painter.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.170
Switched to photography in my
'20s, and swam with my first

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.340
whale in 1994.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.360
And took pictures, and looked at
them, and they just did not

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
convey what I experienced
with the whale.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.870
And in fact, none of the
photographs I've seen of

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.840
whales underwater convey what
one experiences when they're

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.020
so close to you.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.340
So I gave up photography 20
years ago, photographing

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.170
whales and volunteering
with many conservation

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.420
organizations.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.680
And really became burned out
from that experience.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.540
And I was burned out from
painting, and so I decided in

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.780
1998 to begin photographing
marine mammals as an art form

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.730
with no real agenda.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.100
I just wanted to see if I
could create something

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.620
special, and really what was
at the core of the work is

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.860
this idea of decoupling the
pressure of making a living

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.150
from photography, from
the craft itself.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.270
So I started with sea otters,
and by the time I was done

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.560
with sea otters, I started
with whales.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.340
A professor loaned me his Zodiac
from UC Santa Cruz, and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.840
I just started to get the
courage and the interest to go

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.910
further offshore.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.410
And this was 2003, so I had a
boat, a team of volunteers.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.390
That was a trailer I lived in
for four years near the Long

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.350
Marine Lab.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.380
Everything I earned went
into this work.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.580
Experimenting with all kinds
of camera equipment.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.330
This is a gyro stabilized steady
cam that I built with

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.320
the first autofocused medium
format camera made by

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.530
Hasselblad.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.860
And I would wait for the most
ideal weather conditions.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.740
It only happened a couple times
a month, when winds were

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.720
less than five knots and the
sea states were calm.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.190
We would go out and cover
up to 80 miles a day

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.910
in search of whales.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.290
And during the four years of
doing this, this was, I think,

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.630
one of the only photographs
I had.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.330
It's just this idea of bringing
together like, sea

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.100
states, atmospheric conditions
and behavior.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.140
Bringing it all together, and
that was one of the few

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.750
photographs.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.890
And I was really starting
to doubt my pursuits.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.440
I wasn't sure if this
was something

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.790
that was a good idea.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.500
And towards the end of this
time, I had an encounter with

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.110
a blue whale.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.550
And with whales, I didn't know
how to photograph them

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.370
underwater in a way
that would inspire

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.070
unexplored thought and emotion.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.885
And above water I had some
ideas, but I'd never motor up

00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:24.230
to a whale.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.830
I'd never swim after a
whale or pursue them.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.330
And now I wait for them
to come to me.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.750
But at the time, I didn't
even know that.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.670
I just thought, well,
I'm here.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.810
I really don't know what to do,
other than position myself

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.290
where the light is best.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.580
And whenever we'd see a blue
well or a humpback, the boat

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.680
would drop down to two miles
an hour, steady course, no

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.400
changes, and observe.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.810
And they're foraging
300 feet down.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.660
They're coming up, and one day
a blue whale surfaced right

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.380
next to the boat.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.100
Like, six feet.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.020
It was right here.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.640
His head was bigger
than my boat.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.930
My boat was 20 feet long,
and there was his head.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.480
And this nostril, the blue
whales have a splashguard that

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.930
looks a lot like our nose.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.220
And it just came out of
water, and a 30 foot

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.540
blow went right up.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.850
And then you could hear this
sucking sound, this cavernous

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.140
sucking sound, suggesting
this great mass

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.090
underneath the water.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.330
I mean, it was incredible.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.930
Four times the size
of our boat, and

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.980
my legs were shaking.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.290
I was forgetting to breathe as
I'm composing photographs of

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.180
this blue silverback rolling
in front of me.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.730
Through the viewfinder
I could see a rainbow

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.100
casting this blow.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.810
I could see my own shadow in the
blow with the whale's body

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.360
right there.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.820
And I thought, this is it.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.290
After three years of effort,
I've got something.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.880
This is what I've been waiting
for, and this was the photo

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.780
that came back.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.412
That's actually what
it looked like.

00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:41.400
And it was the only time the
film came back unexposed.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.690
And I had decided,
I've got to quit.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.720
I started to go down
the rabbit hole.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.050
I don't have what it takes to
keep exploring this, both

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.890
emotionally and financially.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.700
And around the same time, I had
already booked a trip to

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.320
the South Pacific to reacquaint
myself with the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.550
underwater world of whales.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.850
And this was with
humpback whales.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:01.730
And I didn't want to go.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.480
I couldn't refund it.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.470
So I was there.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.020
The whole time I'm there, I'm
trying to figure out how to

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.162
rebuild my life when I get back
home and stop all this.

00:06:08.162 --> 00:06:11.980
And this a really horrible
photo, and it just shows you

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.940
how difficult it is.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.870
But it just really, it was in
my third week in the South

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.446
Pacific, and it really just
summed it up for me.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:21.190
What's not really being
convinced in this photo, it's

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.140
150 foot visibility.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.910
That water is over 60 feet
deep, and you can see the

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.160
boulders and all the features
on the bottom.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.740
You can see their shadow
on the bottom.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.880
And I thought, this
is incredible.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.660
It's like I was almost standing
on the edge and

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.735
looking out into the abyss
of what I was pursuing.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.480
I realized to really explore
this, you need

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.580
to do it full time.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.530
And you need to be with these
whale for entire seasons, up

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.230
to three months to see the full
spectrum of behavior.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.680
And also, the person left our
group and is swimming after

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.160
the whale, trying to get
photographs, and compromising

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.840
the encounter.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.900
The whales are swimming away.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.120
And that's very symbolic
to me.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.390
It's this mentality
of scarcity.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.320
And we impose it on ourselves.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.330
We say, well, I'm only with the
whales for two weeks, or

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.270
three weeks, so I must chase
them, pursue them.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.530
I've got to get the shot to
either make this a viable

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.490
business of impress
my friends.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.860
And it's like, it's
no, no, no.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.420
You've got to decouple from
that and just really be

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.230
willing to work on whale time.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.840
And so that realization, to
me, like, OK, this is it.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.580
This is like, I'm looking
out at the abyss.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.770
It's like, do I want to
keep going forward?

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.650
How do I be present for three
months with this?

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.960
How do I do that?

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.330
I didn't know how, nor was
I inspired to do it.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.720
And I still wanted to quit, and
it was an experience that

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.530
moved me to tears.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.000
I was like, OK, I'm giving up
on this, and I'm going to

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.830
rebuild my life.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.090
And by the end of the day, that
same day, I was with this

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.410
mother and calf.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.120
And they were about to do
something that would shine a

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.640
light on what I could offer,
what I could create.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.360
And it started with
this whale here.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.610
This little calf on the bottom
is swimming up to me.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.250
And they both kind of churned
and came right up to me, and

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.460
the calf came up to me on
a collision course.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.070
He was just right at me.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.970
And at the last moment he turned
away, and I was using a

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.140
fish eye lens, which
is traditional.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.850
I don't use them anymore.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.180
They're great for small books
and calendars, and things,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.850
where it encouples the whole
whale's body in one photo.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.550
And that's what I was doing.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.560
That's what I was taught.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.540
And I knew he was close.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.130
And the fish eye makes him look
far away, and I thought,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.080
I'd better lower this camera.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.640
He's going to hit my camera
with his tail.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.290
And I lowered the camera,
and this was the

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.300
last photo I took.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.330
And I remember being immediately
just taken aback

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.770
by the sight of a
belly button.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.500
Literally just beyond arm's
reach, going by me.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.500
And seeing all of their
true colors, and the

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.120
fine, subtle details.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.150
And I remember appreciated his
body, his musculature and

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.770
blubber, and skin just moving
and flexing as he was powering

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:48.520
down one more time.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.170
And he powered down.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.510
And that fluke went right
by my face like this.

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.320
And I was just in awe.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.790
I mean, this was a five week old
calf who has that kind of

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.190
mind body awareness in
relationship to me, which, why

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.190
should he be concerned
about me?

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:01.290
It was really humbling.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.280
And I was sitting there trying
to process the moment, trying

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.340
to see if there was something
to this that I could pursue.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.980
And another moment passed, and
then I felt a single, just

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.530
solid tap on my shoulder.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.680
And it was too solid of a tap to
be human, and I felt dread

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.760
as I turned to look.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.100
And it was the mother, and she
had extended her 15 foot long

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.420
pectoral fin that weighs two
tons, and she touched me with

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.230
the very tip of it.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.520
And the camera was to my side,
and I was eye to eye with her.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.320
She was looking into my eyes.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.780
And I immediately saw
what was missing.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.410
What I could offer.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:47.000
Moments like this, on their
terms, and on their scale.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.440
She had this expression, it was
a very calm, heavy lidded,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.270
mindful gaze.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.520
And it's very penetrating.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.370
And it was a moment where the
word whale just fails.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.920
It's a meaningless word, and
there's something else there.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.902
And that was it.

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:07.190
I had the inspiration, and it
took another year and a half

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.255
to find the courage
to pursue it.

00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:11.580
And here was the idea.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.000
If you could see this little
black dot, that's a very

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.410
generous representation
of a digital sensor

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.210
on the biggest camera.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.090
And the idea of putting all
this information on one

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.870
sensor, on a 45 foot
whale just seemed--

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.422
it wasn't going to work.

00:10:26.422 --> 00:10:29.600
And I thought at best, you could
focus on this area and

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.250
make a portrait, which is
one of the things I do.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:35.170
And I was really interested in
seeing what happens if I turn

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:39.220
the camera on its side
and just do a mosaic.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.440
And that's what I began.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:48.970
That's that direction I went
and explored, and I hadn't

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:49.860
quit my job yet.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.300
I was trying to live
in both worlds.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.850
I was trying to do this
and keep my day job.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.770
And this was a photo from
my first season.

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.220
I sold my truck and all the
camera gear I didn't need.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.640
I raised enough money for five
weeks, and to begin exploring

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.170
this process and learning.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.750
And I came back with nothing.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.710
I mean, this was one of the
photos I created, but none

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.080
were life size.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:16.000
And I learned a lot, and I was
really starting to feel sad

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.230
about trying to keep both
things going, and the

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.120
depression was really
powerful.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:30.100
And I remember being at my
therapist's office, and she

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.760
told me something that you
never want to hear your

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.250
therapist say.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.530
She just looked at me one
day, just said, I don't

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.870
know how to help you.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.670
And this was a time where I
was on the brink of being

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.590
checked into a crisis center.

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.560
And I just looked up
at her, it just me.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.710
I remembered that feeling I
had when I had the first

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.200
inspiration.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.835
I need to leave all this
safe and familiar.

00:11:49.835 --> 00:11:51.480
I need to pursue this.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.810
And I told her, I need
to quit my job.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.170
And then just everything
just drained.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.480
I felt fine.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.210
And that was seven years ago.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.300
And so off I went.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.410
I sold everything I owned.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.660
I quit my job at a sea
otter research lab.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.120
I raised enough funding for 124
days of field work, and

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.780
this would allow me to learn and
explore all the different

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.680
possibilities, to recreate that
sensation I experienced

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.405
two years earlier.

00:12:17.405 --> 00:12:18.740
This is a mother calf pair.

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.870
This is one of the whales I
would see regularly, and this

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.820
is him as well.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.900
His name is Beethoven.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.350
We gave them him name because he
would swim down to his mom

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.920
and his back on his mom's body,
and wave his pectoral

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.170
fins like a conductor.

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.030
This was my one and only
attempt to make a

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.760
composite at that time.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.210
The whale on the right swam
up to my friend here, and

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.650
immediately did a 180 and
came right back at me.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.800
And I took some photos.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.190
Let's see if this works.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.280
So those are some of
the photos I took.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.320
And you have to remember, I'm
six feet away from this whale.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.390
This is a small whale.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.800
Probably 27 feet long.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.060
Probably only like
two years old.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.450
Pectoral fins are right here.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:07.560
I'm so close that the pectoral
fin is going underneath my

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.370
body just by about this much.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.400
And all I see is this wall of
whale, and he's probably about

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.190
this tall, which a small
for a humpback.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.310
And your entire field of view is
enveloped by this body, and

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.790
then you see this
eye approaching.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.990
I'm looking through the
viewfinder here, and here I'm

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.770
watching him.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.120
And this eye's looking around,
and looking at me.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:31.150
And sadly, what I learned from
this experience was the sun

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.250
was in the right position.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.720
It wasn't behind my head.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.250
And what I've taken away from
that experience is always keep

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.480
the sun at your back.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.460
And that means if a whale comes
up to inspect my feet,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.710
even if it's six feet away,
I don't turn to face him.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.000
I keep my back to him.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.970
And it requires a
lot of trust.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.970
And my feeling is that
our eyes gravitate

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.120
towards each other.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.260
And so I just hold the
direction I want, and

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.320
hopefully they'll come around.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.960
And they do occasionally, will
come right up and look at me.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.780
They don't like to look in the
sun either, because their eyes

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.800
are very sensitive to light,
but it's the only way these

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.880
photographs can be made.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.730
They don't like strobes.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.050
And this is Beethoven again.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.380
The inspiration was
really powerful.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.820
It was to the point I
couldn't ignore it.

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.360
So I'm doing my best to just
follow it, and every step of

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.700
the way when you make all these
big decision,s you quit

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.265
your job, you sell everything
you own.

00:14:20.265 --> 00:14:22.010
And you're like, well,
how do I feel?

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.020
And it's like, no, I
still feel good.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.682
This is the right thing.

00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:27.960
And there's no other choice,
and I keep going.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.840
But by the end of those 124
days, I had nothing, and I was

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.530
still learning.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.130
And I was looking at the
prospect of coming home with

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.790
nothing, and for the first
time in two years, I was

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.530
thinking, I'm going to have to
quit and rebuild my life.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:42.520
This is insanity.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.010
I'm just going so far down
the rabbit hole now

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:45.900
that I have to quit.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.120
And I had a sleepless night, I
had just a few weeks left, and

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.270
I remember, I didn't
sleep at all.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.810
And just filled with anxiety,
and just a lot of regret.

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.552
And we went back out to sea
that morning, and within a

00:14:59.552 --> 00:15:02.320
half hour, I reunited with
Beethoven and his mom.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:09.340
And his mom was about 60 feet
down, and Beethoven was doing

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.330
the same old thing.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.750
Rubbing his back on her.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.250
And mom started to come up to
surface to have a look.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.880
And she got really close, and
Beethoven swam off, and then I

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.680
lost track of him.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.060
And I thought, uh-oh,
where'd he go?

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.660
And mom was 12 feet down, and
she just rolled up and looked

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.740
at me, and her eye went wide,
and I knew something was up.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.340
And then my body just
moved forward at the

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.590
surface like this.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.990
I'm on snorkel.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.870
And I felt this pressure against
my back and my head,

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.240
and I strained to look up, and I
saw the underside of a whale

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:37.300
go over the top of my head
and stop right here.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.590
And I lowered my camera, and its
pec fin came around, and

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.700
just went right against my chest
and pressed me to his

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:44.600
belly, and we stayed
there together and

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.140
breathed at the surface.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.280
And I didn't want to startle
him, so I just stayed there.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.570
And my assistant was in the
water, and she grabbed my arm

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:57.270
and just separated us gently,
and we went back in the boat.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.470
I've had strange events where
I've wanted to quit, and then

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.510
something like that happens.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.990
It's happened several times.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:06.340
And the very next day, I
composed what would be my only

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.760
life sized portrait of a
whale during that time.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.620
And this is another calf,
a five week old

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.590
calf we named Mozart.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.890
And when you learn something,
you're learning, you're

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.135
developing, you're making
a lot of mistakes.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.110
When you're 6,000 miles from
home, it's hard to just say,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.350
well, I need this
kind of lens.

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.470
I need a more portrait lens.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.280
You can't just go online and
get one from B&amp;H Photos.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.760
So you're kind of committed to
the mistakes you've made with

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.590
the lens choices, and
I realized the lens

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:39.540
I had was too wide.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.770
I really needed something
narrow, because the more

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.690
narrow the field of view, the
more pixels per feature.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.060
And that's really important
when you want

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.015
to capture the eye.

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:52.690
And this, well, and his mom swam
around me for 20 minutes.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.540
Mozart had his pec fin out like
this, and mom's dorsal

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.270
fin was like this.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.690
So he's hitching a ride.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:59.920
They're just cruising around,
going around me, coming closer

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.970
and closer.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:04.380
Finally they were underneath me,
about 15 feet, and Mozart

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.530
just went like this and
separated from his mom, and

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.170
came right up to see me.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.569
He was less than three feet
from my camera when I took

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:11.500
this picture.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.290
And it's like he overcame all
my mistakes, and I took this

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.940
picture, and that was it.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.880
This was my last photograph
from the season.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.440
It's just me saying goodbye on
my last day before I flew back

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.230
to the States.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.860
And really, that portrait of
Mozart was my only currency.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.970
To print the amount of work,
I had to sell my underwater

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.190
camera here and fully
commit to this.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:40.640
And started my first show eight
months later, and really

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.300
just began the process of
putting the work out there.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.180
And during that time, it
was a two year time

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.270
between field seasons.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.090
And I thought about
this whale a lot.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.410
This is Mozart's mother, and
this is probably 10 feet away.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.240
And I thought, hey,
look at this.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:55.620
This is great.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.340
I can make a life size portrait
of an adult whale.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.590
And when I zoomed it up,
enlarged it, the

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.285
eye just fell apart.

00:18:01.285 --> 00:18:03.040
It was just blobs of color.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.770
And I realized I would have
to be closer than 10 feet.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:10.040
And that concerned me more than
fund raising or getting

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.650
commissions than
anything else.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.290
And it took years to
overcome that.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:24.620
And it wasn't until 2008, I was
invited to exhibit my work

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.710
at the International Whaling
Commission meeting in

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:27.990
Santiago, Chile.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.530
And this is the security
detail there.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.165
It's a very highly politicized,
polarized event.

00:18:34.165 --> 00:18:38.760
Can be pretty compelling and
dramatic with the opposition.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.730
And instead of being outside
with the signs, I was able to

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.100
come inside with the work.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.420
And we had an exhibition in
the lobby where all the

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:48.530
delegates walked by every day
to the conference venue.

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.500
Even invited, asked if we could
include the portrait

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.370
outside the conference room
where they have coffee.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:57.500
And they said, it was with no
text, and they said it would

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.560
be too controversial to have a
portrait of a healthy whale

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.720
just there.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.380
So that actually gave me hope.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.270
This was a photo of the actual
exhibit in the lobby.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.000
Had a reception.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.580
It was really an incredible
time.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.360
My last couple of days there
I met this gentleman, Peter

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.770
Hall, who's the CEO of Hunter
Hall Ethical Managed Funds,

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:22.410
who ultimately commissioned me
to create my largest work.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:27.670
And it would be the largest work
I could create that would

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.030
be shown in Norway and Japan
for the first time.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.210
And so in 2009, I started
this process with him.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.710
And it's really simple.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.780
It's what would happen with
a 50 megapixel camera, a

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.000
portrait lens, like a
50 or 80 millimeter,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.310
so it's very narrow.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.690
And from six or five feet
away from a whale's eye?

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.760
What would that look like?

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.750
And it's really exciting, but
it's never happened before.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.530
it's never been done.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.310
And I just was really curious
to see what would happen.

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:04.550
So Peter was able to make that
possible, and right after New

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.950
Year's Day, as soon as the
camera arrived, it was one of

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:10.110
the first batch of cameras that
were sent out, I went to

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.470
the eastern Caribbean to
work with sperm whales.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.340
And I was actually in search of
a specific family known as

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.420
the Group of Seven, and in that
family there is one whale

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.240
who is known to tolerate people
in the water, and who

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.390
might even come close.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.780
And Peter able to fund five
weeks of field work, which is

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.070
a terribly short amount of
time, but I was grateful.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.230
And I thought, if I only have
five, weeks I need to find a

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.100
whale that may allow me to
create, finally create a full

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.380
body composite of
a whale's body.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:42.680
And I spent five weeks there,
like I said, and I never found

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.510
the Group of Seven.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.910
And I was looking at coming home
with nothing once again.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:53.980
And I went out, my last
full day, and I saw--

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.760
during this whole time,
I never found

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.600
the Group of Seven.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.760
This was another whale, and I
saw this whale over and over.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.260
And it seemed like he was
tolerating me more and more

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.160
every time we were
in the water.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.560
When I'm in the water,
I snorkel.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.310
I'm motionless.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:10.530
I don't swim after them,
I just observe.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:14.530
And I want to allow them to
explore any natural curiosity

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:15.415
they may have of me.

00:21:15.415 --> 00:21:17.340
And this is what might encourage
a very close

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.510
inspection, which is really
critical to making these

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.410
photographs.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.060
And this whale never came close
enough, but on my last

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.250
encounter, he was about
eight feet away.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.560
And we just kind of
swam together like

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.850
this, side by side.

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:32.130
And I would compose pictures,
and he opened his jaw, which

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.730
normally is a threat display,
but he shot out a squid

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.500
tentacle at me.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.700
It was about this big, and
about that big around.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.340
And I regretted not taking it,
because I thought maybe it was

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.230
stuck between his teeth,
but it was too big.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.620
And it just started to open
my eyes about how you can

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.850
communicate intention with a
whale, just by showing up

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.160
every day for three months, or
five weeks, whatever you can

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.900
do, being respectful and
consistent, and just being in

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.220
their presence.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.860
And giving them the
space to explore

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.170
their own natural curiosity.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:03.420
So to have that consistency,
visually, everything

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.305
I wear is the same.

00:22:04.305 --> 00:22:07.720
Same boat, for the acoustics,
to make sure they can become

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.480
familiar with that.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.770
And that's what really
inspired that.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.610
And as I was saying earlier,
on my last day of the five

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.670
weeks, I met this whale.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:21.290
He's a two and a half year old
calf, and his mom swam by very

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.350
closely to me.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.000
Not close enough, again, but
she kind of moved her tail

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.810
like this by me.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.020
And I was like, whoa, and I took
a picture of her tell.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.490
And I was going home
within days, and I

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.310
thought, OK, great.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:33.600
I have a life size photo of a
tail, or part of a tail, and

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.460
we'll just make it big and share
it anyway, and just see

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.920
what I can do.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.620
And she dove.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.440
She dove to 1,000 feet, and
was down for 45 minutes.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.610
And this is her calf.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:48.420
His name is Enigma,
and I surfaced.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.740
I came up to look around.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.690
I saw a friend of mine.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.590
We'd just became friends.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.050
His name is Shane Gero.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.340
He's a sperm whale biologist who
studies the social biology

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.940
of Peruvian sperm whales.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:04.510
And he just looked at me and
said, very casually, this is

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.090
the Group of Seven
you're with.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.840
And I thought, OK, this
one whale named

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.720
Scar might be here.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.240
And hopefully this will allow
me to make these big

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:11.990
photographs.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.500
And I hadn't seen him
yet, but Scar's

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.380
younger cousin was here.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.540
And he finally was swimming
around me.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.350
His mother two and a half year
old cousin was in the family,

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.470
too, nursing, so he didn't
really have anything to do.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.030
And the mothers and aunts share
the nursing duties, and

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:31.750
they babysit while the
mom is foraging.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:32.780
So I just stayed motionless.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.550
He swam around me.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.390
He finally settled, probably
five feet, six feet from me,

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.960
and he gave me his right
profile, or his left profile

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.690
first, then left profile.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.340
This is his left profile.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.060
I hope you can see it OK.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.550
And this was the first time that
I was able to capture,

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.460
this is probably five feet away
with an 80 millimeter

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.190
lens and a 50 megapixel
sensor.

00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:59.750
I was starting with 50,
and I learned that 50

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.500
wasn't doing it.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.090
But at the time it stopped
working, so I had to switch to

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:03.710
another lens.

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:07.640
And that turned out to
be the right choice.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.080
And, yeah, I'm sorry you
can't see the detail.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.820
It's a little too dark right,
now but I was really excited

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:13.570
just to see that.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.610
And he gave me about a
half hour sitting.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.890
And so I composed 300
photographs of his body in

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.580
sections about this wide, and I
took the 15 best photographs

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.260
and blended them together
in Photoshop, and

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.860
I'll share with you.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.170
Let's see if this works.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:31.690
Is this going to do it?

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.260
Oh, there we go.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.600
This was the first
one I created.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.510
I flew home within days
after this encounter.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.860
We had to build a computer
that could complete this.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.940
It's probably a 40 gigabyte file
with all the layers, and

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.800
I think I was using maybe 200
gigabytes of memory, which we

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.060
would use--

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.620
that we would get that from
scratch disks to handle it.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.410
Takes like a half
hour to save.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:25:00.140
It measures 5x20 feet.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.480
And I just had a lot of
gratitude for this whale to

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.630
give me that opportunity.

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:11.710
After that happened,
I met his cousin.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.700
I had just got on the boat,
changed my battery in my

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.620
memory card.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.350
And I remember sitting out by
the swim step, and I just

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.695
heard my skipper say hey, look.

00:25:18.695 --> 00:25:20.050
Look down.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.000
This whale was coming up to the
boat, he was upside down,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.340
which I speculate they could see
with both eyes when they

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.280
present their belly, and
gauge your distance.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.850
And I got in the water, and
he swam right under me.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.890
And I remember picking up my
legs, just going like this,

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.610
just to let him pass
underneath me.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.130
And I took this photograph, and
he was preparing for his

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.660
foraging dive.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.030
So he wasn't going to
spend very much time

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.180
with me, and he dove.

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.630
And later in the day, I
saw him one more time.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.850
And this was my last encounter
with him, and I'll

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:52.670
never forget it.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.150
It's the encounter that comes
to mind most of all when I'm

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.961
asked, what does it feel like
to swim with a whale?

00:25:57.961 --> 00:25:58.710
Let me show you.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.050
This is what's going on
underneath the surface.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:03.410
This is all I could see.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:06.935
He swam right up to me with his
lower jaw open, which can

00:26:06.935 --> 00:26:07.780
be a threat display.

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.730
So I wasn't sure what if
he was testing me.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.720
And his head's about this high,
and about this wide.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.940
He's a very small whale.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.350
He's probably 24 feet.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:21.530
I'm guessing 10 tons,
maybe, or more.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.780
If he fully matures, he
could reach 70 feet.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.270
Historically, that's
how big they get.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.540
And I remember feeling this dead
again as his head loomed

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.690
closer, and it finally pushed
up against my body.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.520
And I remember putting my hand
on a whale and touching a

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.740
whale for the first time,
and pushing off.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:40.140
And I remember being humbled
just by the basic observation

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.790
of his body not moving
when I push away.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.830
And he then just heeled over 45
degrees and came forward to

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.580
meet my eye.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.080
This is that right profile.

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.150
And as he came forward, his jaw
was still open, and it was

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.480
open underneath my body.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.360
I was flat, and I remember
looking down, just making sure

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.180
that my feet were not going
inside his mouth.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.300
And he has a history
of grabbing fins.

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.100
He's very tactile.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.440
It's like an opposable
thumb for him.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.550
It's not anything malicious,
but they will feel you.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:16.350
And so I just stayed flat, and
I wondered, what's going on?

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.400
Is he testing me?

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.800
And I realized, I had
to take pictures.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.330
So I just turned over my
complete trust to him, and

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.730
started taking pictures
of him.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:30.360
The thing to think about with
this whale, when I'm asked

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.190
what it feels like to swim with
a whale, and to be this

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:33.670
close to a whale's eye
looking at you.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.780
I always think of this
one encounter.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.910
And the thing to keep in mind
with sperm whales, they're the

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.080
largest toothed predator on the
planet, and they possess

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.680
the largest brain ever
to exist on earth.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.400
It's up to seven times
the size of our own.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.320
They're complex social animals
who have been shaping their

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.910
culture and communication for
over five million years in

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:53.740
their modern form.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:57.510
So if you imagine a brain that
size evolving culturally for

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.780
five million years, that's
25 times longer

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.480
than our fossil record.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.100
Now, they're very
complex animals.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:08.700
And really, the only word that
comes to mind when I

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.510
experience something like
this, the only word that

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.880
describes it is that
it's disturbing.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:18.020
And it comes from the
realization of realizing we

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.330
may not be alone in
the universe.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.810
That there's some intelligent,
conscious life in the oceans

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:25.260
that we can't measure yet.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:31.620
And all you have is this eye
to eye exchange, and this

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:33.350
tangible knowing of something.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.710
And really, that's why I
create this work, is to

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.410
inspire that next generation
of biologists, engineers.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.550
Many disciplines, artists
who want to know.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:46.370
And I don't think enough
of us want to know yet.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.210
And with all the emerging
technologies, it's my hope

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.330
that we can at least measure and
know, because what really

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.990
concerns me most of all is the
thought of losing over five

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:58.970
million years of evolving
culture and communication, and

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.710
the largest brain ever to exist
on Earth, and to never

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:02.780
know what we lost.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.295
And that to me is the
biggest tragedy.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.720
Two years later, I reunited
with him.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.730
And this kind of gives you an
idea of a typical workflow.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.150
This is his head, this is his
blow hole, his dorsal fin.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.710
That's my head right there.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.670
And he gave me a four minute
sitting during this reunion,

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.200
and I composed 144 photographs
along his body.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.750
And this is what it looks
like underwater.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.830
This is my largest photograph.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.430
Let's see if this works.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.910
There it goes.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:44.340
It measures 10x36 feet, has
over 20 photographs in it.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.560
It's a 60 gigabyte file.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.480
have to keep flattening it.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.860
It has probably 200 layers
to it in Photoshop.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.630
It uses probably 370 gigabytes
of memory, which I supplement

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.570
by using solid state hard
drives in RAID 0.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.380
I'll use up to 12 of them to
act as a scratch disk.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:03.985
There's his pec fin.

00:30:03.985 --> 00:30:05.070
You can see his digits.

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:09.066
They have figures like
us in their pec fin.

00:30:09.066 --> 00:30:11.310
And I haven't printed
and mounted it yet.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.590
It will be an original
photograph.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:17.360
I wanted to have the same
feeling of impermanence and

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.720
fragility that they have out
there, and I wanted to be

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.060
special for people
that see it.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.450
Digital's exciting, but for me
it's the means, not the end.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.410
And so I want to create some
special with digital, but not

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:33.550
necessarily make it
something else.

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:33.890
So, yeah.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.140
Now we're getting to his tale.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.455
When it's printed and mounted,
it'll weigh 1,200 pounds.

00:30:44.455 --> 00:30:45.840
And that's the other reason
I haven't printed

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.640
and mounted it yet.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.890
It needs a home.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:52.190
Let's see.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:55.440
During 2009, I was also
commissioned to work with the

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.010
most heavily hunted whale
in the world.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:59.000
It's the minke whale.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.800
This was on the Great Barrier
Reef in Australia.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.060
If any of you are interested in
swimming with whales, I'm

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.320
happy to share information
with you.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.530
But I highly recommend the
Great Barrier Reef.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.300
There's only a five
week window.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.090
Nobody knows why, but the
dwarf minke whales there

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:13.600
become incredibly inquisitive
to boats and

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.390
people in the water.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:16.645
And they do come up to you.

00:31:16.645 --> 00:31:17.690
Very close.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.260
This is a whale I spent five
days with out of five weeks,

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:24.080
and as many as six
hours in a day.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.650
Let me share some more
photos over here.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.730
This is what's going
on under water.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.120
This is still Ella.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.330
She is probably three feet
away in this photograph.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.730
I would wake up in the morning
from our anchorage.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.760
We're probably 15 miles
offshore, and I'd pour a cup

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.720
of coffee and look out the
porthole, and her dorsal fin

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.640
would go by.

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.440
And then another one.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.230
And at times, there would be 14
whales circling our boat in

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.400
a figure eight pattern.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.550
And most often, Ella
would be in there.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.540
And I'll share, hopefully these
photos will show, OK.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.870
This will also give you
kind of an idea.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:58.420
This is a portrait of Ella,
a life size portrait.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:00.970
This is 4x5 feet.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.720
But the problem is the camera
has one autofocus point, the

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.680
Hasselblad.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.120
And so all the eyes are in the
center picture, which isn't

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.370
really ideal.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:14.200
And also, that one autofocus
point focuses on particles, so

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.010
I've been eye to eye, a whale
looking at me right here, and

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.950
it's focusing on all this stuff
in the water, and the

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.790
whale's out of focus,
and I'm in tears.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.950
But you can just add another
photograph and offset it.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.910
And I'll show you a little
bit of detail.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.940
Hopefully it'll show up OK, but
this gives you an idea of

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.670
just how much information
is there.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.230
This is probably my most
detailed photograph of a

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.900
whale's eye.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:41.640
That was Ella's left eye, this
is Ella's right eye.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.510
You can see it's really
dark over here.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.970
She's 4 feet underneath me.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:45.735
I'm floating flat.

00:32:45.735 --> 00:32:46.980
She's going like this.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:49.810
That dark spot is the shadow
cast from my body.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.460
I had to wait for her eye to
come out of my shadow to

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.740
compose that picture, and it was
like 8:00 in the morning,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.570
so the sun was really
illuminating her eye.

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:00.030
Let's see if there's a little
bit more detail.

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.610
After I took this photo, I was
being transferred at sea.

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:09.020
I had to go to another boat,
so I had to get out.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.060
The crew put me on a skiff.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.140
We went to another vessel, and
I was shocked to see her and

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.280
about three other whales follow
us to the other boat.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.180
I immediately just grabbed my
camera and went back in, and

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.430
kept photographing her.

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.580
This gives you an idea
of the workflow.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.150
This looks a little chaotic.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.640
There are probably 15 photograph
that I start with,

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.020
and they also look like this.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.040
You can see all the layers
that go into, all the

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.830
adjustments or the color
adjustments, the tones.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.670
All kinds of little photographs
that you pull in.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:39.800
Some I have to create.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.380
Sometimes I have to create water
from scratch, if I don't

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.790
photograph water by itself
after the encounter.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.930
This is the finished
photograph.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.370
This was at the Tamada Museum
in Tokyo in 2010.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.640
And I'll just do a--

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.330
oh, there it goes.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.320
OK.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.050
This photo is 6x30 feet, and
it's my largest photo so far

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.870
that's been printed
and mounted.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.280
There's only one company in
the United States that can

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.310
print and mount this
size in a clean

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:08.860
room to archival standards.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.270
And they're in New York.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:15.630
So it's a big deal every
time they're made.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:18.010
You can see, like, all the
flakes of skin on her body.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:20.340
These are all the subtle things
that make them real,

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.540
and that's what I explore with
my work with whales.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:26.270
Bringing out every subtle detail
with them that make

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:32.670
them real, and really, what I
want to achieve is I want to

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:35.310
give you a memory of what a
whale really looks like.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:38.150
Less than one millionth of 1%
of the human population will

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.880
ever be eye to eye with whales
the way I have been.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.920
And so they're essentially
reduced to words and small

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.850
pictures, and they're not really
a part of our lives, or

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.230
they don't really move us in
ways that they have the

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:53.060
potential to do so.

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.949
So that's a big motivation
for my work.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:35:02.010
So that last photo of Ella,
these last photos of Ella were

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.690
taken four weeks before
my very first

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.720
show in Oslo, Norway.

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.530
Norway's a country that
commercially hunts whales, as

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.410
well as Iceland and Japan.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:15.040
And Peter had commissioned my
first exhibition there.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.480
And the goal wasn't necessarily
to end whaling.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.760
That takes a tremendous amount
of investment of time.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.250
You have to be on the ground
for years, doing

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.980
all kinds of work.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.040
Work that isn't polarizing,
though.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.400
Sharing beautiful photos of
whales, sharing stories.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.200
And sharing in a way that you're
allowing your viewer to

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.420
have complete freedom to explore
their own curiosity

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.280
the way I do, I do the
same with whales.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.130
And you don't want to take that
away from anybody, even

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:40.400
if it's in a country
that hunts whales.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.760
Because once you do that, you
close the door to change.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.640
Like, you become set
in your ways.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.880
And what was inspiring
was the response.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.110
The show, first show was
only two days in Oslo.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.910
We had 2,000 people show up.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.930
Coverage on television,
newspaper, magazine, online,

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.070
and it was all positive.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.270
And we had a completely new
dialogue about whales with the

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:04.330
journalists in that country.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.270
Normally it's highly polarized
with the NGOs that I've

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.650
partnered with, and we were all
surprised that we could

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:10.690
have this different dialogue.

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.960
And mainly, they wanted to know
how can you get so close

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.730
to a whale without
them hurting you.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.870
And the storytelling really
became an important part.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.160
And the same thing held
true in Japan.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.320
It just was really heartwarming
to know that

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.755
whales can be received this
way, and we perceive these

00:36:29.755 --> 00:36:31.930
countries as not liking
whales, and

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:34.080
realizing that they do.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.750
And it just generates so much
excitement, and it's given me

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:42.600
hope to draw attention to the
far more serious global scale

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.950
issues whales face.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.630
Whaling makes up less than 1%
of what's killing them.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.810
Commercial hunting of cetaceans,
I should say.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.510
Whales, dolphins, porpoises.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:56.300
The number one culprit is
fisheries bi-catch.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.540
Entanglement in fishing gear,
where over 300,000 whales,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:02.050
dolphins and porpoises
die every year

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:03.450
for our love of seafood.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:06.490
And that's something I'm
exploring ways to gently

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:11.770
introduce into our world, and
the consequences of it.

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.950
One thing I'm working to do is
create a full body, life size

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:16.300
composite photo of
a living whale

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.600
entangled in fishing gear.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.940
And that's something that,
it's a major project that

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.490
safety is paramount,
the whale's

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.396
well being is paramount.

00:37:26.396 --> 00:37:30.000
A lot has to go into play, but
it's really my goal is to make

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.950
this a visual reality
that defies words.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.270
My work is currently
on exhibit at

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.260
the Museum of Monterrey.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.370
It's the first time all these
large photographs have been

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:43.940
exhibited together in North
America, and it'll be up until

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:47.060
Labor Day of this year.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:51.830
And I think that covers
my introduction.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:53.650
My book, "Beautiful
Whale," is here.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:55.140
It just released last week.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.520
It's my first photography book,
and I'm really excited.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.150
I hadn't planned on doing a
book, and was encouraged to

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.480
really consider it, and
I'm grateful I did.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:07.210
And I thank all of you
for coming out today.

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:14.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.240
MALE SPEAKER: Particularly bad
smelling minke whales?

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:16.740
BRYANT AUSTIN: Oh, no.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.750
There's a story about
the name.

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.190
it was named after a Norwegian
whaler named Minke.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.940
It was his name, and they were
hunting blue whales.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.930
I don't know when this was.

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:31.300
It may have been 50 years ago,
and he said, oh, a blue whale.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.290
And the crew found out it was
the smallest, one of the

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:34.260
smallest baleen whales.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:35.970
And they named it--

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.060
we're gonna, you know,
name it after him.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.820
It's a minke whale, so
I think that's how it

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.130
started, is what I'm told.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:45.050
MALE SPEAKER: So obviously,
underwater photography is a

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.960
big Everest in the photography
world.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.900
It's very difficult.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.900
There's a lot of equipment
that's involved.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.200
And what sort of advice do you
have for people getting

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.640
started in that medium?

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.880
BRYANT AUSTIN: I would just--

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.130
I would--

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:02.570
it's scary.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.470
There's two ways you could do.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.990
You can immediately go into a
way that's lucrative, that

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.780
produce results financially,
and you can

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.450
just create that way.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.190
Or you can go the other way,
where you have an interest in

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.310
something, but it's not
very well defined.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.950
And you have this thing you want
to achieve, and you just

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:19.150
have to be willing to
say, I don't know.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:21.430
And then just go and explore.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.460
And just decouple from the
financial pressure of trying

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.120
to make a lucrative photography
career initially,

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.220
and just create and explore.

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.270
And it's OK not to know.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.890
And my experience in doing
that is that I've created

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:36.660
something way beyond
my imagination.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:41.470
And that's just, yeah, that's
what I'd recommend.

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.610
MALE SPEAKER: You always see
whale watching tours when you

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.430
go to major tourist areas.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.570
What sort of guidelines should
people be looking for in terms

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:51.640
of reputable companies?

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.440
Like, what should you consider
when you're going on a whale

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.470
viewing experience?

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:58.400
BRYANT AUSTIN: They're
so varied.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.250
There are operators that don't
behave very well, and there

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.230
are some that are
very reputable.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.280
It's different in other
parts of the world.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.890
Anyone that wants to either go
whale watching, or swim with

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.630
whales, I have my business
cards here.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.110
Just feel free to email me.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:15.250
I can send you information.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:18.390
There are specific companies
that I know all around the

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:25.350
world that are just very
respectful of whales, and the

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:28.680
thing that is subtle about that,
being respectful and not

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:31.090
chasing them, not pursuing
them, not behaving badly,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.980
which is so common, is that
often the whales will just

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.630
come to you, and so there are
operators I can personally

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.820
recommend in at least
four countries.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.030
So please, I'll have my contact
information here.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.260
So, thank you again.
