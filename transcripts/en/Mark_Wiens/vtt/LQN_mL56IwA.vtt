00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:03.681
- I'm gonna begin with that top cheek.

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:04.947
(laughs)

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:08.843
That just comes off the bone beautifully.

00:00:08.843 --> 00:00:11.672
There is a lot going on in that bite.

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:14.255
(upbeat music)

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:17.342
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:21.484
It's Mark Wiens with
migrationology.com in Barcelona, Spain

00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:23.226
walking to the metro this morning

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:24.800
on our way to have breakfast.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.383
(lively music)

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.262
That was just a short metro ride.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:35.345
We arrived to San Antoni.

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:38.934
(lively music)

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.789
We just arrived to a
restaurant called Can Vilaro,

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.303
and this is a neighborhood, very friendly,

00:00:49.303 --> 00:00:52.738
traditional Catalan
restaurant in Barcelona,

00:00:52.738 --> 00:00:56.203
and I just ordered a
couple of different dishes.

00:00:56.203 --> 00:00:58.834
The owners here are extremely friendly,

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.667
and we'll see what I just ordered.

00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.806
I'm starting off with a bowl of gazpacho,

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:08.989
and this is a cold soup,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:11.313
and I think there is a
blend of vegetables in here

00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:12.634
but also a tomato.

00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:16.801
Oh that's thick and looks
very hardy like a puree.

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:20.782
Mmm.

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:23.517
Oh that's awesome.

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.184
It is cold, chilled.

00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:31.917
It's almost like a salsa
but it's not spicy.

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.946
It has an onion and tomato flavor to it,

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:38.199
and at the same time, it's sort of fluffy.

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.645
This is common to eat in
the summertime when it's hot

00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:43.151
because this is a cold,
very refreshing soup.

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:47.318
We add some of these little
crispy, crispy breads.

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:53.252
Mmm.

00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:57.401
I really like it.

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:00.406
It's not like,

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:02.552
like really thick tomatoey.

00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:05.263
It's more like kind of watery tomatoey

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:09.141
but that makes it more
refreshing and like, light.

00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.724
Look at that thickness of that.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.189
It's almost like a smoothie in texture.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.253
Mmm.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.405
A little bit sour, a little bit salty,

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:24.615
and a little bit tart

00:02:24.615 --> 00:02:27.066
from all of those vegetables and tomatoes.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:30.066
(speaks in Spanish)

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:34.663
The gazpacho was delicious,

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:36.542
and the next dish has just arrived.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.872
This is one of the dishes
that I was really forward

00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:39.956
to eating when I came here.

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:43.450
It's called cap i pota,
and it's a mixture of.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.158
There is a lot of tripe in here.

00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:46.692
There are pieces of meat.

00:02:46.692 --> 00:02:49.117
There are chickpeas, garbanzo beans.

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:52.678
There is some kind of
white lumps of, is it pork,

00:02:52.678 --> 00:02:54.181
probably, I think pork,

00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:56.229
and this is just a mixture,

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:57.804
and you can actually smell.

00:02:57.804 --> 00:02:59.547
You can definitely smell that tripe.

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.214
Oh and I love tripe.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.833
Oh yeah.

00:03:10.395 --> 00:03:12.642
Oh that's so tender.

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:14.104
I don't know if it's a little bit tomatoey

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:16.652
or that's coming from these
chilies that are in here

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:20.856
but that's awesome, and
what I like about the sauce

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:23.328
is that a little bit of the garbanzo beans

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.104
have sort of been pureed into the sauce

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:29.271
so you get a little bit of
that garbanzo beans' starch.

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:34.311
That is an amazing dish.

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:36.811
Let me try this piece of meat.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:42.870
That meat is just pure and tender.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.177
Mmm, and this is a very hardy,

00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:48.289
like a very solid dish.

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:49.896
This sauce is just made for bread.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:54.822
Look how it just sticks and
soaks up into that bread,

00:03:54.822 --> 00:03:56.666
and if I can get a chickpea,

00:03:56.666 --> 00:03:59.499
oh and a piece of tripe onto this.

00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.368
Oh with the bread, it
goes so well together.

00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:09.043
It's only like 9 a.m. but
people are feasting already,

00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:12.956
and drinking wine, and
enjoying, and socializing.

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:14.051
Food is delicious,

00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.968
and it has an amazing
home-cooked flavor to it,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.058
and these are the cheeks,
and like the jawbones from,

00:04:23.058 --> 00:04:25.978
I'm not totally sure what
but I think it's either lamb.

00:04:25.978 --> 00:04:26.998
I think it's lamb.

00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:28.241
I think it smells like lamb,

00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:31.676
and then you can see a drizzle of garlic,

00:04:31.676 --> 00:04:34.212
and I think parsley on top,

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:36.323
and this smells incredibly good.

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:37.328
Just look at this jaw.

00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:39.148
It's just glistening.

00:04:39.148 --> 00:04:41.204
Oh how do I go about eating this?

00:04:41.204 --> 00:04:43.365
Oh I think that's the
eye socket right there,

00:04:43.365 --> 00:04:47.262
and then you can even
see all the bottom bits.

00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:51.083
(laughs) Oh the tongue is included too.

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:53.318
Oh that is half a tongue right there too.

00:04:53.318 --> 00:04:56.444
I'm gonna begin with that top cheek.

00:04:56.444 --> 00:05:00.611
(laughs) That just comes
off the bone beautifully.

00:05:06.552 --> 00:05:07.873
Fatty,

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:09.470
gelatinous.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.762
There are some chewy bits in there,

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:16.104
and then it's coated in like
a garlicky parsley sauce.

00:05:16.104 --> 00:05:19.310
There is a lot going on in that bite.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.823
So many different textures,
and I think that is lamb.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:27.156
Oh I think this is more of a cheek here.

00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:33.025
Just look at that,

00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:36.775
a combination of the
fat, the skin, the meat.

00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:43.631
That piece just melts in your mouth.

00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:46.170
Okay, I'm moving over to the tongue.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.912
I think that's the tongue, right?

00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:49.162
Let's see here.

00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.790
Oh yeah.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.195
It's a little bit chewy.

00:06:00.195 --> 00:06:02.134
It sort of has the texture of gizzard.

00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:04.884
It's kind of leathery in texture.

00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:08.549
Oh.

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:09.593
What I love about this

00:06:09.593 --> 00:06:11.853
is that there are so
many different textures.

00:06:11.853 --> 00:06:14.178
Some soft and melts in your mouth,

00:06:14.178 --> 00:06:16.856
others that are chewy
and kind of leathery.

00:06:16.856 --> 00:06:18.439
What could this be?

00:06:22.547 --> 00:06:23.380
Oh.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.986
Oh that looks like a little
gem of meat right there.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:28.236
Let's try that.

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.791
That's a little melts in your mouth piece.

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.779
(speaks in Spanish)

00:06:42.738 --> 00:06:43.571
Oh okay.

00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:45.219
(speaks in Spanish)

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.469
(laughter)

00:06:48.986 --> 00:06:50.176
Okay.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.873
Not only is the whole restaurant friendly

00:06:52.873 --> 00:06:55.003
but everyone eating here is friendly,

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:58.195
and they talked me into
having a glass of wine

00:06:58.195 --> 00:06:59.774
this morning for breakfast.

00:06:59.774 --> 00:07:01.830
He said you have to have the wine

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.330
together with the lamb cheeks.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.356
Okay.

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:12.189
That is really good.

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:14.131
That's a white wine.

00:07:14.131 --> 00:07:16.129
It tastes quite light.

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.261
Oh it's fantastic though.

00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:19.348
I've got one more lamb cheek to conquer,

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:21.566
and Ying is not gonna help me on this

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:24.697
so it's up to me. (laughs)

00:07:24.697 --> 00:07:25.750
Yeah, what I do love about it

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.910
is that there are so
many textures going on.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.743
Look at that.

00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:29.576
Oh man.

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:34.230
It's such a wonderful
thing, and for this bite,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.897
I'm gonna take that
cheek section, and then.

00:07:39.474 --> 00:07:40.891
Come on, come on.

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:56.645
What a just, like, harmonious combination.

00:07:56.645 --> 00:08:01.017
Lamb cheeks, tripe, what
else could I need right now?

00:08:01.017 --> 00:08:02.934
Oh except to lean back.

00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:07.544
So many friendly people here too.

00:08:12.666 --> 00:08:14.408
Just take a look at this.

00:08:14.408 --> 00:08:16.021
Take a look at this place.

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:20.188
It is packed, and it's
still early in the morning.

00:08:25.316 --> 00:08:29.453
That was so good that I
just want to sit here.

00:08:29.453 --> 00:08:31.944
This is the type you can just
sit for the rest of the day,

00:08:31.944 --> 00:08:36.063
and just enjoy, and just
keep ordering plate by plate,

00:08:36.063 --> 00:08:39.063
and maybe even spend the night here.

00:08:49.652 --> 00:08:53.371
We finally have left the restaurant.

00:08:53.371 --> 00:08:55.346
We were there for how long?

00:08:55.346 --> 00:08:56.514
- Two hours. (laughs)

00:08:56.514 --> 00:08:57.869
- Over two hours.

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.495
I thought it was gonna be
just a quick breakfast stop

00:09:00.495 --> 00:09:03.345
but that I wouldn't trade
that experience for anything.

00:09:03.345 --> 00:09:05.178
That was an experience

00:09:06.178 --> 00:09:09.999
of why it is so awesome
to travel for food.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:12.582
(lively music)

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:18.591
We just arrived to the Montjuic Fountain,

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.440
and this is an iconic
fountain in Barcelona.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.294
Every Friday and Saturday

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:26.560
but I'm not sure of exactly the days,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.428
and sometimes it's not on.

00:09:28.428 --> 00:09:30.564
There is a famous fountain show

00:09:30.564 --> 00:09:32.827
but unfortunately when
we are here right now,

00:09:32.827 --> 00:09:34.413
there is no fountain show,

00:09:34.413 --> 00:09:36.293
and so I don't think
we're gonna have a chance

00:09:36.293 --> 00:09:38.012
to see the fountain show

00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:39.370
but it's still an amazing fountain

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.026
just to see in the daytime whenever

00:09:41.026 --> 00:09:42.665
even when there is not a show,

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:45.897
and then the museum is further up here

00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:47.314
where we're gonna be next.

00:09:47.314 --> 00:09:49.897
(lively music)

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:05.564
You have to climb up a
number of different terraces

00:10:05.564 --> 00:10:06.989
to get to the top of the museum

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:08.398
but once you're up at that top,

00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:11.163
the city view of Barcelona is fantastic,

00:10:11.163 --> 00:10:12.982
and you can see the
mountains in the background.

00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:14.641
It's an amazing view.

00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:17.224
(lively music)

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:22.304
We are now walking around the museum.

00:10:22.304 --> 00:10:27.009
Here is the map of the Museu
Nacional d'Art de Catalunya,

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:29.498
and there are many different exhibitions

00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:31.567
around the entire complex

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:34.807
including medieval
Romanesque art, Gothic art,

00:10:34.807 --> 00:10:38.636
Renaissance art, and so
we are gonna make our way

00:10:38.636 --> 00:10:40.745
from exhibition to exhibition.

00:10:40.745 --> 00:10:43.495
(relaxing music)

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:49.416
There are really some amazing paintings

00:10:49.416 --> 00:10:52.935
within these exhibitions
especially if you enjoy art.

00:10:52.935 --> 00:10:55.685
(relaxing music)

00:11:08.754 --> 00:11:11.210
The entire medieval and Gothic exhibition

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.841
is really impressive, and a lot of the art

00:11:13.841 --> 00:11:17.632
dates back to the 16th
century, and comes from artists

00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:20.675
especially within this Catalunya region

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:23.233
but then if you come
upstairs to the top level,

00:11:23.233 --> 00:11:26.254
it's all modern and contemporary art.

00:11:26.254 --> 00:11:28.254
I'm in a section of the museum now

00:11:28.254 --> 00:11:30.460
that has a number of different doors,

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.293
which are designed by Antoni Gaudi

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:37.190
who is such an important
figure in Barcelona.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.037
I think probably my favorite
section was the Gothic art

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:41.189
but I also really enjoyed

00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:43.720
browsing through the modernism section.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.303
(lively music)

00:11:48.915 --> 00:11:50.117
The next plan for the day

00:11:50.117 --> 00:11:51.495
is that we're gonna go back to the road.

00:11:51.495 --> 00:11:53.805
We're gonna try to take the
bus to the top of the hill

00:11:53.805 --> 00:11:55.318
to Castell de Montjuic

00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:58.367
for hopefully an even
better view of the city.

00:11:58.367 --> 00:12:00.741
This is a huge roundabout and square,

00:12:00.741 --> 00:12:04.544
and just trying to figure out
which corner to take the bus.

00:12:04.544 --> 00:12:06.910
I think it's this one over here,

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.618
and we are gonna catch bus number 150.

00:12:09.618 --> 00:12:12.201
(lively music)

00:12:29.984 --> 00:12:30.817
We just got off the bus.

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:32.461
That took about 10 minutes,

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.710
and right behind me also alternative

00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.769
where you can take the Teleferico,

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:39.146
which is a cable car, all
the way to the top here.

00:12:39.146 --> 00:12:41.729
(lively music)

00:12:45.825 --> 00:12:48.103
It's five euros per person for entrance.

00:12:48.103 --> 00:12:51.229
Montjuic Castle is a military fortress

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.834
that dates back to 1640,

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:55.456
and it is supposedly the place

00:12:55.456 --> 00:12:58.047
where you can get some of
the best panoramic views

00:12:58.047 --> 00:13:01.204
of Barcelona so I'm looking
forward to entering,

00:13:01.204 --> 00:13:02.912
and to enjoying the views.

00:13:02.912 --> 00:13:05.495
(lively music)

00:13:08.659 --> 00:13:09.877
We just got over the moat,

00:13:09.877 --> 00:13:12.794
and entering into the castle walls.

00:13:14.187 --> 00:13:15.434
I think we'll go right.

00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:18.641
From up here, you get a really
good sense of Barcelona.

00:13:18.641 --> 00:13:20.505
You can see the Mediterranean Sea.

00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:22.306
You can see the downtown area.

00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:23.941
You can see Sagrada Familia,

00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:27.651
which is one of the most
important and iconic basilicas,

00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:29.935
and one of the icons of Barcelona,

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:34.548
and now we're gonna go
upstairs to the top section,

00:13:34.548 --> 00:13:36.276
or within the castle.

00:13:36.276 --> 00:13:38.859
(lively music)

00:13:51.917 --> 00:13:53.114
And there over on this side,

00:13:53.114 --> 00:13:56.523
you have some amazing views
of the Mediterranean Sea,

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:59.765
as well as the port and
the harbor of Barcelona.

00:13:59.765 --> 00:14:02.655
Just look how many thousands
of shipping containers

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:03.739
are below there.

00:14:03.739 --> 00:14:06.517
I think visiting the
Montjuic Castle in Barcelona

00:14:06.517 --> 00:14:08.847
is an absolute must
when you visit Barcelona

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:11.272
just to get this amazing view of the city,

00:14:11.272 --> 00:14:13.699
and it will give you an
incredible perspective

00:14:13.699 --> 00:14:16.411
of everything that you can do and see

00:14:16.411 --> 00:14:17.907
when you come to Barcelona.

00:14:17.907 --> 00:14:20.490
(lively music)

00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:28.035
To enjoy the views and to
get a little bit of exercise,

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:30.947
Ying and I have decided
to walk down from castle.

00:14:30.947 --> 00:14:33.530
(lively music)

00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:43.249
That was a very nice walk.

00:14:43.249 --> 00:14:44.821
We are now back in Barcelona,

00:14:44.821 --> 00:14:48.154
and we're trying to make our
way to a famous tapas bar,

00:14:48.154 --> 00:14:50.004
and hopefully we're gonna get there

00:14:50.004 --> 00:14:52.337
before they close for lunch.

00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:56.694
(speaks in Spanish)

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:03.276
We made it to this
little, small tapas bar,

00:15:03.276 --> 00:15:05.306
which is called Quimet y Quimet,

00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:08.288
and this is an amazing little place.

00:15:08.288 --> 00:15:11.162
It's like a wine and liquor cellar.

00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:15.026
They just have bottles
decorating this entire place,

00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:18.148
and this place is famous
for their little tapas.

00:15:18.148 --> 00:15:19.103
I'm glad I got here.

00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:21.765
Actually we got here just
before they're closing

00:15:21.765 --> 00:15:24.377
so I'm just gonna have
a few little treats.

00:15:24.377 --> 00:15:26.137
This one, I had to order.

00:15:26.137 --> 00:15:28.723
This is a little piece
of bread on the bottom,

00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:30.979
and then he put on some tomato.

00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:33.279
There is some tomato puree, I think,

00:15:33.279 --> 00:15:37.040
and then some mussels, and then
some caviar on top of this.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.139
I think this is a biter.

00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:39.801
With a fork, you would just make a mess

00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:43.485
but you do have to lift
the plate up to your mouth

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.404
so you don't spill too much.

00:15:45.404 --> 00:15:49.321
I don't want any of that
caviar to go to waste.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:15:57.883
The bread on the bottom
is just completely crispy,

00:15:57.883 --> 00:16:00.285
and then the tomatoes
are a little bit sweet.

00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:02.138
Oh. (laughs)

00:16:02.138 --> 00:16:03.571
But the caviar is wonderful,

00:16:03.571 --> 00:16:04.824
and the mussels are,

00:16:04.824 --> 00:16:06.908
I believe they're
canned, preserved mussels

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:09.015
so they're really, really soft,

00:16:09.015 --> 00:16:10.682
and yeah, delicious.

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:15.162
Wow, that's a fantastic, little bite.

00:16:20.586 --> 00:16:21.689
Wow.

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:24.525
I also got a plate of razor clams.

00:16:24.525 --> 00:16:25.553
These are huge.

00:16:25.553 --> 00:16:26.555
Look at them.

00:16:26.555 --> 00:16:31.162
I better lift the plate too so
I don't spill too much sauce.

00:16:31.162 --> 00:16:34.620
I think these are canned,
preserved as well.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:37.758
I think almost everything
they serve is from cans

00:16:37.758 --> 00:16:40.460
but they do it so well,

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:43.562
and they preserve such
high quality ingredients.

00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:46.323
These razor clams are
wonderful, also very soft.

00:16:46.323 --> 00:16:48.740
So I got some stuffed olives.

00:16:53.406 --> 00:16:54.239
Whoa.

00:16:54.239 --> 00:16:55.463
Those are nice and sour.

00:16:55.463 --> 00:16:59.546
And then I decided to have
coffee this afternoon.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.286
I ordered a couple more.

00:17:03.286 --> 00:17:05.808
This one of codfish liver with tomato,

00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:09.725
and he added on a little
bit of caviar as well.

00:17:15.247 --> 00:17:16.080
Wow.

00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:21.691
That codfish liver is like creamy,

00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:24.691
and it kind of just dissolves, yeah,

00:17:25.969 --> 00:17:28.920
and then I really tasted
all of that caviar as well.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.099
Caviar is wonderful though.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:32.562
It's like it's not too salty.

00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:35.645
They are like little jellies, almost.

00:17:41.996 --> 00:17:42.829
Wow.

00:17:44.209 --> 00:17:46.727
That codfish liver is so creamy.

00:17:46.727 --> 00:17:50.894
The codfish liver almost has
the texture of like, cheese.

00:17:51.932 --> 00:17:54.207
And this one is a beauty also.

00:17:54.207 --> 00:17:56.801
This one is the smoked
sardines with red pepper,

00:17:56.801 --> 00:17:59.191
and then yeah, I'm not sure
what that is on the top,

00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:02.134
and then a green pepper on the top.

00:18:02.134 --> 00:18:05.634
This one is a little bit hard to navigate.

00:18:14.504 --> 00:18:15.752
Mmm.

00:18:15.752 --> 00:18:16.585
Mmm.

00:18:17.771 --> 00:18:19.642
I love sardines.

00:18:19.642 --> 00:18:23.062
Yeah, that chili that I ate
is really, really sour as well

00:18:23.062 --> 00:18:24.812
like a pickled chili.

00:18:31.834 --> 00:18:33.046
That was amazing.

00:18:33.046 --> 00:18:36.126
That was another wonderful
tapas experience in Barcelona,

00:18:36.126 --> 00:18:38.913
and we got there literally
just before they closed.

00:18:38.913 --> 00:18:41.090
As I was taking my last bite of tapa,

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.999
it closed the doors, and
closed for the afternoon

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.185
so I'm glad we made it.

00:18:46.185 --> 00:18:48.646
That literally gives a new meaning,

00:18:48.646 --> 00:18:51.967
or breathe this new
life into canned foods.

00:18:51.967 --> 00:18:54.146
All of those little
toppings are from cans,

00:18:54.146 --> 00:18:56.805
and they were so good, such high quality,

00:18:56.805 --> 00:18:59.213
and also the way he made them,

00:18:59.213 --> 00:19:00.985
just the different combinations,

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:04.981
simple but delicious, and he
just seasoned them perfectly.

00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:06.898
I like how nothing was too salty

00:19:06.898 --> 00:19:09.396
but just had a fantastic seasoning.

00:19:09.396 --> 00:19:11.896
(light music)

00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:16.001
We just got off the metro
at Diagonal station,

00:19:16.001 --> 00:19:19.488
and we are walking over to Casa Mila,

00:19:19.488 --> 00:19:21.909
which is also known as La Pedrera.

00:19:21.909 --> 00:19:24.409
(light music)

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.003
Last night, I already bought two tickets

00:19:29.003 --> 00:19:32.086
to two famous houses by Antoni Gaudi,

00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:36.015
and so the first we're
gonna visit is La Pedrera,

00:19:36.015 --> 00:19:38.542
which is also known as Casa Mila,

00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:40.942
and then after that,
we'll go to the next one.

00:19:40.942 --> 00:19:43.442
(light music)

00:19:52.847 --> 00:19:55.367
They also gave us the audio guide,

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:59.109
and this is a building
designed by Antoni Gaudi.

00:19:59.109 --> 00:20:02.026
It was built between 1906 and 1912.

00:20:03.387 --> 00:20:05.124
I just got my audio tour,

00:20:05.124 --> 00:20:07.980
and I think I'm gonna need
to put my bag in the locker,

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.471
and then we are gonna
explore this building.

00:20:10.471 --> 00:20:12.971
(light music)

00:20:14.198 --> 00:20:16.852
We are in the elevator
going to the top first.

00:20:16.852 --> 00:20:19.352
(light music)

00:20:26.994 --> 00:20:28.936
The first thing you do is
you get in the elevator,

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:30.924
and take it all the way to the rooftop.

00:20:30.924 --> 00:20:33.424
(light music)

00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:53.066
This rooftop is extremely
interesting and very peculiar,

00:20:53.066 --> 00:20:56.270
and on the audio guide,
they were mentioning

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.184
that it feels like a
completely different world

00:20:59.184 --> 00:21:00.519
when you are up here,

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:02.681
kind of like a fairy tale land up here.

00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:06.947
Gaudi did not create
anything just for looks

00:21:06.947 --> 00:21:11.057
despite his appeal of things
that looked beautiful.

00:21:11.057 --> 00:21:12.697
He also had a purpose for everything,

00:21:12.697 --> 00:21:16.945
and so all of these spires,
they are all different chimneys.

00:21:16.945 --> 00:21:19.445
(light music)

00:21:34.629 --> 00:21:38.046
We're now walking down to the next level.

00:21:39.349 --> 00:21:41.155
Here's something that's really interesting

00:21:41.155 --> 00:21:42.428
that I just learned.

00:21:42.428 --> 00:21:46.595
Gaudi for his designs, he
would hang chains and strings,

00:21:47.863 --> 00:21:51.581
and hang them down, and then
there is a mirror below here.

00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:54.323
You can see that when it's reflected,

00:21:54.323 --> 00:21:58.642
it looks like the building,
and you can see the arches,

00:21:58.642 --> 00:22:02.505
and how they work, and how
they are geometrically correct

00:22:02.505 --> 00:22:04.652
so hanging models that Gaudi used

00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:07.537
are called stereofunicular models,

00:22:07.537 --> 00:22:09.844
and he was not only an architect

00:22:09.844 --> 00:22:12.511
but he was a genius at geometry.

00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:15.859
We just came down a flight of stairs,

00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:18.859
and now entering into The Apartment.

00:22:29.461 --> 00:22:31.631
Again, just like Sagrada Familia,

00:22:31.631 --> 00:22:35.542
I love how Antoni Gaudi
used natural light.

00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:38.068
There is light coming in through windows,

00:22:38.068 --> 00:22:40.260
and little pockets of light

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.866
shining throughout this entire apartment,

00:22:42.866 --> 00:22:47.033
and also the way he just had
this incredible sense of space,

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.180
and also waves.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.295
This house is very wavy.

00:22:52.295 --> 00:22:53.580
There are lots of curves

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.232
but it all really somehow
just fits together.

00:22:57.232 --> 00:22:59.149
Oh here is the kitchen.

00:23:03.294 --> 00:23:04.461
Very spacious.

00:23:12.271 --> 00:23:14.312
Something else about Casa Mila

00:23:14.312 --> 00:23:17.746
is that it is a UNESCO
World Heritage Site,

00:23:17.746 --> 00:23:19.609
and it's just an iconic building

00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:24.094
but only a little portion
of it is open as a museum,

00:23:24.094 --> 00:23:26.698
and there are other apartments within it

00:23:26.698 --> 00:23:30.783
that are still used, and that
people still live in today

00:23:30.783 --> 00:23:33.717
so it's not only a museum
but it's a living museum,

00:23:33.717 --> 00:23:36.195
and it's a natural residence.

00:23:36.195 --> 00:23:39.804
What I liked about this is
that it provided a glimpse

00:23:39.804 --> 00:23:41.858
about how Gaudi was thinking,

00:23:41.858 --> 00:23:45.673
and his kind of imagination
or thought process

00:23:45.673 --> 00:23:50.285
into his designs, at least
just a little, tiny glimpse.

00:23:50.285 --> 00:23:52.546
We are now walking down the street

00:23:52.546 --> 00:23:55.646
on our way to the next Antoni Gaudi house.

00:23:55.646 --> 00:23:58.146
(light music)

00:24:11.749 --> 00:24:16.183
Just entered into Casa
Batllo, and this is a house,

00:24:16.183 --> 00:24:20.350
a previous house that was
remodeled by Antoni Gaudi in 1904.

00:24:25.183 --> 00:24:27.395
What's really cool about
this audio guide this time

00:24:27.395 --> 00:24:29.463
is that you have this.

00:24:29.463 --> 00:24:32.412
It looks like a smartphone but 360 video,

00:24:32.412 --> 00:24:35.811
and so you can turn it around the room.

00:24:35.811 --> 00:24:37.523
Oh I'm upside down right now

00:24:37.523 --> 00:24:39.433
but you can turn it around the room,

00:24:39.433 --> 00:24:41.994
and you can see the
different design elements

00:24:41.994 --> 00:24:45.105
within the room, within
the cellphone window,

00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:46.520
or within the screen.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.353
One of the things in this room

00:24:47.353 --> 00:24:49.336
is that there is a ventilation system,

00:24:49.336 --> 00:24:52.804
and they think that possibly
he got the inspiration

00:24:52.804 --> 00:24:54.137
from fish gills.

00:24:55.582 --> 00:24:58.909
And this window opens
and closes like this.

00:24:58.909 --> 00:25:00.702
Yeah, kind of like fish gills.

00:25:00.702 --> 00:25:03.202
(light music)

00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:14.260
I have never seen a fireplace like that.

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.760
(light music)

00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:19.393
I have climbed up.

00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:22.707
I am approaching the top of Casa Batllo,

00:25:22.707 --> 00:25:24.865
and it's still amazing to me

00:25:24.865 --> 00:25:28.095
how Antoni Gaudi used natural light

00:25:28.095 --> 00:25:31.790
even in buildings that seemed
like they should be enclosed,

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.957
he found a way to incorporate
light into his designs.

00:25:39.014 --> 00:25:41.270
I just made it up onto the roof.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.770
(light music)

00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:00.816
If there weren't signs to
direct you where to go,

00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:02.615
you could definitely get lost.

00:26:02.615 --> 00:26:05.828
It's like a maze within
this whole complex,

00:26:05.828 --> 00:26:08.791
and on the roof, and in the attic area.

00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:10.054
I am heading down now.

00:26:10.054 --> 00:26:11.150
What struck me about that

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.172
is just his acute
attention to fine details,

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:17.292
and how he thought through
every single thing,

00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:20.348
as well as the natural light,
the space, the windows.

00:26:20.348 --> 00:26:22.119
After going to Casa Batllo,

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:24.134
we ended up just coming back to the hotel.

00:26:24.134 --> 00:26:25.645
Ying wasn't feeling so good,

00:26:25.645 --> 00:26:28.685
and we've been having really,
really long days everyday

00:26:28.685 --> 00:26:30.218
so we're both really tired

00:26:30.218 --> 00:26:32.214
so we're just gonna call it a day here,

00:26:32.214 --> 00:26:35.079
and just have some small
snacks for dinner tonight

00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:38.040
in the hotel but before I end the vlog,

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.554
I did want to address one thing,

00:26:39.554 --> 00:26:41.839
and that is whether it's worth it.

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:45.083
Which one to choose between Casa Batllo

00:26:45.083 --> 00:26:47.250
and Casa Mila, La Pedrera?

00:26:49.328 --> 00:26:52.948
And they're two similar
buildings by Antoni Gaudi,

00:26:52.948 --> 00:26:56.225
and they're both famous attractions.

00:26:56.225 --> 00:26:57.924
They both have some similarities.

00:26:57.924 --> 00:27:00.131
If I were to choose just one,

00:27:00.131 --> 00:27:03.324
I would probably go with Casa Mila

00:27:03.324 --> 00:27:05.280
mainly because I really enjoyed seeing

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:07.021
the apartment furnished,

00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:10.967
and also I thought the roof was the best

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:14.833
but in reality, they are
both different enough

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:17.068
that they are worth it to visit both,

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:20.818
however the entrance
prices are pretty steep,

00:27:21.891 --> 00:27:25.038
pretty expensive so if I
were to just choose one,

00:27:25.038 --> 00:27:26.700
I would go with Casa Mila.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.297
So that being said, I'm gonna
end the vlog for today now.

00:27:30.297 --> 00:27:32.351
Thank you all very much for watching.

00:27:32.351 --> 00:27:33.988
Please remember to give
this video a thumbs up

00:27:33.988 --> 00:27:37.020
if you enjoyed it, and also
make sure you subscribe

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.054
if you're not already, and I
will see you on the next video.

00:27:41.054 --> 00:27:42.647
Thank you for watching.

00:27:42.647 --> 00:27:43.534
That.

00:27:43.534 --> 00:27:48.504
Oh there's like a moth that
just landed on my nose.

00:27:48.504 --> 00:27:49.671
What happened?

00:27:52.524 --> 00:27:53.998
Did I get caviar on my nose?

00:27:53.998 --> 00:27:56.094
(Ying laughs)

00:27:56.094 --> 00:27:58.237
The hanging models that Gaudi used

00:27:58.237 --> 00:28:01.070
are called steri, stereofunicular.
