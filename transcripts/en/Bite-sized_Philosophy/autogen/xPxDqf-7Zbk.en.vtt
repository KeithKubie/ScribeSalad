what would you say that in as an analog
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.429
what would you say that in as an analog
to the self authoring suite is that we

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
to the self authoring suite is that we

actually provide an answer
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.650
actually provide an answer
to this question in a more comprehensive

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660
to this question in a more comprehensive
 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.740
to this question in a more comprehensive
manner is it imagine that if you want to

there's a lot of things that you need to

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
there's a lot of things that you need to
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.040
there's a lot of things that you need to
get straight and you either do that by

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050
get straight and you either do that by
 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.040
get straight and you either do that by
bringing your unconscious assumptions to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050
bringing your unconscious assumptions to
 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.420
bringing your unconscious assumptions to
bear on the situation and perhaps

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
bear on the situation and perhaps
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.780
bear on the situation and perhaps
clashing where they don't match or you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790
clashing where they don't match or you
 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.900
clashing where they don't match or you
sit down like a conscious and aware and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910
sit down like a conscious and aware and
 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.960
sit down like a conscious and aware and
articulate couple and start to negotiate

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
what your joint responsibilities are
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.570
what your joint responsibilities are
going to be and so that would be well

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
going to be and so that would be well
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.340
going to be and so that would be well
who's responsible for the meals and when

which part of what household chores
 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.250
which part of what household chores
there are to do and how is that going to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260
there are to do and how is that going to
 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.370
there are to do and how is that going to
be laid out fair and so you should get

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380
be laid out fair and so you should get
 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.949
be laid out fair and so you should get
to know you should get to know the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
to know you should get to know the
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.560
to know you should get to know the
person that you're with well enough so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570
person that you're with well enough so
 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.570
person that you're with well enough so
that you can start discussing the real

that you can start discussing the real
 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.660
that you can start discussing the real
practical issues of life and determine

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670
practical issues of life and determine
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.030
practical issues of life and determine
whether or not you're capable of

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
whether or not you're capable of
 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.890
whether or not you're capable of
negotiating that and I don't think that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900
negotiating that and I don't think that
 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.199
negotiating that and I don't think that
necessarily means that you should live

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209
necessarily means that you should live
 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.970
necessarily means that you should live
together because the evidence is

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980
together because the evidence is
 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.670
together because the evidence is
actually quite strong at least the last

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680
actually quite strong at least the last
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.740
actually quite strong at least the last
time I looked at people who live

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750
time I looked at people who live
 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.509
time I looked at people who live
together are more rather than less

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519
together are more rather than less
 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.610
together are more rather than less
likely to be divorced now that might be

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
likely to be divorced now that might be
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.229
likely to be divorced now that might be
that might have nothing to do with the

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
that might have nothing to do with the
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.910
that might have nothing to do with the
actual act of living together it might

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920
actual act of living together it might
 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.590
actual act of living together it might
be that people who are more likely to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600
be that people who are more likely to
 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.390
be that people who are more likely to
get divorced or also those who are more

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400
get divorced or also those who are more
 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.100
get divorced or also those who are more
likely to merely live together but I

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110
likely to merely live together but I
 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.660
likely to merely live together but I
don't think that's a great solution for

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670
don't think that's a great solution for
 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.229
don't think that's a great solution for
reasons I won't get into now and with

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239
reasons I won't get into now and with
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.420
reasons I won't get into now and with
regards to being shackled together is

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430
regards to being shackled together is
 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.060
regards to being shackled together is
that that's a complicated one and and I

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070
that that's a complicated one and and I
 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.470
that that's a complicated one and and I
learned this at least in part from

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480
