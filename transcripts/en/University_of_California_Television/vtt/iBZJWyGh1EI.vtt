(upbeat synth music)

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.800
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.870
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.970
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.570
Our guest today is Richard C. Lewontin,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.430
who is the Alexander
Agassiz Research Professor

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.100
at Harvard University.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.580
An evolutionary geneticist
and social critic,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.970
his publications include Human
Diversity and most recently,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.200
The Triple Helix: Gene,
Organism, and Environment.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.440
He is visiting the Berkeley campus

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.730
to deliver the Charles M.
and Martha Hitchcock Lectures

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.563
on the campus.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.595
Welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:05.777
- Thank you very much, Harry.

00:01:05.777 --> 00:01:08.690
- What drew you into the sciences?

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.838
- A charismatic high school teacher.

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.200
- Uh-huh.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.820
- I was a student at a public
high school in New York,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940
a new public high school that catered

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.040
to a primarily middle
class suburban community,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
and we had there a science
teacher who people idolized.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.027
And he drew a number of people,

00:01:27.027 --> 00:01:28.606
and a lot of people in the science,

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:31.210
a number of people who
teach here and so on.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.230
And in fact the group
of his former students

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.230
is now putting together a
kind of collected remembrance

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.943
and textbook on how to be a
charismatic science teacher.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.440
- And looking back, now
we're moving from high school

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.750
into your academic career,
who were your main intellects?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.180
Was there any particular
intellectual mentor

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.720
that stands out?

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.799
- Well, mentor doesn't do the job so well

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.373
- What is the better word?
- as opponent.

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:01.360
- Okay. (laughs)

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.720
Who is your best science...

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.100
- My professor, who supervised my PhD,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.890
again, supervised not the right word,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.860
he was my professor for PhD,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.860
was the leading evolutionary
geneticist of the time,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.680
Theodosius Dobzhansky.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.450
Again, a very charismatic
person with a thick accent

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.480
and a very lively way
of dealing with people.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.830
And he and I spent the
three years of my PhD

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.340
fighting with each other about everything.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.760
And he liked that and I liked it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.870
- So does that tell us
something about scientists

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.710
and how great work gets done?

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.830
It's through the fights?

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.496
- Well, I didn't say great work was done.

00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:42.096
(Harry laughs)
I just said I...

00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:47.890
No, that doesn't tell
us much because in fact,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.420
most professors who have a lot of students

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.240
don't like to fight with them.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.660
But some do, and I
think he liked it a lot,

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.070
although he would make fun of it.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.780
But conflict and struggle is
very common in academic life,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.573
especially between professionals.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.670
Everybody is crazy except you, of course.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.980
- Now you were an evolutionary geneticist

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.490
and most people in our audience

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.260
probably wouldn't know what that is.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.093
What is it?

00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:21.100
What do you do?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.390
- The process of evolution
requires three things.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.120
It requires that there be
differences among individuals

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.070
within a species in
various characteristics,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.500
that those differences
be inherited in some way,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.940
because otherwise every generation

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.030
would go back to where
things started from,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.720
and then requires some
differential rate of reproduction

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.930
of the different kinds.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.100
The evolutionary geneticist is the person

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.040
who devotes him or herself
to the actual mechanics

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.780
of the changes and the
frequencies of different kinds

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.603
of genetic properties.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.030
Why is it, for example,
that all human populations

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.500
have blood groups A, B, and O?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.270
Why isn't everybody A or
why isn't everybody B?

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.990
So the explanation of
the genetic variation

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.890
of how that changes in time,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.010
of how natural selection changes.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.290
We are, if you want to put it crudely,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.233
the auto mechanics of
evolutionary biology.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.140
We try to work with the machinery

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.160
and how it actually operates
at the genetic level.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.800
- Now in the introduction to
you at your Hitchcock lecture

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.480
it was said that you introduced the study

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.150
of molecular population
genetics over two decades ago.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.390
So what is involved in being
present at the creation?

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.289
- God, it's four decades ago, actually.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.122
- Four decades ago.

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:44.921
- They said two, but it's four.

00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:46.360
It was 1966.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.643
- Well, we try to cover up
how old we're all getting.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.500
- I'm afraid I am old.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.333
- (laughs) Yeah.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.870
- Well, the problem when
I was a graduate student,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.810
and for many years before
that was that nobody knew,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.610
you wanted to be an
evolutionary geneticist,

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.340
then you had to be able
to talk about genes.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.340
But nobody knew how to detect
whether a particular gene

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.960
was variable or a
constant in a population,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.610
because nobody knew how to
identify individual genes.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.720
Nobody's ever found the genes
for skin color, for example,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.150
or the genes for height or for weight

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.700
in people or any other organism.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.620
So for years people worried about,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.490
how is it possible for us to count up

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.840
the number of individuals who
have that form of the gene

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.530
as opposed to that form if
we can't work with the genes?

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.703
This was before DNA.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.290
And I worried about that a lot

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.700
when I was a graduate student,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.900
and for a few years after that.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.750
And I constructed in my head

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.833
the kind of scheme you would
have to have to do that,

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.530
but I didn't know how to do it.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.363
And then one day I went

00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:55.580
and visited the University of Chicago,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.480
and there was a guy there, Jack Hubby,

00:05:58.353 --> 00:06:00.470
who was grinding up fruit flies

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.320
and extracting their proteins,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.070
and every one of those proteins

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.920
corresponded to the coding
product of one gene.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.710
And then if two species
had a different gene form,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.220
the proteins would move
slightly differently

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.340
in an electric field,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.290
and I thought, this is
the answer to my problem.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.850
So I moved to the University of Chicago

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.900
and here was Jack with a technique

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.870
but no particular problem to apply it to.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.940
Here was me with a
problem with no technique.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.030
And so we merged together

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.290
and applied his technique to the problem

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.140
of measuring genetic variation,
diversity in populations.

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.150
And the beauty of that technique

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.330
was you could do it with
any kind of organism:

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.400
plants, animals, people.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.250
If they were little animals like insects,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.083
you'd grind them up.

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:50.020
If they were bigger animals
you'd take some blood.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.900
If they were people you'd take some blood.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.760
You could then characterize
at the genetic level

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.520
the genetic variation in
any species in the world.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.550
And that's what we did.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.460
That's really what
started molecular studies

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.773
of genetic variation and evolution.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.483
And then later on,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.580
Martin Kreitman, who
was a graduate student

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.960
in our lab in Harvard, moved
that from the protein level

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.160
to the DNA level, and he did
the same thing at the DNA level

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.690
that we had done at the protein level.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.960
- So does that experience tell us anything

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.550
about creativity in the sciences?

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.100
I mean, is it taking--
- Yeah, it tells us that...

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.970
Not enough credit is given to the effect

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.130
of talking to other people
and dealing with other people.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.990
There's too much emphasis
on the great creative act

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.513
of the great mind, and it's not like that.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.590
I mean, I repeat: here
I was with a problem

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.730
looking for a solution.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.940
Here a guy was with a solution
looking for a problem.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.253
And we got together.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:02.410
Many times, many of the things
we did in our lab in Chicago

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.170
arose in the course of a conversation

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.000
with somebody who came in.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.720
We would have weekly talks at lunch.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.113
People would come from all over the world

00:08:11.113 --> 00:08:12.500
that would happen to be in town,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.320
would come and give a
talk about what they did.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.250
And we'd have a big conversation
among the graduate students

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.130
and the post-doctoral fellows
and me and other people.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.620
And in the course of that,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.420
someone would say something
that would trigger an idea

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.510
and someone would go off and do it.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.960
And the graduate students
and post-doctoral fellows

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.740
and visitors and I all
contributed to that in a way

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.270
that is impossible for me in
retrospect to disentangle.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.680
I can't tell you who got the idea for that

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.760
and who got the idea for that.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.730
The ideas are out there,
and social interaction

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.190
is really important in science, I think.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.423
- And you're suggesting the
importance of the community

00:08:51.423 --> 00:08:52.883
of scientists as opposed to--
- Oh yeah.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:55.983
But I really mean community.

00:08:57.358 --> 00:08:59.120
I don't mean the collection of scientists,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.030
because scientists as a
whole don't form a community.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:05.740
I mean, when we moved
to Chicago from Harvard,

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.070
I came with four graduate students,

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.420
I think that was it,
four graduate students,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.970
and we had the opportunity
to design our own space

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.600
because it was in a new building.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.850
We were given a whole
floor in that building.

00:09:18.201 --> 00:09:20.830
And so we designed the space in such a way

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.760
that everybody's office
opened out into a central room

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.630
where there was a big
table and blackboards

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.150
and computers and the
labs were down the hall.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.090
You couldn't go to your office

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.250
without actually walking
through the laboratory,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.940
not just past it, but through it.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.310
There were no doors.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.070
Everybody at your office had a door,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.350
but everybody had a key to it,

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.500
and people spent a lot of
time sitting in that space

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.090
shooting the bull.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.760
Or in the lab they were facing each other.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.050
Nobody had this private
space, and that included me.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.940
And the consequence is that we had

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.920
a very active community of people,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.270
and eventually the thing
grew within a few years

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.860
to 25 people, which went on for 30 years.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.603
And everybody participated.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.640
It was a real community.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.050
And now I wanna say something
scientific political.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.210
- Okay, please!

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:11.060
- And that is that an important part

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:16.060
of that sense of
community was the, I hope,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.490
I believe it's true, the
feeling that the professor

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.670
did not have property rights over the work

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.080
of the professor's students.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.540
I never in my life put my name on a paper

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.470
which I didn't actually work on.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.700
I mean in the lab or computer analysis

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.853
or something like that.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.543
I just thought that was wrong.

00:10:43.966 --> 00:10:45.670
Some people think it's a great thing,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.290
because it helps the
student because it brings

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.420
the student's paper to the
attention of other people

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.390
because a well-known
person's name is on it.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.540
I think it's nonsense.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.240
What it really is property rights.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.950
You can say, well I published 573 papers,

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.990
but you're of course the
last author on the paper

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.340
and you didn't do anything.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.050
It's taking credit for
other people's work,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.590
and I think the community worked

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.540
because people knew that whatever they did

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.430
they would get credit for.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.750
- Which opens up another line of inquiry

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.710
that I wanna get into before we talk

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.960
about the whole question of
the public's consciousness

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.060
of science and the politics of science.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.860
And that is you're known as,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.900
and have been for quite
a while, a social critic,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.790
a commentator on science,

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.690
somebody who's also been an activist.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.390
When you were at Chicago you were involved

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.233
in a lot of the protests and so on.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.900
What is it about that, how
did you come to that role,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.170
let me ask you first of all,

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:51.073
and then how does it relate
to your role as a scientist?

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.990
- How did I come to it?

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.200
Harry, I'm not sure I know
the answer to that question.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.350
I mean, I was politically
active as a student

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:01.900
as an undergraduate at Harvard.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.510
My father warned me not to
get into political issues

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:07.150
because it wouldn't be good for me,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.047
but I didn't pay attention to him

00:12:09.047 --> 00:12:11.093
and I got involved to a certain extent.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.790
When I was a professor at...

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.863
At Rochester,

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.530
my wife and I and Bob Fogel the economist

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:24.360
and his wife sat in at a police station

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.220
because of the first incidence

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.550
of police brutality against black people.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.440
Man, that was the way our lives went.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.780
When wife and I were in school together,

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.960
we were in high school together,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.560
we were part of a...

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.870
Of an organized political group
that the students organized

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.053
called The World We Want.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.740
Man, that was just part of life.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.080
I can't put it any more clearly than that.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.750
- So then how has that consciousness

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.270
informed your role as a scientist?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.290
Has it?

00:12:58.290 --> 00:12:59.443
- Well, sure it has.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.640
In fact, my wife was just
saying to me yesterday,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.810
I was talking with a
colleague about some work

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.720
I was doing on ants and ant behavior,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.040
and a woman came up from
Stanford to talk to me about it.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.313
And when my colleague
left, Mary Jane said to me,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.840
why do you really wanna do that?

00:13:20.003 --> 00:13:22.870
Why does anybody want to
study the behavior of ants?

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.520
What's it got to do with
anything that we care about?

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.770
And we started to talk about that issue,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.190
which is, what is the motivation

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.803
for academic life in general?

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.480
And a great deal of what I do

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:40.410
is pretty academic, if
I may put it that way.

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.230
The fact of the matter
is that as academics,

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.240
we are supported by society
in a pretty nice way.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.963
We have security and so on.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:55.340
The claim is that intellectual
life has a value of its own.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:14:00.180
But my development has
been such as to believe

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.270
that what you do, I mean, sure,
you have to make a living,

00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:06.700
but to make a claim on the public purse,

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.700
to make a claim on the
resources of society,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.620
you have to do more than say,

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.380
I just want to satisfy my
intellectual curiosity.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.580
I mean, that's a kind
of mental masturbation

00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:27.143
that is not self-justifying
as far as I'm concerned.

00:14:28.987 --> 00:14:31.230
You have to do political things,

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.850
at least I have to do political things.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.150
And then there's the
question of the relationship,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.650
so you could turn it upside down,

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.280
say, well, why bother to do science then?

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.380
And that's A, because I
like it, I agree to that,

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.780
but also because it
provides me with legitimacy.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.620
Legitimacy is very important,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.620
and even the most prominent
and world-famous scientists,

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.750
when they lose their
legitimacy as scientists,

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.853
they also lose their legitimacy
as social commentators.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.453
That certainly happened to Linus Pauling.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.790
When he stopped being
a productive scientist

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.260
and went off and talked
about other things,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.700
people turned off their hearing aid,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.850
because why should I listen to him?

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.050
And look, I write a lot of public stuff.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.570
I write for The New York Review of Books.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:27.580
I write books about
things related to science,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.310
but social things.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.160
And I've made a promise to
myself and I hope I can keep it,

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.240
and that is that the day

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.130
I stop doing any technical
science of any kind,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.520
I'm gonna quit writing anything,

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.710
because nothing is easier than to say,

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:43.733
oh, well that guy, he can't
be a scientist anymore.

00:15:45.122 --> 00:15:47.990
He's over the hill and
he just writes this stuff

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.750
because he doesn't know what else to do.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.100
And therefore it's useless.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.740
You must have legitimacy.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.510
And so my scientific work
gives me that legitimacy.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.780
- And as I, in preparation
for this interview,

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.710
read some of your papers

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.710
about politics and science
and so on, I was struck that,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:10.410
it seems to me, I'm not an expert on this,

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:14.540
but that your science informs

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.973
the way you do your analysis.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.300
It's not the theory
behind it, so to speak,

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.070
but rather it helps you bring
clarity to some of the issues

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.550
because in a number of the
papers that I looked at,

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.643
you seemed to be faulting
both sides of the debate.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.960
- You raise a very important point, Harry.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.510
A book which people
don't know much anymore,

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.350
which was very well known

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.350
around the time of the Second World War,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:52.050
by a French sociologist and
historian, Julien Benda,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.860
was called La Trahison des Clercs,

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.110
The Treason of the Intellectuals.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.810
And what Benda was saying
is that intellectuals,

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:03.350
who are supposed to be
committed to a careful, logical,

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.650
rational analysis,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.700
would commit treason against that

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.450
in the interest of
pushing a social agenda,

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.840
even when that meant saying
things that weren't true

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.490
or claiming things were true

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.290
that they didn't know to be true,

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.370
or even things to be true
which they knew not to be true.

00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:23.170
An important difference, by the way.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.350
And that is uppermost
in my mind all the time.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:30.040
For example, there's a struggle

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.470
about so-called genetically
manipulated organisms,

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.250
or GM foods and so on.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.480
Now one might have a number of reasons

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.023
for opposing that particular technology.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.920
To the extent that I oppose it,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.483
it has nothing to do
with dangers to health,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.500
of which there's no evidence.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.423
And yet I see people writing,

00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:01.340
making claims which might support

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.660
the public position I wanna
take on a political issue,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.533
but using pseudoscientific claims

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.240
and their own legitimacy as scientists

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.810
to tell what come to lies.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.910
I mean, I have to tell you,

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.490
when I was thinking
about the GM food thing,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.470
I read the works of a
woman, Vandana Shiva,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.300
who is an extremely important
writer in this field,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.110
who has a PhD in physics,
so she's a scientist,

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.320
and one thing, I'll give
you a specific example,

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.180
one thing I read, Shiva said,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:38.180
do you realize that when
infants eat baby food,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.590
they are getting eight
times the dose of estrogen

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.550
that a woman gets when she
takes her contraceptive pill?

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.260
I thought, my god, how terrible!

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.040
That a little baby will get
eight times the dose of estrogen

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.370
that an adult woman gets

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.790
when she takes a contraceptive pill?

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.610
So I went to look at the paper she cited.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.960
Well, yes, it's true.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.200
They are getting eight
times the dose of a thing.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.930
But it turns out not to be
physiologically active estrogen.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.580
It turns out to have only 1/1000

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.890
of the physiological
activity that estrogen has.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:18.740
It's a thing called a plant estrogen.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.993
And she played on the word estrogen.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.850
Now, she must have known
the truth of the matter,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:28.070
because she cited the paper
from which she got the data.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:32.090
But she would presumably
regard that as a justifiable,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.740
I would call it a lie, she
would say something else,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.250
in the interests of the greater good.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.760
And I think we cannot put up with that.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.350
Because in the end, it will be detected,

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:43.930
it will make people cynical,

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.580
and it will be counterproductive.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.150
- And in some ways

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:49.950
in the papers that I read,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:54.880
you bring out that it happens
on all sides, basically.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.840
- Oh yeah.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.720
- You did a review, I think,
of the Shapiro commission

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.830
on bioethics, I think.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.470
And they, to deal with
the political problem,

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.723
not the science problem,

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:14.020
seemed to legitimate some
of the religious concerns,

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.350
I think it was.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.400
In other words, there was
an appendix to the report

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.490
that was making part of the discussion

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.310
something that really
had no basis in science.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:26.673
- Well, not only that,

00:20:26.673 --> 00:20:27.900
that was a political issue,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.200
but what was so interesting

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.160
is they interviewed Catholic
priests, Jewish rabbis,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.160
and some liberal Protestants,
and when I questioned

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.460
why they brought in
those religious people,

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.293
they said, well, after all,

00:20:41.293 --> 00:20:43.720
religion's a very important
part of our society,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.020
and they made a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.710
So then I said, okay,

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.890
then why didn't you
bring in Pat Robertson?

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.400
His constituency is a great deal larger

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.584
than the constituents
of the people you did.

00:20:54.584 --> 00:20:55.990
They had no answer to that.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.823
The fact of the matter

00:20:56.823 --> 00:20:59.700
is they didn't wanna bring
in fundamentalist Christians

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.000
because they would rock the boat too much.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.810
But if your real excuse is
that you want to understand

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.470
where people are coming
from and you want an input

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.150
from the public based on religion

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:12.030
in order to make this political decision,

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.020
then why are you avoiding the very people

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.410
who are the most vocal, the
most politically active,

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.410
and represent a large fraction
of American religious people?

00:21:22.222 --> 00:21:24.190
And the answer was clear,

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.103
that to bring in Pat
Robertson was too dangerous,

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.190
and that he would just
upset the applecart.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.140
- Now, let's pursue this,

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.780
because I believe in
the introduction to you

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.730
they pointed out that you joined

00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:43.130
the National Academy of Science
in such-and-such a year,

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.520
and then I believe they said
you resigned from the Academy

00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:48.690
a few years later.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.648
- Yeah, about three years later.

00:21:50.648 --> 00:21:53.400
- Was that for scientific reasons

00:21:54.511 --> 00:21:58.540
or was that in your role as social critic?

00:21:58.540 --> 00:21:59.830
- It was in the latter,

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.520
but also, to put it even more stuffily,

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.203
it had to do with personal integrity.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.940
All scientists in the United States

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.350
wanna be members of the National Academy.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.750
That's big stuff.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.253
So here I was, elected
to the National Academy.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:20.133
I felt wonderful.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.220
And then I discovered
that, among other things,

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.260
the National Academy,
through its operating arm

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:26.760
the National Research Council,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.230
had committees doing secret war research.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.820
It was so secret that as a
member of the National Academy,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.650
which is the responsible body,
as a member of that body,

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.130
I was not only not allowed
to know what they were doing,

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.980
I wasn't even allowed to know
the title of the research.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.300
So at the second meeting
I went to, I guess,

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.020
I got up and said, look.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.410
I can't be responsible for
work other people are doing

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.410
and not even know what it is.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.570
And I think you must stop this.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.990
And if you don't stop it, I
have to resign from the Academy.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.030
I refuse to take responsibility.

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.510
Well, of course being a
political organization

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.640
which is almost quasi-governmental,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.220
the National Academy board
was not about to refuse

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:13.160
the Department of Defense and
the military establishment.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.883
So they refused, so I left.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.090
But that was the proximal reason.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.130
The greater reason was that...

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.360
I realized around that time

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.580
that the existence of a thing

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.950
called the National Academy of Science

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:29.840
as an honorary organization

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:34.510
to which every scientist wants to aspire

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.333
is really destructive
of intellectual life.

00:23:40.334 --> 00:23:44.273
That whole notion of the
chief motivating element

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.420
being prizes, honorary
degrees, personal prestige,

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.163
memberships in academies,
that really turned me off.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.620
That happened at a time

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.440
when I was particularly politically active

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.920
in the movements of the '60s and so on,

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.880
and it was just a contradiction
I couldn't deal with.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.420
So I had no choice but to resign.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.700
- Now this leads to an
interesting question,

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.910
which is the role of government

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.000
in science after World War Two.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.583
You've written about this.

00:24:20.845 --> 00:24:21.678
It in a way was central

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.630
to fulfilling the requirements of society

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.860
and to get around the problem

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.450
that you were talking about earlier,

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.207
namely, the kind of people
you need to do science,

00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:40.610
the kind of capital investment you need,

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.450
that really, society has to be doing it.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:45.673
Those investments have to be socialized.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.330
The private sector either
couldn't or wouldn't do it,

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.230
and one always had the problem

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.340
that the result would then be privatized.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.040
So this is a kind of recurring issue,

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.970
and I just want you to help us understand

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.780
how that process evolved
after World War Two.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.240
- Well, it evolved largely

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.193
through the efforts of Vannevar
Bush, as a matter of fact.

00:25:15.073 --> 00:25:16.460
- Who had been at Harvard, right?

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.293
Had he been there?

00:25:17.293 --> 00:25:18.126
- No, I don't think Vannevar Bush

00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:19.220
was ever at Harvard.
- Okay.

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.880
- He was at that time the head

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.180
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.260
He had been very important
in the war effort

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.960
in science and the war.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.440
And a report was written

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.560
for the president of the United States

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.870
called Science: The Endless Frontier,

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.870
which put in a strong bid for
government support of science,

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.500
of which there had been virtually none

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.900
before the Second World War.

00:25:46.928 --> 00:25:49.390
The importance of science
for national interests

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:54.033
was underlined by the atomic
bomb project and so on, radar.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.330
But private companies were not
gonna put money into science

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.120
because they have very
short investment horizons

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.640
and it has to be privatized and so on.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.740
So what Van Bush pushed
on the administration

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.810
was the idea that there should be

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.270
government support of science.

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.810
On the other hand, the word socialism

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.970
is a dirty word in the United States.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.390
So you couldn't socialize it.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.570
You had somehow to find a mechanism

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.450
by which public money
could be put into science,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.770
yet not appear to be some
kind of a socialistic scheme.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:33.350
And what was developed was at first

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.370
the National Science Foundation,

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:39.190
which the first time around
didn't get through Congress

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.100
because Congress said, what do you mean,

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.700
the National Science Foundation?

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.160
Am I as a Congressman gonna
be able to have an input

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.563
in what goes on here?

00:26:48.792 --> 00:26:50.130
Are you give away public
money to these guys

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:50.963
to do what they like?

00:26:50.963 --> 00:26:52.480
And it failed.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.780
But then, under Truman
they finally succeeded

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.170
and they got the National
Science Foundation created.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:00.980
And then the National Institutes of Health

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.750
began to have a huge input into science,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.010
the Atomic Energy Commission,
then called the...

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.130
Office of Energy Development or something,

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.070
and now it's the Department of Energy,

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.360
they put a lot of money into science.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.980
Some of my earliest work was supported

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.893
by what was then the AEC.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.570
Had nothing to do with atomic bombs

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.363
except very, very vaguely.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.860
And the way it worked was

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.760
that Congress appropriated
money for these institutions,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.220
but the decision about
how the money was spent

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.683
was left entirely in the
hands of academics themselves.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.640
The NIH gets a budget.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.450
The NSF gets a budget.

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:49.400
And then individual
professors, scientists,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.920
are recruited into Washington

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.820
onto committees which meet
three or four times a year

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.860
to review research proposals.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.660
And they say yes, you shall have some,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.350
no, you shall not have some.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.580
So what has happened is that
the scientific community

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.030
as a whole has gained control

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.680
over a piece of the public purse.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.990
Complete control, because it's we,

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.647
I mean, I served on these
committees for years,

00:28:12.647 --> 00:28:15.147
who decide who gets the
money and for what reason.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:16.863
The claim is, of course,

00:28:16.863 --> 00:28:19.360
that this is good for society in general.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.800
No one's ever proved that.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.870
I'm not sure you could demonstrate

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.520
that it benefited anybody in particular,

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.040
but it really worked to
the benefit, for example,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.320
of universities.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.380
A very large fraction
of university budgets

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:34.670
depend on this federal
input into research,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:37.420
and especially after Sputnik,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.230
the budgets expanded exponentially,

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.640
and the current state of universities,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.910
including the University
of California, Harvard,

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.400
state universities of all kinds,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.450
private universities,

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:52.460
the immense expansion in
the higher education sphere,

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.980
the immense expansion
in the number of people

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.330
who are in education, is all a consequence

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.390
of the money put in by
the federal government

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:03.850
and given over, I have to say given over

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.343
to the academics to spend as they wish.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.410
It's a very extraordinary phenomenon.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.430
- And you suggest in one of your pieces

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.920
that a vehicle

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:19.830
for getting around the ideological hangups

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:23.660
about doing this is the
need to fight a war,

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.170
and during the Cold
War it was really the--

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.750
- Absolutely, war is the way you do it.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.640
Scientists were given money to work

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.410
during the Second World
War because it was a war.

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:35.230
Then there was the Cold War.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.310
Then there was a war on cancer.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.163
Then there was the war on drugs.

00:29:44.581 --> 00:29:47.930
The rhetoric of war, over
and over and over again,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.450
justifies the expenditure of public monies

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.880
which in our ideology is not to be done

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.100
because that's socialism.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.913
So war replaces socialism.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.470
- It looked like there
wasn't a war to fight

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.730
after the end of the Cold War.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.050
But now we have the war
on television, television.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:09.380
The war on terrorism, sorry.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.650
The war on terrorism.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.453
So the question is ...

00:30:12.453 --> 00:30:14.460
- Yeah, but Harry--
- Yes?

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:19.460
- War became a word that was
separated from political wars.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.450
As I say, we had the war on cancer,

00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.493
the war on drugs.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:27.253
Those did the trick.

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:29.230
You don't have to have
the war on terrorism.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.417
- Okay, but we do have it.
- We do have it.

00:30:31.417 --> 00:30:33.100
- And what I'm curious about is,

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.100
do you think that the
particular threat posed,

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.940
the use of biological weapons, possibly,

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.370
by an adversary, do you think
that that will in any way

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.990
skew the kinds of research
that will be done,

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.653
or is there so much research going on

00:30:49.653 --> 00:30:51.650
that that won't happen?

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.380
- I don't see that it
will have any real effect

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.360
on the research community.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.890
Look, Camp Detrick and other institutions

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.700
had been doing biological
warfare research for years.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:02.770
They then shut it down

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.770
because of various treaties and so on.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.130
They can always start it up again.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:09.040
The amount of money spent
on that kind of stuff

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.170
is pretty small, as
compared to the total budget

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.030
of scientific research.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.160
So at the moment,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.510
I don't see that it will
have any effect, no.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.190
No, the kind of effect such wars have,

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:23.580
political wars, like the war on terrorism,

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.830
is to create a kind of security hysteria

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.530
in which people may have
to sign a loyalty oath

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.010
and that sort of thing.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.107
But as far as money is
concerned, no, I don't see it.

00:31:34.107 --> 00:31:39.107
- And you actually believe
that it often has not been,

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.890
in your particular, well it has not been

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.100
in your case that you
were denied research funds

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.180
because of your activities.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.602
In fact, it never happened.

00:31:46.602 --> 00:31:47.460
- Never happened, no.
- That in fact,

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:51.860
that the kind of the
McCarthyite atmosphere

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.460
that did exist in this Cold War period

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.540
was really the work of politicians,

00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:02.020
people on boards of regents and so on,

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.270
who used it as an occasion for advantage

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:08.930
or to go after people
to succeed politically.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.020
- Yes, individuals certainly suffered.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.150
I mean, there's no question about that.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.583
People lost their jobs.

00:32:16.962 --> 00:32:18.320
After the professors at the
University of California

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.110
swore loudly they would never
sign a loyalty oath, they did.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.740
They had no choice.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:28.530
But we don't live in a
totalitarian society,

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.143
and the system is very
inefficient in that sense.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.440
I, and other people

00:32:35.401 --> 00:32:38.030
who were deeply involved
in what were then regarded

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.400
as, I suppose, subversive activities,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.460
continued to get funded without cessation

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.190
from the Atomic Energy Commission,

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:48.170
from the National Science
Foundation, the NIH,

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:50.033
from the Office of Naval Research.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.900
The activities of McCarthy
severely hurt some people

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.900
and put a lot of psychological
stress on others.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.730
But it was very inefficient
as a way of denying support

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:09.030
to opponents of the
state, very inefficient.

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:11.990
Now, if we ever get
efficient enough to do that,

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.190
we really will be living
in a totalitarian state.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.203
So far that hasn't happened.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:21.010
- Do you think that the
profiling of students

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.400
because of their national origins,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.673
which seems to be part
of the agenda these days,

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:31.220
how will that impact
research, if it's implemented?

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.130
- It's very hard to know.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.430
Will they be denied entry
into the university?

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.360
Would you be prohibited from hiring them?

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.870
I don't know the answer.

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.363
During the Second World War,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.940
Japanese were very severely
hurt by that profiling.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.940
And curiously enough, German
refugees who had left Germany,

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.890
either because of political
or religious persecution,

00:33:56.890 --> 00:33:59.400
nevertheless were German nationals

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.940
and were restricted in their movement.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.726
My piano teacher, who taught
at the Curtis Institute

00:34:03.726 --> 00:34:06.870
in Philadelphia, had to
get special permission

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.640
to come up to New York
to teach his students

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.680
because he happened to be a German.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.210
He was a German Jew who had left Germany.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.280
So yes,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.720
it does make people's lives difficult.

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:22.260
And in some cases, it makes real hardship.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.523
People lose their jobs.

00:34:25.021 --> 00:34:26.160
It's evil stuff.

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.690
But to ask me whether
it has a mass effect,

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.720
I haven't seen the mass effect yet

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.420
and I don't know what to tell you.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.610
- When you were describing
what you do as a scientist,

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:42.640
one could see the difficulty

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:45.600
that the public might
have in understanding

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.100
what it is you do as a scientist.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.930
But in your writings, you're really saying

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:55.930
that more is going on in
the obfuscation of science

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:02.750
that is a part of the
landscape in the United States.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.680
I want you to help us understand

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.250
some of the social forces at work here.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:14.720
I think you're suggesting
that some of it requires

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:18.300
a kind of a political
or sociological analysis

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.950
of the community of scientists

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:24.900
and how they fit into
national society and so on.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.770
I know that you've written a lot

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.630
on the Human Genome Project,

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:33.630
and question both its goals
and the way it's presented.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.453
Help us understand that problem a little.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.940
- (laughs) Well, there are a
lot of dimensions to it, Harry,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.193
some of them quite specific
and some rather general.

00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.210
I don't know which to begin with.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:49.683
On the specific side,

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.010
genetics, in particular,

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.693
has for its entire history,

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.720
since the beginning of the 20th century,

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:03.460
except for a very brief period
during the Second World War,

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.210
genetics has been extremely...

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.180
What shall I call,
deterministic in its view

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.270
of the causes of human
and social behavior.

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:18.040
Geneticists have been, if
you like, imperialistic

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.530
in saying genes are
responsible for everything.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.533
The most violent eugenicists,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:28.320
and in some ways racists, were geneticists

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.150
who said genes dominate everything,

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:31.610
and if there are
differences between groups

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.190
and how rich they are,
how much power they have,

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:35.630
it must be in the genes.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:38.503
Only for a short period,
during the Second World War,

00:36:40.545 --> 00:36:43.050
when the consequences of that ideology

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.570
in the national socialist
state in Germany became clear,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.083
did people back off that.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.160
When I was in high school
during the Second World War,

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.010
we got a pamphlet saying

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.460
there really aren't any important
differences between races,

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.203
and so on, but that disappeared
when the war was over.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:01.130
Within 10 years of the end of the war,

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.180
it had come back again.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:06.750
So biologists in general
are biological determinists,

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.130
and that has a very
powerful ideological effect,

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:13.610
because they speak to reporters,
they talk on the radio,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:15.680
they have TV interviews,

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.560
and they push over and over again

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.920
the determinism of the gene.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.390
My wife and I went yesterday
to the Berkeley Art Museum,

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:28.120
and there we saw an exhibit
called Gene Genesis.

00:37:29.416 --> 00:37:31.650
The poster for that
exhibit, which is all over,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.180
has a quote from Jim Watson.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.290
And what does the quote say?

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.157
It says, "We used to think
our fate was in the stars,

00:37:38.157 --> 00:37:41.050
"but now we know it's in our genes."

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.750
Now, I mean, that's rubbish, you know,

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.090
but that's what's pushed,

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.660
and if you're a Nobel
prizewinner like Jim,

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.393
you get all the more credit for it.

00:37:49.894 --> 00:37:53.470
So scientists had that
ideology that as organisms,

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.340
we are governed, body
and soul, by our genes.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.400
Secondly, more broadly...

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.280
Scientists want to make claims

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.930
for the importance of what
they do in the general sense.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.140
So Jim Watson wants to say, look,

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.270
you should support work on
the genome, because after all,

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.470
everything that's important in
life is determined by genes.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.070
And that's not ideological,
that's purely political.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.170
That is a crass way of trying to increase

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.563
and guarantee the support of research.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.200
The same is true for medical research.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.960
We're told over and over and over again

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.190
that if we do this research,
people's lives will be saved.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.770
People will be cured.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:40.090
Well, obviously, medical cures do arise

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.590
out of some kinds of research.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.130
I mean, nobody can deny that.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.580
But promises are made of an extreme sort

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.823
which do not correspond to actual truth.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.950
This guy Hazeltine,

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.143
who's the head of one of these
private genome organizations,

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.430
finally said what everybody wanted to say

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:00.760
but didn't have the nerve to say.

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.047
He said, "Death is
nothing but a succession

00:39:05.047 --> 00:39:07.410
"of preventable diseases."

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:08.724
Well, if death is nothing

00:39:08.724 --> 00:39:10.270
but a succession of preventable diseases,

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:14.040
then if you give us enough
money, you'll live forever.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.710
Now, no sensible person believes that.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.810
But that's the kind of
appeal that is made.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.643
Give us more.

00:39:19.643 --> 00:39:22.520
Give us more power, give us more money,

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.113
and we will not postpone your
death, we will prevent it.

00:39:28.307 --> 00:39:30.230
There are a lot of sick
people in the world.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:34.050
Most of them are sick, ultimately,

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.030
because they're underfed and overworked.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:38.530
That's not the case for Americans.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.720
Most Americans are sick because
they've lived a long time,

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.900
and their machines are breaking down.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.370
You know, the transmission goes,

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.063
and then you need a brake job, and so on.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:51.730
There's a tremendous public demand.

00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:52.693
People are in pain,

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.010
and there's a demand to relieve that pain

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.550
and relieve that anxiety.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.090
Science cashes in on that in,
I think, a very cynical way

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:04.033
by making promises that can't be kept.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.760
- Another way it does this,

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.360
you were suggesting in your lectures,

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.877
is by the metaphors it uses to--

00:40:10.877 --> 00:40:13.610
- Well, that's how you do it, of course.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:16.970
You do it by saying
genes make the organism.

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:19.420
And if you really believe
genes are self-replicating,

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.040
so they are powerful, the whole notion

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.930
is that the genes inside of
us are independent of us.

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:27.630
They're in there doing their work.

00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:31.770
They make new copies of themselves,

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.580
and they make you, and,
therefore, they make society.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.910
And so if you support research on them,

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.330
you will be able to change
everything you want to change.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.260
The metaphors are that
genes make proteins,

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.810
that genes are self-replicating,
and so on and so forth.

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.910
- Which leads, as you were
suggesting in your lecture,

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.250
an ignoring of the relationship

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.830
of the organism to its environment.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:57.820
- Exactly so.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.900
Exactly so, because the minute
you allow the complication

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:03.680
of the interaction between
the gene and the environment,

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.700
then it doesn't look like genes

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.940
are quite so important as before.

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.670
Then you have to say, well, look,

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:14.130
let's take the case of
the major killers...

00:41:17.228 --> 00:41:19.417
Of the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.570
The major killers of the
19th and 20th centuries,

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:28.280
up until the first decade
or so of the 20th century,

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.970
were certain infectious diseases.

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:31.270
That's what killed people.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.560
Those infectious diseases
were not waterborne diseases.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.473
They were airborne diseases.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:52.050
A major killer of children in
the 19th century was measles.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.000
Now think of that.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.550
When I was a child, everybody had measles.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.330
Everybody in my class had measles.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.283
Nobody died of it.

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:02.150
But in the 19th century,
children died of measles.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:06.010
The major killer of women in
the 19th century was not child,

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.293
women of childbearing
age, was not childbearing.

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:11.513
It was tuberculosis.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.070
Now, why is it that tuberculosis

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.090
was the major killer of
people in the 19th century,

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.940
the germs are still around,

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.853
and is now a very small
fraction of the death rate?

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.630
Very few people get tuberculosis now.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.820
People do, but very few relative
to the population at large.

00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.150
And children don't die of measles.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.150
Well, now, of course, they're
inoculated against measles,

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.350
but nobody in my
generation died of measles,

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.320
although measles are still a primary cause

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.053
of child mortality in West Africa.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.063
The reason is because both
tuberculosis and measles,

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.210
in their severity and eventual effect,

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:48.610
and the probability of
getting tuberculosis,

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.313
are closely related to nutrition.

00:42:53.649 --> 00:42:57.577
Measles is a protein-consuming disease.

00:42:57.577 --> 00:42:59.940
If you already have a
severe protein deficit,

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.630
as children in West Africa do,

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.530
and then you get the measles, you die.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:10.920
Measles actually destroys
protein, it consumes protein.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:13.070
So if you're already underfed,

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.030
you're in big trouble if you get measles.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:17.420
But if you're well-fed, as I was,

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.240
and as my classmates in school were,

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.280
then it's just an annoyance.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.080
Tuberculosis was a chief
killer during the 19th century

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.093
because people were underfed.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.670
Women died more of tuberculosis than men

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.670
because in 19th-century
industrial England,

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.490
for example, where the data come from,

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.660
men were better fed than women.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:40.300
When there was meat to be had,

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:43.560
and the man came home from the
factory, the man got the meat

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.270
and the women and children
got what was left over.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:50.240
So as far as the causes of death

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.700
are concerned in our society, environment,

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:58.700
social environment, pay
scales, unemployment,

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:01.610
social attitudes toward who deserves

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:03.140
to get fed and who doesn't,

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.173
have had a profound effect
on the causes of mortality.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.200
- So you're suggesting that the metaphors

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.200
that we choose are, in part,
the result of the political

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.130
and social dynamics within science.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:17.963
- Absolutely.

00:44:17.963 --> 00:44:20.120
- The competition for resources and power,

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:24.910
but also that they reflect
the broader society

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.210
and the decisions about, for example,

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.180
the individual versus the community,

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.600
or whatever dichotomies
we might be talking about.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.770
- Yes, quite so.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.880
I mean, you don't want to think

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.390
that the chief cause of
death in your society

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:41.660
is that people are underfed.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:42.493
- Right.

00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:45.870
- That's bad news, because
then people might demand

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.260
that you do something about it.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:49.600
Instead of putting all
that money into germs,

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.010
you should put it into feeding people.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:56.130
- So what is, then, the answer

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:00.210
for the problem that you
posed in your writings,

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:04.420
namely the problem of the inadequate way

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.990
that the public understands
what science is up to

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.750
and the lack of tools
to criticize science?

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.080
- That's a very serious problem, Harry,

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.453
that I don't have a good answer to.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.200
Science reporting in
newspapers, for example,

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.320
and on the radio and on
TV are a serious problem.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.153
They're a serious problem

00:45:25.153 --> 00:45:29.000
not because science reporters
are dumb or ignorant.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.570
It's because of the
nature of public media.

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.403
I know a lot of science reporters.

00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:39.240
I worked together, have over the years,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.110
with the Knight journalism
fellowships at MIT,

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.390
where science journalists come to MIT

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.490
and spend a year on sabbatical
or six months on sabbatical

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:50.690
interacting with scientists,
and I have met with them often.

00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:53.290
I've been greatly impressed
with how much they know.

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.540
But when it's time to write an article

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.910
for The New York Times,

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:01.820
or have five minutes
on TV or on the radio,

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.150
you are in competition with
all kinds of other people

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:08.740
who want column inches and
five minutes on the radio,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:10.360
and if you don't make it dramatic,

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.090
you don't get the five minutes.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.510
You cannot get a long column

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.750
in the science-ish part
of The New York Times

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.170
or the news part of The New York Times

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:21.520
if you write an article saying,

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.510
well, it's all very complicated.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.000
It's some of this and some of that,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.660
and we really don't know what's happening

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.330
and we're sort of trying to find out,

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:29.750
and it's probably something environmental.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.583
No.

00:46:30.583 --> 00:46:34.490
No editor is going to give
you column inches for that.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:35.493
That's point one.

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:40.600
The result is that much of
what's written for the public

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:44.260
is obfuscating, because
it's over-dramatic.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.000
Scientists today have found a gene which,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.660
and then you read what they say:

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.360
which may one day give us information

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.700
that might lead to a cure for.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:57.233
It's always may one day, might lead to.

00:46:59.172 --> 00:47:00.600
But that slips under the rug.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.780
The important thing is
scientists announced today that.

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.970
And, of course, a great deal
of what appears in the press

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.000
and on the radio and on the TV
about the products of science

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.200
are the outcome of press conferences

00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:17.890
called by the press office
of the University of X,

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.500
which is constantly after its
professors to feed them stuff

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:23.793
which they can then announce to the press.

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:29.000
And then the press guy goes
to the press conference

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.490
and somebody gets up and says,

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:32.540
today, we found a gene for...

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.683
That's another way of getting money.

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:39.540
If I have to deal with
the state legislature

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.690
in getting my budget, one
of the things I'd like to do

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:45.257
is to say, people on my faculty
have contributed this, that,

00:47:45.257 --> 00:47:47.260
and the other to public welfare.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.250
And if you don't believe it,

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.683
look in the Los Angeles
Times for last week.

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.040
So there are strong social
pressures on scientists

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.797
to make excessive claims,

00:48:00.797 --> 00:48:02.270
and there are strong pressures

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:04.940
on those who report science to the public

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:09.043
to exaggerate and simplify.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.290
Look, I'm all in favor of simplifying.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.060
If a thing can be made
simple, let's make it simple.

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.870
But they simplify it to the
extent of making it untrue,

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:19.270
and that's the real problem.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:25.063
- Or simplified to the extent
of furthering the interests

00:48:25.063 --> 00:48:29.293
of particular groups or
companies, or whatever.

00:48:29.293 --> 00:48:30.370
- To some extent, although I don't think

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:32.001
that's the most serious issue.

00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:33.690
The most serious issue

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:38.690
is just going along with the metaphors

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.880
and extreme inaccurate
simplifications of the field,

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:47.253
just in order to be able
to get it out there.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:50.290
I don't see most science journalists

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:55.290
as either witting or unwitting
tools of commercial interest.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.083
There may be such people, but
that's not our big problem.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.442
- It's a broader landscape,

00:49:02.442 --> 00:49:04.650
the way it all hangs
together, so to speak?

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:07.510
- I have the experience of
reading the science section

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.480
in The New York Times once
a week, the Science Times,

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.990
and not understanding what
the reporters are telling me.

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:16.060
I read it.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.480
I'm a scientist.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:20.360
And I'm not just a biologist,
I'm also a statistician.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.775
I was trained in physics
as an undergraduate.

00:49:22.775 --> 00:49:23.970
I mean, I have a pretty broad,

00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.800
I'm not an expert in nuclear
physics, that's for sure,

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.430
but I try to understand what
the reporter is telling me,

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:32.210
and I can't ever understand it.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.920
- And why is that, do you think?

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.310
- Because it doesn't have the kind

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.200
of logical detailed
development that I expect.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.280
You know, A leads to B, B leads to C.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.560
No.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.960
A was discovered, and that means D.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.960
And I can't figure out the
relationship between them at all.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.190
- If students were to watch this tape

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:57.550
and they aspire to wear both hats

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.770
that you have worn very well,

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.590
that of a critic of both science

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:07.430
and a commentator on society in general,

00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:09.093
but also that of a scientist,

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:12.540
are there some rules that we can lay down

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:17.110
for how one does that well
without compromising either?

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.790
- Well, rule one, Harry,

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:21.443
is don't start out by
being a social critic.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:24.290
Start out by being a scientist.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.970
Because I think I've said
in this interview before,

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.530
but I'll say it again if I haven't,

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.903
that the critical issue for a
social critic is legitimacy.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.810
You don't want to be written off

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.710
as some sort of loud mouth
who can't do anything better

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.740
than just yak.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.960
So the first thing to do is
to establish real credentials

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.190
as a producer of science,

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.820
recognized by the science community

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.800
and accepted by them
as being of some value.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.640
When you stand on that
base, you can then go out.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.480
The second point is that you must

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.800
make it clear at all times,

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.120
and it must be clear in your own mind,

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:09.120
that the science that you do,

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.520
and especially, not the
science that you do,

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.480
but the results you get in your science

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.200
and what you say about
science cannot be shown

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:23.083
to be simply the consequence
of your social attitudes.

00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:27.670
If I say that genes and
environment are important,

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:30.727
I have to have a firm
underpinning for that

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.190
within the scientific apparatus.

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:36.640
I cannot say, well, I wish that were true

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.790
because I would like a world

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.050
in which I could change the world,

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:41.950
and therefore I'm prejudiced
in the way I report the world,

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:44.450
because that's the first thing
that your opponents will say.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.530
Oh, you just say that

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:47.483
because that's your political ideology.

00:51:49.244 --> 00:51:52.930
You're justifying that political ideology

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:54.980
by pretending that science has done that.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.030
The observations have to be there

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:00.830
independent of any justification.

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:04.400
You have to distinguish
between why you do a thing

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.100
and what the result is.

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:11.100
It may be that you are propelled forward

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:13.640
to study the relationship
between gene and environment

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:17.710
because you have some political agenda,

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:21.690
but what you say better
not be tainted by that.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:23.943
That's very tricky and very important.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:27.630
- And what is your advice
to the general public?

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.970
Because I can hear
people watching this say,

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:33.780
well, if he can't understand

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.853
what's being said in The New
York Times science section,

00:52:38.908 --> 00:52:40.470
how can I understand it?

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.580
What can people, the average person,

00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.220
do to be informed citizens in the debates

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:53.300
that involve science policies
that are rationalized

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.060
about science through the uses of science?

00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.460
- Harry, you've raised there

00:52:58.340 --> 00:53:03.190
one of the most difficult
social problems that exists.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.160
I want to put it in a
broader context for a moment

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:07.860
before I come back to the
specific question you're asking,

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:10.293
because I don't know the answer
to the specific question.

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:17.420
The founding fathers of our
republic said, essentially,

00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:19.920
that you can't have a democratic society

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.410
if you don't have an educated electorate.

00:53:23.410 --> 00:53:26.540
How can people make democratic decisions

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.970
about what has to be done
unless they have some education?

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:30.820
So we have a public education system.

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:35.310
What the founding fathers
never could have imagined

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.510
is the kind of knowledge
that you would have to have

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:41.940
in order to make informed decisions.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.630
Let's talk about the Star Wars project.

00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:47.620
I don't know enough about
physics and engineering

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.760
to decide whether it would work or not.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.120
I have to trust somebody else to tell me.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.320
I don't know enough about
physics to make those decisions.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.570
I have to trust what
Steve Weinberg tells me.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:00.200
Now, that is a very serious problem.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.850
I'm a scientist, and I still have to trust

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.270
what other people tell me.

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.310
So the problem for the public, in general,

00:54:06.310 --> 00:54:09.780
is that in order to make
democratic decisions,

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:14.470
you have to believe something
about elite knowledge

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.603
which is possessed only by a few people.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.223
And it's very hard to know
what to do about that.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.230
I don't have a glib answer to that.

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:27.930
It is one of the contradictions
of a democratic society

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.700
in a highly advanced technological world

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.750
that to make rational political decisions,

00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:36.090
you have to have a knowledge

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:39.923
which is accessible only
to a very few people.

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.130
The first rule, I suppose,

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:49.130
is if there are public disagreements

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:53.180
among people who are
supposedly equally expert,

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.763
then you'd better be careful.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.310
If they all agree,
well, you have no choice

00:54:58.310 --> 00:54:59.410
but to take what they say.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:01.110
I don't know what else you can do.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:05.330
But if there is any disagreement,

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:08.020
then listen carefully to
what those debates are about,

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.220
and see if you can figure out

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.913
who is coming from where and why.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.900
That's true for the Genome
Project and things like that.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.330
That's what killed Star Wars.

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:17.840
Well, I don't know if that's
what killed Star Wars,

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.500
but that's what made the
public doubtful about it.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.910
Whether that had any effect politically,

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:25.530
I don't know the answer.

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.260
But I have no answer to the question,

00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:32.860
because there are no institutions

00:55:34.350 --> 00:55:37.130
promoting the public
understanding of science

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:39.910
that are widely available to the public

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:43.340
that do not obfuscate the issues,

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:48.200
either by funneling them
through media people

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:50.710
who have to try to get the space

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.740
before your eyes and
your ears, and therefore

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.330
they're under control of
editorial exigencies and so on,

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:03.000
or because they are the
captives of scientists

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.730
who have their own agendas,

00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:06.470
so that the head of
the Whitehead Institute

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.650
will tell them how wonderful
everything they do is,

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:10.570
because that's part of the agenda.

00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.810
I don't know the answer,
I don't have an answer.

00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:14.615
I think the answer is listen to me.

00:56:14.615 --> 00:56:16.230
(both laugh)

00:56:16.230 --> 00:56:17.960
- Or at least we have to find out a way

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.553
how to institutionalize you.

00:56:20.798 --> 00:56:23.820
You said something, which this
will be the last question,

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:25.383
and maybe a brief answer.

00:56:26.773 --> 00:56:28.480
Philosophic, you really believe that,

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:34.790
I think you said two things,
if you want to comment.

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:36.697
You said, "Men make their own history,

00:56:36.697 --> 00:56:38.270
"but not as they choose."

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.102
- I didn't invent that.

00:56:40.102 --> 00:56:44.010
- No, I know, but it
tells us where you are

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.010
philosophically in your
view of human nature.

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:50.630
And then you also said,
it was a responsibility

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.740
to decide what kind of world you want

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:56.773
and make the decisions to
move in that direction.

00:56:56.773 --> 00:56:58.437
- If you can.
- If you can, yeah.

00:56:58.437 --> 00:57:00.987
- And that's the problem,
because the latter one...

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:05.430
But the contexts I said
them in are important.

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:07.730
You can't make the world stay still.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:08.630
It's going to evolve.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.250
Species are going to become extinct.

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:11.440
The world is going to change.

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.063
Technology is going to change.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.070
Nature is going to change,
nature is changing all the time.

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:22.640
So if we're going to concentrate
on influencing things,

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.020
we should not try to concentrate

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:27.220
on holding them the way they
are, because that's hopeless.

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:29.620
What we should do, in fact,
is to try to concentrate

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:34.620
on changing them in a
direction that we find better.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:39.370
The only trouble is that we
is a heterogeneous collection

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:41.970
which includes people with
very different interests.

00:57:43.995 --> 00:57:45.910
I'm a citizen of the state of Vermont,

00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:50.180
and my fellow townspeople have
bumper stickers on their cars

00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:53.860
that say another Vermonter
for global warming,

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.860
because if you lived in Vermont,
you'd like it to be warmer.

00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:02.770
People who own stock in companies

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:04.260
that make air-conditioning machines

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.183
might be in favor of global warming.

00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.620
That's, in a sense,
trivializing the point,

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:13.470
which is that different people
have different interests,

00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:16.470
and therefore the struggle
is not a moral one.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:17.810
It's a political one.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:20.270
It's always a political one.

00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:22.550
That's the most important
thing you have to recognize,

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:23.780
that you may be struggling

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:25.670
to make the world go in one direction.

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:26.911
Somebody else is struggling

00:58:26.911 --> 00:58:28.570
to make it go in another direction.

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:30.700
The question is, who has power?

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.880
And if there's a differential in power,

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.500
and if you haven't got it and they have,

00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:36.200
then you have to do
something to gain power,

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.323
which is to organize.

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:42.210
I guess my final word is
organize, organize, organize.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:45.190
- On that note, Professor
Lewontin, thank you very much

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:48.270
for taking the time from your
schedule to be here today.

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:50.450
- Thank you, Harry, for talking to me.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:51.910
- Thank you very much for joining us

00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:54.003
for this Conversation with History.

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:58.247
(upbeat synth music)
