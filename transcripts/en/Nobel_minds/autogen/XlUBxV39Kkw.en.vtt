purchasing contract with the seller of
this of this property and if we have a

this of this property and if we have a
 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.960
this of this property and if we have a
job we probably have an employment

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970

contract with our employer okay so all

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040
contract with our employer okay so all
 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.430

actually contracts is broader than this
 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.900
actually contracts is broader than this
because many phenomena many institutions

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.050
because many phenomena many institutions
we see in society or actually a

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060

contractor can be analyzed with contract

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519
contractor can be analyzed with contract
 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.890
contractor can be analyzed with contract
theory so for example when we own

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900
theory so for example when we own
 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.719
theory so for example when we own
something when we have property rights

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729
something when we have property rights
 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.460
something when we have property rights
to something that's the type of contract

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
to something that's the type of contract
 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.659
to something that's the type of contract
that says what we can do with our

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669
that says what we can do with our
 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.230
that says what we can do with our
property if we you know the political

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240
property if we you know the political
 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.600

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.959
returns from some cooperation okay so it
basically says if we have a contract who

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969
basically says if we have a contract who
 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.010
basically says if we have a contract who
should pay whom when and how much

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020
should pay whom when and how much
 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.480
should pay whom when and how much
now from a theoretical standpoint you

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490
now from a theoretical standpoint you
 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.219
now from a theoretical standpoint you
can think about these as what we call a

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229
can think about these as what we call a
 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.100
can think about these as what we call a
principal and agent problem okay so a

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110
principal and agent problem okay so a
 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.050
principal and agent problem okay so a
principal would be for example if you

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060
principal would be for example if you
 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.519
principal would be for example if you
think about an employment contract the

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529
think about an employment contract the
 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:17.649
think about an employment contract the
principal would be the employer who

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659
principal would be the employer who
 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:20.050
principal would be the employer who
hires someone to do some job so the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060
hires someone to do some job so the
 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.850
hires someone to do some job so the
person who's hired is the agent the

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860
person who's hired is the agent the
 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.309
person who's hired is the agent the
agent is supposed to do some job on

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319
agent is supposed to do some job on
 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.649
agent is supposed to do some job on
behalf of the principal and what you

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659
behalf of the principal and what you
 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.140
behalf of the principal and what you
have to do is design a contract the

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150
have to do is design a contract the
 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.600
have to do is design a contract the
compensation for this agent that they

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610
compensation for this agent that they
 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.050
compensation for this agent that they
sort of design in the best way and it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060
sort of design in the best way and it
 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.180
sort of design in the best way and it
turns out these contracts typically have

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190
turns out these contracts typically have
 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.119
turns out these contracts typically have
to balance two different forces okay so

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129
to balance two different forces okay so
 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.800
to balance two different forces okay so
the first one is that since the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810
the first one is that since the
 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.300
the first one is that since the
principal since the employer doesn't

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310
principal since the employer doesn't
 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.999
principal since the employer doesn't
necessarily see what the agent or the

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009
necessarily see what the agent or the
 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.950
necessarily see what the agent or the
employee is doing all the time you have

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960
employee is doing all the time you have
 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.749
employee is doing all the time you have
to have a contract that gives incentives

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759
to have a contract that gives incentives
 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.290
to have a contract that gives incentives
for this agent to act in the interest of

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300
for this agent to act in the interest of
 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.240
for this agent to act in the interest of
this principal okay to give the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250
this principal okay to give the
 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.670
this principal okay to give the
incentive part but the other part which

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680
incentive part but the other part which
 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.469
incentive part but the other part which
is in conflict with this sometimes is

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479
is in conflict with this sometimes is
 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.600
is in conflict with this sometimes is
that you don't want to put too much risk

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610
that you don't want to put too much risk
 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.089
that you don't want to put too much risk
on the agent okay the employee is not

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099
on the agent okay the employee is not
 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.369
on the agent okay the employee is not
going to be very happy if the cave you

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379
going to be very happy if the cave you
 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.019
going to be very happy if the cave you
know goes up and down the flock chase

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029
know goes up and down the flock chase
 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.209
know goes up and down the flock chase
all the time so you also want to provide

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:10.219
all the time so you also want to provide
 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:12.820
all the time so you also want to provide
some risk sharing some insurance to this

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830
some risk sharing some insurance to this
 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.950
some risk sharing some insurance to this
agent so if we take in an insurance

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960
agent so if we take in an insurance
 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.100
agent so if we take in an insurance
contract for example okay we would love

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110
contract for example okay we would love
 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.499
contract for example okay we would love
if the insurance company fully covered

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:20.509
if the insurance company fully covered
 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:22.629
if the insurance company fully covered
our losses if we have an accident or if

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639
our losses if we have an accident or if
 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.070
our losses if we have an accident or if
our house burns down we would like to

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080
our house burns down we would like to
 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.540
our house burns down we would like to
get everything covered so we have no

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550
get everything covered so we have no
 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.550
get everything covered so we have no
risk but the problem is that that's

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560
risk but the problem is that that's
 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.200
risk but the problem is that that's
going to give us the wrong incentives

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210
going to give us the wrong incentives
 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.209
going to give us the wrong incentives
potentially because you know if we know

00:06:31.209 --> 00:06:31.219
potentially because you know if we know
 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.769
potentially because you know if we know
we're fully covered we're not going to

00:06:32.769 --> 00:06:32.779
we're fully covered we're not going to
 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:34.990
we're fully covered we're not going to
take as well care of our property as we

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000
take as well care of our property as we
 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.309
take as well care of our property as we
otherwise would have that's why we have

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319
otherwise would have that's why we have
 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:38.110
otherwise would have that's why we have
you know deductibles and co-payments

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120
you know deductibles and co-payments
 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.430
you know deductibles and co-payments
right we have to pay you lip

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440
right we have to pay you lip
 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.320
right we have to pay you lip
that ourselves if we have a loss the

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330
that ourselves if we have a loss the
 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.930
that ourselves if we have a loss the
insurance company doesn't doesn't cover

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940
insurance company doesn't doesn't cover
 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.670
insurance company doesn't doesn't cover
everything and that's to give us the

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680
everything and that's to give us the
 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.920
everything and that's to give us the
right incentives to be careful okay

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930
right incentives to be careful okay
 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.500
right incentives to be careful okay
the risk versus incentives so this is

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510
the risk versus incentives so this is
 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.320
the risk versus incentives so this is
where Bank Holmstrom's contributions are

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330
where Bank Holmstrom's contributions are
 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.590
where Bank Holmstrom's contributions are
in understanding this principal-agent

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600
in understanding this principal-agent
 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.200
in understanding this principal-agent
problem and how to design contracts so

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210
problem and how to design contracts so
 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.180
problem and how to design contracts so
this is an old problem I mean already

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190
this is an old problem I mean already
 

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.370
this is an old problem I mean already
Adam Smith's talked about you know the

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380
Adam Smith's talked about you know the
 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.850
Adam Smith's talked about you know the
principal-agent problem but this

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860
principal-agent problem but this
 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.350
principal-agent problem but this
research really took off

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360
research really took off
 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.020
research really took off
thanks to Bank Holmstrom's contributions

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030
thanks to Bank Holmstrom's contributions
 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.200
thanks to Bank Holmstrom's contributions

basically has a number of different
 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.350
basically has a number of different
research contributions that highlights

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360
research contributions that highlights
 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.600
research contributions that highlights
all sorts of different important aspects

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:25.610
all sorts of different important aspects
 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.550
all sorts of different important aspects
of how to do these contracts what

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560
of how to do these contracts what
 

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.920
of how to do these contracts what
information do you want to pay base

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:29.930
information do you want to pay base
 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.140
information do you want to pay base
performance on what do you do when an

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:32.150
performance on what do you do when an
 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.600
performance on what do you do when an
agent has to be incentivized to do too

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:34.610
agent has to be incentivized to do too
 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.510
agent has to be incentivized to do too
many - - lots of different things not

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520
many - - lots of different things not
 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.030
many - - lots of different things not
just one thing how do you incentivize a

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.040
just one thing how do you incentivize a
 

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.160
just one thing how do you incentivize a
team you know so maybe people are

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.170
team you know so maybe people are
 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.030
team you know so maybe people are
working together to produce something

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040
working together to produce something
 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.650
working together to produce something
how do you think about giving the right

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:47.660
how do you think about giving the right
 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.960
how do you think about giving the right
incentives over time for example how

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:49.970
incentives over time for example how
 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.990
incentives over time for example how
does your future career prospects affect

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000
does your future career prospects affect
 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.080
does your future career prospects affect
your incentives to work today okay so to

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.090
your incentives to work today okay so to
 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.580
your incentives to work today okay so to
be a little bit more concrete let's

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:57.590
be a little bit more concrete let's
 

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.770
be a little bit more concrete let's
think about an example that I think a

00:07:59.770 --> 00:07:59.780
think about an example that I think a
 

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.600
think about an example that I think a
lot of people are familiar with how do

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.610
lot of people are familiar with how do
 

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.360
lot of people are familiar with how do
we pay managers and CEOs of big

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:04.370
we pay managers and CEOs of big
 

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.730
we pay managers and CEOs of big
companies okay so this is a principal

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:06.740
companies okay so this is a principal
 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.980
companies okay so this is a principal
agent problem the principal are you know

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:08.990
agent problem the principal are you know
 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.710
agent problem the principal are you know
the shareholders okay they want to hire

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720
the shareholders okay they want to hire
 

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.350
the shareholders okay they want to hire
this agent the CEO to act in their

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360
this agent the CEO to act in their
 

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.360
this agent the CEO to act in their
interest to create as much value for the

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:16.370
interest to create as much value for the
 

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.150
interest to create as much value for the
shareholders as possible for example so

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:19.160
shareholders as possible for example so
 

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.610
shareholders as possible for example so
it turns out you can apply Holmstrom

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:21.620
it turns out you can apply Holmstrom
 

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.680
it turns out you can apply Holmstrom
different theories on lots of aspects of

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:23.690
different theories on lots of aspects of
 

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.620
different theories on lots of aspects of
this problem so for example the

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:26.630
this problem so for example the
 

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.390
this problem so for example the
informativeness principle which is the

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400
informativeness principle which is the
 

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.360
informativeness principle which is the
famous result of Holmstrom that talks

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.370
famous result of Holmstrom that talks
 

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.430
famous result of Holmstrom that talks
about you know what information should

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440
about you know what information should
 

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.100
about you know what information should
you bathe say the bonus on ok one

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.110
you bathe say the bonus on ok one
 

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.959
you bathe say the bonus on ok one
implication of that for example is that

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:37.969
implication of that for example is that
 

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:40.899
implication of that for example is that
it might seem natural to reward a CEO if

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:40.909
it might seem natural to reward a CEO if
 

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.829
it might seem natural to reward a CEO if
the profits of their company is high ok

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839
the profits of their company is high ok
 

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:47.710
the profits of their company is high ok
but that means that's not the full story

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:47.720
but that means that's not the full story
 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.900
but that means that's not the full story
because if we just face bonus on the

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:49.910
because if we just face bonus on the
 

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.300
because if we just face bonus on the
profits of their own company then we're

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.310
profits of their own company then we're
 

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.260
profits of their own company then we're
going to be paid

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.270
going to be paid
 

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.540
going to be paid
the CEO in many times just because be

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:55.550
the CEO in many times just because be
 

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.820
the CEO in many times just because be
there being lucky or punish them because

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:57.830
there being lucky or punish them because
 

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.650
there being lucky or punish them because
they're unlucky if you run an oil

00:08:59.650 --> 00:08:59.660
they're unlucky if you run an oil
 

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.480
they're unlucky if you run an oil
company you might be more profitable

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:01.490
company you might be more profitable
 

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.040
company you might be more profitable
just because the oil price goes up

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.050
just because the oil price goes up
 

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.840
just because the oil price goes up
that's just luck we don't want to reward

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:04.850
that's just luck we don't want to reward
 

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.570
that's just luck we don't want to reward
the CEO for that okay so that's an

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:07.580
the CEO for that okay so that's an
 

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.579
the CEO for that okay so that's an
implication of the informativeness

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:09.589
implication of the informativeness
 

00:09:09.589 --> 00:09:13.090
implication of the informativeness
principle another natural example is

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.100
principle another natural example is
 

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.329
principle another natural example is
that you know a CEO needs to do many

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:16.339
that you know a CEO needs to do many
 

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:18.310
that you know a CEO needs to do many
different things to create value in the

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320
different things to create value in the
 

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.800
different things to create value in the
company so for example they we might

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:20.810
company so for example they we might
 

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.510
company so for example they we might
want them to really make sure that this

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:22.520
want them to really make sure that this
 

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.000
want them to really make sure that this
year's profits are high but we might

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.010
year's profits are high but we might
 

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.800
year's profits are high but we might
also want to make sure that they take

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:26.810
also want to make sure that they take
 

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.170
also want to make sure that they take
the best long-run decisions in the

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:29.180
the best long-run decisions in the
 

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.570
the best long-run decisions in the
company or we invest in let's say R&amp;D

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:31.580
company or we invest in let's say R&amp;D
 

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.550
company or we invest in let's say R&amp;D
your long term investments where the

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560
your long term investments where the
 

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.280
your long term investments where the
profits may show up you know long far

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:36.290
profits may show up you know long far
 

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.350
profits may show up you know long far
into the future okay so how do you

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360
into the future okay so how do you
 

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.449
into the future okay so how do you
balance these incentives for you know

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:40.459
balance these incentives for you know
 

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:43.290
balance these incentives for you know
this year's profits versus long term

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.300
this year's profits versus long term
 

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.790
this year's profits versus long term
value for the company and one

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800
value for the company and one
 

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.880
value for the company and one
interesting finding here is that you

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:48.890
interesting finding here is that you
 

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:50.380
interesting finding here is that you
know typically it's easier to measure

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:50.390
know typically it's easier to measure
 

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.829
know typically it's easier to measure
profits today compared to long-run value

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839
profits today compared to long-run value
 

00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:56.980
profits today compared to long-run value
okay so there's a temptation to base the

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:56.990
okay so there's a temptation to base the
 

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.810
okay so there's a temptation to base the
bonus on the thing you can observe or

00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:58.820
bonus on the thing you can observe or
 

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.090
bonus on the thing you can observe or
easiest measure right the profits today

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.100
easiest measure right the profits today
 

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.100
easiest measure right the profits today
but that's it has a problem because if

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.110
but that's it has a problem because if
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.440
but that's it has a problem because if
you only base the the bonus on today's

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.450
you only base the the bonus on today's
 

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.380
you only base the the bonus on today's
profits then maybe everything that CEO

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:08.390
profits then maybe everything that CEO
 

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.300
profits then maybe everything that CEO
will focus on is just this year's

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.310
will focus on is just this year's
 

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.130
will focus on is just this year's
profits and forget about long-run

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:12.140
profits and forget about long-run
 

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.990
profits and forget about long-run
investments that are important for the

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000
investments that are important for the
 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
investments that are important for the
firm so in that situation maybe you

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.010
firm so in that situation maybe you
 

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.860
firm so in that situation maybe you
can't have any bonus at all not even on

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:17.870
can't have any bonus at all not even on
 

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.660
can't have any bonus at all not even on
short-term profits if you want to have

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:19.670
short-term profits if you want to have
 

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.730
short-term profits if you want to have
the right balance with incentives and

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:21.740
the right balance with incentives and
 

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.360
the right balance with incentives and
the third example is this career

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:25.370
the third example is this career
 

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.760
the third example is this career
concerns model of Holmstrom which

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:27.770
concerns model of Holmstrom which
 

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.470
concerns model of Holmstrom which
basically says that when you're young

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480
basically says that when you're young
 

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.410
basically says that when you're young
you get an incentive even if you don't

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:32.420
you get an incentive even if you don't
 

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.389
you get an incentive even if you don't
have a bonus you have an incentive to do

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399
have a bonus you have an incentive to do
 

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.800
have a bonus you have an incentive to do
the right thing because you might get

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:35.810
the right thing because you might get
 

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.510
the right thing because you might get
promoted in at the pay raise in the

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:37.520
promoted in at the pay raise in the
 

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.579
promoted in at the pay raise in the
future but this also tells you that if

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:39.589
future but this also tells you that if
 

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:42.490
future but this also tells you that if
you think about a CEO maybe having a big

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:42.500
you think about a CEO maybe having a big
 

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.290
you think about a CEO maybe having a big
bonus or performance pay is much more

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:44.300
bonus or performance pay is much more
 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.090
bonus or performance pay is much more
important when they're getting old and

another aspect of contracting that

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920
another aspect of contracting that
 

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.060
another aspect of contracting that
turned out to be very important and

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.070
turned out to be very important and
 

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.249
turned out to be very important and
which has to do with incomplete

00:11:08.249 --> 00:11:08.259
which has to do with incomplete
 

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:11.970
which has to do with incomplete
contracts okay so if we look at a

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:11.980
contracts okay so if we look at a
 

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.870
contracts okay so if we look at a
contract

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880
contract
 

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.660
contract
it just doesn't just specify you know

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:15.670
it just doesn't just specify you know
 

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.269
it just doesn't just specify you know
payments between people but it also says

00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279
payments between people but it also says
 

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:20.730
payments between people but it also says
who should have the right to decide on

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:20.740
who should have the right to decide on
 

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.290
who should have the right to decide on
things in this cooperation okay now why

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:25.300
things in this cooperation okay now why
 

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.030
things in this cooperation okay now why
are these decision rights in these

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040
are these decision rights in these
 

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.620
are these decision rights in these
contracts well it has to do with the

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:28.630
contracts well it has to do with the
 

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.139
contracts well it has to do with the
fact that you can't specify everything

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:31.149
fact that you can't specify everything
 

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:32.819
fact that you can't specify everything
in a contract it will become impossible

00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:32.829
in a contract it will become impossible
 

00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:35.009
in a contract it will become impossible
you know they they'll become larger than

00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:35.019
you know they they'll become larger than
 

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:37.170
you know they they'll become larger than
that one okay there's so many things

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:37.180
that one okay there's so many things
 

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.850
that one okay there's so many things
that can happen in the future that we

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:38.860
that can happen in the future that we
 

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.129
that can happen in the future that we
can't even imagine and write down what

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:41.139
can't even imagine and write down what
 

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:43.199
can't even imagine and write down what
will happen in the contract so we can't

00:11:43.199 --> 00:11:43.209
will happen in the contract so we can't
 

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:45.269
will happen in the contract so we can't
do that then we have to say okay what

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279
do that then we have to say okay what
 

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.610
do that then we have to say okay what
happens if something unexpected or

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:47.620
happens if something unexpected or
 

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.340
happens if something unexpected or
unspecified happens who has the right to

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:50.350
unspecified happens who has the right to
 

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.160
unspecified happens who has the right to
decide what to do then okay that's where

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.170
decide what to do then okay that's where
 

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.439
decide what to do then okay that's where
these decision rights come in so what

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:55.449
these decision rights come in so what
 

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:57.480
these decision rights come in so what
contracts also do is that they decide

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:57.490
contracts also do is that they decide
 

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.759
contracts also do is that they decide
who should or or they allocate these

00:11:59.759 --> 00:11:59.769
who should or or they allocate these
 

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:02.009
who should or or they allocate these
decision rights between the contracting

00:12:02.009 --> 00:12:02.019
decision rights between the contracting
 

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:03.720
decision rights between the contracting
parties who has the right to make the

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:03.730
parties who has the right to make the
 

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.550
parties who has the right to make the
decision when we haven't specified it

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560
decision when we haven't specified it
 

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.420
decision when we haven't specified it
beforehand and this is really what in

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:09.430
beforehand and this is really what in
 

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.960
beforehand and this is really what in
complete contracting theory is about so

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:11.970
complete contracting theory is about so
 

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.730
complete contracting theory is about so
again there were sort of informal

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:14.740
again there were sort of informal
 

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:16.740
again there were sort of informal
arguments of how to understand decision

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:16.750
arguments of how to understand decision
 

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.230
arguments of how to understand decision
rights ownership property rights in this

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240
rights ownership property rights in this
 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.150
rights ownership property rights in this
context but there wasn't any formal

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160
context but there wasn't any formal
 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.949
context but there wasn't any formal
theory before Oliver Hart and his

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959
theory before Oliver Hart and his
 

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:25.530
theory before Oliver Hart and his
co-authors developed this starting in

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:25.540
co-authors developed this starting in
 

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:30.540
co-authors developed this starting in
the mid-1980s and the idea here again is

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:30.550
the mid-1980s and the idea here again is
 

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.910
the mid-1980s and the idea here again is
that when contracts are incomplete you

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920
that when contracts are incomplete you
 

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.100
that when contracts are incomplete you
haven't specified anything then you have

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:35.110
haven't specified anything then you have
 

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.660
haven't specified anything then you have
to write down who has the right to make

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:36.670
to write down who has the right to make
 

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.100
to write down who has the right to make
the decision okay or what to do now

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:40.110
the decision okay or what to do now
 

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.329
the decision okay or what to do now
having the right to make the decision

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:42.339
having the right to make the decision
 

00:12:42.339 --> 00:12:45.180
having the right to make the decision
that gives you power okay and that power

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.190
that gives you power okay and that power
 

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.949
that gives you power okay and that power
helps you actually capture a bigger

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959
helps you actually capture a bigger
 

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:49.379
helps you actually capture a bigger
piece of the cake in your relationship

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:49.389
piece of the cake in your relationship
 

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:50.910
piece of the cake in your relationship
okay so if you have the right to decide

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920
okay so if you have the right to decide
 

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.000
okay so if you have the right to decide
if you own the assets then you're gonna

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.010
if you own the assets then you're gonna
 

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.559
if you own the assets then you're gonna
get the bigger reward from the

00:12:55.559 --> 00:12:55.569
get the bigger reward from the
 

00:12:55.569 --> 00:12:57.689
get the bigger reward from the
cooperation and that in turn affects

00:12:57.689 --> 00:12:57.699
cooperation and that in turn affects
 

00:12:57.699 --> 00:13:02.100
cooperation and that in turn affects
your incentives to for example invest in

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.110
your incentives to for example invest in
 

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.350
your incentives to for example invest in
this relationship so this is sort of the

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360
this relationship so this is sort of the
 

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.449
this relationship so this is sort of the
the gist of the theory they first

00:13:06.449 --> 00:13:06.459
the gist of the theory they first
 

00:13:06.459 --> 00:13:08.699
the gist of the theory they first
applied it to the question of whether a

00:13:08.699 --> 00:13:08.709
applied it to the question of whether a
 

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:11.610
applied it to the question of whether a
firm should own its supplier or not okay

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:11.620
firm should own its supplier or not okay
 

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.139
firm should own its supplier or not okay
so that's called vertical integration

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:13.149
so that's called vertical integration
 

00:13:13.149 --> 00:13:15.059
so that's called vertical integration
but they just turned out this is an

00:13:15.059 --> 00:13:15.069
but they just turned out this is an
 

00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:17.069
but they just turned out this is an
incredibly rich theory to explain many

00:13:17.069 --> 00:13:17.079
incredibly rich theory to explain many
 

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:18.600
incredibly rich theory to explain many
many different things

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:18.610
many different things
 

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.239
many different things
so to give you some examples this theory

00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:21.249
so to give you some examples this theory
 

00:13:21.249 --> 00:13:23.249
so to give you some examples this theory
was applied to understand you know what

00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:23.259
was applied to understand you know what
 

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:25.439
was applied to understand you know what
is really the difference between the

00:13:25.439 --> 00:13:25.449
is really the difference between the
 

00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:27.660
is really the difference between the
firm and the market okay what kind of

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:27.670
firm and the market okay what kind of
 

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.699
firm and the market okay what kind of
transactions economic transactions

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:29.709
transactions economic transactions
 

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.769
transactions economic transactions
should better take place within firms

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:31.779
should better take place within firms
 

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:34.470
should better take place within firms
and which ones should occur in markets

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480
and which ones should occur in markets
 

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.449
and which ones should occur in markets
it has been applied to understand this

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:36.459
it has been applied to understand this
 

00:13:36.459 --> 00:13:38.819
it has been applied to understand this
financial contracting problem okay if we

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:38.829
financial contracting problem okay if we
 

00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:40.679
financial contracting problem okay if we
want to borrow or get money from an

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:40.689
want to borrow or get money from an
 

00:13:40.689 --> 00:13:42.900
want to borrow or get money from an
investor how do we write specify the

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:42.910
investor how do we write specify the
 

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.900
investor how do we write specify the
decision rights in that relationship it

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:45.910
decision rights in that relationship it
 

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.720
decision rights in that relationship it
can be applied to organization design so

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:48.730
can be applied to organization design so
 

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.699
can be applied to organization design so
who should have the right to decide

00:13:50.699 --> 00:13:50.709
who should have the right to decide
 

00:13:50.709 --> 00:13:52.590
who should have the right to decide
should the boss decide on everything or

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600
should the boss decide on everything or
 

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.030
should the boss decide on everything or
should you delegate more to the

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040
should you delegate more to the
 

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.619
should you delegate more to the
employees that's a problem you can

00:13:55.619 --> 00:13:55.629
employees that's a problem you can
 

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:58.530
employees that's a problem you can
analyze with this theory and the last

00:13:58.530 --> 00:13:58.540
analyze with this theory and the last
 

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.269
analyze with this theory and the last
one which I'm going to spend a little

00:14:00.269 --> 00:14:00.279
one which I'm going to spend a little
 

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:02.869
one which I'm going to spend a little
bit more time on is the issue of

00:14:02.869 --> 00:14:02.879
bit more time on is the issue of
 

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:05.460
bit more time on is the issue of
privatization okay so let's say your

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:05.470
privatization okay so let's say your
 

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.519
privatization okay so let's say your
government wants some public service to

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:08.529
government wants some public service to
 

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:10.379
government wants some public service to
be provided we can think about a prison

00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:10.389
be provided we can think about a prison
 

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:13.289
be provided we can think about a prison
or you know healthcare hospital or a

00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:13.299
or you know healthcare hospital or a
 

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:16.169
or you know healthcare hospital or a
school or you know garbage collection

00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:16.179
school or you know garbage collection
 

00:14:16.179 --> 00:14:18.929
school or you know garbage collection
okay should the government own this

00:14:18.929 --> 00:14:18.939
okay should the government own this
 

00:14:18.939 --> 00:14:22.169
okay should the government own this
service provider or should you write the

00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:22.179
service provider or should you write the
 

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:24.389
service provider or should you write the
contract with a private service provider

00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399
contract with a private service provider
 

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:28.019
contract with a private service provider
okay now without in complete contracting

00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:28.029
okay now without in complete contracting
 

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:29.909
okay now without in complete contracting
theory you really can't think about

00:14:29.909 --> 00:14:29.919
theory you really can't think about
 

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:32.669
theory you really can't think about
ownership because so let's say that the

00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:32.679
ownership because so let's say that the
 

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:34.619
ownership because so let's say that the
government wants to get both high

00:14:34.619 --> 00:14:34.629
government wants to get both high
 

00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:36.509
government wants to get both high
quality of this service but they also

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:36.519
quality of this service but they also
 

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.129
quality of this service but they also
want cost efficiency you don't want to

00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:38.139
want cost efficiency you don't want to
 

00:14:38.139 --> 00:14:40.229
want cost efficiency you don't want to
spend too much taxpayers money on

00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:40.239
spend too much taxpayers money on
 

00:14:40.239 --> 00:14:42.479
spend too much taxpayers money on
getting this service so you have these

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:42.489
getting this service so you have these
 

00:14:42.489 --> 00:14:44.220
getting this service so you have these
two goals now let's say you could

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.230
two goals now let's say you could
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.379
two goals now let's say you could
measure some quality and you could

00:14:46.379 --> 00:14:46.389
measure some quality and you could
 

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:48.269
measure some quality and you could
measure costs well then you would just

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279
measure costs well then you would just
 

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:51.900
measure costs well then you would just
write a paper formance contract that

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:51.910
write a paper formance contract that
 

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.389
write a paper formance contract that
gives you know pace the provider more if

00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399
gives you know pace the provider more if
 

00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:56.309
gives you know pace the provider more if
quality is high and costs are low and

00:14:56.309 --> 00:14:56.319
quality is high and costs are low and
 

00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:59.609
quality is high and costs are low and
less otherwise now in this world it

00:14:59.609 --> 00:14:59.619
less otherwise now in this world it
 

00:14:59.619 --> 00:15:01.079
less otherwise now in this world it
doesn't matter who owns it you could

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:01.089
doesn't matter who owns it you could
 

00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:03.030
doesn't matter who owns it you could
have a government employee that has the

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040
have a government employee that has the
 

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.460
have a government employee that has the
same pay performance contract as let's

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:05.470
same pay performance contract as let's
 

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:07.619
same pay performance contract as let's
say a private provider so to get

00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:07.629
say a private provider so to get
 

00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:10.049
say a private provider so to get
ownership to matter you really have to

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:10.059
ownership to matter you really have to
 

00:15:10.059 --> 00:15:12.419
ownership to matter you really have to
be in the world where contracts are

00:15:12.419 --> 00:15:12.429
be in the world where contracts are
 

00:15:12.429 --> 00:15:14.699
be in the world where contracts are
incomplete you can't exactly specify in

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:14.709
incomplete you can't exactly specify in
 

00:15:14.709 --> 00:15:17.369
incomplete you can't exactly specify in
a contract what good quality is okay for

00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:17.379
a contract what good quality is okay for
 

00:15:17.379 --> 00:15:21.179
a contract what good quality is okay for
example so this gives a role for

00:15:21.179 --> 00:15:21.189
example so this gives a role for
 

00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:22.470
example so this gives a role for
ownership and it's going to be very

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480
ownership and it's going to be very
 

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.970
ownership and it's going to be very
different than if the government owns

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:23.980
different than if the government owns
 

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.039
different than if the government owns
the service provider or if it's private

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:26.049
the service provider or if it's private
 

00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:28.829
the service provider or if it's private
service provider that you pay to do the

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839
service provider that you pay to do the
 

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:31.829
service provider that you pay to do the
service so in general

00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839
service so in general
 

00:15:31.839 --> 00:15:33.509
service so in general
it's very hard if you have a

00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519
it's very hard if you have a
 

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:35.939
it's very hard if you have a
government-owned service to provide good

00:15:35.939 --> 00:15:35.949
government-owned service to provide good
 

00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:37.920
government-owned service to provide good
incentives for either for cost-cutting

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:37.930
incentives for either for cost-cutting
 

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:40.530
incentives for either for cost-cutting
or quality and because it's very hard to

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:40.540
or quality and because it's very hard to
 

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.019
or quality and because it's very hard to
credibly reward government employees for

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:43.029
credibly reward government employees for
 

00:15:43.029 --> 00:15:44.809
credibly reward government employees for
for cutting costs or improving quality

00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:44.819
for cutting costs or improving quality
 

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:47.069
for cutting costs or improving quality
now that doesn't mean that private

00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079
now that doesn't mean that private
 

00:15:47.079 --> 00:15:49.199
now that doesn't mean that private
ownership is always better so Hart's

00:15:49.199 --> 00:15:49.209
ownership is always better so Hart's
 

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:51.809
ownership is always better so Hart's
model really tells you which type of

00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:51.819
model really tells you which type of
 

00:15:51.819 --> 00:15:54.360
model really tells you which type of
factors go in the direction of public or

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:54.370
factors go in the direction of public or
 

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.079
factors go in the direction of public or
private ownership so for example in the

00:15:58.079 --> 00:15:58.089
private ownership so for example in the
 

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:00.389
private ownership so for example in the
situation where cost reductions can

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399
situation where cost reductions can
 

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:03.420
situation where cost reductions can
really hurt quality okay well that would

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:03.430
really hurt quality okay well that would
 

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.549
really hurt quality okay well that would
push you more towards public ownership

00:16:05.549 --> 00:16:05.559
push you more towards public ownership
 

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:10.559
push you more towards public ownership
and if innovations future innovations to

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:10.569
and if innovations future innovations to
 

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:12.269
and if innovations future innovations to
improve quality of services are really

00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279
improve quality of services are really
 

00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.670
improve quality of services are really
important and very hard to specify well

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680
important and very hard to specify well
 

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.920
important and very hard to specify well
that factor tends to move in the

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:16.930
that factor tends to move in the
 

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.900
that factor tends to move in the
direction of a private ownership in this

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:18.910
direction of a private ownership in this
 

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.049
direction of a private ownership in this
model and how competitive a private

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:22.059
model and how competitive a private
 

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:24.329
model and how competitive a private
market will be also turns out to be very

00:16:24.329 --> 00:16:24.339
market will be also turns out to be very
 

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:26.970
market will be also turns out to be very
important if competition is not expected

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:26.980
important if competition is not expected
 

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.730
important if competition is not expected
to work very well well then that goes in

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:29.740
to work very well well then that goes in
 

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.499
to work very well well then that goes in
the direction of public ownership so

00:16:31.499 --> 00:16:31.509
the direction of public ownership so
 

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:33.269
the direction of public ownership so
this isn't the model that says that one

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279
this isn't the model that says that one
 

00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.679
this isn't the model that says that one
thing is always better than the other

00:16:34.679 --> 00:16:34.689
thing is always better than the other
 

00:16:34.689 --> 00:16:36.509
thing is always better than the other
but it tells you that maybe you know

00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519
but it tells you that maybe you know
 

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:38.939
but it tells you that maybe you know
garbage collection has a different

optimal setup than let's say a prison
 

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:48.749
optimal setup than let's say a prison
okay so to conclude this theory has

00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759
okay so to conclude this theory has
 

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:51.059

much as it's study it's the question
about what what kind of structure should

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:24.100
about what what kind of structure should

about what what kind of structure should
be used and and in this regard I think

theory first of all when you start
 

00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:46.720
theory first of all when you start
thinking about it contracts are really

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:46.730
thinking about it contracts are really
 

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.610
thinking about it contracts are really
fundamental we see them everywhere in

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:48.620
fundamental we see them everywhere in
 

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.680
fundamental we see them everywhere in
society all of us are engaged in

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:50.690
society all of us are engaged in
 

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.810
society all of us are engaged in
different types of contracts many

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:52.820
different types of contracts many
 

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.820
different types of contracts many
institutions we see in society you can

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:54.830
institutions we see in society you can
 

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:56.430
institutions we see in society you can
also think about contracts like

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440
also think about contracts like
 

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.289
also think about contracts like
constitutions or property rights and

00:33:59.289 --> 00:33:59.299
constitutions or property rights and
 

00:33:59.299 --> 00:34:01.240
constitutions or property rights and
those kind of things so one thing it's

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:01.250
those kind of things so one thing it's
 

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:03.460
those kind of things so one thing it's
important the second thing is that this

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:03.470
important the second thing is that this
 

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:05.500
important the second thing is that this
is a theory that really has given rise

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:05.510
is a theory that really has given rise
 

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.379
is a theory that really has given rise
to lots of other applications so in many

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:08.389
to lots of other applications so in many
 

00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:10.690
to lots of other applications so in many
many fields not just in economics but in

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:10.700
many fields not just in economics but in
 

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:13.419
many fields not just in economics but in
law and politics people actually use

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:13.429
law and politics people actually use
 

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:17.109
law and politics people actually use
these theories to understand

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119
 
 

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.020
 
is this a big big area of research and

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.030
is this a big big area of research and
 

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.569
is this a big big area of research and
economic sciences it's huge

00:34:22.569 --> 00:34:22.579
economic sciences it's huge
 

00:34:22.579 --> 00:34:24.430
economic sciences it's huge
I would say it's literally huge and it

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440
I would say it's literally huge and it
 

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.460
I would say it's literally huge and it
really started taking off first with you

Oliver Hart both of those strands have
 

00:34:36.379 --> 00:34:38.619
Oliver Hart both of those strands have
proven incredibly influential across

give an example of the value of this

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:43.700
give an example of the value of this
 

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.950
give an example of the value of this
type of research if it can be more

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:44.960
type of research if it can be more
 

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:49.300
type of research if it can be more
concrete so well I mentioned to two

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:49.310
concrete so well I mentioned to two
 

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:51.430
concrete so well I mentioned to two
examples in the press conference one is

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440
examples in the press conference one is
 

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.650
examples in the press conference one is
you know thinking about how to decide

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:53.660
you know thinking about how to decide
 

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:57.190
you know thinking about how to decide
pay for for example for CEOs and firms

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200
pay for for example for CEOs and firms
 

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.340
pay for for example for CEOs and firms
you know how do you balance incentive

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.350
you know how do you balance incentive
 

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.410
you know how do you balance incentive
pay which makes maybe them be more

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:02.420
pay which makes maybe them be more
 

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:05.380
pay which makes maybe them be more
motivated but how do you avoid you know

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:05.390
motivated but how do you avoid you know
 

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.480
motivated but how do you avoid you know
bonuses and incentive pay leading to

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:07.490
bonuses and incentive pay leading to
 

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.460
bonuses and incentive pay leading to
wrong decisions being made in companies

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:09.470
wrong decisions being made in companies
 

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.410
wrong decisions being made in companies
so the theory is super useful to

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:11.420
so the theory is super useful to
 

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.360
so the theory is super useful to
understand that problem not just to

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:13.370
understand that problem not just to
 

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.900
understand that problem not just to
explain what happens but actually help

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:15.910
explain what happens but actually help
 

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.980
explain what happens but actually help
shareholders or corporate boards to

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:17.990
shareholders or corporate boards to
 

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.890
shareholders or corporate boards to
design better contracts as well the

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:20.900
design better contracts as well the
 

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.200
design better contracts as well the
second example I mentioned was you know

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:23.210
second example I mentioned was you know
 

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.300
second example I mentioned was you know
ownership okay so how do we think about

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:25.310
ownership okay so how do we think about
 

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:28.960
ownership okay so how do we think about
ownership does it matter who owns what

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:28.970
ownership does it matter who owns what
 

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:29.710
ownership does it matter who owns what
okay

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720
okay
 

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.410
okay
so to be very concrete privatization

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:32.420
so to be very concrete privatization
 

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.260
so to be very concrete privatization
right does it matter whether a provider

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:35.270
right does it matter whether a provider
 

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.450
right does it matter whether a provider
of public services is owned by the

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:37.460
of public services is owned by the
 

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.280
of public services is owned by the
government or owned by a private

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:39.290
government or owned by a private
 

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.700
government or owned by a private
contractor and to understand this

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:42.710
contractor and to understand this
 

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:44.710
contractor and to understand this
problem and the trade-offs there this

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720
problem and the trade-offs there this
 

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.750
problem and the trade-offs there this
theory that Oliver Hart developed an

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760
theory that Oliver Hart developed an
 

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.730
theory that Oliver Hart developed an
incomplete contracting is absolutely

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:48.740
incomplete contracting is absolutely
 

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.930
incomplete contracting is absolutely
crucial to think about that as the

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:52.940
crucial to think about that as the
 

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.490
crucial to think about that as the
ordinary consumer like you and me who

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:54.500
ordinary consumer like you and me who
 

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.350
ordinary consumer like you and me who
sometimes sign contracts and I think you

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:56.360
sometimes sign contracts and I think you
 

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.450
sometimes sign contracts and I think you
learn about this yeah well I think we

00:35:58.450 --> 00:35:58.460
learn about this yeah well I think we
 

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.900
learn about this yeah well I think we
understand for example why when we have

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:01.910
understand for example why when we have
 

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.300
understand for example why when we have
an insurance for our house and it burns

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:04.310
an insurance for our house and it burns
 

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.780
an insurance for our house and it burns
down what we have a loss why doesn't the

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:07.790
down what we have a loss why doesn't the
 

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:10.090
down what we have a loss why doesn't the
insurance company cover everything okay

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:10.100
insurance company cover everything okay
 

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.960
insurance company cover everything okay
so we would like our you know to be

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:13.970
so we would like our you know to be
 

00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:15.640
so we would like our you know to be
fully covered but we usually have a

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:15.650
fully covered but we usually have a
 

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:18.100
fully covered but we usually have a
deductible or a co-payment okay that may

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.110
deductible or a co-payment okay that may
 

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.370
deductible or a co-payment okay that may
be the first whatever loss we have to

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:21.380
be the first whatever loss we have to
 

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.950
be the first whatever loss we have to
pay ourselves and contract theory

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960
pay ourselves and contract theory
 

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.660
pay ourselves and contract theory
explains for example why that's the case

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:25.670
explains for example why that's the case
 

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.120
explains for example why that's the case
because if we were fully covered let's

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:28.130
because if we were fully covered let's
 

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:30.040
because if we were fully covered let's
say our car insurance paid for the full

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.050
say our car insurance paid for the full
 

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.410
say our car insurance paid for the full
value of our car well then maybe we

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:32.420
value of our car well then maybe we
 

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.640
value of our car well then maybe we
wouldn't care about whether we locked

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:33.650
wouldn't care about whether we locked
 

00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:35.080
wouldn't care about whether we locked
the car or not or someone stole it

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:35.090
the car or not or someone stole it
 

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.260
the car or not or someone stole it
because you know we would anyway get a

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:38.270
because you know we would anyway get a
 

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.350
because you know we would anyway get a
new car from the insurance guy so these

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:41.360
new car from the insurance guy so these
 

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.320
new car from the insurance guy so these
two things it's just giving us insurance

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:44.330
two things it's just giving us insurance
 

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:46.300
two things it's just giving us insurance
but also making sure we have the right

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:46.310
but also making sure we have the right
 

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.760
but also making sure we have the right
incentives to be careful the trade-off

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:48.770
incentives to be careful the trade-off
 

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:50.510
incentives to be careful the trade-off
between these two things

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520
between these two things
 

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.280
between these two things
thing we can understand and analyze with

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:52.290
thing we can understand and analyze with
 

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:55.340
thing we can understand and analyze with
contract insurance compasses companies

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:55.350
contract insurance compasses companies
 

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:56.870
contract insurance compasses companies
interested in this field research know

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880
interested in this field research know
 

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.610
interested in this field research know
that insurance companies are hugely

00:36:58.610 --> 00:36:58.620
that insurance companies are hugely
 

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.470
that insurance companies are hugely
interested in this type of research

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480
interested in this type of research
 

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.120
interested in this type of research
actually a lot of the insurance

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.130
actually a lot of the insurance
 

00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:04.550
actually a lot of the insurance
companies were among the first people or

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560
companies were among the first people or
 

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.190
companies were among the first people or
real world people who really started

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200
real world people who really started
 

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.680
real world people who really started
thinking about contract theory and how

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:09.690
thinking about contract theory and how
 

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.480
thinking about contract theory and how
to balance insurance and incentives and

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:14.490
to balance insurance and incentives and
 

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.250
to balance insurance and incentives and
contracts are sometimes program just

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260
contracts are sometimes program just
 

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.820
contracts are sometimes program just
economists economy and money is there

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:19.830
economists economy and money is there
 

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:21.140
economists economy and money is there
any political lessons to be learned

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:21.150
any political lessons to be learned
 

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.580
any political lessons to be learned
about this type of research there's

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:22.590
about this type of research there's
 

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:24.680
about this type of research there's
actually lots of political lessons

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:24.690
actually lots of political lessons
 

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.540
actually lots of political lessons
because a lot of political institutions

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:26.550
because a lot of political institutions
 

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.880
because a lot of political institutions
you can think about as contracts between

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:28.890
you can think about as contracts between
 

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.130
