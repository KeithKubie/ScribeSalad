00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:14.030
So, what'll it be, Mister... The name's Bond.
Ionic bond. Taken, not shared. Hello and welcome

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.780
to The Lab, where we take your questions and
turn them into experiments every Sunday. My

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.260
name's Mitch and I'm Greg and today we're
going to be getting drunk in the name of science.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.119
So study's actually show that it's really
hard when you're drinking to predict how drunk

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.570
you actually are, so we're gonna play with
that a little bit. We're going to be doing

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.559
something else. Oh yeah, we're gonna actually
also be seeing if can trick a breathalyzer

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.309
into thinking we're not drunk after we've
already had quite a bit to drink. And we're

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.270
gonna test some scientific theories about
whether or not you can sober up really quickly.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.209
So we're essentially going to have a really
fast party. Test #1. To start, we want to

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:50.110
say that obviously we are here trying to have
a talk about alcohol as a chemical that enters

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.289
your body and is a poison and is something
that can be very addictive. So, we're not

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.390
condoning alcohol, but we're trying to, you
know, scientifically look at what it does

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.739
to our bodies as something that many people
in our society do it's a really strong custom

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.450
and part of our culture. On that note, cheers!
So, an interesting thing about beer that relates

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.720
to science is that Niels Bohr, who was a Danish
scientist, after receiving the Nobel Prize,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.780
Karlsberg, a very famous Danish--Danish famish--brewery
actually opened a line of beer right directly

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.770
to his house on tap so that Niels Bohr after
receiving his Nobel Prize got to have beer

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.540
whenever he wanted. I feel like more people
who try to get Nobel Prizes if they knew that

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.380
was the reward. Mmm! Ah! Did you know that
a "butt" is a Medieval measurement--like B,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:43.619
U, T, T, like my butt--is 126 gallons of wine?
Yeah, uh, did not know that. Oh, the oaky

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.590
texture is divine. Oh, it smells like a $4
wine, doesn't it? *burping* So, next up, we

00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.159
have a Canadian delicacy known as the caesar.
Mmm! Tastes like Zoodles. It is like spicy.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.920
Tastes like Zoodles. I'm feeling kind of tipsy.
Studies actually show that when you think

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.310
that you're the most drunk, your actual peak
drunkenness is 25 minutes after you actually

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.000
think that it is. So, I'm feeling very drunk
right now and so I'm worried about myself

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.159
in 25 minutes. Over here we've got sober,
feeling good, this is you know, where you

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:27.030
can and can't drive, and so we are going to
take our little action pieces and decide and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.629
estimate where we are. Here's 0.09 because
I think that I couldn't drive. I think if

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.209
a cop stopped me right now, I'd be like, I'm
sorry, here's my jail time.Ithink I'll put

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.569
mine a little lower, like probably right on
0.08. *blowing into breathalyzer* 0.02! So

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.780
I actually was overestimating. That's how
careful I am. *blowing into breathalyzer*

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.800
0.03! Okay, so I'm at the feeling good section.
Yeah, do you feel good? I feel good. That's

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.799
true. But I mean, I would probably feel good
here too. I feel like if I was the government

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.950
of Canada, I would be like, lower that to
like 0.03. According to science, drinking

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.270
diet drinks with your alcohol will get you
drunk faster. And it does make sense and it

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.379
is true because what happens is the sugar
acts as a meal so it holds the alcohol in

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.180
your stomach for longer and your stomach actually
absorbs alcohol much slower than your small

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.420
intestine. So when you drink diet cokes, the
alcohol makes its way to your small intestine

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.360
faster, therefore where it is absorbed more,
so if you really, for whatever reason, want

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.560
to get drunk very fast, you do use diet cola.
Okay--this is too much to go on the internet.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.959
I am so ashamed. Wait, everyone keeps talking
about the internet. What's the internet? I

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.200
like don't know what it is. Everyone's always
like, what's it like to have a job on the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.519
internet and I'm like "what?" Did you know
that the British Navy actually found that

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.189
rum would stop their scurvy when they're at
sea? Did you know that? Do you believe that?

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.659
No. It was an interesting finding until they
realized it was actually the lime that they

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.250
were putting in their rum that was helping
to fight off the scurvy but they for the longest

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.310
time thought that the rum itself had some
magical ingredient. Oh, the British. *does

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.040
bad Cockney accent* Oh, that alcohol will
save you. Rum innite? This is one of my favourite

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.281
drink. Yeah, rum and coke. This is Mitch's
poison. Ohhh, Ah!!! *laughs* We're going to

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:26.280
do some vodka and coke, also known as a "voke".
OOOOH, that's university! One weird thing

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.850
about vodka is that it actually goes bad and
you're not supposed to keep it for more than

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.950
12 months. Really? Why do we feel this way?
We're obviously intoxicated at this point.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.380
What is alcohol doing to us? Actually, alcohol
is slowing down our brain and our neuron's

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.310
responses... There are two different types
of neurons. Some are excitatory and some are

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.790
inhibitory. And so alcohol actually slows
down the excitatory neurons and stimulates

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.970
the inhibitory neurons. Now, normally those
inhibitory neurons help to guide your thoughts,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.440
so that your brain isn't just being stimulated
crazily. But alcohol actually stimulates those

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.310
more, so you shut down a lot of the process
in your brain. You stop paying attention to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.510
those external sources or noises around you
that your brain is really good at picking

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:17.410
up. You think a lot about nothing. Picture
this: Magic School Bus. Coming to Netflix.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.100
And then like a weird live-action lizard running
up Julianne Moore's arm and it's like, "Get

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:27.530
in the bus." And it's like 2017. I would be
like *breathes heavily*. I have to pee pretty

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.660
bad. Are you at that point? I can explain
this. So, in our kidneys, it's really important

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.720
that you have your anti-dieuretic hormone
which re-absorbs water back into your body,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.440
because you don't want to just get rid of
water, because water is what makes you live.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.490
And so, alcohol binds to that anti-dieuretic
hormone and so when it binds to it, therefore

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.770
you don't re-absorb water back into your body,
you just piss it all out. That's why when

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.560
you go out to bars and you drink lots of beer,
you just pee all the time and therefore you

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.830
become dehydrated and therefore you become
hungover and therefore you have to pee really

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.350
bad right now, because alcohol's binding to
your anti-dieuretic hormone and that's why

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.510
you have to pee. Also, the most important
thing in the world is science. Girl, I'm gonna

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.840
whip out some diet--straight to the brain.
Straight to the small intestine. True. So

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.300
are you near blurred vision and speech, or
are you close to sad? I think that I'm probably

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:23.280
at 0.10 and I have zero idea what's going
on. Your turn! I think I'm probably 0.13.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:38.360
You're drunker than me! *laughing* We should
pose with it like our baby. Tharr she blows!

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:48.710
*breathes in loudly* 0.08! If any cop were
to pull me over right now and was like "you

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.400
can go sir!" I'd be like "no, no, no, no!
You're protecting the people. Don't let me

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.280
go." Lower it Canada! I'm 0.08 as well. Consider
that in most places, 0.05 is the limit, so

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.080
we're actually over it. You can't really predict.
We've been so bad at not only predicting it.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.790
I kind of thought we'd be like "oh, we're
always feeling good," but we're more drunk.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:17.720
I honestly thought that we'd be like more
drunk but actually down here. So, one myth

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.250
I've come across on the internet is that peanut
butter can actually stop or hide the fact

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.990
that you're drunk. And another theory is that
if you suck on a penny, you can actually do

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.880
a breathalyzer test and the results will be
a lot lower than you think that they are.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.620
Allegedly, the sodium in the peanut butter
binds to the ethanol in the alcohol and somehow

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:44.700
stops the breathalyzer from picking it up.
I think that the science for the penny...

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:54.331
It's just a rumour. Mmm, I love peanut butter.
Ew. I can't believe I'm doing this. How's

00:07:54.331 --> 00:08:02.230
the penny? I'm sucking on the Queen right
now. This is so gross. I went down .01! Wow!

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:07.670
It went down! So mine may have gone down a
little bit, but it's still above the legal

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:12.990
limit. This did not make any drastic change
to what I was doing. I think a 0.01 change

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.610
is negligable enough that it doesn't necessarily
mean it could have been anything. It definitely

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:23.120
is not just from sucking on a penny. I would
still be in trouble and have a DUI--I would

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.920
be over the limit. Okay, so scientists have
shown that potentially honey could be the

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.829
cure for your drunkenness. And what they did,
is that actually got mice intoxicated. They

00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:37.629
found out that when they gave mice honey and
certain ones not, the ones that got honey

00:08:37.629 --> 00:08:42.060
were actually better able to perform specific
climbing tests better and were able to have

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.110
their dexterity be heightened. And so essentially
they were like "okay, honey maybe has done

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.680
some stuff to these mice", but they don't
know exactly why. So we are going to be the

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.510
first human subjects who clearly right now
are drunk. This is not okay though because

00:08:56.510 --> 00:09:03.220
like mine's gone down by zero. It's like SO,
SO intensely full of glucose and sugar that

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:09.209
I actually think my body's like. Maybe these
mice were just like shocked. *gagging* I don't

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:13.610
think this is a reasonable way to sober up,
because you just feel sick. In the study,

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:19.439
the scientists argue that it increases otonomic
activity, kind of as if we were just saying,

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:23.190
like if a cop shows up at a party, and all
of a sudden you think, I know exactly what

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.199
to do. I'm only .01 down below of where I
was before and I feel like that would be a

00:09:28.199 --> 00:09:32.170
natural progression from the wait. Mine stayed
the same. In this case it did not work. In

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:43.420
the meantime, it's time for THIS WEEK IN SCIENCE
TALK! So this week, we're hungover. A one-year-old

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.639
girl with leukemia has receieved modified
immune cells from a healthy donor, which has

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:51.360
put her cancer into remission. This type of
therapy has actually already been done on

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.320
an HIV patient in the past, where they took
healthy t-cells from another subject and put

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.439
them inside of him. This gene-editing technology
could be a glimpse into the future of medical

00:10:00.439 --> 00:10:05.290
care. Soon scientists will be intimately studying
how 10,000 New Yorkers live their lives, where

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.700
they go, what they eat, how they grow, etc.
This will help to gain new bio-medical and

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:14.970
sociological information to help inspire new
groundbreaking studies. *singing* THIS DATA

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:19.410
WILL INSPIRE YOU. Swedish scientists have
discovered that high-intensity-interval-training,

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.939
or working out really hard for short periods
of time, offers the same endurance benefits

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:28.420
as longer, more time consuming exercizes that
are less intense. This really intense training

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.550
creates free radicals that break down calcium
levels, ultimately increasing the power of

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:39.800
muscle cells. Less gym time means more Zelda
time. Thanks again for watching another episode
