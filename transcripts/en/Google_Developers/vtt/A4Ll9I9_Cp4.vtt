TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.793
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.560
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.444
The Google Maps API team
maintains client libraries

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.860
that give you the
power to develop

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.400
with confidence that your
app will scale smoothly.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.580
We provide client libraries
for Python, Java, Go,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.615
and now Node.js.

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:22.990
For the links and
some highlights

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.930
of how these libraries can help
you, head on over to the post

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.590
linked in the description below.

Service workers
give you the ability

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.360
to respond to network requests
made by your web applications,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.950
allowing them to continue
working even while offline.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.330
But they've historically been
tied to a specific origin.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.489

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910

a post highlighting six features
that were designed specifically

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.160
