Hey, everybody, Matt here for a DNews Short.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.700
There may come a day when you’ll have dragonflies
to thank for improving your health.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.970
Turns out, dragonflies are helping scientists
develop smarter medical devices based on the

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.770
unique bacteria-killing abilities of their
wings.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.789
Scientists have known for a while that dragonfly
wings are composed of nanopillars, which are

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.500
small, spike-like pillars on the surface of
the wings.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.869
But a new study in ASC Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces
found that these nanopillars play a role in

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.960
killing bacteria by physically ripping them
apart.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.010
The pillars are of varying sizes and look
similar to what scientists have referred to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.290
as a bed of nails.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.320
However, instead of puncturing the bacterial
membrane, as researchers previously thought,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.359
the new study found that the bacteria secrete
a substance that traps them in the pillars.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.449
You can see in this image here how the bacteria
become stuck on the dragonfly wing.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.340
When the bacteria try to move, the force of
their adhesion to the nanopillars tears them

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.510
apart, spilling out their contents and killing
the bacteria.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.590
Ouch!

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.010
Dragonflies aren’t the only insects with
this winged superpower.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430
The nanostructures of cicada wings are built
similarly.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.199
However, cicada nanopillars aren’t tall
enough to kill certain bacteria that have

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.790
thick membranes, like MRSA and strep, whereas
dragonfly nanopillars can.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.120
Inspired by the dragonfly and cicada wings,
scientists have started developing medical

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.830
materials that mimic the structure of nanopillars
in hopes of creating versatile bacteria-killing

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.830
surfaces.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.650
The science has already made its way onto
many medical tools and could be used on food-processing

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.480
and even in public facilities.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.170
These bacteria-ripping materials could have
a tremendous impact on everything from the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.850
operating room to Monday morning’s busy
commute.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.240
However, research is still very much underway,
and it could be a while before you can clutch

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.961
the railing of a crowded bus and not worry
about catching the next bug.

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:40.240
But when that time does come, I guarantee,
it’ll be all the buzz.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.270
But did you know there are actually bacteria-eating
viruses?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.340
Check out this video to learn more.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.500
So what surface would you most want to be
covered in antibacterial coating?
