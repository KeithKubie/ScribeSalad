00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:04.185
 How many problems would you like to not be? 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.180
 This is a strange question because you want to have something to fight with. 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.120
 Do you want to have something 

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:13.365
 what pulls you the best you have. 

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.195
 You have to have real problems or something like that. 

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.865
 If you get rid of everyone, you'll be lying 

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.015
 on the bed and the problems will put you in your mouth 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.745
 if all your problems were resolved. 

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:28.520
 So maybe you want hard problems you can solve 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.380
 because, I don't know exactly what it is, but overcoming it 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 and the growth that comes with it. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.415
 The effort itself is noble, 

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.665
 you can see it when you have children, for example. 

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:43.000
 The psychological literature is clear: 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.140
 if you compare the moments of life of people who have and don't have children, 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 so people who do not have children are happier. 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.520
 And so psychologists who tend to misunderstand things, even though they make such intelligent discoveries, 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.160
 right away - some - draw a conclusion 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.660
 that if "happiness is a goal," 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.740
 so then if something on the kids makes you unhappy, it's not good. 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.100
 But the moment, maybe it is wrong. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.940
 Of course you are less happy with children because you have to worry about them. 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.200
 My neighbor in the street, a reasonable woman, once said to me: 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.840
 You can be just as happy as your happiest child. 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.820
 I thought: that's really good, really reasonable. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.360
 But then, if having kids doesn't make you happy, then don't have kids! 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.020
 Don't be so crazy to be happy, that's the answer! 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.240
 Because effort is noble: now you are responsible. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 You have a new baby; you think, especially if you are a primipar, you think: 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.500
 What the hell is that? What am I going to do about it? 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 And you have fun for the end of your life, you never sleep properly 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.180
 for you will have to worry about it, you have to take care of it. 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.840
 Why are you good if you don't do that or something like that? 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 You have not yet been called until you take something similar on account. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:14.420
 It happens that happiness is the meaning of life; it is super to be happy and when it succeeds, enjoy it. 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.800
 But the idea that you should try to do that is the most miserable. 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000
 First, if something terrible happens to you, it's over. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.500
 Life must be happy, but what if you get cancer? 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.100
 What about it? How does this happiness thing work now? 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.380
 Maybe not you, but your father will get Alzheimer's disease or other damn sickness. 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.640
 There is an exception if someone has no tragedy with a loved one. 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.020
 Life is to be happy - that's not true. 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.680
 We can draw that from those stories, but they don't. 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.420
 God in those stories is happy to give the people with whom he has made a covenant of happiness and prosperity, 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.000
 but nowhere is there a word that this is the goal. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.580
 The rule is: peace up and hell up! 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.220
 It is also a rule and constitutes the ultimate ideal of the covenant. 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.915
 And that will lead you through disasters. 

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:13.805
 And this is a much more mature view of life. 

00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:17.960
 Just have your eyes half open and see 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.280
 that elementary reality in life is pain and suffering. 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.580
 It cannot be avoided. This does not mean that life becomes unbearable, 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.740
 or that such a thing should not exist. That's not the point. 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.380
 That means you have to fight it and you have to be ready 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.360
 and have the will to take responsibility for oneself and others. This is a prerequisite. 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.320
 And maybe then, if you do well, here and there you get a little luck 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.580
 you will sit in the evening and have a half hour: your conscience is clean, 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.300
 you don't have to do anything, you can relax and think: 

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:57.405
 that's okay, things are good, thank God for that. 

00:03:57.405 --> 00:04:00.375
 And maybe you'll get your luck here. 

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.705
 That's teenage, of course. 

00:04:05.705 --> 00:04:11.740
 And not knowing if anyone doesn't teach you, they should teach everyone!
