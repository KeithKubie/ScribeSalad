Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radio from W N Y s e n p r gave this a Jad Abumrad. This is radio lab, the podcast. Robert is out of town today. He's actually um, his son is getting married. So it's just me. I thought in this podcast a and wander a little bit

Speaker 2:          00:29          [inaudible] generally and that should be in front of your mouth. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33          So I'm gonna Start with a conversation that uh, Brooke Gladstone and I, this is Brooke from on the media that she and I had with my brother in law Eugene. I am Eugene Thacker. I am an author and professor at the new school in New York City. We talked about this very weird thing that happened to Eugene and I asked Brooke to join me cause I just felt like her kind of story. I've been wearing black since I was 13. I just want to point out that the two of you are head to toe in black right now. Any case to set it up. Eugene is a hard core scholar of philosophy and he writes these books that um, sometimes can be a little dense. I mean, he'll use words like exegesis and radio sunation. And so the family joke is that he writes books for no one.

Speaker 1:          01:18          I think the joke started out, I write books that nobody reads. And then after a slow, long period of acceptance, I started to think, well, maybe I should write books for no one to read. And just sort of embrace that meaning at a certain point, if you do this kind of work, you kind of have to ask yourself, if you knew that this would not be published, would you still write it? How committed are you? And he decided he was committed. He would write it no matter what. So the story begins a couple of years ago, and I'm 2011 Eugene writes this book called in the dust of this planet, in the dust of this planet. It's kind of a hard book to describe, but if you had to sum it up in a sentence, it's a about the end of the world, but not in the Hollywood sense.

Speaker 1:          02:01          It's darker than that. Your hypothesis is the greatest horror is that nothing exists and nothing matters. And the world that we live in that we define in terms of humanity doesn't care about us. What in philosophy is often referred to as nihilism or pessimism that there might not be a purpose to things or to your life or to our existence or to the cosmos. There might not be an order to things. We might not be here for a reason. This all might be purely arbitrary and an accident that there's no inherent meaning to anything, but it just doesn't matter. This is what Nietzsche called most difficult thought and in the book, Eugene traces this idea through all of these different horror movies from slasher films to sort of more supernatural horror and also music. I mean, at one point he goes into this deconstruction of how different types of black metal with this thought. I Dunno, it's, it's something, it's a way of thinking. I've always found really intriguing and ironically kind of inspiring. Are you a pessimist on my better days? Are you a nihilist? Not as much as I should be. Okay, so Eugene writes this book in 2011 it is dark, it is dense. He writes it as he says, for no one. And as expected, beyond a few philosophy types, no one really pays attention. So he keeps his head down teaching, writing, but then some things happen.

Speaker 3:          03:38          Hmm. 2014 ghettos in the world. I saw on get, Oh man, Jack Gutter and outer space to show true detective comes along.

Speaker 1:          03:50          It comes to big head. And at the center of the show is this character Russ Cole, this Louisiana detective who is one dark dude. I think human

Speaker 3:          03:59          consciousness is the tragic misstep and evolution. He goes on these rants about how there's no order in the world, how humans are just this accident. And we have to deal with that. I'd consider myself Hurria last time, but in philosophical terms on what's called a pessimist.

Speaker 4:          04:13          And I just remember watching it and being like, wow, that's Eugene's wife, Prima Murphy, my sister-in-law. I was like, this replicates so many conversations that we've had in the car. She's like, were they listening in on us? Yeah, it was eerie. So prayma goes online, clicks around and all of a sudden I see this article about, um, the true detective director.

Speaker 1:          04:36          It was an article where actually the writer of the show, nick a lotto was asked how did you create that character of the nihilist police detective? And he lists a bunch of things he was reading at the time.

Speaker 4:          04:46          And included in that list was Eugene to which I was like, cool.

Speaker 1:          04:54          At least one person is reading the book. But I really just try to keep my head to the ground and just keep writing, just doing what I'm doing. But then things got weird. Okay, so now let's pull up the um, the Lucky magazine and see if I can find it. Short time later, prima is flipping through this fashion magazine, Lucky magazine. And there was a spread with this actress Lily Collins, 25 year old actress I'd never heard of. Pretty big. Right now she's standing on a street corner dressed up and all of this sort of goth makeup and clothing. And in the photo she is wearing Eugene's book on her chest she had on and one of the shots of sweatshirt that had the cover of the book in the dust of this planet. Big letters right on her chest. And I was just like, no way. You know, it was definitely,

Speaker 4:          05:45          this is crazy. Like what? She's just casually wearing my husband's book cover.

Speaker 1:          05:51          I Dunno. Again, I didn't react to you, but it was just strange. Turns out a Norwegian artists had made a painting of the book. That image had gotten picked up by a fashion label and turned into some very expensive clothes. You know, I write books for no underwriting, so obviously I'm not pulling in a lot of royalties on these, but you know, Eugene says he's not going to sue. I'm not going to see her take any legal action or really do anything about it because he says that's not why he writes. Okay. So that happened, but then it gets weird are still

Speaker 5:          06:27          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:27          So one day my wife Carla Murthy is online. This is the day that Jay z and Beyonce announced they're going to do this big international tour. Carla's watching the video that they released to promote that to a sort of a fake movie. Right?

Speaker 5:          06:40          This is all, I'm the one that's all flashy guns. Fire occurs.

Speaker 1:          06:48          Here's smart guy. It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. I mean, it's some kind of Bonnie and Clyde thing, I think. I mean, they're running from someone, you're not quite sure who Beyonce is in a wedding dress. She's got a veil on, but she shooting semiautomatic weapons in her wedding dress, cut tech, car chases, cut their money flying everywhere, but it exactly, 37 seconds in chorus, go back, go back, go back. It's like you're making me think too fast. You see Jay z turn stick a giant gun out to his right and he is wearing Eugene's book. Hey, my life right there on his back in the dust of this planet. Uh, a sound as well, and make them smile.

Speaker 1:          07:32          Yeah. This is the point at which I was like, okay, what do we make of this? I mean, could it be that Eugene is no longer writing books for no one, that somehow he has become a conduit for this idea that we all in that subterranean way that pop music operates, that we all are channeling right now? That was my thought. Yeah. No, I think that's, uh, that's the question is whether this is something particular to the moment we're living in and Eugene, his knee jerk reaction is, I think it could have been this cover or a million other covers. No, this is just meaningless appropriation. I don't think there's anything more than that to me then it's just, it looks like a cool phrase to go on a tee shirt to put on a golf Carla in some photo shoots. And why is it cool?

Speaker 1:          08:20          Right? Cause my hunch is you might be right, but you also might be wrong because of the answer that you're about to give to Brooks question. It's cool because some publicists, and this was sort of the conversation I wanted to have, and so I called Brooke, like, what is behind all of this nihilistic entertainment that's everywhere. Now, Brooke, for her part, agreed that Eugene probably is tapping into something, yes, but is this unique to this moment? And to that I would say, no, really? You don't think this says anything about now I think there are cycles in which the sense of meaninglessness

Speaker 6:          08:57          comes out in sharper relief than other times, but you can identify them over and over again.

Speaker 7:          09:05          Yeah, nihilism goes all the way back. Brooke actually turned us onto this guy, Simon Critchley and the hands, yon as professor at the new school for social research. Simon wrote an article that, uh, basically made the argument that nihilism is the basic credo of cool because it's, it's sexy. It's interesting and it's been that way forever. Oh, I have to go. I've got, I've got the best thing for you. You love this. It's a Russian word, right? He said the word really got its pop in 1862. This is 150 years ago. There's a novel by two you have called fathers and songs and in the novel, the son who's the nihilist turns to his conservative dad and he says, we base our conduct on what we recognize as useful in these days. The most useful thing we can do is to repudiate. And so we repudiate everything. The father says, everything, everything with indescribable composure. So that's the gnarliest moment everything goes.

Speaker 1:          10:04          And Simon says, roughly from that point on, you see a young people glom on to this idea again and again as a way to, you know, say no to the older generation or to just what's happening in the world. For example, after World War One you had tens of millions of people dead. This lost generation that was confused and disgusted at what had just happened. And out of that says, Brooke, you get Dadada.

Speaker 6:          10:26          I want to pull up here on the computer, the manifesto of Tristan Saara. He was one of the founders of the data movement. You says, Dada means nothing. Everything one looks at is false. I do not die. That abolition of memory, Dada abolition of archeology, Dadada abolition of profits. Dada abolition of the future. And after World War II,

Speaker 1:          10:53          she and Simon say he had similar movements in the 70s and 80s with the threat of nuclear annihilation. You get punk rock. It just keeps going.

Speaker 7:          11:02          Pop Culture, at least since I was a kid, has always been deeply nihilistic,

Speaker 1:          11:06          you know. All right. So it's nothing new. But when I ran Simon through the Eugene jacket situation and then I asked him like, is there something different about today's nihilism versus nihilism of the past? Like is there something more potent about it? Without hesitation, he said,

Speaker 7:          11:25          I see, I see. Yes. Huh? Based on one that's producer Andy Mills who was with me during the interview. Well, you know, you can, you can get, Simon says, it was more of a gut feeling, uh, based on this class that he taught last year with Eugene. Oddly enough, I didn't actually know that they knew each other, but they had taught this class together. So the seminar that we did in the fall last year, it was one of those rare seminars. We're teaching mysticism. Nobody teaches mysticism, really obscure stockwood in desert fathers, medieval female mystics.

Speaker 1:          11:58          This is early Christianity. Neither of us are religious. He says they started the seminar not really expecting much by talking about how in the fourth century, a d there was this sissy Alexandria, this is near Egypt.

Speaker 7:          12:12          My Alexandra was a lot like Manhattan. There was an offshore island. It was a colony of a full Moan Power Roman empire. But it's the cease of old culture and all learning in the ancient world. A certain point in a full century, people start to leave. They start to leave and go into the desert. People wander off and they seem to want something else. The city doesn't just doesn't do it anymore.

Speaker 8:          12:36          Why? It's corrupt. It's broken. It's a, it's sinful. He said crime was rampant pollution. And so people just started to wander off into the desert and live in these caves. And uh, these intense forms of ascetic practice begin like you had these women who were not educated because women couldn't be educated, who is so enraptured with Christ that they began hosting themselves, throwing themselves into icy rivers, jumping into ovens. The body is something which is you're trying to strip away in order that you can free the capacity for love. Like that's a classic mystic idea, right? The body is just getting in the way. I want to go soul to soul with God. Exactly, but the premise of that again is that the,

Speaker 7:          13:19          the world is a kind of field of ruins,

Speaker 1:          13:23          but he says what really struck him is that as he was talking about all this, he would glance out at the students and he would notice this look in their eyes.

Speaker 8:          13:32          I just felt that in the room there was this, this deep need was being fulfilled by these strange mystics. He said the students were just in it in a way that almost never happens when you're teaching. We weren't not saving souls, but it was, it was hissing something really, really deep. What exactly, I mean do you think they were starting to form the thought of wandering into the desert so to speak? Yeah, I think there's a sense of wishy you, you know what? You do a succeed, walk away. You know? That's where a lot of people are are.

Speaker 1:          14:02          As for what's behind it all he says, just turn on the news.

Speaker 8:          14:05          A video showing the beheading of a second American journalist has now been verified as these experts say, this is turning into one of the longest deadliest outbreaks ever. The girls were gang raped on strangled. Once again, it is mostly children we are seeing brought into this hospital. The world I grew up, in my sense it was completely crazy, mutually assured destruction, but it made sense and you could understand it.

Speaker 7:          14:28          Simple terms that he states was the Soviet Union. We were going to be eviscerated. That was clear, but it, you know, you knew what the balance of power was. You're, you're a nostalgic for mutually assured destruction. Is that what's happening now? It seems a much simpler world. Well,

Speaker 1:          14:41          you at least knew who to blame for it. Right? Right. That's Andy. Again, I'd be like, that's the thing. Like you look at the Cold War and you could see like specifically like the

Speaker 9:          14:52          you Americans. Yeah, the nukes. That's right. Right. That's right. And now, yeah. Who am I supposed to say? You too. I'm saying you to everybody. Carbon emissions.

Speaker 1:          15:02          Speaking of which today, the world's leading climate scientists warn it will get worse, no doubt. One of the reasons for the current gloom is that we are in the middle of an uncomfortable shift in how we talk about climate change. Waves will be more frequent and last longer. This is made official when the IPC, the intergovernmental panel on climate change released a report where for the first time they stopped using the language of prevention and shifted to the language of adaptation. In other words, hundreds of scientists and policymakers. This is the world's top organization for assessing climate change. We're now saying we can't stop it. It's inevitable.

Speaker 10:         15:38          And so now we need to talk about dealing with the mass that is now on our doorstep. That's David Victor, professor of international relations at a University of California at San Diego, and he is one of the authors of the report. When the IPC first began back in the late 1980s you could imagine that people would take the climate change problem seriously. They would start to control emissions and then over a period of decades, climate would stop changing. And instead of what's happened is people have talked a lot about climate change, but they haven't actually done much to control emissions.

Speaker 1:          16:08          And now he says, we're all in this strange middle ground where we're trying to find the language to say why it's important to keep working at this while at the same time admitting some degree of failure.

Speaker 10:         16:19          That's the kind of inevitability that I think you see in the new, uh, the new reports and the reports are bending over backwards to try and find ways to be optimistic. You know, the report says if you put into place all these technologies and international agreements, we could, we could still stop warming at two degrees. My own assessment is that the kinds of actions you'd need to do that are so heroic that we're not going to see them on this planet.

Speaker 1:          16:46          Olive, which reminded me of that true detective moment. Okay. I'd consider myself a real last time, but in philosophical terms on what's called a pessimist. Okay. What's that mean? Well, a pessimists like nihilist agree. There's no meaning, they're just a little more mopey about it. Less likely to do something means I'm bad at parties. I mean, is that where we're all headed? You know, in a recent Wall Street Journal poll, 76% of people 18 and over weren't confident that the future is going to be brighter than the past. Which brings me back to Brooks question. Why is it cool? Call it nihilism, pessimism, whatever. Shouldn't it be depressing? Why would you want to put a phrase like in the dust of this planet, a phrase that deliberately negates the person wearing it? Why would you want to put it on your chest or on your back? Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, and since it was Jay z jacket, which was in a way the catalyst for this whole podcast, we decided to talk to him for he sorta that's coming up.

Speaker 6:          19:48          Ron. Good. That sounds great. Over there. Hey, this is jazz. This is radio lab. So we ended up in the flow of things, you know, as we were trying to figure out, like in the dust of this planet. Why isn't that cool? Why isn't it just scary and depressing? We ended up like they want to talk to me. Why? That's a good question. Talking to this lady who it turns out was the person who made the decision to put it on Jay z's back. I should say my name, I guess. Uh, my name is June Ambrose. I've been a costume designer for 22 years. 2023 this year, and I've worked with everyone from Luther Vandross to puck to Sean tomorrow. Carey, Busta rhymes. Mary's your blush. Alicia keys. Dave Matthews, pat backstreet boys. Kelly Ripa can control do this, but a r Kelly, go hit on Jamie Fox. Please do for missy Elliot. Did you do the missy with the balloons? Yeah. That was you. Yeah. Oh my God. And of course Jay Z and Beyonce. That's like culture basically. Yeah. I was responsible for something. That Nazi stuff. It occurred to Andy and I during the interview that June has probably influenced the fashion sense of a significant portion of the human beings on this planet. And she was very clear that a costume is more than just a costume. It's like a conversation

Speaker 1:          21:10          without words. They really, what she's doing, when she styles someone is whispering to all the people that are gonna watch the videos, come in contact with the billboards, go to the concerts.

Speaker 6:          21:21          I don't have to talk to you, but I can create this conversation with a pair of pants and how they fall and how they fit in the texture and the color. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:28          The field. He says with Jay Z for that video,

Speaker 6:          21:34          she knew she needed something epic but like effortless. I knew I wanted a bike, a jacket, cause there was a motorcycle scene, but I knew that I just couldn't give him a black vote. I needed it to, I need it to say some feel like something. We were on the hunt, her and her assistant went to dozens of places, Tillys studios, the showrooms looking at all these leather jackets. It's like finding a needle in a haystack. Nothing was right, but then they sound true into this one place, black denim, this place, it does sort of high end grunge. They're flipping through the racks when she sees it, the jacket, those words, and that was it. I knew it. I said, I need, this is what I need. It just felt, I mean it was just

Speaker 5:          22:15          perfect.

Speaker 1:          22:16          The question was why this point? I hadn't really told her the whole backstory, so I pulled out a screen capture from the video. This is one where you see Jay z sort of standing in the desert, shot from behind in the dust of this planet. On his back and he's kind of pointing this really long dirty Harry gun off to his right. Sorta up like he's about to shoot the sun here. You think he's about to shoot the fence? I printed it out cause it's just got this like billboard quality to it right here it is. I have a really cool one in my phone too, isn't it?

Speaker 6:          22:44          Okay. So let's just look at this for a second. Yeah. So like why did you choose that jacket? Um, you know, it's something very menacing about it. It's almost like

Speaker 5:          22:58          the aftermath

Speaker 6:          23:01          that there was something going on that was periling. It'd be end of an era. The beginning of something new. She says in the back of her head, she was thinking about how the music industry might be dying. It's definitely in a place where it's like, what? Now? You can hear it in the music and you know if this is the biggest tour in history, really what now you know, and these are the whispers that you hear, but she says one of the loudest whispers with super simple, just here's a guy, massive pop star pack, a sovereign, he's in the desert. It's about to go down. The end of the world is literally on his back foot. It was almost as if he didn't even know that was on his back. You know what I mean? It's like that was the afterthought. Like, Oh yeah, the world's ending. Oops, I don't care.

Speaker 1:          23:46          Go on out and stuff. In other words, he wasn't afraid. He wasn't afraid, wasn't afraid. That's what, that's what we talk about whispers. That's what I get from it. Now, now that you said that, it's not so much, I don't give it. I'm not afraid. Yeah. I mean we all have to lead the planet. You know? Everybody has their day. What you work on is not being afraid when you have to leave.

Speaker 6:          24:15          Okay, that'd be cool. Thank you. This is, um, this was after refreshing walking out of that interview. Thank you. This was by the way, after we had told her that phrase on Jay, his back was lifted from him.

Speaker 1:          24:28          A book written by my brother in law Eugene. Oh Wow. No, I need to get the book and I need to get it to Jay, which he was very interested to know. Can we do that? Yeah, let's do that. And we did send him the book. You haven't heard back. Oh my God. Anyhow, walking out of there, I kept thinking, is that what this is all about? That all this pop nihilism around us is not about tearing down power structures or embracing nothingness. It's just look at me, look how brave I am. That I can wear it on a tee shirt. Yeah. I would go with that. And this is why, as you pointed out, you know, from data to punk, this isn't a recurring motif of how, how bad ass you are in facing mortality. Pluto. Badass. That's what I was thinking. I think that that is nothing more than a posture. I mean it's all fine when you're 18 to wear that tee shirt, but when you're like in your fifties dealing with cancer, like okay, you know, maybe, maybe then is when you really have to confront those things. So I just, it's a, it's simply a posture and that's why it's in pop culture. Quite cynical.

Speaker 7:          25:34          Sponsored pizza. Say you know why we love nihilism in pop culture is that it saves us having to be burdened with it. Simon Critchley again, it saves us from feeling it all right, we can, we can enjoy it in our rooms. We can get off on it and then we let it go and we got, we got back to work.

Speaker 1:          25:51          But Simon says, you don't have to be cynical about this if you don't want to be. I mean these are meeting Nietzsche, Mr dark pessimists himself had this idea about nihilism, that it was just the beginning, that if you really dealt with it and took it in, accelerated it to its logical end, you could get to the other side,

Speaker 7:          26:10          which he called a reevaluation of values, some new way of thinking about who we are as moral creatures. And that's, that's kind of where I am and love love is that capacity which can see it through that.

Speaker 1:          26:25          And that he suspects is why his students were so interested in those mystics cause they had found a way through

Speaker 7:          26:30          these people, these mystics have got the own compromising commitment to something like love

Speaker 1:          26:37          the fact that they were ready to go all the way to negate even their own bodies for that love.

Speaker 8:          26:44          Right. So in a world where, where love has been reduced to Tinder exchanges, if that's the hell that you're living in as a 25 year old, then yeah, you got to read these mystics and think I want what she's having.

Speaker 6:          26:56          I'll say, I'll say, I'll take what she's having earned my flesh. That's right by my friends. And you could argue, I mean, why not that Jay Z and Beyonce, you've got a little bit of that going on. I mean, part of what's made this tour, so big biggest tour ever actually is that it's like this grand love story and with the love of my life. So it's, it's like it worked. I have a fantasy, I have a fantasy that Beyonce and Jay z will do this tour and they will go off into the desert and they'll live in a little like this monastic existence together in love in a new and new sort of age of Aquarius. We'll begin starting with the two of them. That's beautiful. The loudest Mike Trap. Oh, any chance of that? Are you gonna really hear me slip, right? Yeah. That was your answer. Finical out on the beach. Maybe a perfect response to Jan's question. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          28:30          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          28:55          so Jen, I can hear that you're going to take a lot of this stuff and you're going to look at the current moment and [inaudible] and see how this idea is expressing itself in this made me want to work to go back and see when and where and how it was x. It's been expressed all along. Okay. So, uh, I'm delighted to be on this. Yeah. And I'm going to be delighted to have you on our show in a couple of weeks. Really? Yeah. We want you to come on after after I've put it together. Love that. We're pulling you in. Oh, beautiful. I'm game. Okay. Thank you for being game for this. Um, you look for on the media's take on nihilism in a couple of weeks. Big thanks to produce Randy Mills,

Speaker 1:          29:42          who the process of helping me, uh, put together this podcast began to say things like other day. I thought of it in the sense of I saw this lady bug, my friends and I, we were watching this lady bug crawl around my shoe and then it started to crawl up my leg. It got caught in my leg, hair fell back down to the shoe, and we were all like, oh, that's life. That's it, man. We're all just bugs crawling around on a God damn shoe. And he was totally serious and special thanks to the Murthy tribe and in two zero books and of course to Eugene Vacher, who even though we harbors no redemptive fantasies about human beings whatsoever, isn't awesome dude. And this piece is an homage to him. One of the most committed writers I know also happens to be my brother-in-law. If you would like to read in the dust of this planet, and I actually do highly recommend it, it's super fascinating. Go to our website, radiolab.org and uh, we'll link you to it. I'm Jad Abumrad thanks for listening. [inaudible].
