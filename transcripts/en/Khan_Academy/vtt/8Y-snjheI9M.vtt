00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:01.893
- [Voiceover] We've used the definite

00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:04.037
integral to find areas.

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.867
What I want to do now is to see if we can

00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:09.406
use the definitive role
to find an arc length.

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:10.934
What do I mean by that?

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:15.291
Well, if I start at this point
on the graph of a function,

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:17.663
and if I were to go at
this point right over here,

00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:19.625
not a straight line, we
know already how to find

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.287
the distance in the straight
line but instead we want

00:00:22.287 --> 00:00:24.719
to find the distance along the curve.

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:26.566
If we lay a string along the curve,

00:00:26.566 --> 00:00:28.562
what would be the
distance right over here?

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:33.312
That's what I'm talking
about by arc length.

00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:36.138
What we could think about it
is okay, that's going to be

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:41.138
from x equals a to x
equals b along this curve.

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.077
So how can we do it?

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:48.377
Well, the one thing that
integration, integral calculus is

00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:49.990
teaching us is that when we see something

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.122
that's changing like
this, what we could do is

00:00:52.122 --> 00:00:55.397
we can break it up into
infinitely small parts.

00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:57.694
Infinitely small parts
that we can approximately

00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:00.275
with things like lines and
rectangles, and then we could

00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:04.081
take the infinite sum of
those infinitely small parts.

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.974
So let me break up my arc length.

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:09.194
Let me break it up into infinitely

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.982
small sections of arc length.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:14.252
Let me call each of those
infinitely small sections

00:01:14.252 --> 00:01:18.428
of my arc length a, I
guess I could say a length

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:23.209
to differential, an arc length
to differential, I call it ds.

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.607
I'll draw it a much bigger
that when I at least

00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:27.351
I conceptualize what a differential is,

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:28.902
just so that we could see it.

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:31.366
What do I mean by breaking
it up into these ds's?

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.059
Well, if that's the ds,

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.762
and then let me do the
others in other colors,

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:39.762
that's another infinitely
small change in my arc length.

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:42.710
Another infinitely small
change in my arc length.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.623
If I summed all of these ds's together,

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:48.473
I'm going to get the arc length.

00:01:48.473 --> 00:01:52.873
The arc length, if I take
is going to be the integral

00:01:52.873 --> 00:01:57.873
of all of these ds's sum
together over this integral

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.782
so we can denote it like this.

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:03.216
But this doesn't help me right now.

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:06.798
This is in terms of this arc
length that's differential.

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:10.127
We do know how to do things
in terms of dx's and dy's.

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:11.305
Let's see if we can re-express this

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:14.258
in terms of dx's and dy's.

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:16.067
If we go on a really, really small scale,

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:17.556
once again, we can approximate.

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:20.066
This is going to be a line.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.425
We just the way that we approximated

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:22.857
area with rectangles at first.

00:02:22.857 --> 00:02:24.049
But if we have an infinite number

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.146
of infinite small
rectangles, we're actually

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.553
approximating a non-rectangular region.

00:02:29.553 --> 00:02:31.113
The area on a non-rectangular region.

00:02:31.113 --> 00:02:32.861
Similarly, we're approximating with lines

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.258
with the infinitely small
and there's infinite number

00:02:35.258 --> 00:02:38.222
of them, you are actually
finding the length of the curve.

00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:42.599
Well, just focusing on
this is a line for now.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.945
This distance right over
here, I'm just going

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:47.019
to try express in terms of dx's and dy's.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.581
So this distance right
over here, that's dx.

00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:54.143
You can do this as
infinitely small change in x,

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:58.189
and this distance right
over here, this is a dy.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.920
Once again, I'm being
loosey-goosey with differentials.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.218
Really giving you
conceptual understanding,

00:03:02.218 --> 00:03:04.697
not a reader's proof, but
it'll give you a sense

00:03:04.697 --> 00:03:08.156
of where the formula for arc
length is actually coming from.

00:03:08.156 --> 00:03:12.649
Based on this, you can see
the ds could be expressed

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.932
based on the Pythagorean
Theorem as equal to dx squared

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:19.271
plus dy squared, or you could rewrite this

00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:22.336
as square root of dx
squared plus dy squared.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.443
So we could rewrite this.

00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:29.051
We could say this is the same
thing as the integral of,

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.365
instead of writing ds,
I'm going to write it

00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:36.365
as the square root of dx
squared plus dy squared.

00:03:45.328 --> 00:03:48.960
Once again, this is straight
out of the Pythagorean Theorem.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.304
Now this is starting to get interesting.

00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:52.140
I've written in terms of dx's and dy's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.065
but they're getting squared.

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:54.032
They're under radical sign.

00:03:54.032 --> 00:03:56.064
What can I do to simplify this?

00:03:56.064 --> 00:04:00.358
Or at least write it in a way
that I know how to integrate.

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:03.946
Well, I could factor out a dx squared,

00:04:03.946 --> 00:04:04.865
so let me just rewrite it.

00:04:04.865 --> 00:04:06.207
This is going to be the same thing

00:04:06.207 --> 00:04:10.952
as the integral of the square root.

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:13.181
I'm going to factor out the dx squared,

00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:18.181
dx squared times one
plus dy over dx squared.

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:27.256
Notice this, and this
is exact same quantity.

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:29.597
If I distribute this dx squared,

00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:31.618
I'm going to get this right up here.

00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:34.526
Now I can take the dx
squared out of the radical.

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:39.526
So this is going to be the integral of,

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.806
let me write that in the white color,

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:47.806
the integral of one plus dy, dx squared.

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.356
This is interesting because
we know what dy, dx is.

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.979
This is the derivative of our function,

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.117
dy, dx squared.

00:04:56.117 --> 00:04:58.062
If you take the dx squared
out of the radical,

00:04:58.062 --> 00:05:00.917
the square root of dx squared
is just going to be dx.

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:04.637
This is just going to be dx.

00:05:04.638 --> 00:05:06.636
This is just going to be dx.

00:05:06.636 --> 00:05:08.114
Now this is really
interesting because we know

00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:10.643
how to find this between two bounds.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.455
We can now take the
definitive role from a to b.

00:05:13.455 --> 00:05:16.641
This is now we are
integrating a bunch of dx's

00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:20.499
or we're integrating with respect to x.

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:23.308
We could say, "Okay, x
equals a to x equals b."

00:05:23.308 --> 00:05:25.108
Let's take the sum of the product

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:28.966
of this expression and
dx, and this is essential.

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:31.786
This is the formula for arc length.

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:33.116
The formula for arc length.

00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:34.601
This looks complicated.

00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:35.883
In the next video, we'll
see there's actually

00:05:35.883 --> 00:05:37.113
fairly straight forward to apply

00:05:37.113 --> 00:05:39.130
although sometimes in math gets airy.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.061
If you wanted to write this in
slightly different notation,

00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:46.061
you could write this as equal
to the integral from a to b,

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:51.433
x equals a to x equals b of
the square root of one plus.

00:05:52.446 --> 00:05:54.622
Instead of dy, dx, I could write it

00:05:54.622 --> 00:05:59.622
as f prime of x squared, dx.

00:06:03.877 --> 00:06:06.215
So if you know the function,
if you know what f of x is,

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:08.776
take the derivative of it
with respect to x squared

00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:11.517
added to one, take the square
root, and then multiply,

00:06:11.517 --> 00:06:14.083
and then take the definite integral

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:18.065
of that with respect to x from a to b.

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:20.852
We'll do that in the next video.
