00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:08.242
Friends was just a hand-clappy
theme song and six random

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:10.711
hot people fucking eachother.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.114
Well thats not true. Five random
hot people and David Scwimmer's 

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.951
droppy dog sadness that
disguises itself as actual

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.086
stage presence.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.589
And it inspired a whole
generation of bland hot people

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.790
fucking sitcoms. 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.226
None of which had a fun
hand-clappy theme song

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.962
which is why Friends is
considered a classic. 

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:33.700
But it's not a classic. Sienfeld
is a classic, The Simpsons is a
classic

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.137
Friends is remembered more for
its haircuts than its
punchlines. 

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.439
and is as memorable as a Tinder
date where you didn't even get

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:42.342
to make out and had to pay for
your half of the meal. 

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:49.950
Beards are disgusting snack food
traps. 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.886
Mmm. Honey Mustard Pringles. 

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.290
And any man that has one is just
too insecure to show you his

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.457
real face. 

00:00:57.457 --> 00:01:00.327
I'm not a real man, but Lord
knows my face is doing

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:02.195
a decent impression of one. 

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:05.799
My face says "I'll start a bar
fight to defend a womans honor"

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.237
but the rest of me says
"confrentation makes me feel
very naseous"

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.412
The unrealistic expectations
your parents put on you

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.149
and your inability to fullfil
them is what ruined your
childhood

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.053
Why can't you play sports?
Why'd you get a 1060 on your
SATs?

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:27.821
We paid for a tutor!

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.991
George Lucus gave you a happy go
lucky minstral gungan called 

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.895
Darth Vador Ani. That's it. And
you know what he did with the
money he made 

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:39.099
selling Star Wars to Disney? He
gave all 4.6 billion of it to

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:43.704
inner city school programs so
he's actively enriching
childhoods.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:46.807
What have you done besides
complain about George Lucus?

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.875
Yea. Mesa-thought-so.
