Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, I am always getting ready for home invasion or a situations mart. It might be the problem is that they're just too many things to worry about. I can also, I also have to worry about fucking ticks and things that I can't see like flesh eating bacteria and Murcia worry about more than anything. Leslie asteroidal impacts you too. Yep. Oh really? Yeah. Because they can come and then wipe out civilization almost instantaneously. There was something that I just retweeted a yesterday of the Graham Hancock put up. They found a new impact site at 12,500 years ago, that that coincides with the end of the ice age. This is one of the things that he and Randall Carlson had been saying ad nauseum and now Brian or Robert Schoch rather who's a professor at Boston University. Did you hear about the, uh, explosion on the media the next December, December? Yeah. This media that exploded in December had something like 50 times the power in the atmosphere.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Oh, 10 10 atomic bombs. Jeez. 10 Times the power of the atomic bomb that exploded in Hiroshima. Wow. Yeah. And it exploded in our atmosphere. But no, there's um, this impact that they think happened and well, there's two concepts. Uh, Robert Schoch thinks that it might've coincided. These impacts might've coincided with, uh, he believes there's a great deal of evidence for a mass coronal ejection that there was some sort of a solar flare, massive solar storm that happened, which can periodically happen every few thousand, every few hundred years something can happen. And when that does happen, it just wipes out everything. And he said that there was thunderstorms. So like there's, they sit thunderstorms or lightening storms that were like, like the hail that was coming out outside that we filmed today. But that, but like lightening put that back up please. Jesus. So this is the, uh, impact created that they found in Greenland.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Um, it's say 30 miles, 31 kilometers across, which is not 15 miles. Yeah. Somewhere around 15 miles in fucking sanely. Huge. But do you think, um, as you think about your impending doom, which is going to happen, right? I just worry about the civilization being we're so dependent upon electricity and any small catastrophe, oh, this is, they have an an impact video of where it hit a wow, so it's all, all this, this hit like where there's glaciers right now, but there's this massive impact they got hit man. The, the people that lived 12,500 years ago got hit. They got, there's more than one crater too, by the way. This is one of the many craters that they found during the time period of 12,500 BC or 12,500 years ago rather to 10,000 years ago. In that time period, that 2000 year time period, they think there was multiple impacts on the earth.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Why? Why? I guess it just wasn't our time now. Well, we're lucky we've just been through a really lucky stage, but what he's saying essentially is that this is what wiped out the Egyptian civilization. The first Egyptian civilization. This is what wiped out the civilization that built a, called Beckley tapping. This is what wiped out the civilization that preceded Sumir and ancient Babylon and Mesopotamia, that all those were a rebuild of a, I can't wait for him to come back on again. He's coming back on again. Graham Hancock cause coming back on again, I think April debate, that other guy that you had on the podcast, it was great. Yeah. Wolves, Michael Shermer, who was actually a friend of mine who I like, but he's, he's a skeptic and there's an issue with skeptics and that the issue is not that it's not good to be skeptical.

Speaker 1:          03:49          It's very good to be skeptical. The problem is when you approach things as a skeptic, you're not approaching them as a scientist. And I'm not saying that Michael Does this, but that I think he did in that debate. I think it was a mistake. People, they approach these things looking to debunk them rather than objective. Really assessing all the possible evidence. Right. And so because of that, you miss out on big thing. Like this is evidence. This is not like big foot tracks or some shit like that. This is fucking real evidence of a crater that they have dated back to 12,000, 500 years ago. Yeah. But people have a hard time believing in doomsday scenarios because it kind of like, you know, when you talk about taking the entire chessboard and throw it in the air and you have evidence for it, look at global warming and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          04:37          There, there is a, I really believe that people have, whether it's late and are not a religious notion that we are ultimately sacred and that God would never do something that terrible to us on moss. And I really, I really believe that like humanity itself to go away. No, because that would make no sense where we're moving in a certain direction. We're making progress. There's, there's this sort of neural net, it's becoming easier to understand what it is to be each other, uh, you know, uh, and, and that's kind of what virtual reality and being able to download other people's brains will eventually do. That probably brings us into one, I guess universal consciousness, but you can go on and on. So the idea that that would be all obliterated before it happens before the singularity, for example, happens is too much to bear. It would make no sense for us because we have this narrative that we all kind of adhere to. It's very easy to do that.
