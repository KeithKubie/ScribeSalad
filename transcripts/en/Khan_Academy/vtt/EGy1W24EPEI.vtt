00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.120
Let's add these
two mixed numbers.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.615
2 and 5/13 plus 7 and 6/13.

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:07.490
And the way I like to
think about in my head,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.250
I like to separate out the mixed
numbers into the whole number

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.450
component and the
fractional component.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.500
So we can rewrite 2 and
5/13 as 2 plus 5 over 13.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.240
And then we can write that plus.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.416
And then 7 and 6/13, we can
rewrite as plus 7 plus 6/13.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.290
So all I did is I rewrote this.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.890
And I essentially
expanded it out.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.070
I broke up the mixed numbers
into their whole number

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.130
parts and their
fractional parts.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.850
And then what I
like to do is I like

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.480
to add the whole number parts.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.050
So this 2 plus this
7, so I'll do that.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.410
So I'll do the 2
plus 7 over here.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.370
I'll add those up.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.820
And to that, I will add
the fractional parts.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.893
So to that, I will add
the 5/13 to the 6/13.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.180
So if we add the whole
number parts, 2 plus 7 is 9,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.950
and the fractional
parts, they already

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.270
have the same denominator
in this problem.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.140
5/13 plus 6/13,
same denominator.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.750
You're going to get 11/13.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.080
5 plus 6 is 11.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.510
So you get 9 plus 11/13.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.550
Well, that's just the
same thing as 9 and 11/13.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.560
And we are done.
