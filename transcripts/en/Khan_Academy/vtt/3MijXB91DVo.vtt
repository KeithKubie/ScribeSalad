00:00:00.221 --> 00:00:01.054
- [Instructor] Let's get some practice.

00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:04.761
Simplifying radical expressions
that involve variables.

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:06.392
So let's say I have

00:00:06.392 --> 00:00:07.973
two times

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:10.140
the square root of seven x

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.297
times three

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.050
times the square root of 14 x squared.

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:20.500
Pause the video and see
if you can simplify it.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.172
Taking any perfect squares out

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.064
multiplying and taking any perfect squares

00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:26.631
out of the radical sign.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:28.146
Well, let's first

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:30.799
just multiply this thing.

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:31.632
So,

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.678
we can change the order of multiplication.

00:00:33.678 --> 00:00:34.765
This is going to be the same thing

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.265
as two times three

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:40.413
times the square root of seven x

00:00:40.413 --> 00:00:42.663
times the square root of 14

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:45.533
x squared.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:47.060
And so this is going to be equal to

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.893
six times

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.168
and then the product of two radicals,

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.864
you can view that as the
square root of the product.

00:00:53.864 --> 00:00:55.947
So six times the square root of

00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:56.925
and I'll

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:58.875
actually I'll just leave it like this.

00:00:58.875 --> 00:00:59.708
Seven

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:00.977
times

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:02.310
x

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.143
and then

00:01:03.143 --> 00:01:04.785
let me actually factor 14.

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:05.618
14 is two

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.315
times seven

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:09.168
times

00:01:09.168 --> 00:01:10.706
x squared.

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:11.956
Actually let me

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:16.757
extend my radical sign a little bit.

00:01:18.196 --> 00:01:19.654
And the reason why I
didn't multiply it out.

00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:21.523
Obviously we could've
multiplied it in our head.

00:01:21.523 --> 00:01:24.106
X times x squared is x to the third.

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.564
And we could've said,

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:26.532
seven

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:28.698
times 14 is what

00:01:28.698 --> 00:01:29.531
98.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.443
We could've done that.

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:32.901
But when you're trying to factor out

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:34.334
perfect squares, it's actually

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:37.040
easier if it's in this factored form here.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.386
Especially because,

00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:39.692
from a variable point of view

00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:42.438
you can view this as a
perfect square already.

00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:43.286
And then

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:45.085
14's not a perfect square,

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:46.468
seven isn't a perfect square

00:01:46.468 --> 00:01:48.551
but seven times seven is.

00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:52.192
Seven times seven is a perfect square.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:54.252
That is 49 of course.

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.383
So let's rewrite this a little bit

00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:57.283
to see what we can do.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.972
This is going to be six

00:01:58.972 --> 00:01:59.805
times

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:01.558
and

00:02:01.558 --> 00:02:03.372
I could write it like this.

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:04.872
The square root of

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:07.685
let's put all the perfect squares first

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.083
so seven times seven

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:10.916
that is

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:12.056
49

00:02:12.056 --> 00:02:13.333
that's those two.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.166
X squared

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.224
49

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:17.542
x squared

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:18.375
and then

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:19.208
I could

00:02:20.247 --> 00:02:23.510
once again separate the two
radicals right over here.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.013
So whatever else is left.

00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:26.116
So

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.421
I've already used the seven,
the seven, the x squared

00:02:28.421 --> 00:02:30.046
I have a two x left.

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:31.608
Times two x.

00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:32.750
Hopefully you'll appreciate
that these two things

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.583
are equivalent.

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:35.345
I could've put one big radical sign

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:37.493
over 49 x squared times two x

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:39.397
which would've been exactly
what you have there,

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:42.694
but, if you're taking the
radical of the product of things,

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:43.750
that's the same thing as

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.788
the product of the radicals.

00:02:45.788 --> 00:02:48.563
It's come straight out of
our exponent properties.

00:02:48.563 --> 00:02:50.146
But what's valuable about this is

00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:51.733
we now see this is six

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:53.074
times

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:53.907
now

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:54.781
we can take the

00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:56.394
the square root of 49 x squared

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:57.538
this is going to seven x

00:02:57.538 --> 00:03:00.423
square root of 49 is seven

00:03:00.423 --> 00:03:03.058
square root of x squared

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:04.939
is going to be x

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.257
and then we multiply that

00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:08.771
times the square root of two x

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.743
times the square root of two x

00:03:11.743 --> 00:03:13.177
and so now we're in the home stretch.

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:15.094
Six times seven is 42 x

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.225
times the square root of two x

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:20.627
and the key thing to appreciate is

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:23.527
I keep using this property

00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:24.360
that

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.710
a radical of products

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.306
or the square root of products

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.514
is the same thing as a
product of the square root.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.596
So even this step that I did here,

00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:34.249
if you wanted, you could've
had an intermediary step.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.974
You could've said that the
square root of 49 x squared

00:03:38.974 --> 00:03:40.443
is the same thing

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:42.846
as square root of 49

00:03:42.846 --> 00:03:45.304
times the square root of x squared

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:48.218
which would get us square
root of 49 is seven

00:03:48.218 --> 00:03:51.213
square root of x squared is x

00:03:51.213 --> 00:03:52.862
right over there.

00:03:52.862 --> 00:03:54.261
Let's do

00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:56.761
let's do another one of these.

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:00.170
So let's say

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.488
I have

00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:03.375
square root of two a

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:04.208
times

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:05.685
the square root of

00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:07.839
14 a to the third

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.463
times the square root of five a.

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:11.818
So like always, pause this video

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.742
and see if you can
simplify this on your own.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:16.047
Multiply them and then take
all the perfect squares

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.492
out of the radical.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:19.031
So let's multiply first.

00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:20.430
So this is gonna be the same thing

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.180
as the square root of

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:24.638
two times 14

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:27.343
times five.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.532
So let me actually just

00:04:29.532 --> 00:04:30.365
I'm just going to

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:31.668
two and five are prime.

00:04:31.668 --> 00:04:33.450
14 I can factor it as

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.315
two times seven

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.395
so this is gonna be

00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:37.752
two times, instead of
14 I'm going to write

00:04:37.752 --> 00:04:39.002
two times seven

00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:42.344
and then times five

00:04:42.344 --> 00:04:44.828
and then we have a times a to the third

00:04:44.828 --> 00:04:46.314
times a

00:04:46.314 --> 00:04:47.777
well actually let me write that as

00:04:47.777 --> 00:04:49.739
a to the fifth.

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:51.365
We have a to the first,
times a to the third,

00:04:51.365 --> 00:04:52.331
times a to the first,

00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.331
and the exponents you get a to the fifth.

00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.466
Now, what perfect squares do we have here?

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.201
Well we already see a perfect square

00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.843
in terms of two times two

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.834
and then a to the fifth
isn't a perfect square

00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:05.807
if you think of terms of the variable a

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:08.658
but you can view that as a
perfect square a to the fourth

00:05:08.658 --> 00:05:09.491
times a.

00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:12.916
So let's rearrange this a little bit.

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.436
And so this is going to be equal to

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:17.287
the square root

00:05:17.287 --> 00:05:18.120
of

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.381
let me put my perfect squares out front.

00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.097
The square root of four, two times two

00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:26.163
times a to the fourth

00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:28.659
and then let me put my non perfect squares

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:29.492
times

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:31.887
I have a seven

00:05:31.887 --> 00:05:32.821
a five

00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:34.526
and an a that I haven't used yet

00:05:34.526 --> 00:05:36.082
so seven times five is 35

00:05:36.082 --> 00:05:36.915
so it's 35

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:39.289
a

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.030
and now just like we said before,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.863
we could

00:05:41.863 --> 00:05:42.696
let me do it

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:43.529
we could say hey look,

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.134
this is the same thing as
the square root of four

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:48.206
times the square root of a to the fourth

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:50.226
it's using exponent properties

00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:51.809
and then times the square root of

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:52.642
35 a.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:56.886
Now principle root of
four is positive two.

00:05:56.886 --> 00:05:58.929
You can view this as
a positive square root

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:01.130
and then square root of a to the fourth

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.160
the principle root is
going to be a squared

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.412
and then we're going to have that times

00:06:06.412 --> 00:06:07.625
the square root of

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:08.458
35 a

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.567
and we're done.

00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:13.181
Let's do one more example

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:15.718
and this time, we're going
to involve two variables

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:16.751
which as we'll see

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:19.584
isn't that much more complicating.

00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:23.438
So let's simplify

00:06:23.438 --> 00:06:24.663
the square root

00:06:24.663 --> 00:06:25.496
of 72

00:06:26.648 --> 00:06:28.071
x to the third

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:29.238
z to the third

00:06:30.253 --> 00:06:31.617
so the key is can we factor

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:33.260
72 is not a perfect square

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.424
but is there a perfect
square somewhere in there?

00:06:36.424 --> 00:06:38.502
And you immediately see that
if you're trying to factor it

00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:40.169
you get 36 times two

00:06:41.695 --> 00:06:44.301
and 36 of course is a perfect square.

00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:46.246
And likewise x to the
third and z to the third

00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:47.616
are not each perfect squares

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:50.547
but they each have an x
squared and z squared in them.

00:06:50.547 --> 00:06:52.109
So let me rewrite this.

00:06:52.109 --> 00:06:53.891
This is the same thing

00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:55.865
This is the same thing as

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:57.159
I can write

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:59.116
let me put all my
perfect squares up front.

00:06:59.116 --> 00:07:00.944
So I have 36

00:07:00.944 --> 00:07:02.001
36

00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:03.464
I'm gonna take an x squared out

00:07:03.464 --> 00:07:05.460
x squared I'm gonna take a z squared out

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.749
z squared

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:08.224
and then we're left with

00:07:08.224 --> 00:07:09.257
is

00:07:09.257 --> 00:07:10.424
we took a 36 out

00:07:10.424 --> 00:07:13.384
so we're left with a two times two

00:07:13.384 --> 00:07:14.748
and if we took an x squared out of this

00:07:14.748 --> 00:07:16.362
we're left with just an x

00:07:16.362 --> 00:07:18.964
x to the third divided by x squared is x

00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:20.049
two x

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:22.441
and then z to the third
divided by z squared

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.274
is just z

00:07:24.205 --> 00:07:25.099
and you can verify this

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:26.429
multiply this all out.

00:07:26.429 --> 00:07:27.990
You should be getting

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.771
you should be getting
exactly what we have here.

00:07:30.771 --> 00:07:32.733
I do that little line on
the z to differentiate

00:07:32.733 --> 00:07:35.160
so it doesn't look like my twos.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.007
36 times two is 72

00:07:37.007 --> 00:07:38.853
x squared times x is x to the third.

00:07:38.853 --> 00:07:41.552
Z squared times z is z to the third.

00:07:41.552 --> 00:07:43.553
But now this is pretty
straighforward to factor

00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:44.386
because

00:07:44.386 --> 00:07:45.583
let me just

00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:47.941
I'll do more steps than
you would probably do

00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:49.749
if you were doing it on your own

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:51.224
but that's because

00:07:51.224 --> 00:07:53.848
the whole point here is to learn.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.026
So two

00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:55.897
x

00:07:55.897 --> 00:07:57.041
z

00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:59.270
so that's just using exponent properties.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.609
And so everything here
is a perfect square.

00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:03.333
This is going to be the square root of 36

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:04.651
times the square root of x squared

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:07.507
times the square root of z squared

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.125
which is going to be square root of 36

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:11.153
is

00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:13.115
principle root of 36 is six

00:08:13.115 --> 00:08:15.094
principle root of x squared is x

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:18.357
principle root of z squared is z

00:08:18.357 --> 00:08:20.098
and we're gonna multiply that

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:20.931
times

00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:22.060
square root

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.610
of two x

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.754
z

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:25.587
and

00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:27.170
we are

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.003
done.
