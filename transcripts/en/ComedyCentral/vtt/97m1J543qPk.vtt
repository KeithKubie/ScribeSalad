I’D LIKE TO HEAR IN
YOUR WORDS JUST BRIEFLY

00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:03.500
WHAT THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.083
-THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT PARENTS
FINDING OUT THEIR KIDS ARE

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:09.625
MAKING WHAT THEY FEEL
IS A BAD DECISION AND

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.166
TRYING TO STOP THAT BAD DECISION.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.375
RIGHT, BUT REALLY
THIS MOVIE I S ABOUT

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:14.625
BUTT CHUGGING.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.000
OH, YES.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000 line:91%
OH, YES.
THERE’S ALSO THAT.

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:21.875
I’D LIKE TO KNOW

00:00:21.875 --> 00:00:24.375
WHEN YOU WERE FILMING YOUR
PIVOTAL BUTT CHUGGING SCENE

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.875 line:91%
DID YOU USE A STUNT BUTT
OR WAS THAT YOUR BUTT?

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:31.166 line:91%
THERE IS NO WAY TO, TO
EQUAL THE PRESENCE OF MY BUTT.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.749 line:91%
SO, YOU DO YOUR
OWN BUTT STUNTS?

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:34.000
I HAVE TO.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.666
IT WAS A MASSIVE CASTING PROCESS.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:40.291 line:91%
WE SENT OUT FOR THE
ASSES OF THE WORLD.

00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.333 line:92%
AND YOU COULDN’T FIND ONE?

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.041
IT WAS JUST NOT ANYTHING
THAT MEASURED UP TO THE

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.791 line:91%
THE HAM-LIKE SUBSTANCE OF BUTT
MEAT THAT I CAN PUT ON SCREEN.

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:50.375 line:91%
AND WHAT KIND OF PREPARATION
DID YOU PUT YOUR BUTT THROUGH?

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.166 line:92%
THE TRAINING, THE PREPARATION,

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.000 line:91%
THE MENTAL EXHAUSTION,
THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER.

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.458
BUTT CHUGGING CAN,
CAN RUIN A RELATIONSHIP.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.583
I MEAN, IT'S NOT FOR EVERYONE

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.249
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I
RECOMMEND THOSE AT HOME

00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.291
THEY DON’T TRY IT.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:10.333
I WOULD START WITH SMALLER
OBJECTS LIKE THE CAP OF A TIRE

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.750 line:92%
THAT YOU PUT THE AIR IN,

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.166
MAYBE THE CAP OF A
TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.875
WORK UP TO
NON-BREAKABLE MASON JARS

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:21.291
AND THEN INFLATABLE INNERTUBES
WAS MY LAST STEP.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:24.541 line:91%
CAN YOU RUN US THROUGH HOW
THE DIRECTOR PREPARED YOU TO –

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.500
KAY WAS GREAT.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.541
ALL GOOD DIRECTORS LET
YOU OWN THAT WORK

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:31.208
AND SHE SPECIFICALLY SAID

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.875
“YOU KNOW I’VE
BROUGHT YOU THIS FAR

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.083
I’VE GIVEN YOU THE CLIFF NOTES,

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:36.083
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
JUST OWN THE WORK.”

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:40.333
SO, I WAS AT GREAT LIBERTY TO
CHUG AS I SAW APPROPRIATE.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.958
-AND REALLY FEEL OUT THE SCENE

00:01:41.958 --> 00:01:42.541
YES

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:45.000
THE SCENE TAKES PLACE
AT A HIGH SCHOOL PARTY.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.791
AND ON THE DAY, THERE
WERE 120 TO 150 EXTRAS

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.208
THAT HAD TO “STARE INTO THE
CHUG” AS WE DEEMED IT ON SET

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.500
AND I’D LIKE TO THINK
THAT I GAVE THEM THE

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.541
EXPERIENCE THAT
ANYTHING’S POSSIBLE

00:01:58.541 --> 00:02:00.000
AND WHAT UH-

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
-I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROS

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.750
AND YOU CAN SCOUR
YOUTUBE FOR THIS

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.291
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR
OWN TECHNIQUES

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.458
AND SOME ARE FILLED WITH
CONSISTENT LAUGHTER

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:11.208
I DON’T BELIEVE IN THAT BECAUSE
YOU CAN PUSH BACK OUT.

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:12.833
SURPRISE IS CERTAINLY AN ELEMENT

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.375
YOU DON’T WANT TO
BE INVOLVED WITH.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.708
I THINK ITS MOSTLY A STATE,
A MEDITATIVE STATE

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:23.041
OF FINDING EMOTIONAL ONENESS
WHERE YOU DON’T,

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:24.041
YOU DON’T DEVIATE.

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:25.125
YOU GET A RESTING HEART RATE,

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:28.083
ALMOST LIKE, YOU KNOW
LONG DISTANCE RUNNERS

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.000
THEY KEEP A VERY LOW
RESTING HEART RATE.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.083 line:92%
ASS CHUGGERS IT’S THE SAME

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.166
AND YOU WOULDN’T
LOOK AT ME AND BE LIKE

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:34.666
THAT GUYS GOT A RESTING
HEART RATE OF 46

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.041
NO
-BUT I – I DO.

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.041
IS BUTT CHUGGING AN
ACTIVITY YOU DO AROUND

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.208
CLOSE FRIENDS OR YOU CAN
KINDA DO IN PUBLIC?

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:41.583
MY FAVORITE BUTT
CHUG OBVIOUSLY IS

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:44.083
CAPTURED ON FILM IN
BLOCKERS BECAUSE IT WAS

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:45.500
AROUND CLOSE FRIENDS,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.750
IT WAS AROUND COWORKERS AND IT
WAS AROUND COMPLETE STRANGERS.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.250
SO THAT IS, I BELIEVE WHEN YOU
REACH FULL CONFIDENCE

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.500
IN YOUR BUTT CHUGGING ABILITIES

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.916
AS AN ACTOR THE KIND OF MENTAL
TRAINING YOU WENT THROUGH –

00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:00.166
I CHOSE THE STRAIGHT
FORWARD APPROACH

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:02.208
THIS THING IS GOING TO
GO IN MY A**HOLE

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.541
AND THEY’RE GOING
TO POUR FLUID INTO IT.

00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.000
IT SEEMED TO WORK.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.125
AND DID YOU HAVE ANY PRIOR
EXPERIENCE TO THIS BEFORE?

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:13.041
I – I- AT THIS POINT I CANNOT
CONFIRM NOR DENY THAT.

00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:14.583
