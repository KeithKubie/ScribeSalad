00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.650
 

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:08.170
The whole point of the immune
system is to keep out shady

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.950
things from your body-- or, if
they get in, to kill them.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.680
So those shady things would
include shady proteins that

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.670
can do damage to your body,
viruses, bacteria, even

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.290
eukaryotic parasites,
and then even fungi.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.770
So all sorts of things that if
they were to enter your body,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.050
they would cause some
form of disease.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.500
These are collectively
called pathogens.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.730
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.620
So the whole point of the immune
system is, on a first

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.710
line of defense, keep these
things out-- and then if they

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.480
were to get into your body, to
kill and eliminate them from

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450
our system so that we don't
get sick and so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.970
that we don't die.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.470
So I already just mentioned that
there's kind of two lines

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.510
of defense and even with
those, there's kind of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.340
subclassifications.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.800
The first line of defense-- I'll
just call that the first

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.140
line-- which is essentially just
to keep things out-- keep

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.940
all of these pathogens out.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.260
And there's some obvious ones.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.410
There's our skin.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.540
Our skin keeps pathogens out and
actually even the oils on

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.040
our skin are a little bit more
acidic and it's hard for some

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.410
types of bacteria to thrive in
that type of environment.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.330
You have your mucus membranes
and in the mucus, there's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.550
there's some chemicals that
maybe make it a little bit

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.310
more difficult for bacteria
to survive.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.640
And then you even have acidic
environments like

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.890
your stomach acid.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.000
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.120
You might not view your stomach
as the outside of you,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.310
but it fundamentally is.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.810
Your whole digestive tract,
which I'll make videos on in

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.840
the near future, is really
on the outside of you.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.130
You can simply model really most
vertebrate bodies as kind

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.270
of a doughnut our digestive
tract is the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.289
inside of the doughnut.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.020
So stomach acid is on the
outside of our real bodies and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.870
you can imagine, that's a hard
environment for a lot of these

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.570
pathogens to survive in.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.720
So that's the first line of
defense, but we know that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.820
that's not good enough, that
sometimes these things can get

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.760
into our bodies, and there we
have to start thinking about

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.750
the second line of defense.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.540
What do we do once things are
actually in our body?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.980
 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.550
And here, in both the first and
second line, I'm talking

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.660
about non-specific immunity--
and this is going to make a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.290
lot of sense when we start
talking about specific

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.840
immunities.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.020
So both of these are
non-specific.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.630
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.840
And when I say non-specific--
or you can also call them

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.430
innate-- it means that they
just generally respond to

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.050
things that appear bad.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.840
They don't remember the bad
things that came before.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.690
They don't respond to a
particular type of virus or a

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.060
particular-- well, they do
respond to every type of virus

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.270
or every type of bacteria, but
they don't say, this is virus

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.660
type A, B, C, or this is
bacteria type A, B, C.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.990
They just say, this
is a virus.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.120
Let me get rid of it, or
let me not let it in.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.180
This is a bacteria.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.390
Let me get rid of it or
let me not let it in.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.950
It doesn't know what type of
bacteria it's dealing with.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.320
So this is all the
non-specific or

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.630
innate immune system.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.370
And we'll go into a lot of
detail on the specific immune

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.850
system because you can imagine,
it becomes very

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.760
complicated or interesting when
you start thinking about

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.710
your body somehow remembering a
virus that it's seen before

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.930
and being able to respond better
to that virus or that

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.240
bacteria or that protein the
second time it sees it.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.580
So we're dealing with
non-specific in this case.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.080
And the the second line of your
non-specific immunity,

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.790
there are two things.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.760
One is an inflammatory
response.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:16.910
 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.250
And I'm going to do a whole
video on this, but in general,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.110
we've all experienced
inflammatory responses.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.000
When you see blood flowing to a
certain part of an area and

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.010
you see there's pus and
there's-- and I'm going to go

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.280
into a lot more detail on what
an inflammatory response

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.090
actually is, but that's one of
your-- and what it really is

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.250
doing is bringing blood and
bringing cells that can fight

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.450
whatever type of infection you
have. It's bringing them to

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.030
the site where maybe you got a
cut or maybe where a lot of

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.370
the bacteria or whatever
the pathogen is.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.810
So inflammatory response is all
about bringing fluid and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.570
fighters to the fight.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.210
 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.500
I'm going to do a whole
video on that.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:07.190
 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.070
But the byproduct is, that part
of your tissue or that

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.030
part of you body gets inflamed--
a lot of fluid

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.960
there, a lot of byproducts of
the battle that goes on there.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.000
We'll do a whole
video on that.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.100
And the other second line of
defense is, and it's actually

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.940
part of the inflammatory
response-- are phagocytosis or

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.190
phagocytes.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.730
 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.120
And really, what I want to do
over the rest of this video is

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.300
talk in a little bit more
detail about phagocytes

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.110
because once we understand what
phagocytes do, that's a

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.350
pretty good building block for
going into the specific immune

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.010
system-- and actually, it'll
help lead into the discussion

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.850
on the inflammatory response as
well because phagocytes are

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.740
really part of the inflammatory
response.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.460
So phagocytes are just
a class of cell

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.430
that can eat up pathogens.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.020
They can eat up other things
really, but when we talk about

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.970
the immune system, we're talking
about pathogens.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.710
So let's say that this is
a phagocyte right here.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.620
This is a phagocyte
right there.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.310
It has some kind of a
nucleus, whatever.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.550
I don't have to focus on the
inside of the phagocyte.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.210
It's a traditional eukaryotic
cell, but what I want to do is

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.840
see what happens when a
phagocyte encounters a foreign

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.590
particle or a foreign
bacteria.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.850
So let me say this is a foreign
bacteria right here.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.940
So the phagocyte, we've already
said, is non-specific.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.620
What it does is, it has
receptors that respond to just

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.380
things that it knows are bad.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.426
You could imagine these
are super sensors.

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:43.050
 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.410
Maybe these are super sensors
for bacteria.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.010
The bacteria have proteins on
their surface that maybe look

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.860
something like that.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.270
Obviously they don't look
exactly like that.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.240
I'm just drawing them as kind
of a Y and a triangle so you

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.430
can see that they fit.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.810
But once these two guys
connect-- let me draw the

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.100
situation where they
have connected.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:03.310
So this is the bacteria.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.600
This is the pathogen.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.670
And it's really the same idea
with a virus or any

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.600
other type of thing.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.070
And we'll actually see in future
videos that these guys

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.250
can actually be tagged by other
molecules, which makes

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.100
these phagocytes want to
attack them even more.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.720
Once they're bonded--
that's my bacteria,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.900
the invading pathogen.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.590
And now it is bonded.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.850
It has triggered the receptor
on this phagocyte.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.540
This phagocyte will start to
engulf-- it'll wrap around

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.790
this pathogen.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:44.140
 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.125
And these two ends are
eventually going to meet.

00:07:48.125 --> 00:08:00.230
 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.690
But then once these two meet,
what's it going to look like?

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:09.320
Then all of a sudden, that
bacteria is going to be

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.350
completely engulfed.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.880
It's going to be inside
of the cell.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.760
So now the cell-- once these
two ends meet and these

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.070
membranes merge, then this guy
is going to be in his own

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.410
little membrane bubble-- or you
can almost imagine, it's

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.820
in its own little vesicle.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.370
So this is the pathogen, the
bacteria in this case-- but

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.950
phagocytosis-- the process is
completely identical in terms

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.340
of how it engulfs things.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.390
If it was a virus or some type
of other foreign protein or

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.010
any type of really foreign
molecule-- actually, sometimes

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.620
it doesn't even occur
to foreign stuff.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.780
It can occur to dying molecules
that are not

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:49.310
foreign, that just need
to be cleared out.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.190
But we'll just focus on the
immune system, on foreign

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.440
things right now.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.870
 

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.930
So this membrane right here will
completely merge and go

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.520
around this guy like this.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.800
And of course, you had your
receptors and who knows if

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.910
they're still there.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.740
By the time-- let's just draw
them there so you see that

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.800
that part is that part.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.220
But once it's fully engulfed,
this thing is called a

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:20.240
phagosome, on which is really
just a vesicle that contains

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.740
that foreign particle that
you want to get rid of.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:33.660
And then other fluid or vesicles
that contain things

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.800
that can eat up this phagosome--
so let's say that

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.360
this is some vesicle that
contains things-- lysozymes

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.905
and it contains really reactive
species of oxygen.

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:50.420
 

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.920
And if this comes in contact
with, really, almost any

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.240
biological compound, it's
going to do some damage.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.360
But once the pathogen is
completely merged inside the

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.530
cell, this little package will
merge over here and it will

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.130
dump its contents into this
phagosome, into this vesicle

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.380
containing the pathogen,
and then break it up.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.990
It's essentially digesting it.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.190
So obviously the first role is,
it just got it out of the

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.530
way and it killed it.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.910
And then the second role-- and
I'm just going to give a

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.230
little tidbit right here.

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.660
We're going to do it in a lot
more detail in future videos.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.910
It breaks it up.

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:38.490
 

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.550
So now the thing is
all broken up.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.330
 

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.930
So that thing is broken up into
constituent proteins and

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.590
another molecules.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:57.550
And then what the phagocyte
does-- it'll actually take

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.050
some subset of these
molecules, some

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:02.990
subset of the proteins.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.170
It'll break them out.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.860
Proteins are just sequences
of amino acids.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.350
Normally when people say
proteins, they're talking

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.580
about long sequences
of amino acids.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.760
When people talk about short
sequences of amino acids or a

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.820
protein that's broken up a lot,
they refer to it as a

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:17.710
peptide chain.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.360
A peptide chain is a shorter
chain of amino acids.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.880
So this guy will take some
special peptide chains, some

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.160
special pieces from the thing it
just killed, attach them to

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.920
some other proteins.

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:37.020
So it'll take maybe a little
piece of this bacteria right

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:45.060
now, attach it to other protein,
which is called a

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.800
major histocompatibility
complex-- and if we're talking

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.650
about phagocytes, this will be
a major histocompatibility

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.140
complex type II.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.810
 

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.900
It sounds very-- a strange word,
but we're going to see

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.150
this a lot.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:17.110
 

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.110
So they abbreviate it MHC.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.580
This is a protein and it bonds
with this peptide that was

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.510
kind of chunked off or digested
off of this invading

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:32.820
pathogen and then this phagocyte
will then present it

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.910
onto its membrane.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.590
So this combination-- the
complex of the MHC-- in this

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.420
case, it's going to be
an MHC II protein.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.960
 

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.820
We're going to talk about
Type I in the future.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.920
It's going to take this complex
and then present it on

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.170
its surface.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:13:01.780
 

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.060
And the reason why I'm going
through all this pain of

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.930
explaining this process-- you're
like, hey, we already

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.340
got rid of the thing
and killed it.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.240
Why is Sal worried about what
we do with the peptides?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.780
This is crucial to our immune
system because we'll see other

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.590
specific parts of our
immune system.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.590
Remember, so far everything
is non-specific.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.290
This guy just said, this
is an invader.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.900
It doesn't know the type
of an invader.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.900
It just says, hey, let me bond
to this thing and kill it.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.270
It's one of these things that I
know are foreign to my body.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.880
So it kills it, but now it can
leave it on its surface and

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.460
now the specific parts, the
parts that actually have

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.450
memory and attack specific
things, can say, gee, Mr.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.600
Phagocyte, look, you've
killed something.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.260
Let me see if I have some
specific reactions that can be

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.420
triggered by this thing that
you're presenting.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.000
So, many phagocytes
are also called

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.590
antigen presenting cells.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:14:00.120
 

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.260
And I'm going to go into more
detail on what exactly an

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.640
antigen is.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.340
I called this thing
a pathogen.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.950
An antigen is essentially-- you
can view it as a protein

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.750
or a peptide chain that will
trigger or that can be dealt

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.830
with within the immune system.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.720
I'll be a little bit-- the
specific immune system.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.170
And I'm going to be a little bit
more nuanced about it when

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.150
I talk-- I'll make a whole
video on antigens and

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.810
antibodies, but right now you
can just view it as a peptide

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:28.620
chain right there.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.660
An antigen is just a protein
or part of a protein.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.390
So this is presenting an antigen
on its surface that

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.220
can later be used
by other parts.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.720
Now, the one thing that-- there
are many, many types of

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.470
phagocytes.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.300
And just to give you-- just so
when you see different words,

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.250
you don't get confused by the
different types of phagocytes.

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.860
I'll do a little review
of those right now.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.110
You have neutrophils.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.850
 

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.340
These are actually the most
common of the phagocytes.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.120
And these are the fast and
numerous respondors.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:10.880
So these get to a location
of infection very fast.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.900
Phagocytes don't necessarily
just have to kill in this way.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.620
I mean, they're called
phagocytes because they engulf

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.930
this way, but we'll in future
videos talk about other ways

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.840
that they can release chemicals
or even DNA nets to

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.540
ensnare pathogens,
but neutrophils

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.210
are fast and abundant.

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:30.610
And then you have macrophages,
which are-- on some level,

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.800
they're the most versatile and
do the heavy lifting, but

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.560
they're also phagocytes.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.130
And then you dendritic cells.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.460
And when you first see the
word dendritic cell, you

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.520
think, hey, does this somehow
relate to dendrites of the

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.390
nervous system?

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:46.740
And no, they have nothing to
do with the nervous system.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.720
 

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.100
The reason why they're called
dendritic cells is because

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.350
they look like they
have dendrites.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:03.190
 

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.640
So they look like neurons on
some level, but they don't

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.130
participate in the nervous
system at all.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:11.610
And these tend to be the best
activators of the specific

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.920
immune system that we'll talk
about in future videos.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.680
So anyway, I'll leave you there
and we'll talk more

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.690
about all of this in the
next few videos.
