&gt;&gt; Jon: MOTHER -- SO IT APPEARS
THE SENATE IS STUCK ON A BILL

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:13.106 line:91%
I'M SURE EVERY AMERICAN WHO'S
NOT CURRENTLY ACTIVELY INVOLVED

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.973 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN TRAFFICKING HUMANS FOR
SEX WOULD SUPPORT.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.675 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING I
WOULD HATE.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.344 align:start position:0% line:85%
TELL ME MORE.

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.980 align:start position:0% line:91%

OUT HYDE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.754 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AH YES, THE HYDE
AMENDMENT, NAMED FOR THE ACTION

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.757 line:91%
THAT REPUBLICANS APPARENTLY HAVE
TO TAKE TO GET THE ANTI-ABORTION

LANGUAGE INTO ALL BILLS. LET'S
HIDE IT OVER HERE, LET'S HIDE IT

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
OVER -- THE HYDE AMENDMENT
BLOCKS THE USE OF FEDERAL MONEY

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:42.602 align:start size:94% position:6% line:91%
FOR ABORTIONS, BECAUSE JUST
BECAUSE A PROCEDURE IS

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.071 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPLETELY LEGAL DOESN'T MEAN IT
HAS TO BE TREATED THAT WAY.

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:49.575 line:91%
I SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED, A LITTLE
BIT OF REPUBLICAN WHAT WE AT

GET PASSED COMMITTEE

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:09.195 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITHOUT ANY NOT REPUBLICANS
COMPLAINING.

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:10.296 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DEMOCRATS DO ADMIT THAT WHEN
THIS BILL WENT THROUGH THE

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.297 line:91%
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
AND WAS APPROVED BY BOTH

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.932 size:81% position:41%
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS,

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:21.908 size:81% position:41% line:85%

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.577 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU DIDN'T READ IT
FULLY.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.080 line:91%

SEE IF YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED?

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:28.581 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:33.486 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS IN THE
BILL.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.954 line:91%
YOU CAN BLAME IT ON STAFF, BLAME
IT ON WHOEVER YOU WANT TO BLAME

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.055 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW ABOUT I BLAME NOT
READING THE BILL ON YOU?

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:46.933 line:91%
SENATOR HARRY REID, THE GUY IN
CHARGE OF SENATE DEMOCRATS WHOSE

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:55.274 line:85%
LAST NAME IS LITERALLY" REID ."

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:59.111 line:85%
HOW DID YOU NOT READ THIS BILL?

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:00.713 line:91%
IT'D BE LIKE GOING TO JOHN
WATERS' HOUSE AND FINDING OUT

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:05.651 size:84% position:42% line:85%
ALL OF HIS PLANTS ARE DEAD.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:06.852 align:start position:0% line:91%
JOHN, WHY DIDN'T YOU YOUR LAST
NAME THEM!

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:07.853 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:15.528 line:85%
EVERYONE AGREES SHOULD BE A LAW.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:21.634 align:start position:0% line:91%

BULLET POINTS.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:30.343 align:start position:0% line:85%
GUESS WHAT.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY LEFT OUT THE CHANGE THEY
MADE.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:42.655 line:91%
&gt;&gt; REPUBLICANS ANNOUNCING THAT
TRUSTING THEM WAS A MISTAKE.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:43.756 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: REALLY? YOU THINK?

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:44.323 size:84% position:42% line:91%
YOU THINK THAT TRUSTING THE
REPUBLICANS WAS A MISTAKE

00:03:44.357 --> 00:03:45.558 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU KNOW WHO THAT'S ON?

00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:48.427 line:91%
IT'S THE SAME WAY NOBODY BLAMES
THE BEARS IN "GRIZZLY MAN" FOR

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.030 line:91%
EATING THE DELICIOUS-LOOKING
MEAT SACK WHO KEPT STICKING HIS

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:57.003 align:start position:0% line:91%
HANDS IN THEIR POOP.
BECAUSE THEY'RE BEARS.

00:03:57.036 --> 00:04:00.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT, PERHAPS
NOW IT'S TIME ON

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:06.245 align:start size:88% position:13% line:91%
"HATEWATCH" TO GO TO THE
PHONES.

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:07.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; "HATEWATCH" PHONE
CALLS SPONSORED BY ARBY'S.

(LAUGHTER)

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.426 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE OUR FIRST
CALLER.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.429 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW OBVIOUSLY SINCE THIS IS
C-SPAN THE CALLER WILL PROBABLY

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start position:0% line:91%
BE A NON-SCREENED, UNAPOLOGETIC
RACIST. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.969 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE ON THE AIR.

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.304 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Caller: JON, CLEARLY THE
PROBLEM HERE IS BLACK PEOPLE

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start position:0% line:91%
DON'T HAVE AN AMERICAN WORK
ETHIC AND CAN'T REALLY

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.609 line:91%
UNDERSTAND CIVILIZATION, SO AS
LONG AS PRESIDENT BROKE O'BUMMER

00:04:36.642 --> 00:04:38.444 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS IN OFFICE OPPRESSING WHITE
PEOPLE --

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:42.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY GOODBYE.

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:47.553 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S RETURN TO OUR EXAMINATION
OF HOW A BIPARTISAN SEX

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0% line:91%
TRAFFICKING BILL IS STUCK IN THE
SENATE.

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:59.598 line:91%
I BELIEVE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH
MCCONNELL WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:00.766 line:85%
A DISINGENUOUS POINT.

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:01.934 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LET'S NOT FILIBUSTER
BIPARTISAN HELP FOR VULNERABLE

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:02.234 align:start position:0% line:91%
VICTIMS JUST TO MAKE A POINT FOR
LEFT-WING SPECIAL INTEREST

00:05:02.267 --> 00:05:03.435 line:85%
GROUPS.

00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:05.671 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW DARE -- THE ONLY
REASON THE LANGUAGE IS IN THERE

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:08.874 line:91%
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE BOWING DOWN TO
RIGHT-WING SPECIAL INTEREST --

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:09.909 size:78% position:39% line:85%
YOU KNOW, SON OF A BITCH!

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:10.543 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANNA -- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING!

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:16.515 line:85%
TURTLE MAN! 

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:17.483 align:start position:0% line:91%
I, YOU KNOW WHAT -- I JUST, I
NEED A MOMENT.

00:05:17.516 --> 00:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
I NEED A MOMENT.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:21.487 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; UP NEXT WE'LL TRAIN OUR
CAMERAS ON AN EMPTY PODIUM LONG

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.657 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEFORE ANYONE APPROACHES
IT TO SPEAK.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.325 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT. I'M OKAY, I'M
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:30.062 size:84% position:42% line:91%
UNLESS SENATOR MCCONNELL IS
ABOUT TO IN THE IMMEDIATE

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:33.299 line:91%
AFTERMATH OF COMPLAINING THAT
THE DEMOCRATS ARE USING AN

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:36.936 size:88% position:44% line:91%
UNRELATED ISSUE TO HOLD UP
IMPORTANT SENATE BUSINESS --

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.005 size:81% position:41% line:91%
HOLD UP IMPORTANT SENATE
BUSINESS WITH AN UNRELATED

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:41.273 align:start position:0% line:85%
ISSUE.

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:45.010 line:91%
&gt;&gt; SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH
MCCONNELL SAYS HE WILL PUT OFF A

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:49.682 line:91%
CONFIRMATION VOTE ON ATTORNEY
GENERAL NOMINEE LORETTA LYNCH

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:50.616 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNTIL THE SENATE PASSES A HUMAN
TRAFFICKING BILL.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.585 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU'RE DOING THE
SAME THING -- HELP!

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:53.686 align:start position:0% line:85%
HELP! HELP!

00:05:53.719 --> 00:06:00.059 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE NOW REJOIN LIVE A
REENACTMENT OF A CIVIL WAR

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:01.527 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOOK PANEL.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.864 line:85%
&gt;&gt; BLAH, BLAH, BLAH GETTYSBURG.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:05.932 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%

OLD I WEAR A BOW TIE!

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.241 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; FASCINATING...

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:16.041 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL,
IT APPEARS THE FAILURE OF THE

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:17.443 size:88% position:44%
SEX TRAFFICKING BILL TO PASS

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.779 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE SENATE WOULD SEAL THE
VICTORY FOR (BLEEP)RY IN THIS

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
CASE BUT WE WON'T SURE UNTIL THE
VOTE ON THE

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.584 align:start position:0% line:91%
SENATE FLOOR ACCOMPANIED BY
CLASSICAL MUSIC TO MAKE YOU FEEL

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:26.552 align:start position:0% line:85%
SMART.

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:38.531 align:start position:0% line:91%
(MUSIC)
&gt;&gt; Jon: ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW

00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:39.398 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT, THIS IS JUST
TAKING TOO LONG.

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.833 align:start size:84% position:16% line:91%
I'M GONNA MAKE ANOTHER
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:48.641 align:start position:0% line:91%
SIX AND A HALF MINUTES AGO,
C-SPAN 2 GAVE ME AN INCREDIBLE

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:55.848 line:85%
OPPORTUNITY TO HOST THIS SHOW.

00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.451 line:91%
BUT I THINK NOW IT'S TIME FOR
SOMEONE ELSE, ANYONE ELSE.

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:03.355 align:start position:0% line:91%
"HATEWATCH" DOESN'T DESERVE A
HOST WHO'S EVEN SLIGHTLY

00:07:03.388 --> 00:07:04.389 align:start position:0% line:85%
NAUSEOUS.

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:06.859 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'LL BE
LEAVING "HATEWATCH."

00:07:06.892 --> 00:07:07.827 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH YES, I DO.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.395 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT (BLEEP) NOW.

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:09.929 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOW!

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.362 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT WAS A NIGHTMARE!
