00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:10.209
Daniel:<i> This is a bat that feeds
 exclusively on blood</i>

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:11.444
<i> as the name implies.</i>

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.579
<i> And the way that
 that bat feeds is</i>

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.148
<i>to make a razor sharp incision</i>

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.316
<i> into the animal that
 it is feeding on and</i>

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.687
<i>then it uses a specially grooved
 tongue to lap up blood.</i>

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.255 line:0%
That's not it,
because these bats

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.023 line:0%
also have anti-coagulants
in their saliva

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:25.491 line:0%
which keep that blood flowing

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:29.028 line:0%
and after they finish eating,
they can just hop up into air

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.362
which is really
unusual for a bat

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:32.298
most have to climb
up onto something.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.801
So, all of these traits
make bats incredibly

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.803
good transmitters
of rabies virus.

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:38.071
<i>Rabies has been described</i>

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:42.108
<i>in ancient Chinese and Arabic
texts as an incurable wound</i>

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.010
<i> resulting from the bite
 of a rabid animal.</i>

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.213
<i> That incurable part of
 rabies is still true.</i>

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.148
<i> We still don't have a
 treatment for people</i>

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.917
<i> once they start to
 show signs of rabies.</i>

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.053
<i>Even by the most rudimentary
standards that we have now</i>

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:56.689
<i>one person still dies of the
 disease every 15 minutes</i>

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:58.658
<i>and another 300 are exposed.</i>

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.693
We are talking about
50,000-60,000 people

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:01.760
dying every year.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.331
<i>The natural response of the
people that are affected by this</i>

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.866
<i> is to kill bats.</i>

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.101
<i> The state sanctioned
 way of killing bats</i>

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:11.103
<i> is using a poison
 called vampiricide.</i>

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:13.772
<i>Where essentially a poison is
mixed together with Vaseline</i>

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:15.341
<i> and that's spread on
 the back of a bat.</i>

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:17.410
They release that one, it
flies back to its roost.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.245
And the other ones groom it off,
ingest the poison and die.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:21.614
Sounds straightforward enough.

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:24.116
Unfortunately, there's
not really much evidence

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:26.219
that it's doing anything
to control rabies.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.888
One of the first questions
that I wanted to ask was

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.856
why is it that this
conventional wisdom

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.193
that the only good
bat is a dead bat

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.294
isn't actually
doing its purpose.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.798
So, one of the most, I think,
innovative and exciting ideas

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.333
we've had in the last,
really, six months

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.302
is whether we can
replace the poison

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.137
that's used in
the vampiricide

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:46.773
with an oral rabies vaccine.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.942
In Peru, we're
in a spectacular

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.543
situation to be
able to try this.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.912
We've recently detected that

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.781
there are actually
travelling waves of rabies

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.049
moving down different
valleys of the Andes.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.618
So, you can actually
see this on the map

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:01.253
<i>where the dark points are
 the old rabies cases</i>

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.456
<i> the light points are the
 new rabies cases.</i>

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.758
<i> And we see them in a
 very step like manner</i>

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.959
<i>moving through these valleys.</i>

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.527
That is powerful.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:11.029
That allows us tell
farmers, "okay

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.265
you're going to
have rabies.

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:13.999
You don't have it now,
but you will in a month

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.935
you will in six months,
you will in a year."

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.170
That allows them to make

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.305
an informed decision
about vaccination.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.141
Second, this is a
really powerful

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:23.710
experimental opportunity.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.479
We can consider this valley and
there are several others like it

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.148
we can consider these as
experimental replicates.

00:02:29.148 --> 00:02:32.251
Can we try vaccinating at
various stages in the valley

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.253
or across different valleys and

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.155
compare that with other
types of interventions.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.391
And say what works,
what doesn't...

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.193
can we use science
to figure this out?
