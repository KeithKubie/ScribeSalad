00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.870
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But how does color blindness come from cones.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.335
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, actually before we talk about color blindness, I think it makes sense to

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.874
talk a little bit about color.

00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:12.300
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that's a great idea, because what exactly is color.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.405
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, remember how we talked about how sound is a wave. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:17.754
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; light's actually a wave too. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, really?

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:22.970
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so, what that means is that, well, remember the properties of waves. Do you

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.535
remember which property corresponded to pitch?

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:26.995
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, that was frequency.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:32.980
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. And so, what would a, for example, high frequency wave look like?

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.715
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It would look like this.

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:36.420
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And what about a low frequency wave?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.412
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It would look like this.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:43.136
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Excellent. That's perfect. So, high frequency, lots of fast oscillations; low

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:47.684
frequency, fewer waves per second, slower oscillations.

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:49.780
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, what does frequency have to do with light waves?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.816
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Lauren, with light, we actually usually talk about wavelength, which is

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:55.708
the distance between let's say, here and here.

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:59.612
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And light waves can have all sorts of wavelengths, but we can only see certain

00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:01.390
wavelengths.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.590
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which wavelengths can we see?

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.226
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The smallest we can see is 400 nanometers, and the largest is about 750.

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:08.829
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But, what's a nanometer?

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:15.645
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; right, well, 1 nanometer is actually equal to 1 billionth of a meter.

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:19.090
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, what's the difference between the big ones and the small ones?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.278
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, that's how we see color. Let me show you something.
