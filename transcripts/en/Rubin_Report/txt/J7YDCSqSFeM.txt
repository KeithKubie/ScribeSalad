Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          All right. So I want to shift a little bit to foreign policy because I think that's sort of, uh, one of your, one of your, would you say that's one of your main strengths? So my claim to fame was counter terrorism and stuff like this, but, but really deep down, I'm a strategy wank. Yeah. Grand Strategy is my thing. Okay. So we'll talk, we'll talk in the lens and strategy then. So as we're taping this right now, I mentioned earlier, it's gonna, it's gonna sit on the shelf for a couple of days. Um, so I don't want to get too lost in anything that happened today, but at the moment it's a little upside down in Syria. We don't, there might've been strikes already from when we're taping this. Hungary just had elections. Um, in your Wikipedia that I referenced earlier, it says you work through for the guy who just won you apparently you never worked for him. You don't want to face potty. I wasn't victim Audubon's advising, which is what it says. We have the PD at least. Um, what's your general thoughts on foreign policy strategy? Like, what is a sensible

Speaker 3:          00:58          policy and, and his Trump applying that view. Uh, first things first, uh, the great irony of all nation is that we are the most powerful nation in the world has ever seen. And until recently we have been the dumbest and most a strategic. I mean, we haven't done, we haven't thought or acted strategically since about 1989. November the ninth when the Berlin Wall fell. And this is, you know, um, how have we active, what would you say that since then it's just, Oh, well we want security. Nineties was just this kind of confused. What is national security about lurching for the snooze button. Just who are the threats? Is it China is a weapons of mass destruction and say you can slog it. It was just a mess. And then we had 2001 and nine 11, and we had just neo con disasters. There's not an accident.

Speaker 3:          01:49          These guys were former Trotskyites because there's so naive, the way they look at the world, that we're going to create democracy at the end of a gun barrel in a country with 36 languages that defeated Alexander the Great and the British empire and the Soviets. You couldn't be stupid or if you tried. So, you know, we, we, we, we've done some very, very foolish things because we haven't stuck to the basics. Strategy at the end of the day is about one thing. It's about prioritization based upon interests, right? You've got to say some things are more important than others. And guess what? Some countries are more important than others. And in a postmodern secular world, you're not allowed to or know all countries or Vanuatu is as important as Turkey wrong. It's partly, I mean, I love the people that I out too, but no, it's not a geo strategic input to the, to the country of America.

Speaker 3:          02:41          So number one, we have to prioritize. And I think this administration, I doff my cap to Nadia, shadow low, uh, uh, HR mcmasters deputy, she held the pen in the meetings that I was in on the new national security strategy of America. And I tell you, David, it is the first document of that name in 30 years that deserves the name national security strategy. Every administration has them. This is the first one that says, this is what we stand for. These are our values, these are our friends, these are our enemies and this is what we're going to prioritize. Prior to that, it was laundry list of well we're going to have to front walls, we're going to save the whales. And you know, no. So you have to prioritize. And finally this administration is about America first. Uh, we are not isolationists nor are we interventionists.

Speaker 3:          03:27          This is really annoys me that if you're a conservative for 20 years you were given two options, button a invade other people's countries and occupy them button B, B around the Sta and close the, you know, the curtains on the Pacific and the Atlantic and say, we don't care about anybody else. Well guess what is the most powerful nation in the world? There is a large pallet of options. It's gotta be something in the middle of their, yeah. So it's about being smart. It's about our interests. And to summarize the president's approach, this isn't official, but I like it. We have numerous former generals and active generals from the Marine Corps at the highest level of the administration should have the joint chiefs, Chief of staff, secretary defense. And the interesting thing is they all come from the same Marine Corps division, not just the Marine Corps, the same division.

Speaker 3:          04:17          And that division has a motto, no better friend, no worse enemy. That's America first. So when you see someone like John Bolton, uh, now part of the cabinet, and if you were to look on, you know, not that you can get truth out of Twitter, but the day it was happening, you know, everybody's saying this is going to start world war three and you know, just the general hysterics. And now John Bolton is definitely private suspect. More of a neo con then you're comfortable with, is that, I don't think it's fair to them. Naoko I, I don't, I don't think he's ideologically driven. If you watch the videos that he, you know, we're recording of his speech is 20 years ago he was sounding very much like Trump, we're American, we have interests. You want to work with us, fight. If you don't, there's a problem. So I think it's very telling that within 40 minutes of the president's tweet about John Coming on board, um, massive Balkan gave an interview on Fox and they asked them about what are you going to be like as a national security advisor?

Speaker 3:          05:15          And he gave a very interesting answer. He quoted Dean Acheson and you know, the, the, the Doyenne of foreign policy in America. And uh, I don't know if this is true story, but John said the mattress than was once once asked, how do you have such a good relationship with the president you serve and the mattress and said, well, it's very easy. We may disagree on policy issues, but at the end of the day, I never forget who was elected president. And it wasn't me that uh, John Bolton 2.0 he understands that unlike his predecessor HR McMaster, he's not there to lecture the president or foist his version of what you should do onto the commodity and chief. He's at to be an honest broker and provide a palliative options because guess who gets to decide the person who was elected president. So I am very excited about John and I, I'm, I'm as excited about Mike Palm coming from the CIA to the State Department that we are in.

Speaker 3:          06:12          Very good hands, David. So how do you make sure if, if it's between the pure isolationists and, and the neo cons or something, something like the nation builders, something like that. How do you make sure that not everything that you do outside of our borders becomes something much bigger? I mean, look, we're still at war in Afghanistan. I don't think anyone knows why at the, I mean, can you, can you tell me why we're at war in Afghanistan? Can anyone tell, tell you is why, why we went, why we went to Afghanistan in October of [inaudible]. One is the only reason we should be that today. Nothing's changed. Okay? The idea that goes go to school. I love it. I get it that people can listen to music freely and the Taliban load execute you. My parents lived under communism. My father suffered under fascism. He protected his fellow Jewish classmates during the occupation of Budapest.

Speaker 3:          07:00          I get it. I don't like those kinds of systems, but there's only one reason we're there to make sure that that piece of land less would never ever again be used to execute mass casualty attacks in Manhattan, in Washington or in a field in Pennsylvania. End of story. It's not about building a ring road around Kabul. The not even the Soviets could finish. It's not about building hospitals. I'm sorry. You never make the ideal, the enemy of the good. What the president does is he looks at things as questions of possibility. You cannot be a massively successful realtor in the toughest market in New York or in the world which in New York real estate. If you have a filter that distorts reality, I mean, either this square footage is worth x or it's not worth x according to the market. And that's how he approaches these issues.

Speaker 3:          07:48          So Afghanistan's only important to make sure bad guys don't use it again to kill Americans in America. So you, so you would say, or at least if you, if you had to guesstimate basically what he believes, you would say that he believes that still keeping us there at the moment is still accomplishing. Yeah. Oh, I don't have to guesstimate. I can tell you that. Yeah. So you believe that as well because it just seems unclear and it has nothing that has nothing to do. He will. He will never, I tell you right. This 71 year old man who is now the most powerful man in the world will never, ever, ever buy into a nation building scenario anywhere outside of the United States. Not happening for the next seven years. End of story. And the idea that you have my followers on Twitter tearing their hair out, the boltons going to house in Syria, guys got a grip on reality.

Speaker 3:          08:39          And stop talking about crisis actors and 10 fold hot garbage. It's not going to happen while the president's the president. Well that I tweeted something to that effect the day of the Bolton thing because it also reminds me that people don't understand basic deterrence that you have to bring in people that you know, talk a big game so that perhaps radio hello. Yeah. Right. The man who was going to take us to war. What did he do? I think the success in North Korea today has in large part being pop had been uh, uh, thanks to his tweets because that's how you deal with the potatoes. You make fun of them, they hate that. And then you ridicule them, right? And then you do what? You scare them. Oh, and Lo and behold, they want to negotiate for the first time in 65 years. Well, isn't that interesting?

Speaker 3:          09:27          Do you think there's any chance he would ever give up his nukes? About 3% because at that point, what leverage does he have left? Right. So that you still think it's worth having the talks to figure out what we can, absolutely. Because what's happened for the last 25 years? Escalation, escalation, escalation. I mean we, we have given into nuclear blackmail since Bill Clinton. Uh, so yeah, we, we have to at the end of the day, we have to remember in 1953 was not a peace treaty in 1953 in Korea was a cease firing and all MREs. That is actually a war that's just simply been frozen for 65 years. Would be nice to have a little bit of a peace treaty or something. Yeah. How much of what's happening in the world right now? Do you, you must be thrilled, I assume with everything going on at the UN that Nikki Haley is basically walked in there and, and John Bolton 2.0 yeah.

Speaker 3:          10:18          Yeah. I mean, she strikes me as, I almost wondered, did Trump really know what he was getting with high Billy? Yeah. Did anyone know? Anybody? Did? Yeah. Where, where did the, did you know her at all? Where do you think that that of, I don't know her as a friend. Um, she found herself, she found herself in more power to her. What, what usefulness do you see in the UN at this point? Because it seems like truly it seems like the most corrupt should be backwards pushed into the river. I mean really, I mean, well, the buildings basically now they're going to quote that and go, you see, he was calling for, to be knocking to the river. Um, look, the idea was a good idea in 1945 in San Francisco, let's have an organization that stops us from killing 60 million people again. Um, but when you lock in dictatorships like China and Russia into the Security Council with veto power and then you create this, this empire of UN organizations, I mean, has there been a year in the last 20 years that we haven't seen a UN scandal, whether it's money for oil, whether it's UN troops raping children in Africa?

Speaker 3:          11:32          Have we seen it one year without a UN scandal? I don't think so. So try and reform it and if you calm was questioned the validity of what it does or forget. I don't talking about, you know, the, the, the, the, the children's rights organizations and food, food security. I'm talking about its main mission, which is stability and safety. It's failed abysmally. Yeah. What

Speaker 2:          11:53          do you make of the endless obsession with Israel that something like 47 over the last 51 resolutions are against Israel and usually usually voted on by countries. I'm sorry.

Speaker 3:          12:03          That alone is a reason to dissolve the UN. I mean what a lack of moral compass, what an utter bankruptcy of the morality that there are nations in the world that actually still have slavery going on. Slavery where we're basic human rights for individuals are not guaranteed based upon sex based upon lifestyle choices. And you're going to lambaste Israel, the only real democracy in the Middle East. Yeah, I say I think you nailed it. I mean that that in and of itself is a reason enough to question the future of the UN.

Speaker 2:          12:43          So is the u s sort of in an odd position where it's like if we don't do anything, nothing can get done sort of. And that that then puts us endlessly in these quagmires or at least in these positions where we can either watch the world burn or get involved in things where we may end up adding to the burning in the first place. Like for example, you know with Russia going into Crimea, they gave up their weapons, right? They gave up the weapons and they said, all right, NATO is going to take care of us, but what that really means is the United States is going to take care of you, and I'm not saying we should have gone in and done anything there, but that we're in this endless situation now where it is either us there, there is no international fighting.

Speaker 3:          13:22          When I was super careful not to get caught in a binary dichotomy, you can absolutely say a world without American leadership is a more dangerous world because it was for the last day is look, I mean we had a government that actually said, we're going to lead from behind, which is an oxymoron. You cannot lead from behind. We're going to have strategic patients, which means we do nothing and allow others to act. What happened? You name it from China building fake mandatory basis on fake islands to isis, to Russia invading. It was just a disaster.

Speaker 2:          13:56          We back the guy, then we got my other guys, then we backed off there.

Speaker 3:          14:00          So yeah, to say that a welder on record leadership is, is more dangerous, is true, but that doesn't mean that we have to fix everybody's problem and nuts. That's where smart strategy comes in where you say, look, we have a moral duty to espouse certain values, but that doesn't mean we are responsible for all human beings. Because, because the American revolution says the opposite, right? Each nation is responsible, the citizens are responsible. If you don't like your system, do something about it because guess what we did against the most powerful empire in the world. So, um, again, it's about finding that happy medium in the middle and being smart about it. And again, we're not being callous, being realistic, right? There are atrocities everywhere from Orlando to t three Yugoslavia, Father American taxpayers are gonna pay for fixing all of them. Are we responsible? Are they responsible for what's happening in their country? Sure are the times when we could perhaps help them. Uh Huh. But it's a balance right,

Speaker 2:          15:08          to balance. All right, so let's shift back to your book. So defeating Jihad, it seems to me that the, the main sort of narrative on this is not that we can defeat it, but we should live with it. That there's a degree of it with which we should just live, which is don't carry knives in London and it's, you know, we're going to put up more barricades so the trucks can't be driven into buildings or into shopping centers or just down the street and killing people that we can't really defeat this ideology. We just have to manage it. I suspect you do not agree with that premise. Oh, because we've defeated ideologists before. You can't look, there are idiots who run around with swats grand bands today.

Speaker 3:          15:49          I get it. So Nazi-ism hasn't disappeared, but we have made it so enough of that. If you walk down the street with a Nazi flag, you will be rejected by society instantly. The same thing with the KKK, right? Saudi not with Che Guevara for the hammer and sickle, right, right, right. But there are ways to defeat ideologies or to put them in a box where they're laughable and everybody shuns them. We have to do the same thing with jihadism. This is my argument. This is the conclusion of the book. We have to be as effective in dealer [inaudible] the message of GF because very simply put killing jihadis is great, but at the end of the day, uh, body bags as a metric, not a good metric. It didn't work in Vietnam. Doesn't work today because guess what? If you've got a recruiting pool that's massive, not just recruit new jihadis.

Speaker 3:          16:37          So what's your victory condition of victory condition is when the life style of jihad is no longer sexy from Brussels to San Bernardino. How do you do that? You make a laughingstock. You discredit that value system. We're not asked. I mean, white skinned Catholic isn't going to do it right? But we help President Sisi, we help King Abdullah of Jordan will help MBS in Saudi Arabia. I mean, MBS, the historic things he said, I mean massive about Israel in just the last few weeks. Yeah. That's how we win. Because sooner or later enough people say, Eh, uh, those guys are losers. That's how we win. Yeah. But you only do that if you get to talk about it. Truthfully. You've gotta be able to talk about the Koran, what Jihad means, the history of the religion. Because if you can't talk about it, honestly, you're never going to treat it accurately.

Speaker 3:          17:27          Yeah. We're not very good at that though. Well, thanks. Political correctness, right? I mean, imagine if you know, you're, you're a doctor and you've got a patient that comes in with third stage lymphoma, but your hospital administrator, because it's a scary word, has banned the use of the word cancer. You can't say it right. It's just not allowed. Yeah. And then you have to tell the patient what, well, you know, you're dehydrated. Go home, drink some water and take some aspirin. What happens? You patient, they die. It's the same thing. If you can't diagnose a geo strategical issue accurately, however much money you throw at it, you will not solve the problem. So are you concerned at all that just even if it's purely because of the way the media frames things, that perhaps Trump is not the right person to lead the fight against this, that for whatever, whatever he's going to say about Jihad or a radical Islamic terrorism or the rest, even if he said everything the exact way that you wanted it to be said cleanly and clearly and correctly defined and all of that, that he may not be the right messenger on this just because of the filter it has to get through to get to reality.

Speaker 3:          18:34          He's not the right messenger domestically because of what political correctness is wrought in our country. But he is absolutely the right messenger internationally. Watch the video of his Riyadh speech. Don't watch him. Watch the 53 Mosley matter of heads of state and the body language because man did he guys, you got a problem and your master and your society's extremes that you have to deal with it. It was tough and you'd thing that'd be all negative and arms crossed. They were beaming. Right. Cc Abdulla we're going over finally find a guy who understands our problem and what is giving us tough love. So yeah, he is absolutely the right guy to fix this internationally, which is where it needs to be fixed domestically. Now the political correctness things going to get in the way, the media insanity. So do you think he has more support from foreign heads of state and then we'll ever have a sense.

Speaker 3:          19:30          I mean even if the g eight there was a feeling of like that actually these guys kinda liked him or I can tell you, yeah, I told people before the inauguration, you have no idea. Even if you voted for him, you have no idea how successful he will be internationally because he's a straight shooter and because he's an Alpha dog. And guess what? In a lot of places outside of Berkeley, they like have that right, because they know what you're talking about. They don't have to walk on eggshells. They understand your direction. So, yeah, internationally, our prestige as a nation has skyrocketed in, you know, outside of the European Union and maybe, you know, certain century pin countries exempted. Yeah, absolutely. So I know we could do a whole other show on this, but, but very quickly just on Russia and collusion, as someone that has been around the administration, you've mentioned some of these people already, Flynn, you know, down the road.

Speaker 3:          20:32          What can you tell me about that and is there anything that people should be worried about or do you think this is all gonna actually points us back to the Democrats, which every time it seems, every time it seems to point to Trump, you go a little bit further and then you're going, oh whoa, wait a minute. That was actually the Democrats doing my good friend has a, the best morning show in DC, a m Chris plot of the radio host is actually a national syndicated now. And I have to credit him with this. He says it's the, it's the last scene from the hunt for Red October when the bad captain Tupelo launches the, the, the torpedoes against, you know, Sean Connery on the radio, Toba and he takes the fuses off and then what happens? Remember his Xo says you killed off the thing, comes back and syncs them.

Speaker 3:          21:15          This is the most hilarious boomerang in history, right? I'll tell you what the president told me in the Oval Office, just the two of us. It was very frustrating. One day I think maybe Jared had just testified or given his speech, his little press conference, and he said, they will not find anything because there is nothing, and you know what? I take that to the bank. There is no Russian collusion. How could there be off for the last 15 months from arming the Ukrainians to the XL pipeline to Anwar to finally, after 30 years, the first present to ever get NATO to finally stump up the 2% of GDP that they promised they'd spend on defense to our own military expenditure increases. Every significant policy decision as president has taken with regards to Russia has been bad for that former KGB colonel. So the idea that with colluding, you have to be on drugs or be so ideologically blind to believe that, well then what do we do with this?

Speaker 3:          22:15          This layer, you know, whatever that you, you've referenced deep state before [inaudible] what do we do with this thing? You know the look, we have an ongoing investigation to me, the Mueller and get investigated. What seems odd to me is that I don't know what the actual, I don't know that they ever laid out with their mission is other than to find something, what was the crime? Right? And so the illusion to commit to collusion to conspire in a crime. Okay, but what's the crime? Because if it's Russia misrepresenting itself or perverting the truth on Facebook, well then Zuckerberg should be right charged then, then you know, Anderson Cooper should be in the doc.

Speaker 3:          23:02          What are the charges that have been brought outrageously ridiculous lying to federal investigators? You, you would probably be able to be caught in a perjury trap today. Okay. Because not everybody remembers what they did and how they did it. Perjury traps about what you said to somebody Irri irrespective of Russia. That's not Donald Trump's problem. Why a fraud eight years ago when Manafort worked for the Ukrainian president, what's that got to do with Russian collusion? Nothing. My worry is that Mueller is not a good actor. If you look at who is hired, it's clear that there's massive buyers and this report he's writing for Congress is simply going to be a political weapon in the elections and that's not how justice is served. That's not rule of law. That's a law enforcement official getting involved in politics,

Speaker 2:          23:59          so that's what I'm concerned about. Also whether, whether you think something for the people that are watching this that thinks something happened or didn't happen. What I'm more concerned about is that we're entering this new phase where whether it's Trump that's president or it's a Democrat that's president or it's a different republican or whatever, that we're just going to endlessly also have this layer that all it does is investigate itself, waste money. You know, just constantly just be keeping us all in this state where we never know what's real. Because if you listen to half of the pundits on television, I mean their implication is that Russia has installed our president, in which case that's probably the single biggest active board and the history of the world. And what are you actually saying? Do we take Trump out and then do you take out pants and now should Paul, right? Have you taken to its logical conclusion or do we have Paul Ryan as what are your resident then and w right? Where are you really taking this? And that's what I'm worried about is that we're just going to end up in this constant state where yes, we'll have a democrat and then a republican or whatever, but we'll really be caught in just con all government can do is investigate itself really more than anything else.

Speaker 2:          25:01          I didn't see myself as an optimist, but you're giving me a real challenge with that last one. I see myself as an optimist too, but I think, um, I'm a realist. So for months and months, a month,

Speaker 3:          25:11          it's all refuse to use the phrase deep state. I really thought that was a, you know, 10 fold, Hattie kind of thing

Speaker 2:          25:16          and one of the record, I don't even know that I've even said it once on this show. It sort of pops up and answer.

Speaker 3:          25:21          I use it now because I've seen it, I've seen it inside the administration. When you go to enough National Security Council meetings that are classified, that is the, the, the, the pinnacle of policy making in America outside of the Oval Office. And this is where policy's made. Everybody's in the room from the NSC. Then you've got the outstations on secure VTC from Dia, uh, chair of the joint chiefs, CIA state, you name it, right? And you sit there as a newly appointed political, and you're next to, for two hours on a big issue, isis, Russia, whatever it is. And not one participant mentions the name of the president or what he said yesterday in Warsaw or what his objective is, given that specific issue.

Speaker 2:          26:11          And you see this happen again and again and again. And you're the guy at the end of the conversation with the funny accent and says, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, you do know what the president said about X. Yes, today. Can we actually do that? The deep state is real when you've got gs fifteens and ses is saying, well, I've been here for 20 years. I know this guy's gonna be here for four. I know better. That's bad for democracy. So to be clearly, you don't think it's some sort of massive underground conspiracy. You think it's just the apparatus, the, it's just the old Washington apparatus. I

Speaker 3:          26:44          don't think you have these people who think Obama is sitting in a cave somewhere with a joystick. He's lazy. He never be a monster. My, he's not specter, right? It's not Blofeld but, but know that there's a culture in government that's antithetical to an undermining, undermining the president on a daily basis. But, but there is, there is concerted effort in the media. Oh my gosh. I mean Ben Rhodes brags about Ai. That guy's unbelievable. But he says, my buddies, the left wing journalists are morons. And then my echo chamber, he, he built this machine that was, was this incestuous connection between people in the West Wing, people in the think tank community and their bodies in the media. I mean, look at the attack pieces on anybody, me or whatever. It's very interesting that somebody should do a case study agendas in school. One attack piece will drop at 7:00 AM by two o'clock in the afternoon, 30 have been written, which are simply cut and paste.

Speaker 3:          27:39          But if you don't know that, it looks as, oh my gosh, go cause a fascist. No. It's one guy's article that was written because Ben Rhodes told them to ride it. The Co comes and multiplies on the right. How do we react? Well, I got my own pet international review this month, right. There's a Gulf in terms of managing narrative. The left built built a whole ecosystem and we're still in the 1980s you know, oh we'll take out a full page ad in the Washington. Well that's why when discussing, right. Yeah.
