[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:06.890
DAVID NIHILL: Thanks for coming.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.190
I didn't think I would
be climbing over people

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.530
to get through the room.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.030
Somebody must have started a
vicious rumor that Taylor Swift

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.280
was coming here today, not me.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.420
She will be around Dublin.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.820
Someone always dodgy is singing
in Dublin when I'm here.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.960
The last time I was in
Google, it was Justin Bieber.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.230
So I don't know who's
booking this schedule.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.910
I do totally hate
public speaking

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.080
and I always have done, and
I know that sounds crazy.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.262
My nickname in university
was always Shaking Stevens.

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:37.720
I don't know if you've had it
when you hold a bit of paper,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:38.919
or something like this.

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:40.710
And it's in your hands
and your presenting,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.490
and you're like,
why is it shaking?

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.830
Oh, no, and you're
looking around.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.510
For me, it actually
went through my body

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.250
so much that I became like
an Irish salsa dancer.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.561
It was going
absolutely everywhere.

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:52.810
And you'll see it happens now.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.280
Can you see it shaking?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.090
Can't control it, so
I just don't do it.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.840
That was one of the
first things I learned

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.930
not to do pretty quickly.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.090
And for this predicament
did I find myself in,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.147
I blame Americans.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:05.230
I don't know if you've
been there or noticed this,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.350
but they're a lot more
positive than Irish people

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.200
and they will support you
with anything, no matter

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.970
how bad the plan sounds.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.890
You could be like, I'm
going to give up my job

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.170
and sell inflatable
penguins on the internet,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.710
and they'll go like,
(AMERICAN ACCENT)

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.709
you should do that, man.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.260
That could be great.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.780
Sometimes you just
miss Irish people

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.880
to tell you that's
a horrible plan.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.740
Get those penguins
down off eBay.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.290
You're bringing
shame to the family.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.930
They would tell you very quickly
that it's not a good idea

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.820
to do with your time.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.010
Literally, I was so bad in
the Shaking Stevens days

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.718
that when I went to
university originally

00:01:37.718 --> 00:01:39.520
in IT Tallaght and
then later in UCD--

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.100
but at IT Tallaght
people in other classes

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.110
knew I was so bad that it
was worth coming to see me.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.439
That's a very Irish thing.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.230
They're like, this is
going to be terrible.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.339
Let's go see it.

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:54.130
And I'd be there and
I'd be looking around.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.465
I'm like, who are those
extra people down the back?

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:58.900
They're like, they came
to see you go to pieces.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.344
And I was like, oh, man.

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:03.760
And it kind of got the better
me all through my existence.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.400
And it does sound like the worst
plan ever, what I did the end,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.820
was to do stand-up comedy
intensively for a full year

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.040
to try and get over a
fear of public speaking.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.640
But I loved Malcolm Gladwell.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.140
I don't if you know
him as a writer.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.470
And I love Tim Ferriss
and I loved AJ Jacobs,

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.290
and I loved anyone who wrote
about the 80-20 principle.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.030
Basically, all
authors that had said

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.550
you could short-cut
learning processes.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.220
There was a way to
do things quickly

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.430
and that people who had
mastery in a certain topic

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.990
had usually clocked up
about 10,000 hours doing it.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.297
So one thing-- you could
shortcut to a certain level.

00:02:35.297 --> 00:02:37.630
But if you wanted to be a
true master, who would that be

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.710
and what would they do?

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.960
So that was Malcolm
Gladwell's 10,000 hours--

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.550
that if you looked
at Bill Gates,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.410
or you looked at the Beatles,
or you looked at anyone

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.770
who had huge
success in one area,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.228
they usually hit
that 10,000 hours.

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:50.140
So I was like, well, who's
better at this than anyone

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.060
in the world on public speaking?

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.596
Surely, it's comedians.

00:02:53.596 --> 00:02:54.970
Like, they're up
there doing this

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.554
in the worst of
circumstances every night,

00:02:57.554 --> 00:02:59.470
where people might be
coming in off the street

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.200
after having a horrible day--

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.760
depressed, lost their
job, drinking alcohol,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.697
close their arms, sit there,
and go, make me laugh.

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:09.530
And you're like, surely,
night after night--

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.740
and it turns out comedians,
on average, the ones that

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.470
are dedicating themselves, do
it-- put about four hours a day

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.290
between actually being on
stage and crafting the content

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.620
to get on stage.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.860
And usually, they estimate
it takes about seven years

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.500
to make an income full-time
from stand-up comedy, which

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.200
is roughly about
those 10,000 hours.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.020
And I didn't come across
any of this voluntarily.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.990
A friend of mine tragically
had a spinal cord injury,

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.480
fell from a third story
balcony, and doctors told him

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.734
he'd never walk again.

00:03:35.734 --> 00:03:37.150
And he didn't want
to accept that.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.820
And his insurance company
cut him off and wouldn't

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.010
fund his recovery attempts.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.010
And all my American friends
were super positive.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.460
They're like, no, we're going
to get him through this.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.610
We're going to do fundraisers.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.827
We're going to get the money.

00:03:46.827 --> 00:03:48.410
And it kind of rubbed
off on me a bit.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.429
And I was like, well, maybe
I can do something, as well.

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.470
And I said, well, why
don't we do a charity show?

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.490
I know this comedian.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.720
Maybe I can get
him to headline it.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.053
He just happens to be my next
door neighbor at the time.

00:03:58.053 --> 00:03:59.070
Maybe he'll do it.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.040
And I went to my friend Arash
and I said, we should do this.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.200
And he's like, oh,
man, that's great.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.520
You're going to be
the host, right?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.519
You're going to host it?

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.150
I was like, oh, no.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.370
He did not know what all
my Irish friends knew

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.710
and all those extra people
in the back of the room in IT

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.580
Tallaght you that I was not very
good at that kind of carrying

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.080
on.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.440
But it gave me a
kind of a reason

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.620
to realize the ridiculous
of the fear I had

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.014
and it gave me a belief that
maybe you could overcome it.

00:04:23.014 --> 00:04:25.180
And I think I've learned
the hard way after all this

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.040
that you never really overcome
a fear of public speaking.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.520
And I think so many people
get sold on the belief

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.900
that you will overcome it.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.370
Take this 10-step program.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.210
Take this class.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.020
Do this weekend.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.180
You can overcome it.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.500
And everyone I met never
really overcame that fear.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.090
They just learned to manage it.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.460
And that's exactly what
happened to me over time.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.050
So I started talking
to comedians.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.140
I said, right, I wouldn't
describe public speaking

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.974
as a crippling fear.

00:04:47.974 --> 00:04:50.223
I was like, my friend's
sitting there in a wheelchair,

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.540
looking at me saying, you're
going to host this thing?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.270
You can't even consider using
that word in that room anymore.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.740
So I'm like, it's just, look
at what you're going through.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.780
I'm afraid of speaking.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.140
That just makes no sense.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.744
And especially when you break
down the term public speaking--

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:04.410
like, Irish people
hate public speaking,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.576
but imagine going to Irish--

00:05:05.576 --> 00:05:06.946
Irish people love speaking.

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:09.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.380
We love speaking.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.700
We just hate public speaking.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.320
It makes no sense.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.560
You're like, do you
like speaking, do you?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.080
Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.413
Do you ever do it in public,
you talk to people, you do?

00:05:16.413 --> 00:05:17.060
Oh, I do, yeah.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.090
What about public speaking?

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.810
Oh, no, no, no.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.706
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:23.190
But it just has this weird,
very weird thing when

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.536
you put these things together.

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:26.910
So I was like, right, the time
has come to try, at least,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.350
and get over this, or manage it.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:29.580
I wanted to do
this charity event.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.288
So I talked to all
the comedians I could.

00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:33.092
I did as much research
as I possibly could.

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:35.550
I really dived into this and
went way down the rabbit hole.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.560
Did the charity show--
it went really well.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.507
One of the main comics
thought it went so well

00:05:39.507 --> 00:05:41.340
that he asked me to
open for him at a comedy

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.325
club, the main comedy
club in San Francisco.

00:05:43.325 --> 00:05:44.700
And I was like,
should I tell him

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.400
I have no idea what I'm doing?

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.080
No, so I did it.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.580
And that scared
the life out of me.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.359
And I did it again
and I did it again.

00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:54.150
And I was very much
influenced by an author

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.020
called AJ Jacobs I don't know
if you've read any of his work.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.520
I love him.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.760
He goes into topics
intensively for one year.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.344
So he was a guy who wrote "The
Year of Living Biblically."

00:06:03.344 --> 00:06:05.760
You ever read it, where he
followed the rules of the Bible

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.500
to the letter, the law,
even though he was Jewish?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.789
He took it extremely seriously.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.830
At one stage, he was in
New York in Times Square,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.510
throwing rocks at adulterers.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.266
It's a really, really good book.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:20.640
So I was like,
right, intensively

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.230
for a year-- stand-up comedy.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.867
I can't tell any
of my Irish friends

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:25.950
this plan because they're
not going to support it.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.270
They're not like
the American ones.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.130
They're going to be
like, what you are doing?

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.130
You had your master's degree.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.780
You're not using it.

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.970
You're going to be a comedian
with no intention of being

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:33.469
a comedian?

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.950
It just makes no
sense long-term.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.020
But I did it anyway.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.970
And it turned out it's quite
hard to clog up stage time

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.750
if people know you don't
know what you're doing,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.360
so I had to make it look
like I'd been around doing

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.152
comedy for a while.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:44.693
And nobody in America
could pronounce

00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:46.080
my last name, which is Nihill.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.790
It was a bit unusual
even in Ireland.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.430
So they kept calling
me Irish Dave.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.540
So I was like,
there's a good stage

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.910
name that sounds horrendous
all at the same time.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.510
Irish Dave-- so I had to get
Irish Dave a website to make it

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.051
look like he'd been around for
a while and very professional,

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.060
and a Facebook page.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.810
And at the time--
mildly controversial--

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.330
but you could go on
Fiverr.com and buy likes.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.890
So Irish Dave was pretty
popular there, for a while.

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.125
Mostly in India.

00:07:10.125 --> 00:07:11.477
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:11.477 --> 00:07:13.310
That would have been a
real red flag for me,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.726
but Americans, they
seemed OK with it.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.100
Even the concept,
I was like, why

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.446
would Irish Dave be big in
Ireland for doing comedy?

00:07:19.446 --> 00:07:20.820
That's the worst
stage name ever.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.552
That's like a guy called
American Frank touring America.

00:07:23.552 --> 00:07:25.260
Like, wait, what's
the American part for?

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.930
Anyway, nobody questioned it.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.700
So this got a little bit out
of control and it ended up--

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.560
this is at the end
of a full year.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.560
And The Moth is a storytelling
competition in the US.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.080
It's true stories told
live with no notes

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.030
and this is the biggest
competition final

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.290
they do anywhere in the world.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.664
It's in San
Francisco and there's

00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:42.960
1,400 people in the audience.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.257
And that little ant on stage
about to lay an egg is me.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.090
And if you came up and
hugged me after that,

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.715
you'd felt like you
just hugged someone

00:07:49.715 --> 00:07:51.450
who got out of the shower--

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.742
not good, not sexy,
not anything like that.

00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:56.200
But if you were to
see me speaking,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.230
you would have thought I looked
pretty comfortable with what

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.190
I was doing.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.000
I didn't have
butterflies in my chest.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.230
I had pigeons.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:05.160
It was big and bad
and it was messy,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.480
but other people couldn't tell.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.260
So at this stage, I'd learned to
figure out a way that comedians

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.030
knew backwards and
sideways of how

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.610
to manage that public speaking
fear, how to get to a point

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.270
where you know it's
going to go well.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.480
It's just a matter of how
well it's going to go,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.890
and that puts you quite at ease.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.110
And it was just all these things
the comedians knew and learned

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.000
the hard way, and clocking
up those 10,000 hours

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.710
that the average
person, even people who

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.164
taught public speaking, didn't
seem to have a clue about.

00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:29.580
And I was like,
it's kind of crazy

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.050
that you're ignoring
the one group of people

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.360
who are doing this the most,
especially in the world

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.571
of business, where most people
kind of need it-- no offense.

00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:38.070
Have you been to a
conference lately

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.630
where you're like-- they're
first question is like,

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.799
not will I sit near the stage?

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:41.789
It's like, where's the plug?

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:42.630
Where's the nearest plug?

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.280
Where am I going to
plug-in my laptop?

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.600
Where am I going to
plug-in my devices

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.016
because this is
going to be boring

00:08:47.016 --> 00:08:48.280
and I'm going to need them.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.190
But we actually go in
there with-- the bar

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.290
on public speaking is
so low, it's amazing.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.950
Like really, just a couple
of little things, and you

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.160
really stand out quite fast.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.470
So today is just
about taking you

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:59.803
through a bunch of those things.

00:08:59.803 --> 00:09:01.890
This day was just about
me telling a story

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.810
and some pretty crazy
things happened just

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.515
because of telling that story,
and a story very unique to me.

00:09:07.515 --> 00:09:09.640
And I'll tell you what
happened at the end of that.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.890
But I really went
down this rabbit hole.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.420
I started looking at
comedians, and I'm like, well,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.190
I wonder if business speakers
are doing the same things

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:14.670
as comedians?

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.503
Maybe they just don't
know it or they aren't

00:09:16.503 --> 00:09:17.740
aware of the correlation.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.800
So I started breaking
down TED Talks.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.990
This is one of my favorite
speakers, Seth Godin.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.570
He's so funny that even
TED described his talks

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.747
as hilarious.

00:09:25.747 --> 00:09:28.080
But then it's like, well, how
hilarious is he, actually,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.040
and can we measure this?

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.330
And it turns out
there's a metric

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.040
that comedians use
and are very aware of,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.550
called laughs per minute.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.670
How many times you make
someone laugh per minute?

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.920
And it turns out he's making
people, on average, laugh

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.214
about 3.4 times per minute.

00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:42.255
And then, OK, what does
that metric mean, though?

00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:43.629
Give me some level
of comparison.

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:46.892
These are the three
funniest movies in history--

00:09:46.892 --> 00:09:49.140
"Airplane!," "The Hangover,"
and "The Naked Gun."

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.120
Some guy talking
about marketing will

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.770
make you laugh more on a sheer
reputation basis per minute

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.636
than the funniest
movies of all time.

00:09:56.636 --> 00:09:59.010
So think about that-- like a
team of the best of the best

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.320
script writers in Hollywood
sat down and got the best

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.403
creative talent and said,
we're going to be funny.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:05.630
And this guy said, I'm going
to talk about marketing,

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.030
and he got more laughs.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.420
Now granted, the movie script
is a longer script to it.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.090
It has a longer period of time
to keep people's attention.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.170
And if you're watching
"The Hangover,"

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.586
you're definitely
laughing bigger.

00:10:16.586 --> 00:10:19.580
But for sheer repetition,
for engaging his crowd,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.370
this guy is up there with
all the funniest movies

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.380
of all time.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.040
And the nice thing is, if we're
trying to produce that, well,

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.834
how is he doing it?

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:27.500
And I should tell you
around this stage,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.640
if you're watching this
or you're in a room

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.220
or you're writing notes, if
you want to be lazy in any way,

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.950
I have a link at the
end I'll give you,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.052
and it links to anything
I'm going to mention,

00:10:35.052 --> 00:10:37.010
any of the things I'm
going to mention at all--

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.110
video-wise, book-wise,
writer-wise.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.600
And you can download
all the tips for free

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.440
because I forget a lot of
stuff to be honest, sometimes.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.450
58% were from
images-- so literally,

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.650
just that last
metric alone, sorry,

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.600
he is just using
GIFs, funny things

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.640
from online,
socially-proven content.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.490
And instead of telling
somebody how frustrated he was,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:56.660
he's showing them.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.680
I was left frustrated,
it was a bit like this,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.196
and then reveal of
the image, which

00:11:02.196 --> 00:11:04.070
creates a little bit of
a surprise and nearly

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.760
always a laugh.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.260
I don't you ever
seen a presentation

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.180
where you saw somebody
put up something funny

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.055
and then they just stand
there looking at it.

00:11:10.055 --> 00:11:14.092
And they're like, and you're
like, you're a total weirdo.

00:11:14.092 --> 00:11:15.800
That's all you're
thinking at that moment

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.330
because they haven't built
an element of surprise to it.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.640
It's really that this is how
I felt. How did you feel?

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.390
Show me how you felt.
And when you show it

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.250
like that, like a
comedian would do a joke,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.830
where you really hide the
reveal until the end of it,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.480
you get quite a big reaction.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.430
And he wasn't the
outlier, so we actually

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.427
studied all the world's
leading TED Talks

00:11:33.427 --> 00:11:35.510
and correlated them for
this measurement of humor.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.330
And it turns out every one of
the leading, most popular TED

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.130
Talks in the world are funny.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.160
Every one of the top
10 TED Talks are funny.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.860
These are all researchers--
so Mary Roach, Shawn Achor,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.761
and Ken Robinson
are all researchers.

00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:50.720
Researchers are normally
not known for being

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.790
the most exciting, funny
people-- no offense,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:53.602
researchers.

00:11:53.602 --> 00:11:56.060
But these are very serious,
heavy topics for the most part,

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.110
apart from Mary Roach's.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:59.617
Have you ever seen that, the
talk about the female orgasm?

00:11:59.617 --> 00:12:01.700
I only see one guy nodding
his head-- smartest man

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.199
in the room.

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:03.435
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:05.120
That was very quick.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.700
You were like, I
knew this was coming.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.740
Well done, you're going to be
signing books after, not me--

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.780
stallion.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.250
But it's very clear that
all these leading talks

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.430
were actually funny.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.030
So if you want to go and
you're speaking in these days,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.100
there was nearly an
expectation for you

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.450
to have a level of entertainment
within the content you

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.010
were giving people.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.827
So how do we reproduced this
very much 80-20 principal

00:12:28.827 --> 00:12:29.660
style, which I love?

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.243
So we're going to focus on the
20% of the things that give you

00:12:32.243 --> 00:12:35.150
80% of the results, and this
becomes quite clear quite fast

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.210
in public speaking.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:37.851
So breaking down any topic--

00:12:37.851 --> 00:12:39.350
you can do it with
anything, really.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.630
Language-wise-- any
Brazilians in here today?

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.130
No?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.930
This is the only time
with nobody from Brazil?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.560
Brazil and Portuguese
sounds really complicated,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.200
but then you're like,
I think they're just

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.574
taking English
words and sticking

00:12:49.574 --> 00:12:51.800
an e on the end of
many of them and making

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.090
it sound pretty groovy.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.180
And I was like, imagine
you were in a meeting

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.060
and you wanted to get some
commentary from a manager.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.420
You'd be like, give me some
give me some [PORTUGUESE]..

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.020
AUDIENCE: [PORTUGUESE].

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.811
DAVID NIHILL: [PORTUGUESE],,
that's a word!

00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:04.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.620
And then, if you go
camping and you're not

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.780
going to sleep in your
duvet or your bedsheets,

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.360
you're going to
need a sleepybaggy.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.037
It just kept getting better.

00:13:14.037 --> 00:13:16.203
AUDIENCE: And you're checking
things off internetty?

00:13:16.203 --> 00:13:17.720
DAVID NIHILL:
Internetty, thank you.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.010
You're going to post things on
Faceybooky, watch a YouTubey.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.770
You might play some pingypongy,
kingykongy, knockouty.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.440
You can go to a field, have some
wine and cheese-- pickynicky.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.190
You can do it all.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.662
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:29.662 --> 00:13:30.620
So it just keeps going.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.550
I love that language.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.320
My personal favorite
is when you have a cold

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.570
and you have some problems
breathing-- vickyvaporubby.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.630
God, I love that word.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.921
But all of the sudden,
something you do is complicated.

00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:42.309
You become-- oh,
I see a pattern.

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:44.600
So what we were doing with
this one is-- it is similar,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.410
but without--

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.910
I love the old
Brazilian Portuguese.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:47.870
Sorry about that one.

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.411
That was fun.

00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:51.404
You were even more happy
about it than I was to share.

00:13:51.404 --> 00:13:53.570
We didn't even mention the
Hedgyhodgy Chili Peppers,

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.160
the band.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:55.751
I love those.

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:57.750
So any tiny principle--
how do we break it down?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.708
So what are the world's
leading speakers doing?

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:02.090
What patterns are we able to
teach people very quickly,

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.506
and how can people
get really good

00:14:03.506 --> 00:14:05.030
at public speaking really fast?

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.990
Number one, always
start with a story,

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.657
especially if you're
trying to be funny.

00:14:08.657 --> 00:14:10.156
So if you make a
joke about someone,

00:14:10.156 --> 00:14:11.600
you have a huge
chance of failure.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.990
If you make a joke about you
or tell a story about you,

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:17.870
it's very easy,
most of the time,

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.970
to get some sort of
positive reaction.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.880
If it's embarrassing for
me, it's funny for you

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.780
sick individuals.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.630
It's very much
Irish style on that.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.209
I was fundraising
for these events

00:14:28.209 --> 00:14:29.750
for people with
spinal cord injuries,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.349
and I was sending out emails.

00:14:31.349 --> 00:14:33.140
And office e-mails, of
course, you normally

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.810
end them the same way--
kind regards, very formal.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.030
I'm dyslexic, and
unfortunately in kind regards

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.606
I was mixing up a g and a t.

00:14:40.606 --> 00:14:42.230
I ended all those
emails, kind retards.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.556
Oh, yeah, for two whole months.

00:14:46.556 --> 00:14:47.930
And sometimes I
tried to be like,

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.700
office cool, and I
just dropped kind,

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.550
and I was just
going, like, retards.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.730
And that day, I wanted to
just slip into a hole and die.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.010
And look at you all
laughing at my pain.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.020
That's kind of how it works--

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.177
embarrassing for
me, funny for you.

00:15:02.177 --> 00:15:04.510
So a lot of people in the
leading business talks-- and I

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.360
mean the most popular talks of
all time-- were using a story.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.220
They were using a
story to be humorous.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.260
Thing is, if you tell a
story and the funny bit

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.690
is moved to the end
quite consciously

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.314
to delay the element of surprise
the same way we would show--

00:15:16.314 --> 00:15:17.980
and we mentioned with
the images later--

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.340
delay that surprise twist
until the end, if they laugh,

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.110
fantastic.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.950
It gives a maximum
chance of laughing.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.420
And if they don't,
nothing happens.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.714
They don't know you were
trying to be funny in any way.

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:30.130
Do you ever have
that moment where

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.390
your boss calls
you into an office,

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.350
and they're like, oh, sit down.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:33.600
I've got a great joke for you.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.980
And you're like, oh, god,
get me out of here now.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.750
They've already
telegraphed the intention

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.940
of what they're about to do.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.494
So you already have a
massive chance of failure.

00:15:42.494 --> 00:15:44.410
And the other thing on
this that is pretty key

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.210
is, if you want to
create memorable content

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.440
or information and
you want people

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.856
to be able to tell
it back to you,

00:15:48.856 --> 00:15:51.070
they have to be able to
visualize it actually

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.040
happening.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.970
So nobody cares
about your story.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:57.640
They care about themselves
within your story.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.456
So if they can't visualize
themselves within your story,

00:16:00.456 --> 00:16:02.830
or you're telling them even
a client's story in your case

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.670
when you're pitching
in a business context,

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.810
if you don't put features on
that story that their mind can

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.390
actually visualize,
they cannot remember it.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.854
They 100% can't remember
facts and figures.

00:16:12.854 --> 00:16:14.770
So you never want to
lead any pitch or meeting

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.686
with facts or figures,
because your brain just

00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:17.590
can't remember them--

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.390
very, very difficult.
They're normally the icing

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.667
on the cake and not the lead.

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:22.750
And a lot of people make
that mistake in pitching.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.000
But the world's best speakers
will always have a story.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.620
They're always going to have
that funny bit at the end

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.450
to maximize the chance
of something being funny,

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.825
and they're going
to have details

00:16:29.825 --> 00:16:32.710
into it that you can latch on
to or see yourself with it.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.780
So a lot of you probably
speak Spanish, do you?

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.220
Many Spanish speakers,
by a show of hands?

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.344
How many here, quite a bit?

00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:41.064
The word in Spanish
for to fit caber.

00:16:41.064 --> 00:16:41.770
Is that right?

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.614
Don't trust Irish
people speaking Spanish.

00:16:43.614 --> 00:16:45.280
That's why I'm getting
a second opinion.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.104
AUDIENCE: Caber.

00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:46.516
DAVID NIHILL: Caber?

00:16:46.516 --> 00:16:46.930
AUDIENCE: Caber.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.680
DAVID NIHILL: Yeah.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.580
I know that you noted the first
time, you're like, no it's not.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.250
And then you were like, wait,
it's just his Irish accent.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:51.749
Yes it is.

00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:53.406
He might have said
the right thing.

00:16:53.406 --> 00:16:55.030
If I just try and
tell a room of people

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.790
to remember the word
for to fit in Spanish,

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:59.860
very difficult to
remember caber tomorrow.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.540
But if we take that
and break it up,

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.950
as another Irishman recommends--

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.782
Benny Lewis, who
speaks 12 languages

00:17:04.782 --> 00:17:06.490
and wrote a very cool
book called "Fluent

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.069
in Three Months."

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.700
You turn that into
a story so your mind

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.949
can remember it-- better
yet, so you can visualize it.

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:12.940
So we take a taxi cab--

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.314
New York street, yellow taxi
cab driving down the street,

00:17:15.314 --> 00:17:17.770
pulling up outside of Trump
Plaza-- bit of a scary place

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.500
to be, but it's pulling
up outside there.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.150
And a big, hairy
grizzly bear runs out

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.380
and tries to get in the taxi.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.880
And obviously, the hairy grizzly
bear doesn't fit in the taxi,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.040
though.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.030
The taxi driver is getting
a bit emotional about this.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.500
He's like, man,
what are you doing?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.172
Get your hairy
ass out of my cab.

00:17:31.172 --> 00:17:32.630
You're not going
to fit in the cab.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:34.240
The bear does not
fit in the cab.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.290
Caber is the word for to fit.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.030
So you have a whole visual
lesson wrapped up there

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.490
that sounds craziness,
but you'll never forget it

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.020
for the rest of your life.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.911
Anyone speak Mandarin Chinese?

00:17:45.911 --> 00:17:47.660
This might be pushing
it, but it's Google.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.180
Somebody does for sure.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.021
Yourself over there?

00:17:50.021 --> 00:17:52.270
All right, now we're really
testing the Irish people's

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.350
language skills.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.840
I got sent there for work,
and I had to try and get

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.090
a receipt for all my expenses.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.298
So my manager is like, the
first thing you need to do

00:17:59.298 --> 00:18:00.234
is get a tax receipt.

00:18:00.234 --> 00:18:02.400
I was like, oh, I'm going
to be so popular in China.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.360
There my first words
are like, hello, I would

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.962
like a tax receipt, please.

00:18:05.962 --> 00:18:07.170
That's all I knew how to say.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:08.890
But luckily for
me, the word for I

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:12.437
would like in Chinese sounds
a bit like Irish swear words.

00:18:12.437 --> 00:18:14.020
I don't know if
you've noticed-- we're

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.000
very good with swear words over
here in this part of the world.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.670
But I would like
in Mandarin Chinese

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.235
is [MANDARIN CHINESE] Correct?

00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:20.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:21.650
DAVID NIHILL: Thank
you very much.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:23.483
And that sounds to my
dirty Irish mind like,

00:18:23.483 --> 00:18:24.472
want to shag you.

00:18:24.472 --> 00:18:26.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:28.690
And you might have heard this
on the streets of Dublin,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.220
maybe around Copper Face Jacks.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.130
I definitely hear
it there, myself.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:35.671
And the word for tax
receipt is fapiao.

00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:37.170
That sounds a bit
angry, doesn't it?

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.461
That's something you might
hear in the streets at home?

00:18:39.461 --> 00:18:40.480
Come on now, fapiao.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.160
Cutting me off in
traffic, fapiao.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.410
You'll remember that one.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:47.380
And word for please, or
not too much trouble,

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.640
literally is mafan ni.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.615
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:52.615 --> 00:18:54.990
So I literally- I'm sitting
in the taxi with this driver,

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.230
and he goes to pull
up, and I'm like,

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.354
oh, I'm going for this one.

00:18:57.354 --> 00:18:58.894
Oh, it's going to end so badly.

00:18:58.894 --> 00:19:00.560
And he jams on the
brakes, turns around.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.580
There's a kind of awkward pause.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.996
And I was just like, want to
shag you, fuck you, my fanny?

00:19:03.996 --> 00:19:06.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.820
This guy just hands
me a tax receipt.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:08.539
He was delighted.

00:19:08.539 --> 00:19:10.080
He was like, oh,
[MANDARIN CHINESE]..

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:10.590
Bye bye!

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:14.170
And I was like, oh my
god, this actually works.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.980
So I was kind of proud of myself
for learning a bit of Mandarin

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.950
Chinese rapidly.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.310
But you will notice very
consciously there isn't

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.260
a single detail in that story.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.730
There's nothing,
nothing, nothing

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:25.050
that you can latch onto.

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.859
What does the taxi
driver look like?

00:19:26.859 --> 00:19:27.900
What kind of taxi was it?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.040
Where did it take place?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.920
What was happening?

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.609
It would be extremely hard
for you to remind me tomorrow

00:19:32.609 --> 00:19:34.650
if I asked you, how do
you say I would like a tax

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.112
receipt in Mandarin Chinese?

00:19:36.112 --> 00:19:38.070
But if I ask you all to
say the word for to fit

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.010
in Spanish, together?

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.070
AUDIENCE: Caber.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.040
DAVID NIHILL: Caber.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.860
Big difference.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.220
So it's a yellow taxi cab, it's
a hairy bear, it's a building.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.219
You visualize it, and you
could picture yourself

00:19:46.219 --> 00:19:47.320
within that story.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.840
So if you're public speaking
or you're presenting

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.550
and you're not delivering
information in a way

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:52.050
that someone can
remember it, you're

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.246
kind of wasting your time--

00:19:53.246 --> 00:19:55.620
unless it's on video like this
and you can watch yourself

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.203
back, and wave at yourself and
go, look at me on the internet.

00:19:58.203 --> 00:20:00.210
But most of the time
it's not like that.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:02.490
Most of the time you need
people to actually resonate

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.050
and you're trying to convince
them of something when

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.800
you're in a room.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.020
So if I told you you could
replicate in-- how long

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.978
we going to be in here?

00:20:07.978 --> 00:20:10.287
55 minutes-- the
world's best talk ever,

00:20:10.287 --> 00:20:11.370
and the most popular talk?

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.750
So this is Ken Robinson.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.215
The talk is called, "Do
Schools Kill Creativity."

00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:16.590
And I'd just like
you to watch it

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:20.760
and go, has this anything to
do with the topic whatsoever?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.880
Does he know where people
will laugh in this story?

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.462
Has he told it before?

00:20:25.462 --> 00:20:26.670
So just have a watch of that.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.020
Is it connected to the topic?

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.895
Does he know where people
are going to laugh?

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:31.824
And do you think he's
ever told it before?

00:20:31.824 --> 00:20:32.490
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:34.569
- We moved from
Stratford to Los Angeles.

00:20:34.569 --> 00:20:37.110
And I just want to say a word
about the transition, actually.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:38.520
My son didn't want to come.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.420
I've got two kids.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.310
He's 21 now, and
my daughter's 16.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.690
He didn't want to
come to Los Angeles.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:47.710
He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:50.310
This was the love
of his life, Sarah.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.870
He'd known her for a month.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.350
Mind you, they've had
their fourth anniversary,

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.460
because it's a long
time when you're 16.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.168
Anyway, he was really
upset on the plane.

00:21:00.168 --> 00:21:02.390
He said, I'll never find
another girl like Sarah.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.864
And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly, because--

00:21:04.864 --> 00:21:12.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.960
--she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.299
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:20.207
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:20.847 --> 00:21:22.680
DAVID NIHILL: So he was
murdering it, there.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.090
You like it?

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.540
It's very, very likable.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.110
And I have a
ghostwriting business

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.290
where we write for a lot of
the world's leading influencers

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:32.130
and CEOs.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.840
And the number one request is,
I want to be like Ken Robinson.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.470
But Ken Robinson is very
much only like Ken Robinson.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.180
So you'll notice, he
has his own style.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.367
He has his personality.

00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:42.450
And you're learning things
about his personal life

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.440
by watching his talks.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.398
And his talks are full
of little bits like this

00:21:45.398 --> 00:21:46.530
that are unique to him.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.020
You can never copy
someone's personality.

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.794
You can never copy their style,
because style is personality.

00:21:51.794 --> 00:21:54.210
If you copy Chris Rock-- do
you ever see him doing comedy?

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.390
I like him a lot, very funny.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.806
But if you copy
Chris Rock and you

00:21:56.806 --> 00:21:58.230
go to your next
Google conference,

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:00.190
you're getting thrown out.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.410
Right?

00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.390
His personality and style can be
copied, but the techniques can.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.720
So the technique here
is a short-form story

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.849
with the keyword at
the end of the story.

00:22:08.849 --> 00:22:10.890
And do you notice in that
one-- what do you think

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.660
is the key funny part
to that story when

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.454
you were watching it?

00:22:14.454 --> 00:22:15.270
AUDIENCE: She was the
reason that we left.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.170
DAVID NIHILL: She
was the reason we

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.904
were leaving the country-- very
consciously at the end of that.

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:20.820
Do you think he's ever
told that story before?

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.547
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:21.547 --> 00:22:23.130
DAVID NIHILL: I see
the heads nodding.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.230
To me, I can picture
him in every Christmas

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.559
party he's ever been to
just busting out that story.

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:30.600
Do you think it's got
anything to do with schools

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.710
killing creativity, loosely?

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.554
Nothing, not even loosely.

00:22:37.554 --> 00:22:39.970
And one thing you'll see in
all the world's best speakers,

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.190
they do this literally
to the letter of the law.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.610
They all do it-- short, personal
stories about themselves.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.817
No story is off topic.

00:22:47.817 --> 00:22:49.900
As long as it's clean or
not offensive in any way,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.420
no matter how far removed from
your topic you think it is.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.980
If you're talking
about technology,

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:57.880
crazy things that your parents
do with technology are perfect.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.100
I was trying to get my
mother to call me on Skype,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.450
and she's like, David,
I can't call you

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.699
on Skype because that
computer in there has viruses.

00:23:03.699 --> 00:23:04.990
And if I use it, I'll get them.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.990
It's like, brilliant.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.651
Now, is that linked
to technology?

00:23:09.651 --> 00:23:10.150
Yes.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.490
If we take the wider topic
of technology, can I say,

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.480
new users are having-- sometimes
be resistant to change,

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.140
can be resistant
to new platforms,

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.180
can be resistant to
new packages, that's

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.000
a very good example of that
that lets the audience picture

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.410
something within their own life.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.600
And they latch onto it
and actually relate to it.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.400
That's way better
than you just going,

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.380
we're in a fundamental
moment of change.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.910
And they're like, wow,
you're so amazing.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.970
But you just don't
learn anything by them

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.860
fluff statements that a lot
of people-- the world's best

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.526
speakers are always just telling
little stories about themselves

00:23:38.526 --> 00:23:41.200
like this that are very,
very likable and easy enough

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.790
to replicate if you try it.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.970
You can tell any story
ever by using the words,

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.489
I told you that story because.

00:23:48.489 --> 00:23:50.530
So if you add those words,
then everybody's like,

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.330
there's a reason they
told me that story.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.739
Now, this can't be an Irish
kind of grandmother story.

00:23:54.739 --> 00:23:56.530
I don't know if you've
been subject to them

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:57.640
when you're in Ireland,
where they're like,

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.140
oh, it was like, when I
was going on the road,

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.760
I met Mary there,
and she was out there

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.590
looking for a couple of
cows, and her son was there.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.880
He's a bit of an
idiot, now, that fella.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.920
He went to live in
Australia, met a girl there.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.270
There's kangaroos
everywhere in Australia.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:08.230
I never really
liked those, myself.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.390
I was watching a David
Attenborough program, actually,

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:11.960
on the kangaroos
there the other night,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.820
and I was wearing my
purple shoes at the time.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.440
I've lost one.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.080
I don't even know why I
like the color purple.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.454
You just-- what
the hell are you?

00:24:17.454 --> 00:24:18.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:18.995 --> 00:24:20.620
Has anyone happened
on that in Ireland?

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.070
I got those stories
all the time,

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.390
but what are we
talking about here?

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.510
So obviously, in the world of
public speaking you cannot do

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:26.010
that.

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:26.770
Brevity is levity.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:28.404
You have a very
short time period.

00:24:28.404 --> 00:24:30.070
So we're going to
borrow some techniques

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.710
from the world of comedy, one
of them being joke structure.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.510
So comedians live
off joke structure,

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.520
which is the minimum
amount of information

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.010
for you to understand
the point of the story--

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:40.870
the key part, the
key funny part.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.330
So in Ken Robinson's
example, the punchline

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.130
is, she was the reason we
were leaving the country.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.492
And you could see very visibly
that the audience was laughing.

00:24:49.492 --> 00:24:50.950
And they laughed
even a little more

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.630
than he expected
them to laugh, so he

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.256
shut up and let them laugh.

00:24:54.256 --> 00:24:55.630
So there's a very
powerful line I

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:57.940
like called, the end
of laughter is followed

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.990
by the height of listening.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.140
So the most attention
you will have ever is

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.810
the moment after you make
a group of people laugh,

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.420
because they have a dopamine
spike and their brain goes,

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.750
give me more of that.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.990
So if you have a very,
heavy serious topic--

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.287
laughter, serious stuff.

00:25:12.287 --> 00:25:14.620
You get to bring them up and
down and up and down as you

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.252
want, as long as you know how to
harness this tool effectively.

00:25:17.252 --> 00:25:19.210
That's why it can be very
powerful in the world

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.230
of public speaking.

00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:22.870
And no topic is too
serious for this.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.127
Mark Pollock-- I'm a big
fan of his work in Ireland,

00:25:25.127 --> 00:25:26.710
and the charity they
have, and the Run

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.040
in the Dark they've set up.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.500
He suffered a
spinal cord injury,

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.430
he was paralyzed,
and went blind.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.690
And he wheels out onto
a stage in his TED Talk.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.190
And you can imagine that every
single person there is going,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.980
oh my god, what a
terrible situation.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.500
It's not relatable to the
average person in any way.

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.350
But he starts off.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:45.490
He's like, ladies and
gentlemen, I've got problems.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:46.540
I'm paralyzed.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.690
I'm blind.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.580
I'm bald.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.463
And I'm from Northern Ireland.

00:25:50.463 --> 00:25:51.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.320
And they all laugh
straight away.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.470
But then, the even
better line is, listen,

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.150
I'm not the only
one with problems.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.970
I bet you guys have too.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.310
And they're like, yeah, we do.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.700
But now, that talk is no
longer just about his injury.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.400
He's made it applicable to every
single person in the room--

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.290
humor, serious,
relatable to everybody.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:09.040
But it's very key.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.920
So if I get up and I'm like,
I went to China one time,

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.795
learned some Chinese.

00:26:11.795 --> 00:26:13.680
You're like, I don't care.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.210
But that's your
automatic reaction.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.790
Whereas if I say something
like, being in a new place

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.460
can be challenging.

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.300
You're like, yeah.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:20.940
No, I agree with that.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.810
OK, tell me more.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:23.250
Immediately, your
mind is like, where's

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.870
a place that I've been
that was challenging?

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:26.995
You're already trying to
put yourself in the story.

00:26:26.995 --> 00:26:28.140
So minimum amount of words.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.836
Setup is usually three to
six sentences and no more.

00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:33.210
So with Ken Robinson, we knew
he was leaving the country.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:34.560
We knew there was a
relationship there.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.268
We knew there was some
change, and that's

00:26:36.268 --> 00:26:37.319
all we needed to know.

00:26:37.319 --> 00:26:39.360
So it just forces you to
get down to the details.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.160
Tagline is anything
additional you

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.890
say at the end of the story,
but it normally comes down a bit

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:45.390
in the level of laughter.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.440
We add what Ken did
really, really well.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.910
You delay impact words-- key in
the world of public speaking.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:53.490
This is when you tell people,
I want your attention,

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.212
maybe even you should
write this down.

00:26:55.212 --> 00:26:56.670
So the people who
are good at this,

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.860
they can control when
you take notes just

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.811
by changing sentence structure.

00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:03.310
So if I have a startup and I
was pitching a bunch of people,

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.600
and I said to you, we have an
80% growth rate year on year,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.590
what do you think I'm most
excited about in that sentence?

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.520
We have an 80% growth
rate year on year.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.976
You should give us your money.

00:27:12.976 --> 00:27:14.100
What's exciting about that?

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.789
AUDIENCE: 80%.

00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:16.830
DAVID NIHILL: 80%, right?

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.300
That's a big number
I'd be excited about.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.980
Everything else is pretty
changeable in there,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.290
and wouldn't make a big
difference, but 80% is huge.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.660
But if I say, we have an 80%
growth rate year on year,

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.610
it's very easy for me
to keep waffling on.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:27.960
We have an 80% growth
rate year on year,

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.010
and then we hired
another team, and then

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.270
we got series a
investment, and we

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.644
have these other guys lined up.

00:27:31.644 --> 00:27:33.810
It's very hard for me to
take a mental pause and go,

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:34.750
that was important.

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.810
But if I flip that like
Ken Robinson would do--

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.240
like a comedian would do, like
a great speaker would do--

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.070
the keyword goes to the end.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:45.150
Year on year, we have
a growth rate of 80%.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.420
Emphasized, volume comes up for
the keyword, natural pause--

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.915
people take out pen
and write it down.

00:27:50.915 --> 00:27:51.790
Very, very important.

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.270
You guys, especially-- for your
work you're very metric driven.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.170
You're very results driven.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.970
You're always going
to be showing numbers.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.529
If you're really
pushing numbers,

00:27:58.529 --> 00:28:00.570
the numbers should be at
the end of the sentence,

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:01.800
or it's just any old number.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.959
Seven, nine, 11--
where did they start?

00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:04.500
I don't know.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.180
Thanks for shouting
numbers at me.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.950
Year on year growth
rate of 80%--

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.607
it really takes your attention.

00:28:09.607 --> 00:28:11.190
In comedy, the funny
word-- you go out

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.840
of your way to
move it to the end.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.270
If you're creating
memorable content--

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.127
very, very key-- you
want people to remember

00:28:17.127 --> 00:28:18.210
what you're talking about.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.376
You might have noticed Irish
people cannot pronounce

00:28:20.376 --> 00:28:21.109
the number three.

00:28:21.109 --> 00:28:23.400
So I wish this would be the
rule of four, but it isn't.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.850
It is the rule of three.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.750
Three is the smallest sequence
of elements your mind can

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.794
recognize as a pattern.

00:28:29.794 --> 00:28:31.210
So if you want to
break a pattern,

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:32.520
that's what makes comedy.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.590
Comedy is only funny if
you create a pattern,

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:37.560
you create expectation, and then
you shoot in another direction.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.630
So like a train coming
down the train tracks,

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.400
you change direction.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.420
If I say, one, two, your mind
automatically expects three.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.980
One, two, four-- that's comedy.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.310
It makes sense, but
only retrospectively.

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.420
It's still a sequence.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.950
I was multiplying the numbers.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.640
You only knew that
after the fact.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.490
So it puts me as the
speaker or the comedian

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.260
one step ahead of
you, because you're

00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:59.610
making the logical sequence.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.340
I'm breaking a logical sequence.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.240
So comedy is always
apples, apples, oranges.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.270
The misdirect has
to be at the end.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.070
If it isn't at the
end, comedy fails.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.320
So a lot of people it was like,
oh, comedy is risky sometimes.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.486
It is if you don't know
little things that comedians

00:29:12.486 --> 00:29:13.800
know backwards and sideways.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.740
They're the true masters
of public speaking.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.740
So I just wanted to show
you these in operation.

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.406
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:21.270
- There are 12
different agencies

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.960
that deal with exports.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.000
There are at least
five different agencies

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
that deal with housing policy.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.800
Then there's my
favorite example.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.260
The Interior Department
is in charge of salmon

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.640
while they're in freshwater, but
the Commerce Department handles

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.660
them when they're in saltwater.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:43.160
I hear it gets even
more complicated

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.390
once they're smoked.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.120
[END PLAYBACK]

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.992
DAVID NIHILL: Not
exactly viral hilarity.

00:29:52.992 --> 00:29:54.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.890
I think you will agree.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.570
But compared to
Congress that day,

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:59.049
that was pretty epic stuff.

00:29:59.049 --> 00:30:01.590
And when they surveyed people,
they remembered two key words,

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.381
and I'm pretty sure
you know what they are.

00:30:03.381 --> 00:30:05.625
The two most memorable
words-- smoked and salmon.

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:07.250
You have a very clear
sequence, there--

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:10.840
freshwater, saltwater, smoked.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.320
But what happens if he put
smoked first or second?

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.260
If you put smoked first, what?

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:19.870
He just becomes weird.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.090
One of like most
likeable, epic presidents

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.060
ever literally just
becomes a bit strange

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.870
just by changing that sequence.

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.140
It wouldn't be funny anymore.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.780
It would get no reaction.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.100
This one isn't viral hilarity.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.170
Free beer, topless bartenders,
and false advertising.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:33.670
Right?

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.740
And that was a bar
in San Francisco,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.990
and they were male
topless bartenders,

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.445
and I was not expecting that.

00:30:39.445 --> 00:30:40.731
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:40.731 --> 00:30:42.230
So don't worry about
that one, then.

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.530
Anyway, but what happens
if I move false advertising

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:47.410
to position number
one in that sign?

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.270
So if it started off
with false advertising,

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.910
and then the other
two, what happens?

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.950
It's just weird.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.960
Not even Irish people
are going into that bar.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.267
That's how powerful
knowing these tools are.

00:30:59.267 --> 00:31:01.600
It's the difference between
something successful or not.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.640
I ended up writing a book
about all this lunacy.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.230
And if you write a
book, then you're like,

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.210
oh, I need to get famous
people to say nice things

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.080
about my book, right?

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.880
Publishers are always trying
to get you to do that.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.860
It's a bit cringeworthy,
but you have to try.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.350
So I got one there,
two, number four.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.430
This book is great.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.980
I haven't read it yet,
but David drew a picture

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.080
when he was six years
old of a penguin drinking

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.212
beer in a Chinese
restaurant, and it

00:31:22.212 --> 00:31:23.920
was clear the potential
for slight wisdom

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.550
and misguided
creativity were there--

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.505
Marita Nihill, David's mother.

00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:30.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.400
What happens if I put my mother
in position number one there?

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.352
I'm a nutcase.

00:31:37.352 --> 00:31:38.310
Mothers would be proud.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:39.851
They're like, I
should be number one.

00:31:39.851 --> 00:31:41.760
I made you.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.557
Which is true.

00:31:43.557 --> 00:31:46.140
But I literally go into Barnes
and Noble when I'm in New York.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.250
And I'll go in--
you know, bookstores

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.240
are pretty quiet places.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.530
And I'll watch someone
pick up that book,

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.610
and they're kind of
reading it, and then

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.120
they're like, [CHUCKLES].

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.277
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:53.277 --> 00:31:55.360
And they have a little
weird moment to themselves.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.960
And it's not like
it's viral hilarity,

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.900
but it's just a
flip of expectations

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.229
that they weren't expecting.

00:32:00.229 --> 00:32:02.020
And you can use this
absolutely everywhere.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.480
It doesn't have to be the world
of public speaking solely.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.490
PS section of an
email works really

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.450
well for a little
one, two, four.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.450
I'll follow up, I'll do
this, and then something

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:11.577
that's totally different.

00:32:11.577 --> 00:32:13.660
So I'll email you next
week, I'll give you a call,

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.830
or I'll be standing
outside your side

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.970
your door in the
middle of the night.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:16.511
Just kidding.

00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:17.053
Bye-bye, now.

00:32:17.053 --> 00:32:19.010
Then, you're going to be
worried you get fired.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.390
Don't blame me for that one.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.764
But it's just
somewhere where you

00:32:21.764 --> 00:32:23.710
can play around a little bit.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.600
So if we had to sum
this up, a lot of people

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.926
will teach you public speaking.

00:32:26.926 --> 00:32:28.550
Have many of you
taken a class before--

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.716
by a show of hands-- in the
world of public speaking

00:32:30.716 --> 00:32:31.220
somehow?

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:33.490
And it kills me a little bit
when I see them training it,

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.870
because they come in
with their video camera.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.995
And they're like, say three
things into the camera.

00:32:36.995 --> 00:32:39.795
We'll record you, play it back,
you'll see how bad you were.

00:32:39.795 --> 00:32:41.650
You're like, what the
hell did you expect?

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.409
You didn't give me
any preparation time.

00:32:43.409 --> 00:32:45.200
You're here because I
hate public speaking.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.694
Why would we do this to me?

00:32:47.694 --> 00:32:48.860
Why would you do this to me?

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.260
This doesn't make sense.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.740
How you deliver content
is not the key part.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.546
Rubbish content delivered
beautifully is still rubbish.

00:32:57.546 --> 00:32:59.170
So if I come in, I'm
making eye contact

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.003
and holding it, and
really freaking you out.

00:33:01.003 --> 00:33:02.367
Well done, look at this.

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:03.450
He already wants to leave.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.462
Or I'm walking around and moving
my hands like this, graciously.

00:33:06.462 --> 00:33:08.920
You're not allowed to stand
public speaking with your hands

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.490
in your pockets.

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:11.448
I've had him in my pockets
for half this thing.

00:33:11.448 --> 00:33:13.150
It really makes no difference.

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:16.670
And the people who emphasize
that have never been onstage--

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:17.320
100%.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.903
You'll see comedians stand there
the whole night, sitting down

00:33:19.903 --> 00:33:21.760
on a stool sometimes,
arms folded

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.380
over, hands in their
pockets, look at their feet.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.810
But the content
is really strong.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:26.831
And if the content--

00:33:26.831 --> 00:33:29.080
the story, the thing you
want to resonate-- is strong,

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.020
how you deliver it-- unless
you're being a total weirdo

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.270
by running around
while you're doing it--

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.150
isn't as important
as you'd think.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.040
And a lot of that
training, to me-- comedians

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:39.640
would never do that.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.660
They'd never come in and go,
let's start with delivery.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.450
They'd be like, what
are you going to say?

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.430
Like, if you're on a
Conan O'Brien show,

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.810
or you're on David
Letterman, you

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.050
have to send in your script.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.630
They don't care how you're
going to practice it.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.130
You don't turn up and
do the run-through.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.060
Why would you do that?

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.143
What are you going to say?

00:33:53.143 --> 00:33:54.280
That's what we care about.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.050
OK, go say it.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.020
People resonate with what
you say, not how you say it.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.340
It's quite important.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.820
But how do we do this fast?

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.100
So that's why a lot of
this is on the content.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.570
I'm going to give you a
load of quick delivery

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:05.278
tips in a minute.

00:34:05.278 --> 00:34:06.850
But honestly, the
biggest difference

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:07.930
is always in the content.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.449
And it's always in you getting
personal about the content.

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.987
You can have an amazing
chart in there-- a pie chart,

00:34:12.987 --> 00:34:15.070
and people go, oh god,
that pie chart was amazing.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.341
Where do I get my hands on it?

00:34:16.341 --> 00:34:17.924
Like, that's just
not going to happen.

00:34:17.924 --> 00:34:20.020
They're like, oh, that chart you
had, the way it went up, down,

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:20.900
up again at the end?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.150
Didn't see that coming.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:25.030
Whew, how did you do it, magic?

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.989
Never.

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:27.219
They're just like, you said
something about your mother.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:27.927
That was amazing.

00:34:27.927 --> 00:34:30.350
You used to work here,
so did I. We lived there.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:31.449
I lived there.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:34.449
They never come up to you after
and say anything else, really.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:37.719
So general topic-- you can
tell any story you ever want.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.480
Remember, as we said, I
told you that story because.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.590
Start really wide.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:45.420
Nobody cares about the
specifics of your opinion first.

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.780
Like, walk them into it a bit.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.400
Hey, we all have moments where.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.780
We all do two things where.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.860
Being in a new place
can be challenging.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:54.330
The idea is to capture as
many people as possible.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.980
If you walk into a room and
you're pitching something,

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.396
and you're a bit lawyerish in
your approach-- you're like,

00:34:58.396 --> 00:35:00.350
this is wrong and
you need to change.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.110
We're argumentative
buggers as people.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.780
Like, 50% of the room will
naturally fold our arms and go,

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:05.794
I don't agree.

00:35:05.794 --> 00:35:07.210
And you don't want
that to happen.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:09.460
So very wide statements at
the start, and then kind of

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.251
bring them down the
funnel towards your way

00:35:11.251 --> 00:35:11.980
of seeing things.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.860
So identify five stories that
you love telling, and try

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.830
and shoehorn them into
any presentation ever.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:20.930
No matter how far off topic you
think it is, put it in there.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.750
All the best ones
I've worked on ever--

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.124
and I'm talking about people
who were speaking to 26,000,

00:35:25.124 --> 00:35:28.082
27,000 people in a very
high-stakes tech environment

00:35:28.082 --> 00:35:29.540
where all the
investors are there--

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:31.654
are using personal stories,
and they are always

00:35:31.654 --> 00:35:33.070
the things that
get tweeted about,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.630
and always the things
that get the traction,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.250
and always the reason they get
asked to speak somewhere else.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.340
So get those in there, and
use that joke structure

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.210
we went through.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:41.710
Remember, the details
are important.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.111
You guys don't have a clue
how to ask for a tax receipt,

00:35:44.111 --> 00:35:46.360
but you do know the Spanish
word for to fit, which is?

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.117
AUDIENCE: Caber.

00:35:47.117 --> 00:35:47.950
DAVID NIHILL: Caber.

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:49.360
Anyone want to go for
the tax receipt one?

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.984
That could get
controversial real fast.

00:35:50.984 --> 00:35:51.970
Don't do it.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.960
Being recorded,
we'll get in trouble.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.330
And then, you just play
around with the details,

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.820
because that's what allows you
to have a little bit of fun.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:58.960
So that's the content
creation side.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.126
I want to give you as many
tips as I can on delivery

00:36:01.126 --> 00:36:02.020
as fast as I can.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:03.220
I just like that cat.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:05.339
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:05.339 --> 00:36:06.880
That cat doesn't
even need a buildup.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.950
Some images are just
awesome all by themselves.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:12.160
So what makes the biggest
difference the fastest?

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.650
So I believe these will give
you the biggest results.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.350
I believe most people don't ever
teach them or dwell on them.

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:18.940
Number one most useful
thing I ever learned

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.860
was the memory palace.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.750
So it's a memorization technique
popularized by Joshua Foer

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.850
in a book called
"Moonwalking With Einstein."

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.690
The story's amazing
if you don't know it.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.570
He was a "New York
Times" journalist

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.545
who went to the US Memory
Championships, which

00:36:30.545 --> 00:36:32.170
is actually a sporting
event where they

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:33.400
compete on remembering things.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.440
It sounds like a lot of
people's worst nightmare.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.481
And he's like, well, I
don't have a great memory.

00:36:37.481 --> 00:36:39.700
I wonder if I went all
80-20 principle on this--

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.860
went intensively into it
a bit like A.J. Jacobs,

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.780
did it for a year, came
back, how good I'd be?

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.120
He came back, became the US
memory champion one year later.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.170
He became the 11th best
mind in the whole world.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.170
The book is pretty epic.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.310
They're all using
the same technique.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.740
So they take a memory palace
like we already learned.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.137
They take something like
caber, they create a story,

00:36:57.137 --> 00:36:58.220
and they put it somewhere.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.300
So this is my story.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.490
That night, I was
stood on stage sweating

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.082
out my shirt in front of
1,400 people at The Moth.

00:37:04.082 --> 00:37:05.540
And this is a story
about my mother

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.956
coming over to San Francisco
and having a pretty fun time,

00:37:07.956 --> 00:37:11.120
and going home wearing
Lululemon merchandise.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.540
Really changed her over there--

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:13.730
got way more active.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.860
But all I'm doing while
I'm on stage and talking

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.810
is, I'm walking around my house.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.150
It's very hard for your mind
to go, what word is next?

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.810
What do I say next?

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:21.601
What do I say next?

00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:23.300
But if you go, where am I?

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.590
That's very easy to answer.

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:26.000
So I'm standing in the kitchen.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.220
There's a bear and a taxi
driver in the kitchen.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.750
I need to talk about caber.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.340
So you basically
prepare your talk

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.230
by making a bullet point list.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.970
A comedian would
make a set list.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:37.220
And then you create a
wild, fictional story

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.936
in your mind for every point.

00:37:38.936 --> 00:37:40.310
And then you go
one step further.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.680
You put it in a physical
location in the building

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.450
you're most familiar
with in life--

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.659
often the house you live in
or the place you grew up.

00:37:46.659 --> 00:37:48.575
And all you're doing
when you're giving a talk

00:37:48.575 --> 00:37:50.660
is walking around clockwise
or anti-clockwise.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.960
It must be sequential so you
don't double back on yourself.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.080
And there's no limit.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.640
The only limit
there is creativity.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.600
So I walk in the kitchen,
and a big elephant

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.600
jumps out of the fridge.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.891
I need to talk about elephants.

00:38:00.891 --> 00:38:03.151
I walk into the bathroom
and Lionel Massie

00:38:03.151 --> 00:38:05.150
runs out of the bathroom
dribbling the football.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.922
I need to talk about 10% GDP.

00:38:06.922 --> 00:38:08.630
That's the next thing
I need to remember.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.800
He wears the number
10 on his back.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.710
So it's just whatever
you associate

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:14.000
with something-- you use that.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.650
You never use the
keyword itself.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.020
You picture the
associated memory.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.867
And that's how these guys do
large sequences of numbers.

00:38:20.867 --> 00:38:22.700
People who remember
large volumes of numbers

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.710
are usually turning the
number into an animal.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.560
So they're like, pig, goat,
bear-- whatever it may be,

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.690
something has to be
associated with each thing

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:31.100
that they can visualize.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.570
Sound like craziness?

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:34.190
It's a big old topic.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.977
Jump into it.

00:38:34.977 --> 00:38:36.560
I'll supply some
links after this talk

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.760
where you can read
up on that some more.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.259
But if you use it,
you can literally

00:38:39.259 --> 00:38:41.330
use this within five
minutes and you will never

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:43.010
be that person backstage
who is standing

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.502
looking at their notes.

00:38:44.502 --> 00:38:46.460
You ever see someone
public speaking just about

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.374
to go on, or just
outside a meeting room

00:38:48.374 --> 00:38:49.790
before they're
coming in to pitch,

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.580
and they're standing there
looking at a piece of paper?

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.950
How would you describe that
person with a bit of paper

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.627
just before to give
a presentation?

00:38:57.627 --> 00:38:59.090
AUDIENCE: Shaking Stevens.

00:38:59.090 --> 00:38:59.900
DAVID NIHILL: Shaking Stevens.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.070
That was just me, thank you.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.330
And the hips, yes.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:06.028
Nervous-- anything else?

00:39:06.028 --> 00:39:07.504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:07.504 --> 00:39:08.490
DAVID NIHILL: Yeah.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.730
Unprepared.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:10.730
Everything's negative.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:11.690
So if you're that
person and then you

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:14.030
walk out with the bit of
paper, everyone in the audience

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.530
assumes you're not
prepared already.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.270
So you need to find a way
of doing this and hiding it.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:20.060
So a very good way
is drawing this out,

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.790
hiding it on your person
just for confidence reasons,

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.610
or putting it on a stool, hiding
it somewhere, putting a bottle

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:26.700
of water in front of it.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.494
If anyone sees that,
they haven't a clue

00:39:28.494 --> 00:39:30.410
what that little drawing
means, as long as you

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:31.827
don't pick it up and hold it.

00:39:31.827 --> 00:39:34.160
So a lot of the time, I'll
have it on a stool next to me

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.660
somewhere.

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.650
I'll go over, take a
moment, have a drink.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.220
Nobody else can see that I'm
actually looking at the notes.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:41.070
And I'm not trying to
read word for word,

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:41.990
which is very obvious.

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:43.675
I'm just trying to go,
where am I in the house?

00:39:43.675 --> 00:39:45.230
Oh yeah, we're in the bathroom.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.910
And then, if my talk
gets cut short--

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.010
which happens a
lot in the moment--

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.802
I just skip a room.

00:39:49.802 --> 00:39:51.593
And I'm like, oh, that
takes about a minute

00:39:51.593 --> 00:39:53.210
to explain if I go
into the bedroom.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.557
Let me walk straight through.

00:39:54.557 --> 00:39:56.390
And if this talk has a
structure and there's

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:57.973
a couple of key
learning points in it,

00:39:57.973 --> 00:40:00.590
how many key learning points
do you think would be in it?

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.430
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:02.638
DAVID NIHILL: Three, exactly.

00:40:02.638 --> 00:40:05.420
So a lot of people have 10 key
things, or five key things,

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:08.090
and people go away and they
literally can't remember them.

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.715
So if you have three
key points, you're

00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:11.270
very easily able to
keep a structure.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:12.830
That's the number
one most useful thing

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.270
I ever learned from
comedians, and it's

00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:16.811
saved my life in public speaking
I don't know how many times.

00:40:16.811 --> 00:40:19.370
And anyone who's ever tried
it is like, that's amazing.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:20.400
That helped me so much.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.820
So people's normal biggest
fear around public speaking

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.230
is going blank on stage.

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.030
This completely eliminates it.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:27.530
It also works really
well for names.

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:29.071
I'm sure nearly
everyone in this room

00:40:29.071 --> 00:40:30.863
has a hard time
remembering people's names.

00:40:30.863 --> 00:40:33.237
The minute you meet them, the
minute they say their name,

00:40:33.237 --> 00:40:35.570
you need to create a visual
representation of that name

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.090
with somebody who
you already know

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.194
or somebody famous
with that name.

00:40:39.194 --> 00:40:40.610
With this one,
even if I asked you

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.752
to picture your favorite
restaurant, and you go,

00:40:42.752 --> 00:40:44.710
OK, I've got my favorite
restaurant in my mind.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.685
Where's the server?

00:40:45.685 --> 00:40:47.060
Is there someone
that greets you?

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:47.560
Yeah.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.770
Where are they?

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:49.610
You can see them.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.200
How many tables are
in that restaurant

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.060
on the floor when you walk in?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.470
You'll be like, oh, 11 or 12.

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:55.886
Very quickly you
can visualize it.

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.030
Where's the bathroom?

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:58.490
Yeah, I can see the bathroom.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:00.530
And you can do that with any
building you've ever been in.

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.850
Imagine if you're using it as
the foundation for your talk

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.670
and it's a house you live in
that you know really, really

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:05.300
well.

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:05.927
So just try it.

00:41:05.927 --> 00:41:07.010
It makes a big difference.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.961
Cut the fluff is huge.

00:41:07.961 --> 00:41:09.710
I just like farm
animals, so I try and get

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:12.062
one into most presentations
for no apparent reason.

00:41:12.062 --> 00:41:13.520
There was a monster
in New Zealand,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:14.686
you might have heard of him.

00:41:14.686 --> 00:41:16.760
He was roaming the glens
wild and scaring people

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.765
and freaking them out
for years in New Zealand.

00:41:18.765 --> 00:41:20.390
And then they finally
tracked him down,

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:23.510
and he looked like this.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.440
Shrek the sheep.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.690
He was a bit of a furry
stallion of a sheep,

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.454
and he was roaming
wild for six years,

00:41:28.454 --> 00:41:29.870
and that's how he
got that fluffy.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.203
And then in New Zealand, they
put him on live television

00:41:32.203 --> 00:41:34.730
and they sheared
him for charity.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.700
And he just became a fraction of
the little sheep he used to be.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.810
Unfortunate news is,
this is your talk,

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:42.770
and this is any talk you've
ever given or been subject to

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.820
in corporate world whatsoever.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.649
And this is what
it should be like.

00:41:46.649 --> 00:41:48.440
If you're lucky enough
to ever write a book

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.060
and work with an editor,
that's what they're

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.210
going to do to your content.

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.000
If you're lucky enough
to ever give a TED Talk,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.710
that's what they're going
to do with your content.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:55.310
That's great.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:56.060
It's an hour.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.470
Oh no, no, we're
going to get you

00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:59.330
to do the nine-minute version.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:02.080
So it's good to have a system
where you edit yourself.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.070
And the best way to do
it is score the content

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.690
from one to five.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.114
One is stuff that people
don't really react to,

00:42:08.114 --> 00:42:09.530
they don't get
excited about, they

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.057
don't mention it afterwards.

00:42:11.057 --> 00:42:13.640
You don't think it's that key,
but it kind of made it in there

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.570
for some reason.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.814
Five is stuff that people
applaud, they laugh,

00:42:16.814 --> 00:42:18.230
they love it, they
tweet about it,

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.710
they always ask you about it.

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:21.680
And then, anything in
between on that range.

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.889
And you want to end up with
threes, fours, and fives,

00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.721
and just chop everything
that's one and two.

00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:27.710
And just repeatedly do
that until you get down

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:30.030
to something that has
three key points to it,

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.507
and really you're like,
oh, that's my best stuff.

00:42:32.507 --> 00:42:33.840
Did the rest need to be in here?

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.120
It never needs to be in there.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.440
You think it does at
the start, but when

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.130
you trim it down and
practice it, you're like,

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.796
oh, I didn't need to
have that in there.

00:42:39.796 --> 00:42:40.820
So do cut the fluff.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.920
Never, ever speak from
behind the podium--

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.640
very useful.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.440
Always just turn
up with a clicker

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.600
that you have yourself if
you have to public speak,

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.610
because who speaks
from behind a podium--

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:51.730
apart from some of
your lovely colleagues?

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.830
But if I was stood here like
this for this whole talk--

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:55.674
hello, who am I?

00:42:55.674 --> 00:42:57.590
Who normally speaks here
from behind a podium?

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:58.450
AUDIENCE: Priests.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:42:58.880
AUDIENCE: Obama.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.046
DAVID NIHILL: Priests, yeah.

00:43:00.046 --> 00:43:03.080
Obama-- Obama was amazing,
but we have some politicians

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.640
not quite fit into that mold.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:07.070
So usually politicians,
priests, or?

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.121
AUDIENCE: Lecturers.

00:43:08.121 --> 00:43:09.620
DAVID NIHILL:
University lecturers--

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.960
Those people you slept through
for a lot of your life.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.850
But that's not a
very engaging bunch

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.652
that you want to be part of,
but we have that assumption.

00:43:16.652 --> 00:43:18.860
Also, if you don't see
someone, you don't trust them.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.539
So Ted Talks are always--

00:43:20.539 --> 00:43:22.580
like, comedians are never
hiding behind anything.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.530
A TED speaker is
always just on the mat,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:26.370
and they have a
clicker, and that's it.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.578
So very helpful for yourself
just to get away from it

00:43:28.578 --> 00:43:29.770
and be able to walk around.

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.250
Because if I was giving
to talk now and you guys

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.000
weren't listening,
I can go for a walk.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.874
If, just say, you happen
to be on your phone,

00:43:34.874 --> 00:43:36.950
I can stand here without
saying anything to you.

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.739
But just by being able to come
over, you'll usually stop.

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:41.530
So it just gives you
control over the room.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.370
But if you're stuck
there, you don't have it.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:44.828
So you see a podium,
get rid of it.

00:43:44.828 --> 00:43:45.569
Get away from it.

00:43:45.569 --> 00:43:48.110
If you're meant to be sitting
down behind the table, jump up.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:48.950
Let people see you.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:49.700
Be quite visible.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.380
Move around a little bit.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.074
Most people use filler words.

00:43:53.074 --> 00:43:54.740
Irish people definitely
use filler words

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.310
when they're speaking.

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:57.220
I did a radio interview
the other day,

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.730
and the lady who
went down after me

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.320
was like, well, I
suppose, it's kind of,

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.770
you know, it's one of
those things, I mean,

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:02.620
have you ever felt like.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.950
And I was like, wait a minute,
that was, like, 11 words

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.366
and you haven't
said anything yet.

00:44:06.366 --> 00:44:07.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.550
And I do it all the time.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.758
And the way to change that,
as well, public speaking,

00:44:10.758 --> 00:44:12.630
is simply to raise
your voice 20%.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.360
Right now, I'm speaking a
little bit louder than normal.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.220
There's no audible change
for you guys whatsoever.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.420
And it's impossible for me
to say at an elevated tone

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.352
the word, uh.

00:44:23.352 --> 00:44:24.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.060
It'll nearly blow
your own brains out.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:28.480
You cannot do it.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.200
So just elevate your voice,
and that fixes that problem.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.240
No other training
needed whatsoever.

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.520
If someone tells you you
speak too fast, you don't.

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.289
Speak whatever is
comfortable for you.

00:44:37.289 --> 00:44:39.580
The only time you need to
slow down is the key points--

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.570
80%, stand still, and
then you can go back

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.070
to doing all your weird stuff.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.236
But make your key points
when you're standing there.

00:44:46.236 --> 00:44:47.754
Comedians delivering
a joke, they

00:44:47.754 --> 00:44:49.170
might be running
around the stage,

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.290
but when it's funny time,
it's front and center.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:52.290
They step forward a bit.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:53.100
The voice comes up.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:53.670
You react.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.610
And then they might
go for a walk again.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.670
But it's the only
time-- if you're

00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:58.260
one of those people who's
like, oh, I'm too slow.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.471
I speak too fast or too slow.

00:44:59.471 --> 00:44:59.970
You don't.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:02.261
Just whatever is fine for
you is fine for the audience.

00:45:02.261 --> 00:45:04.620
But for key points, to slow
it down and raise your voice

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.110
a little bit if you
have this problem.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:08.826
First 30 seconds is
the most important.

00:45:08.826 --> 00:45:10.950
If you're going to memorize
anything word for word,

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.500
do it the first 30
seconds, because if you're

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.814
a nervous public speaker--

00:45:14.814 --> 00:45:16.230
if you hate public
speaking like I

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.930
do-- you can say anything
in the first 30 seconds.

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.900
You have no control of what's
going on over your body.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.790
So you're all sweating,
things are going mad.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.950
You walk out.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:27.570
You get a bit flustered, and
then you're just, like, oh god!

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.820
And you're standing there,
and you're like, hello, uh,

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.247
thanks for having me, uh.

00:45:31.247 --> 00:45:32.580
It was like I started off today.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.053
I was like, oh, people
everywhere, oh god!

00:45:35.053 --> 00:45:35.760
Oh, hello.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.410
Oh, thanks for having me.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:39.180
Oh, something about
Justin Bieber.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.696
I don't know why I said that.

00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:41.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.800
Why didn't I memorize the
first 30 seconds today?

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.042
No!

00:45:45.042 --> 00:45:47.500
That's what was happening to
me when I came out here today.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.862
Should have been doing
it, but I didn't.

00:45:49.862 --> 00:45:50.820
Makes a big difference.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.140
Because you all have been
to a conference before,

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.723
and a speaker comes
out and does that.

00:45:53.723 --> 00:45:55.330
Like, hello, uh,
thanks for having me.

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.070
Uh, so many of you here today.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:57.570
It's great.

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:59.580
Uh, I'm very honored.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.244
Um, so many great people
made this event possible.

00:46:02.244 --> 00:46:03.660
And you're just
like, kill me now.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.989
This is terrible.

00:46:04.989 --> 00:46:06.780
Whereas someone comes
out and they're like,

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.150
I'm standing there and a
tiger is staring right at me.

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.770
And you're like, ah!

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:10.470
Did he eat you?

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.303
What happened there?

00:46:11.303 --> 00:46:12.500
Tell me more.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.790
Second, so a very good
public speaker, storyteller,

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:16.410
comedian-- they
start in the action.

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:18.190
They use the present tense.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:20.057
And it's go from the word go.

00:46:20.057 --> 00:46:21.140
There's no fluff in there.

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.150
They realized brevity is
levity, and every word counts.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.951
But just mad things can happen
in that first 30 seconds.

00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:28.450
And try and stick
to the time limit.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:30.300
We're going to do it today,
just in case anyone's running

00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.258
to watch the World Cup.

00:46:31.258 --> 00:46:34.200
Don't worry, we'll
finish bang on time.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.520
These you can get when a
little timer built into them.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.810
And they'll vibrate so you know
exactly what the time is doing.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.070
And I'm also cheating.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.290
This is a free app that I
use that I'll let you see,

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.498
and that's the countdown
clock for me that I can see,

00:46:45.498 --> 00:46:47.850
but you didn't know I had
until I ruined it right now.

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:49.100
OK, thanks.

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:51.900
But very handy just so you
know to shut up on time.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.580
Don't pet hamsters-- more
animals, woohoo, happy days,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.080
right?

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.460
Most people when
they're nervous,

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.607
they will do this
with their hands.

00:46:58.607 --> 00:47:01.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.140
Like they're petting a
little imaginary ball of fur

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.860
that they're keeping very
warm in there for some reason.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.182
And it's very easy to
stop yourself doing that.

00:47:10.182 --> 00:47:12.390
I was looking for another
ball, but I don't have one.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:14.880
Practice at home with two
glasses, one in each hand,

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.310
or a bottle in each
hand, because this looks

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.730
very natural to your audience.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.570
It's actually correlated to
the virality or the view count

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:23.516
on your talk-- the more
you move your hands--

00:47:23.516 --> 00:47:25.140
but it doesn't feel
very natural to do.

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.660
And when you're practicing with
two things, one in each hand,

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.680
every time you
bang them together

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.000
you become very conscious of it.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.720
You're not going to do that
kind of hamster petting.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.220
That would be really weird.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.920
You're like, oh, what's my
iPhone doing to that ball?

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.630
Very unusual, don't do that.

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:37.619
But you get the idea.

00:47:37.619 --> 00:47:39.660
So if you want to shortcut
that learning process,

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:41.370
when you're practicing,
a glass in each hand.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.259
They clink, you know.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.550
But then you get very accustomed
to speaking like that.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:45.900
It looks completely normal.

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.170
Don't pet the hamsters.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.139
If something mad is
going on, acknowledge it.

00:47:49.139 --> 00:47:50.430
Always acknowledge the obvious.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.436
Anyone training you--
I hear this in business

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:54.810
speaking so much, and I'm
like, oh, it's terrible advice.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.210
They're like, if you're having
problems, just work through it.

00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:57.650
Ignore them.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:58.760
I'm like, don't ignore them.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.230
Everyone in the room can see
something mental is happening,

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:02.540
so you have to say it.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.290
Like, if you're having
a breakdown, if you

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.880
make a joke that's
horrendous, if you have

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.171
a big stain on your shirt,
they're just like, good god,

00:48:08.171 --> 00:48:09.850
can you not wear your
breakfast cereal?

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:10.650
What happened to your clothes?

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:11.860
What's going on here?

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.230
You have to talk about it.

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.150
I saw a guy once--

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.070
literally, the fire
alarm started going off.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.290
And he's like, don't worry,
I've got 16 slides left.

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:20.957
We'll get through them.

00:48:20.957 --> 00:48:22.540
I'm like, the
building's on fire, man.

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.500
We're all out of here.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.250
But the easiest laugh
you'll ever get ever

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.530
is acknowledging the obvious
thoughts of the audience

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.821
towards something you're doing.

00:48:29.821 --> 00:48:32.582
If they're thinking it, you
get marks for vocalizing it.

00:48:32.582 --> 00:48:35.040
If you're like me, when I live
in America, I start talking,

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.707
I can't assume that
they know I'm Irish.

00:48:36.707 --> 00:48:38.039
They could be thinking anything.

00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:40.440
They're like, oh my god, is
the Australian, or Canadian,

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.400
or intoxicated?

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.150
I just can't tell.

00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:43.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.470
They don't know.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.410
So I have to say it, or
they're just thinking,

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:47.620
where's this guy from?

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.380
So it's very important to
spell that out if you're

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:50.900
conscious of the fact that
you might have an accent

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.400
or you're a second
language speaker,

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.200
get it in the opening statement
in a way that isn't strange

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:55.837
whatsoever.

00:48:55.837 --> 00:48:56.670
But just watch this.

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:58.045
One of my favorite
speakers ever,

00:48:58.045 --> 00:48:59.730
Dave Eggers,
petting the hamster,

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.064
acknowledging the obvious.

00:49:01.064 --> 00:49:02.720
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.370
- Thank you so much, everyone
from Ted and Chris and Amy

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.020
in particular.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.650
I cannot believe I'm here.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:11.127
I have not slept in weeks.

00:49:11.127 --> 00:49:13.460
Neil and I were sitting there
comparing how little we've

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.620
slept in anticipation for this.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.950
And I've never been so nervous.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.300
And I do this when I'm nervous.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.378
I just realized.

00:49:19.378 --> 00:49:20.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:20.872 --> 00:49:21.669
[END PLAYBACK]

00:49:21.669 --> 00:49:23.460
DAVID NIHILL: Bang,
gets a laugh, moves on.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:25.130
One of the best talks
you'll ever see.

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.600
But if he didn't
say that it would

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.683
be a bit weird, because
you're like, what on earth

00:49:28.683 --> 00:49:30.120
is he doing?

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.150
He's like, playing
baseball with a hamster.

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:34.490
He's like, really going for it.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.600
Something great speakers
will always do also--

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:39.224
and you'll find it every leading
talk-- when they get a chance,

00:49:39.224 --> 00:49:40.310
they will add acting.

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.260
They will try and
bring something to life

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:44.540
for you by telling it
in the present tense

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.340
and changing their
voice or their behavior

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.230
just a little bit, so
it's nearly something

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.281
like an actor would do.

00:49:49.281 --> 00:49:51.780
And a lot of people will say,
I'm no good at voices, though.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.511
I can't do that.

00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:54.510
You just have to change
your voice a little bit.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.260
You don't know what
my mother sounds like.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.320
You know what my dad
sounds like, right?

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.962
There's no racial
connotations, there.

00:49:59.962 --> 00:50:00.920
There's no risk factor.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.085
You're just illustrating
that it's another person,

00:50:03.085 --> 00:50:05.210
and that allows you to
shorten the amount of words.

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.970
So you don't say, and then
she said, then I said.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.027
It's like, damn it.

00:50:09.027 --> 00:50:11.360
And then she says whatever
the thing she's going to say,

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.800
and we all move
on quite happily.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.175
But just watch another one of
my favorite speakers, four-

00:50:15.175 --> 00:50:16.883
or five-time "New York
Times" bestselling

00:50:16.883 --> 00:50:19.520
writer, John Acuff-- really,
really good, small difference,

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:20.090
big impact.

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:20.756
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:50:20.756 --> 00:50:24.450
- But we can't get a cat because
my wife, Jenny, is allergic.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:29.060
And so McRae, our youngest
daughter, scrunched up her face

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:36.196
and thought, and then said, we
can get a cat when mom is dead.

00:50:36.196 --> 00:50:38.586
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:38.586 --> 00:50:41.014
[END PLAYBACK]

00:50:41.014 --> 00:50:41.930
DAVID NIHILL: Likable?

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:42.730
Do you like it?

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:43.900
I love him as a speaker.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.994
And it's just all short,
personal stories all the time.

00:50:46.994 --> 00:50:48.410
He's an amazingly
popular speaker.

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:50.740
He told me he studies 100
comedians for every business

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:51.470
speaker he does.

00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.428
So he's really trying to
replicate their stuff,

00:50:53.428 --> 00:50:54.345
but amazingly likable.

00:50:54.345 --> 00:50:54.969
But do you see?

00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:56.680
In that moment, he
becomes the daughter.

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.390
We can get a cat--

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:01.007
and pay attention to
the sentence structure.

00:51:01.007 --> 00:51:02.590
Everything we've
learned so far today.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.530
We can get a cat when mom is--

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:07.480
still makes no sense.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.800
Mom is dead.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.050
Then it all makes sense, so
people are going to laugh.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:12.640
He's facilitated that laughter.

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.754
He can just stand
there and soak it up.

00:51:14.754 --> 00:51:16.170
You're not stepping
on your words.

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.890
So if the end of laughter
is followed by the height

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:19.450
of listening-- he knows that--

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:20.500
they have time to react.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.090
If they don't, he
just keeps going.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:24.527
But at no moment would you
know he was trying to be funny.

00:51:24.527 --> 00:51:25.360
But of course he is.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.693
That's a story he's told before.

00:51:26.693 --> 00:51:28.420
He knows they're going to laugh.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:29.950
This will save
your life if you're

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:32.860
pitching, presenting in any
way, or public speaking ever.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.530
Never finish on a
Q&amp;A. Don't do it.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:37.070
That's like presenting suicide.

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.800
That would be the
equivalent of U2

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.500
going on a tour around the
world, writing a new album,

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:43.770
going to Madison Square
Garden, bringing the energy

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:44.478
through the roof.

00:51:44.478 --> 00:51:46.300
It's 10 songs, they've
already played nine,

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.590
they've got one left.

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.920
Bring it home, or just ask
the audience, hey, anyone here

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.080
play an instrument?

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.754
Maybe you want to bring it
home, finish us off here?

00:51:55.754 --> 00:51:56.920
They'd never do that, right?

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.850
Like, they've created.

00:51:57.850 --> 00:51:58.880
That's all their work.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:51:59.650
That's everything they've said.

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.899
They get to bring it to an
end and leave the strongest

00:52:01.899 --> 00:52:04.341
possible impression, or just
give it to random chance

00:52:04.341 --> 00:52:05.590
and say, anyone want to share?

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:06.640
And you know when
you ask a question,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.990
it's always a life story.

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.730
Well, like in my company,
there's a guy called Brian,

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.130
and he's, like, not really
nice, and then there's

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:11.930
a thing about this.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:13.120
And I feel emotionally in a way.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:14.230
And you're like,
that's-- what's that?

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:15.400
That's not a question.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.941
Have you ever seen that happen
at a conference, where it just

00:52:17.941 --> 00:52:19.150
goes on and on and on?

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:21.400
If you say these words,
it will save your life.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.050
I'm going to take
a few questions

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:25.577
before I make my conclusion.

00:52:25.577 --> 00:52:27.410
Because that tells them
a couple of things--

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:28.600
I'm going to talk some more.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.280
There is a conclusion left.

00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.197
And that way, when
someone goes to ask

00:52:32.197 --> 00:52:34.030
you one of those really
long-winded stories,

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:36.530
the other people in the room
will death stare at them going,

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:37.549
shut up, shut up.

00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:38.590
And you can see the eyes.

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:39.850
We're never going
to get out of here.

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:41.410
He said he has a
conclusion to come.

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:42.220
We're not finished.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.537
I need to go home.

00:52:43.537 --> 00:52:44.620
And you literally feel it.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.491
So they'll do, partly,
your job for you.

00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:48.240
But then, if there's
that awkward moment--

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.660
have you ever seen a
speaker standing there

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.190
and someone's like, any
questions for the speaker?

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:52.731
And they're just
like, oh god, please

00:52:52.731 --> 00:52:54.400
somebody ask me something.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.080
And then, the presenter will
be like, someone back there?

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:57.538
And they're like,
no, it wasn't me.

00:52:57.538 --> 00:52:58.147
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:58.147 --> 00:52:59.980
And then, I just have
to walk off like this.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.980
OK, goodbye now.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.360
And nobody even knows it's over.

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.610
Like, it's total madness,
but it happens all the time.

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.320
So if I say, I'm going to
take a few questions before I

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.990
make my conclusion,
and nobody asked

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:10.240
any questions, no big deal.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.670
I know I have another slide.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.290
And how many things are
going to be on that slide?

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.545
Either one or three--

00:53:15.545 --> 00:53:17.920
two of the most memorable
combinations you can ever have,

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.700
one or three.

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.500
So if you take nothing
away from this talk today,

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.240
here's one thing.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.781
If you take nothing away from
this talk, here's three things.

00:53:24.781 --> 00:53:26.930
But it doesn't end in a
way that they control it.

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:27.950
So if you're
presenting and you want

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.890
them to switch over to
this product or service

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:30.682
or take action--

00:53:30.682 --> 00:53:32.140
listen, I've said
a lot here today,

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:35.740
but ultimately it comes
down to these things.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.150
And then off you go.

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:38.317
They applaud, say thank you.

00:53:38.317 --> 00:53:40.358
When you say thank you,
everyone knows it's over,

00:53:40.358 --> 00:53:41.200
and then it's fine.

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.670
Makes the world a better place--

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:45.587
well, I don't know about
that, but more exciting.

00:53:45.587 --> 00:53:47.170
Review and evaluate--
you're not going

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:48.490
to want to listen
to yourself back.

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.450
You're like, oh god, I
hate listening to myself.

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:51.574
I hate listening to myself.

00:53:51.574 --> 00:53:52.360
Everybody does.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.080
Comedians will do a comedy club,
do their set, audio record it

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.870
on their smartphone, listen back
to it instantly, and adjust.

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.610
So they're constantly
editing themselves.

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:01.910
You won't want to do it.

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:03.409
And if you're like,
David, I'm never

00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:06.340
going to do that,
ever, audio record it,

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.140
put it through a service
like Trint, which

00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:09.270
is a transcription service.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:11.410
It's really, really cheap
to use and really good.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.760
There's a number of them,
but that's the best one

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.920
that I've found to use.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.920
And then, just turn it
into a script, and go oh,

00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:16.750
there are my words.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:17.910
I better edit this script.

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:19.360
And now, all of a
sudden, you're actually

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.010
preparing your talk
for the next time

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:22.600
without having to
watch yourself,

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:24.940
but becoming quite conscious
of the amount of mad things

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.161
that you've said.

00:54:26.161 --> 00:54:27.160
But you'll see patterns.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.506
You're like, oh, I said, but,
I said, I'm excited 57 times.

00:54:30.506 --> 00:54:32.380
Like a guy I was working
with the other day--

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.550
I was like, I don't
think they believe

00:54:33.550 --> 00:54:35.950
you're excited after the 56th
time there that you said,

00:54:35.950 --> 00:54:37.930
I'm excited.

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:40.334
So with that, I'd like
to take a few questions

00:54:40.334 --> 00:54:41.500
before I make my conclusion.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:45.940
So listen, I'm hanging
around after if you

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:46.870
want t ask me any questions.

00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:48.100
But I didn't want to
leave you hanging.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:48.910
I love this sign.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:52.054
Roses are red, bacon is
red, poems are hard, bacon.

00:54:52.054 --> 00:54:53.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:55.619
It's completely rubbish.

00:54:55.619 --> 00:54:57.160
And it tries to
illustrate everything

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.830
we talked about today, and it's
brilliant in its rubbishness,

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:02.080
because it acknowledges
the obvious failure of what

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.267
they were trying to do.

00:55:03.267 --> 00:55:05.350
So even if you were trying
to be funny and you go,

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.120
oh my god, that did
not work, did it?

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.530
And everyone will be like,
no it didn't, and then

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:09.280
they all laugh.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:11.080
It's always totally
fine, as long

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.240
as you acknowledge
how bad it's going.

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.430
If you're up there and
you're thinking it's amazing,

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:16.900
and you're doing all this
stuff with your hands,

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:18.040
and you're making
the eye contact,

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.160
and you're making
your big points,

00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.050
and they're sitting there going,
what a weirdo, what do you do?

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.550
So just always, always, always
acknowledge the obvious,

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:26.260
and have a bit of fun with this.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:28.240
People are so supportive
to see you doing well

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.095
in public speaking.

00:55:29.095 --> 00:55:30.970
Like, have you ever seen
someone do terribly,

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.500
and you're just watching them,
and you're like, oh my god.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.660
I hope that the ground
just magically opens up

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:37.150
and a tunnel appears that
they can slide through,

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:38.749
and it brings them
back to a fireplace

00:55:38.749 --> 00:55:40.790
and their slippers with
a mug of tea, just going,

00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:42.340
thank god that's over.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.982
Like, you really
want that to happen.

00:55:43.982 --> 00:55:45.440
And I could tell
you that all day--

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.250
how supportive people are
of you public speaking,

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:49.583
but this is the best example
I've ever found in my whole

00:55:49.583 --> 00:55:53.090
life of just how long they
will wait for you to speak,

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:54.680
how long will they
will support you,

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.450
and how long they
will literally--

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:59.210
as a nervous speaker,
you think silence,

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.585
you have to fill
it all the time.

00:56:00.585 --> 00:56:02.734
This is the opposite example
in its ultimate form.

00:56:02.734 --> 00:56:03.650
So I hope you like it.

00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:04.316
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:56:04.316 --> 00:56:07.880
- This is how bad I was
sex for the first time.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.010
- Yesterday?

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:40.384
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:56:46.858 --> 00:56:48.870
[END PLAYBACK]

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:51.770
DAVID NIHILL: What
a legend of a man.

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:54.639
So that was a full 29
seconds, and the best example

00:56:54.639 --> 00:56:56.180
I've ever found--
the end of laughter

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:57.200
is followed by
height of listening.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.741
They estimate the
people, on average,

00:56:58.741 --> 00:57:01.640
watching this or in this room
laugh about 15 times a day.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:04.355
And as kids, we used to
laugh about 300 times.

00:57:04.355 --> 00:57:05.730
So anyone who
brings a little bit

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:07.188
of that back to
corporate life, you

00:57:07.188 --> 00:57:09.355
tend to stand out, and
actually get rewarded for it.

00:57:09.355 --> 00:57:11.229
You'll get asked to
speak more and more often

00:57:11.229 --> 00:57:12.350
on behalf of your company.

00:57:12.350 --> 00:57:15.705
So there's no downside
to doing any of this.

00:57:15.705 --> 00:57:17.330
That's the link I
promised I'd tell you

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:18.930
where you can get
more of this info,

00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:21.141
and if you want to
get in touch with me.

00:57:21.141 --> 00:57:23.390
And all the tips you can get
that I've mentioned today

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:24.810
in the back of
that book for free.

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:26.934
You don't even have to buy
it if you don't want to.

00:57:26.934 --> 00:57:29.540
And I'll put that up again at
the end if you want to get it.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.330
I don't want to
leave you hanging.

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.996
Remember me, on stage,
telling the story

00:57:31.996 --> 00:57:35.087
that I was like, loads of crazy
things happened in The Moth?

00:57:35.087 --> 00:57:37.670
The Moth, by the way, I should
tell you that they score people

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.610
after their story.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:39.770
So, like, the
Olympics after you've

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:41.561
gone-- that sounds like
my worst nightmare,

00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:44.180
like some stranger is going to
hand up a number judging you.

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:46.280
Imagine you lost your
virginity and strangers were

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.310
hiding at the end of your
bed, and just popped up,

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:48.893
and went, two!

00:57:48.893 --> 00:57:50.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.512
In my mind, it was-- oh, I know.

00:57:53.512 --> 00:57:54.470
That's happened to you?

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.650
I didn't think that was a thing.

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:56.250
I though-- no?

00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.892
OK.

00:57:57.892 --> 00:57:58.850
So I'm on stage, right?

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:01.730
And I had self-published
a version of my book,

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:03.140
and now I'd sold to a publisher.

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.700
And they said, you need
to rewrite the ending.

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.660
So I was like, maybe if I
win this competition that'd

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:07.490
be a good ending.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.500
And it was three comedians
in this competition,

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.240
and of course my theory is,
comedians are the world's

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.390
true master of public speaking.

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:14.264
They're going to be one,
two, three for sure.

00:58:14.264 --> 00:58:17.570
So it's down to one speaker
left to go-- one storyteller.

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:19.580
And the comedians are
number one, number two,

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:20.660
and number three.

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.240
I'm winning, and there's
one lady left to go.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.670
My friends are in the audience,
including my friend Arash

00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:26.850
with the spinal cord injury.

00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:28.410
They found the name
Irish Dave somewhere,

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:29.590
and they put two
and two together,

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:30.470
and they're like, that's you.

00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:31.300
You never told us.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.350
And they all came, and
I was like, oh god, no.

00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:35.390
So this lady went
last, and she beat me

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.050
by, like, point-something.

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:38.294
And I was like, oh no.

00:58:38.294 --> 00:58:39.710
There goes the
ending to the book.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:43.460
That screwed all of theories
around this topic completely.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:44.530
She was amazing.

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:45.230
And then I started
talking to her.

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:46.070
I was like, how did you do it?

00:58:46.070 --> 00:58:47.150
Like, you don't
have any background

00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.720
in comedy or anything.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.880
She's like, I read everything
I could get my hands on--

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.910
loads of useful stuff.

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:52.090
And I was like, tell
me, tell me, tell me,

00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.330
because I'm about
to publish a book.

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:53.900
I want to know.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.066
And she was like, well,
this one was really useful--

00:58:56.066 --> 00:58:58.340
pulled up all these cliff
notes, "Seven Comedy Habits

00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:00.784
To Be a Better Speaker"
by David Nihill.

00:59:00.784 --> 00:59:02.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.790
The chances!

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:06.130
I was like, you beat
me with my own book!

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:08.130
I was like, right, that's
the end of this story.

00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:09.124
Now I have no ending.

00:59:09.124 --> 00:59:10.540
And then, actually
this guy saw it

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.029
and asked me to
come do a TED Talk.

00:59:12.029 --> 00:59:14.070
And I was like, now, that
would be a good ending.

00:59:14.070 --> 00:59:15.320
I was like, hold on, actually.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.860
I have a friend called
Arash, and his story

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.230
is better than anything I
could ever come up with--

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.220
hugely inspirational.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.470
Can I send you a clip of him
in action, his first talk ever?

00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:24.428
I think you'll love it.

00:59:24.428 --> 00:59:27.790
And I sent it to him, and
he booked him in my place,

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:29.790
and Arash got a 51-second
standing ovation

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:31.540
as he told everyone
how he trained for one

00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:34.060
whole year to do something
doctors would say he'd never

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.096
do again and stand
on his own two feet,

00:59:36.096 --> 00:59:38.470
because he wanted to propose
to his girlfriend eye-to-eye

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.136
instead of doing it
from his wheelchair.

00:59:40.136 --> 00:59:41.500
So of course she said yes.

00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:43.240
He stood up out of
his wheelchair onstage

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.281
and she came out and joined
him, and the audience

00:59:45.281 --> 00:59:46.300
lost their mind.

00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.800
And the hairs on
the back of my neck

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.675
even stand up just
telling you guys about it.

00:59:49.675 --> 00:59:53.110
So if you take nothing else from
this talk, start with a story

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:54.550
and really find the key point--

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:56.034
the fun part or the funny part.

00:59:56.034 --> 00:59:58.450
Use those comedians' techniques,
because at the end of day

00:59:58.450 --> 00:59:59.380
it's your story.

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.950
You know it better
than anyone else,

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.660
and you never know what will
happen when you tell it.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.700
So thank you very much
for your attention.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.366
I appreciate it.

01:00:04.366 --> 01:00:04.900
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.400
Thank

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.000
you.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:07.900
Thank you very much.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.350
Thank you.
