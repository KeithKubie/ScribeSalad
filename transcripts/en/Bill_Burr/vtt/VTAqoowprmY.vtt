00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.630
Hey,
what's going on?
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.460
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Yeah.

3
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.890
<v 2>Ah.</v>

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.950
<v 1>Do you guys checking in on you?
I'm checking in to see you.
How's your week going?</v>

5
00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:22.450
You're almost there.
It's fucking Thursday,

6
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:25.810
man.
You're on the east coast.
It's almost lunchtime.
All right.

7
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.100
By the time this comes out,
it'll be lunchtime.
What are you going to get?
Huh?

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.570
You're going to go out and get something heavy.

9
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.890
Are you going to start the weekend?
Right?
Go out and get something healthy.

10
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:38.710
Bring the stomach down a little bit.
You feel a little more comfortable,
right?

11
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.260
A little more confident.
You go out to the clubs that he buttoned down,

12
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:45.070
shirt you bellies,
not pressing against it,
right?
While you're,
yeah,

13
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:48.130
I used to do a bit my act where your buttons are doing like the iron cross

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.340
hanging on to both sides of your shirt.
Like,
Hey,
yeah,

15
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.590
you don't need that.
Make life a little easy.

16
00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:00.070
Why is this fucking thing only on one goddamn channel?

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.230
Oh,
well,
I'll figure it out.
That's it.
You're not sitting up.

18
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.940
The elevator only goes to the fourth floor.

19
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.650
It's where I am right now with my anger.
No more go to the penthouse.
Okay.

20
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:13.260
I've downsized my anger life.

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
I've moved down to a floor that I feel is just a little more affordable and

22
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.260
everybody can relax the round me,
you know what it is,

23
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.700
is I don't have any time.

24
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:26.220
I think that that's something I feel like that triggers me.

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.830
Bailey know Tam Bailey,
no time.

26
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.680
They call him Billy nor time cause you've got no time.

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.300
<v 1>You know my wife knows I don't have any time.
Don't show you.</v>

29
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.870
I don't have any time.
Uh,
but what does she do

30
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.540
the fuck was it?
Was it yelling?
Just set off one of my kids' toys.

31
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.290
I like that.
It's like a sound effects.
What did I just yell?

32
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.970
I'll see if I can make that.
But you're now go chin.

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.210
She's got this one frigging toy.

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.710
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

35
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.450
<v 1>it's fuck.
It's fucking crazy.
I like it.</v>

36
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.880
Cause there's all these different musical instruments and it teaches the kids

37
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.490
about it,
but I swear to God the guy's energy.

38
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:10.850
It's like Willie aims and Charles in charge.
You know,
he's like Charles,

39
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.080
the same thing.

40
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.080
It's like Bob and rock [inaudible] rock bup and Brooke picked four instruments.

41
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.690
It's a trip.
It's like,
buddy,
relax.

42
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.830
I don't want to hear you play an instrument when you're all fucking wound up

43
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:32.480
like that.
They're constipated.
Fucking sound coming out of your instrument.

44
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.660
Miles Davis turned around giving you that look on the bandstand.

45
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.300
<v 0>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.530
<v 1>Relax a little bit.</v>

47
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.740
<v 0>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.880
<v 1>Pop and rock.</v>

49
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.730
Boppin rock is skewed LIPO.
Is that a trumpet?
Right?
You want to live in there?

50
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:52.440
I'm not a musical guy.
Fuck you.
I'm a goddamn comedian.
Speaking of which,

51
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:57.441
I want to thank Madison Square Garden for a and Rory Rose Garden for having me

52
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:03.340
on the garden of dreams.
And um,
this is really great.

53
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.960
Um,
charity where they basically,
you know,
underprivileged kids,

54
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:09.130
kids who are sick and all that,

55
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.710
they got a dream and they come out and they make it,
they make it come true.

56
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.220
It was really nice.
He was funny.
As I was doing the,
uh,
the press there,

57
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.620
I was doing the press and I'm,
Jeffrey Gurian was in,
I always fuck with him.

58
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:25.300
I always have a great time with them.
But uh,
one of the ladies in lines like,

59
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.750
do you know what this,
you know what this charity is about?
You don't,

60
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.650
and I just seen some kid,
you know,

61
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.420
in a wheelchair kid on a walker or whatever and it's just like,
Oh God,

62
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.120
do you know what this charity is for this?
I just was like,
no,
no,
I don't.

63
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.580
No I don't,
so I'm going to come off like an asshole.

64
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.040
But the reason why I said that was because I really didn't feel like talking

65
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:46.060
about it.
You know,
once you have like a kid,
it just,
it affects you.

66
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.360
Like you have something to apply it to.
Where before it was like,
oh my God,

67
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.840
I feel bad for that and I'm just like,
I felt the whole fucking thing.

68
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.310
The parents,
the whole thing.
Tell us about the charity.

69
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.190
<v 1>Can you go through the emotion of it at no,
no,
I won't be,</v>

71
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.130
I don't know what it is.
It's Madison Square Garden.

72
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:06.790
They asked me to come on here.
So anyway,
so I go on,

73
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.840
I do this show fucking monster lineup of a,

74
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.800
of comics.
Everybody fucking killed fortunately.
Um,

75
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.400
I went on during the middle.
Seinfeld had to close it out.

76
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.040
John Stewart went on a second to last and,
uh,
Michael Change,

77
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.790
Jesus Christ,
he came in fucking murdered,
came in from SNL,

78
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:32.960
still at his jacket on,
just walked on stage.
Fucking murders,

79
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.430
leaves your fucking joke assassin.

80
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.850
Uh,
who else was on it?
Um,

81
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.900
John Malaney fucking murdering Lizer Schlesinger murdered Brian Regan.

82
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.910
Brian was how big the show Brian Regan opened.

83
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.060
That's how fucking amazing the show us.
Um,
so I was happy showing me.

84
00:04:57.061 --> 00:04:59.670
I forgot somebody.
I know.
I did.
I know there was more than that.

85
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.720
Who else was on it?
Come on,
Bill.
Thank you.

86
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.180
I don't fucking know.
Um,
Steve Sherpa hosted the thing.

87
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.200
Uh,
one of the crew guys at Madison Square Garden,
his name was,
um,

88
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.000
you know what's cool and we'll go into the bowels of the place going over to the

89
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.350
,
uh,
the theater at Madison Square Garden where Eddie Murphy recorded Ra.

90
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.830
I always think about that when I was there and uh,

91
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.510
when I'm there and we were going through,

92
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:31.230
we had to go up the elevator and they had all the Ottawa senators like hockey

93
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:35.250
bags,
they will load them in cause the rangers were playing,
playing.

94
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.020
Then the next night and lo and behold,

95
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.210
the next night I'm back in La Cause I got up at 4:00 AM to get back to my lovely

96
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:45.200
wife and kid as you do as a dad.
Cause it's

97
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.350
<v 3>not about you anymore.
You've moved down the depth chart.</v>

98
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.460
<v 1>What do you think?
You've got to get some sleep.
Their dad don't think so.</v>

99
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.070
<v 3>Ben.
No time in no time.</v>

100
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.693
<v 4>MMM.</v>

101
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.360
<v 4>I got on the fucking plane,
flew back here,</v>

103
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.030
and then I ended up watching like a period and a half of the game.

104
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.370
And Lo and behold,
they cut to the,
uh,

105
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.300
they cut to some highlights from the garden guy.
They didn't show the show.

106
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:15.440
Thank Christ.
Um,
I was a little rusty.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

107
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:20.300
I hadn't done much stand by.
I have to,
I did the,
uh,
did my special,
I was like,

108
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:22.970
I'm going to take some time for me,
you know what I mean?

109
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:27.560
Put my feet up and just thought of just what it was that fucking word,

110
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.440
those kinds of people use that regroup.

111
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.560
Just allow myself to just realign my synopsis.

112
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.100
No,
I just didn't feel like going out or anything and I was,
I was fucking,
yeah.

113
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.530
Wiped out.
And uh,

114
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.990
<v 0>yeah,</v>

115
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.490
<v 4>I w I felt like a fighter that didn't spar,
you know?</v>

116
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.180
<v 4>Just be like,
man,
I'm the champ.
I got the belt right.
I just knocked out,
you know,</v>

118
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.620
my last set was my,
uh,
my standup special fucking knocked that out.

119
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.770
I'm going to fucking champ over here.
And I got the old right there,
Fred,

120
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:02.440
the second I walked out this.
So I meandered a little bit in the beginning.

121
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:07.210
Then I got to go in and uh,
oh my God had this fucking hilarious moment.

122
00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:08.980
My set where you know,

123
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:13.930
I was making fun of Michelle Obama because how do you not,
you know what I mean?

124
00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:16.440
The level that she's been gassed up to.
Oh,
I'll,
you know,

125
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.630
she's the president's wife.
All right.
Let everybody relax.

126
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.000
Um,
that was basically my angle.
So you know,
you know,
you know,
fucking,
you know,

127
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.920
all the women are going to fucking lose their minds,

128
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.870
especially white women who also don't have jobs.
You know,
they get,
you know,

129
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.410
who are,
you know,
it was a lot of rich people there.
Right.
So I was a,
you know,

130
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.230
I was pushing their buttons.
What,
I mean,
in fairness,
the audience,

131
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.010
I was being a cunt
and I was saying,

132
00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:46.480
you know how being a first lady,

133
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:51.250
it's not a job that extending what all excitements about,
it's not a job right.

134
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.100
And the Ada yet.

135
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:01.150
So I keep setting off that toy.
Um,

136
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.250
so I say,
and I just,
so you know,
I can't see into the crowd,
right?

137
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:09.100
So I just looked into the blackness of like the 10th row,

138
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.540
this voice that I just heard you like.
Do you think it's the Jami?
Yes.
Yes.

139
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.890
I'm like,
all right ma'am,
I'm going to do me a favor.

140
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.150
You tell me how the fuck that's a job.
And the woman goes,

141
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.900
first of all,
it's sir turned out it was a dude.

142
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.583
<v 5>Right?</v>

143
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:34.780
<v 4>So then immediately you feel like this fucking post me to tension a,</v>

144
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.000
a gender neutral bathroom,
all his fucking energy.
And I just went like,
wow.

145
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.810
You know,
Guy Tell you you've got a high pitched voice.
She sounded like a woman.

146
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.313
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

147
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.530
<v 4>I,
you know something.</v>

148
00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:50.860
I was really not enjoying this time and now I've realized that this is one of

149
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:55.560
the greatest times ever to be a fucking comedian.
The amount of fun that you have

150
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.080
<v 1>and there was not,
you know,</v>

151
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.400
you sound like a woman and you know what the nowadays is just say,

152
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.030
well what is a woman sound like?
You know what a woman's sounds like.

153
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:10.110
You know what a guy sounds like,
you know the base fucking thing.

154
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:11.440
I hate when people do that.

155
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.080
That would have up during the Oj trial when that guy said it sounded like a

156
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.570
black guy and nobody's,
he's like,
what does a black guy said?
You know what,

157
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:23.160
the fucking black and what is an Irish guy sound like?
What does the German guy,

158
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:26.970
what does a French guy sounded like this accents

159
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.130
not say it.
Everybody sounds like that.
You know what I mean?

160
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.310
What if you met a black guy going like,
oh,
how are you a top of that morning?

161
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.860
[inaudible] you'd be like,
this guy is fucking with me.
But because it's a trial,

162
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.330
it's somebody sprayed.
It was all the wine

163
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.810
you have to take into consideration that this might be the anomaly.

164
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.770
Now I understand that.
But to say that somebody saying,
you know,

165
00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:58.310
that sounded like an Asian dude,
that there's something like fucking,

166
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:00.860
I dunno clannish about that.

167
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:05.600
I guess there could be speaking to that where it tell you one time I was in San

168
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.550
Francisco,
right?
Visiting the bath houses.
Um,
and,

169
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.920
uh,
I got into a cab and this Asian dude was driving.

170
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:17.730
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

171
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.630
<v 1>And he had the,
he sounded like he was on fucking he.
Huh.</v>

172
00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:25.750
So there is always that exception.
I swear to God,
straight up Asian Dude.

173
00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.690
And he was just going,
wow,
man,
I'm telling you this traffic out here,

174
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.890
it's ridiculous.
And I'm looking at the Dubin is this guy fucking with me?

175
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.320
Hi,
I'm alone.
Y'All gone be out here in San Francisco.

176
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.620
And I was just like,
dude,
I got to ask,
where the fuck are you from?

177
00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:43.900
And he laughed.
He's like,
man,
I grew up in Tennessee.

178
00:10:43.901 --> 00:10:47.720
I know it's fucked up to hear me talk and lock this bowl where I grew up,

179
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.000
everybody dead.

180
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.270
Then he started telling me how he did all this extra work and how he was an

181
00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:57.170
extra in cleaning clean Eastwood's uh,
one of those dirty Harry movies.

182
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.310
And I got his phone number and I bags when I was back on Opie and Anthony,

183
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:05.940
I was like,
oh my God,
we gotta get this guy on the show.
Um,

184
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.390
so there is an exception,
but I mean it's all,
but there's also,

185
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:11.550
that's not a reason to,
uh,

186
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.060
what are the kids call it now you've been canceled.

187
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.360
Um,
you sound Latino.

188
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.420
Just exactly.
What does that mean?

189
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.450
Did I tell you that time I was going to Charlie Murphy's funeral and I,

190
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.730
I had packed hastily.
You know what I mean?

191
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:36.650
Cause you never know when someone's going to pass away.

192
00:11:36.651 --> 00:11:38.650
All of a sudden it's like,
shit,
we gotta go.
So I,
I,

193
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:43.130
and I forgot to pack my underwears there.
So where I,
uh,

194
00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:47.990
was staying in New York was,
uh,
had become the gay part of town.

195
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:51.070
Right.
And,
uh,
cause it didn't used to be gay,

196
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.130
used to be fucking shady and then all the gay moved in and then,
you know,

197
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:57.460
what happens?
All of a sudden this nice restaurants,
there's a nightlife,

198
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:01.550
there's fucking mood lighting.
It's,
it's a,
it's awesome.
Right?

199
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.990
So right across the street from where I was staying was this clothing store.

200
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.630
And I'm not going to lie to you,
you know,
in the fucking windows.

201
00:12:08.631 --> 00:12:10.220
They definitely had like the,

202
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.480
the mannequin with the leather underwear in the hat.
But I mean,
I had to go,

203
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.030
but I saw they had other fucking tee shirts in there.

204
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.810
So I went in there trying to find some underwear.

205
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.660
So I figured that was just like an aisle,
right?
That dog collar,
gimp aisle.
Right.

206
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:28.530
So I go into this fucking place and I'm trying to find underwear and all that.

207
00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:29.530
God is like the fucking,

208
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.680
and like I finally find an underwear cut that I can wear to a funeral.

209
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.153
<v 5>All right.</v>

210
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:42.080
<v 4>Rather than wearing the,
uh,
Greg Louganis goes to Brazil,
fucking cut.
Right.</v>

211
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.393
So,

212
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.410
<v 5>yeah,</v>

213
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.010
<v 4>I finally find the cut and then on,
on,
I know I've told this story before,</v>

214
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:53.010
but there's always new listeners,
right?
On the waistband it said nasty pig,

215
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.580
you know,
and in the funeral,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

216
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.800
the service is like fucking 90 minutes away.
It's out in jersey,

217
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.210
and in time he's become an issue.

218
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:04.960
So I walk up to the counter and there's this dude standing there talking to the

219
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.320
person behind the register and I kind of interrupted.
I was,
excuse me,

220
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.600
I don't mean to interrupt.
I go,
do you have any like,
uh,

221
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.820
like mainstream underwear?

222
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.700
<v 1>That's what I said.</v>

223
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:20.430
<v 4>Do you have any mainstream underwear?
And the guy got offended.</v>

224
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.790
He's like,
define mainstream.

225
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.280
<v 1>I just stayed in the pocket.
I was like,
oh,
I don't know.</v>

226
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.510
It doesn't say nasty pig on,
on,
on the waist

227
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.920
<v 4>band.
And then he had nothing.</v>

228
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.100
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

229
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.650
<v 4>he was trying to do that.
Like,
you know,
try to make me out to be like homophobic.</v>

230
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.410
<v 1>Okay.
Fucking come home to my wife off the road.</v>

231
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.660
Which underwear that says nasty pig on it.

232
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:47.490
<v 5>Okay,</v>

233
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.930
<v 1>honey.
I swear to God,</v>

234
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.510
I was going to a funeral and I,

235
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:56.190
I needed some underwear.
There was a glitch.

236
00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.360
They had his blow.
Right.
Oh son.
I'm Gus Grissom of fucking underwear.

237
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.370
<v 5>Anyways.
Um,</v>

238
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.120
<v 4>so that ended up being a lot of fun.</v>

239
00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:09.270
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

240
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.200
<v 4>And I finished my set and I said,
thank you.
God bless everybody,
including you,</v>

241
00:14:13.201 --> 00:14:15.710
sir,
with you high pitched voice.
So,
I guess I was a bit of yeah,

242
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.700
<v 1>cut.
But um,
so last night,
right.</v>

243
00:14:18.701 --> 00:14:22.280
And I and I really did not like that feeling of um,

244
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:28.170
be in like rusty or whatever.
So I mean I already look rusty.
Um,

245
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:32.220
remember Rusty Jones?
Hello.
Goodbye.
Ello Rusty Jones.

246
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.730
Good bar rusty.
Cause Ya know,

247
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.210

Writing jingles.
Eight second songs.

248
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:43.910
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

249
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.870
<v 1>I'm a pastor.
He's a puppy.
She's a pepper a of pepper.</v>

250
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.240
Wouldn't you like to be a pepper to be a pepper Drake?

251
00:14:50.241 --> 00:14:55.241
Dr Pepper Bam House in the Hollywood hills whores by the pool.

252
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.040
Cocaine on the piano

253
00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.640
stays are all gone.
It's in the second you make it.

254
00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:08.620
Somebody takes it on the Internet and then they do a mash up right with the

255
00:15:08.621 --> 00:15:11.770
fucking,
I don't know the cocacola song.

256
00:15:11.771 --> 00:15:13.120
I don't know how that fucking works anymore.

257
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.673
<v 5>Okay.</v>

258
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.940
<v 1>That was a job when I was growing up.
You'd have a,</v>

259
00:15:18.941 --> 00:15:21.040
you'd have a party and then there would be somebody at your house.

260
00:15:21.041 --> 00:15:24.460
One guy was a milkman and not another person wrote jingles for commercials.

261
00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.630
Like there was always somebody in actuaries to sizing everybody up,

262
00:15:28.631 --> 00:15:31.210
trying to figure out when you're going to die.
Oh,

263
00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:36.211
he's already got 22 pounds overweight as far as my visual estimate goes.

264
00:15:36.281 --> 00:15:40.990
And that is a second helping of cream of spinach.

265
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.400
I can't be good for the arteries.
I'm going to want to say,

266
00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:49.870
that guy's going to tip out around 57 it was a dangerous age when I was growing

267
00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:52.390
up.
57 you know,

268
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.940
that's when you were in the red zone of having a heart attack.

269
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:59.941
57 fucking 63 61 a lot of guys dropped at 61

270
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.983
<v 5>mmm.</v>

271
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.010
<v 1>Which doesn't seem like a big deal.
When I was like five,
six,</v>

272
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.323
<v 5>you know,</v>

273
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.960
<v 1>fucking guy was born in like the 19 early 19 hundreds he had a great run,</v>

274
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.623
<v 5>right?</v>

275
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.350
<v 1>Like I was alive when Babe Ruth,
this was in shape.</v>

276
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:24.050
But when all of a sudden you're 50 stare down the barrel of 51 in June,

277
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.810
oh my God.
Oh my God.
I was,
uh,
I want,

278
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.390
so I go to the airport,
right?
Like,
pick up 10 or five is what it actually was,

279
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.410
right?
And I get to the airport like five 30 crews right out to fucking JFK.

280
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.870
All right.
I got my,
I got my ticket on my cell phone.
All right.
I'm a modern man.

281
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.230
I'm not checking any bags.
I'm a little buck and Mr Technology,

282
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.220
so I'm precheck Tsa,
right?
I fucking go through that shit.

283
00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.880
And I got my ticket and I just fucking,
I go,

284
00:16:53.881 --> 00:16:55.520
I just put my phone down to the thing and I,
and I,

285
00:16:55.521 --> 00:16:58.530
I set it down on the thing and I,
on my cell phone case,
I got,
oh,

286
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.440
I got this cluster of pictures of me and my lovely daughter,
right?

287
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.420
So I set it down and you know,
there's a woman there,
so you know,

288
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.450
they can't resist the kid.
She sees it and she just goes,

289
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:08.403
<v 7>oh,</v>

290
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.370
<v 1>I go,
yeah,
isn't she a beauty?
And she goes,
yes.</v>

291
00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:12.960
She goes to set your granddaughter.

292
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.893
<v 7>Ah,</v>

293
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:22.060
<v 1>Oh,
did that hurt?
And I laughed.
I said,
no,
it's my daughter.</v>

294
00:17:22.061 --> 00:17:25.360
I go,
I got a late start.
Oh.

295
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:28.180
And then I just limped through fucking security.

296
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.180
I had such a fucking spring in my step.
I'm like,

297
00:17:31.181 --> 00:17:35.080
I haven't boozed comp 130 days.
Right.

298
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.430
My skin's clearing up.
I'm drinking fucking smoothies.

299
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.773
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

300
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:46.240
<v 1>I'm looking younger than,
than my years.
And she,
oh my,
she just said she sent me,</v>

301
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.800
she fucking fucking me in

302
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.860
<v 4>right on top of the rocket and just shot me right back to the reality of my</v>

303
00:17:54.861 --> 00:17:57.470
fucking age,
man.
Oh man,
that killed me.

304
00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

305
00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:00.460
<v 4>Fucking kill me.
I'm not gonna lie to you.</v>

306
00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.820
I thought I'd tell this story and then have a joke at the end of it,

307
00:18:03.821 --> 00:18:07.120
but all I have is just the raw emotion of that,
that really fucking hurt.

308
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.340
You know,
see,
see,
you go ladies there.
There's a pressure.
This,

309
00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:17.170
this stigma when you're a bald,
redheaded male.

310
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.870
Granted.
But the reality is,
is I am,
I am old.
I am.

311
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.280
If I had a kid at 25 my kid would be coming up on 26 and if my kid had a kid

312
00:18:25.281 --> 00:18:27.410
about the same time I did,
then fuck it.
I would,

313
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:29.810
I would be old enough to be a grandfather.
See,

314
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.460
so I'm not going to get mad at her.

315
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:36.440
I'm not gonna write tsa.com and be like,

316
00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:41.441
I was so triggered when somebody stated a fact about my age.

317
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:49.120
<v 1>You know what?
I'm going to take it and we'll take a look book.
Um,</v>

318
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.720
what did I want to talk about here?
Oh,
I got so much.
Not so much shit.

319
00:18:53.721 --> 00:18:58.130
I got a couple emails from these fucking f one snobs because I was talking about

320
00:18:58.131 --> 00:19:00.380
how rooting for Ferrari's,
like rooting for the,
uh,

321
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.470
the Kansas City chiefs and it was painting them as an underdog.
Now,

322
00:19:03.471 --> 00:19:06.560
even though I clearly stated that,
I just started watching like fucking three,

323
00:19:06.561 --> 00:19:08.810
four years ago,
Ferrari has not been doing well.

324
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.310
<v 4>All right.
Second place a that,
that,
yeah,
that's your,
you're the first loser.</v>

325
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.880
So what I said was accurate and they're sitting there talking down to this

326
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:23.100
father who looks like a grandfather talking down to me.

327
00:19:23.101 --> 00:19:25.410
This person who has difficulty reading out loud,

328
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.640
talking down to me the hero of this podcast,

329
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.440
the greatest person on this podcast,
right?
Yeah.

330
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.830
<v 1>Now is me.
And it's not because I'm,
I'm the only voice.</v>

331
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.120
It's because I'm the only one who votes.
Um,

332
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.980
yeah,
giving me shit.
Like I didn't understand that Ferrari is,

333
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.120
I know what a Ferrari is.
You fucking morons.
Everybody knows what a Ferrari is.

334
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.430
I know their history.
I actually read a,

335
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:58.670
I read this book called the limit about the first f one American f one champion.

336
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.940
One of the great fucking books I ever read.
I wish I didn't give it away.

337
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:05.340
I always give away the books.
Um,

338
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:09.990
absolutely fucking love that book.
And I understand.
I understand.
Okay.

339
00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:14.310
I know where it's at.
All right.
I'm just saying the last couple of years,
I mean,

340
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.850
ever since I've been watching the sports since like 2015,
2016,

341
00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:22.580
whenever the fuck I started,
it's just been Mercedes.
All right.

342
00:20:22.581 --> 00:20:23.600
I'm getting sick of it.
I,
you know,

343
00:20:23.601 --> 00:20:25.250
the same way you guys are sick of the Patriots,

344
00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:29.630
I would like to see Ferrari make a run.
Although since then I did see,
uh,

345
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.650
that new guy,
John,
what's his face there?
The,
the,
the,
the new drivers,

346
00:20:33.651 --> 00:20:37.520
not Kimi Raikkonen the new,
the new guy,
uh,
driving for Ferrari.
He's like,
ah,
man.

347
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:38.121
You know,
well,

348
00:20:38.121 --> 00:20:42.110
I guess we got lucky that the safety car came out and he was really positive

349
00:20:42.111 --> 00:20:46.850
about it and that made me,
um,
that gave me some hope.

350
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.990
It gave me some hope.
By the way,

351
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.920
we're going to have a fucking benefit for fucking Daniel Ricardo yet,
you know,

352
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.330
they always doing standup benefits.

353
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:58.120
I want to do a stand up benefit to get that guy who fucking team that can give

354
00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.440
them a car that's going to be able to finish the fucking race.
That poor bastard.

355
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.820
I swear to God,
if they take the smile away from that man,

356
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.470
you know,
that's,
that's really going to be a difficult fucking

357
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:17.010
thing to watch somebody so young,
so full of life,

358
00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.080
you know,
twinkle in his eye.
How many fucking times can you just be driving,

359
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.280
crushing it and all of a sudden your car just shuts off,
you know?

360
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:31.170
Or for some reason somebody puts a mogul in the goddamn grass and you try not to

361
00:21:31.171 --> 00:21:34.650
get sideswiping you go over just to Cantera under the grass in the front of your

362
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:39.000
car,
fucking explodes.
I don't get it.
The guy's fucking snake.
Bitch,
snake,
bitch.

363
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:43.890
Snake bit.
Sorry.
[inaudible] oh,

364
00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:47.530
so I finally,
I saw the uh,
did I tell you guys,
I've,

365
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:52.440
I saw the uh,
I saw the moto GP from Ah,
Argentina.

366
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.350
Um,
I got a lot of questions.
All right.

367
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.440
Is I take a sip of a green smoothie,
a green smoothie.

368
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:05.820
You guys want a good recipe for a smoothie.
Green smoothie.
Here it is.
Cup of ice,

369
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.890
Cup of almond milk.
Sorry.
Starting over again.

370
00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:15.080
Quarter Cup of ice,
Cup of almond milk,

371
00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.970
a banana,
a cup of spinach,

372
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.750
a cup of all net.
I mean a couple of,
a,
a,

373
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.270
a tablespoon of all natural honey.

374
00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.660
Two tablespoon of a instant oatmeal and one tablespoon of almond butter.

375
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.280
Just try to get all natural,
everything.
This is how I do it.

376
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.350
I put the ice,

377
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.250
the almond milk and the spinach in first and then maybe like some of the honey

378
00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.490
because what happens is,
you know,
the way you do it,

379
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.310
like sometimes it can turn into like a shake if there's too much ice,

380
00:22:53.311 --> 00:22:56.550
but there's not enough ice in it.
And then I blend that.
Then I put the paint,

381
00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.200
I put the banana in there first and then I put in the uh,

382
00:23:01.201 --> 00:23:03.990
the peanut butter.
Now the oats and then the peanut butter or whatever.

383
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.130
And that way it stays on top of the banana and it doesn't sink all the way

384
00:23:08.131 --> 00:23:11.730
fucking down cause like it's,
it's really the peanut butter in the honey.

385
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.400
It's going to stick down to the bottom and it won't be part of the fucking mix.

386
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.580
So however I just said that,

387
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.420
don't put the honey in where I said that flipped the oats and the honey and mix

388
00:23:21.421 --> 00:23:24.420
it up that way and you should be good.
I do like to see two separate Mexicans.

389
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.000
There you go.
Drink that fucker.
Drink your breakfast.

390
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:35.610
Be a champion.
Be like a dad.
Looks like a grandfather.

391
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.280
Oh God,
that fucking killed me.
You know,

392
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.680
I swear to God just for men actually gave a shit about men with red beard's.

393
00:23:43.681 --> 00:23:44.970
I would've gone out and bought some,

394
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.410
like if they were selling it on the plane and I would've been quite quietly

395
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:50.660
crying to myself as I combed it into my chin.

396
00:23:56.070 --> 00:24:00.860
All right,
here's my question about the moto GP.

397
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.630
I don't get,
what the fuck is with mark.

398
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:05.900
Mark has his fucking motorcycle where it's just,
they,
they even called it,

399
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:06.171
you know,

400
00:24:06.171 --> 00:24:09.290
he might just take off and this could be a boring race and then the guy quickly

401
00:24:09.291 --> 00:24:11.810
correct himself,
not saying that it's going to be boring.
The guy just fucking,

402
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.890
you've got a good start and he got out front and he had like a fucking 15 second

403
00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:20.240
lead by the middle of the race or something.
Something crazy.

404
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.560
I don't understand why his bike is so much faster.

405
00:24:24.561 --> 00:24:29.561
I thought that the Ducati's or the do caddies were all on like the same level,

406
00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.290
but he just pulled away like,
you know,

407
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.900
he had the IROC Z and everybody else had the rally sport or the Berlinetta,

408
00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.010
you know,
the Firebird versus the Trans am I've,
I,

409
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.940
it's the exact opposite of f one.
So then the whole fucking race,

410
00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:51.620
the exciting part of the race was watching a to CEO.
So in um,

411
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.360
uh,
Valentino Rossi battling for second place and he would,

412
00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.270
Mark Marquez was so far out into the front

413
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.340
that they just had them in a little square on the upper right hand side of the,

414
00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.121
of,
of the uh,

415
00:25:05.121 --> 00:25:09.260
my computer screen here while we just watched everybody else battle and I don't

416
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:11.360
understand what happened or Halo Renzo did.

417
00:25:11.361 --> 00:25:15.230
He pushed the wrong button cause he's also drive riding a Honda

418
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.320
and then they were all bitching about the visio zone is his little aerodynamic

419
00:25:21.321 --> 00:25:26.090
thing that cooled off his back tire.
They thought that was ridiculous advantage.

420
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.390
And then the very next race,
all of a sudden this guy,

421
00:25:29.391 --> 00:25:32.340
you know mark mark has just takes off and it's,
it fits.

422
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.640
He also still has that thing cool.
And his back tire,

423
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.150
I guess what they should have done because they were so busy fucking with each

424
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:40.460
other trying to pass each other racing.

425
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.390
What they should have done is just accepted that the vizios so was in second,

426
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.550
they all got in behind each other.

427
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.520
Like the Peloton is that I said in bike racing and eventually they would cut

428
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:55.670
through the wind and catch up with the guy and then once they caught up with

429
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:57.740
them,
then it can be like,
all right,
let's start racing again.

430
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.040
Is that legal to do that,
to actually become a team,

431
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.780
to catch the fucking guy who was already eight seconds in front of you?
I Dunno.

432
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.440
And then lastly,
uh,
cal crutch,
Lowe says name.

433
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:14.000
He got fucked on that race.
He got fucked.
All right?

434
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.620
He had an incredible fucking start until the naked eye.
He didn't start too soon.

435
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.040
And the fact that there's a goddamn computer now,

436
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:27.500
like people's brains are not as good as a fucking computer.
Can't see that thing.

437
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.440
So he doesn't know he's cheating.
He just started,
he got a good fucking start.

438
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:35.420
Hey Man,
they fuck that guy over.
They fucked him over.
All right,
so there you go.

439
00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:37.040
There's,
there's my little motorcycle talking.

440
00:26:37.041 --> 00:26:39.350
I'm going to read some advertising and then I'm going to wrap this fucking

441
00:26:39.351 --> 00:26:43.770
podcast up and I'm going to get on with my,
my day here.

442
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:48.950
All right.
Oh,
here we go.
Oh,
don't do me undies.
Me undies.

443
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:53.100
Bailey is old in gray.
Doo,
Doo,
Doo Doo.
Mandy's me on Ds.

444
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:58.080
That's what the lady say.
You have a beautiful fucking granddaughter

445
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.700
started my granddaughter,
right?
Nothing rhymes with daughter.

446
00:27:02.701 --> 00:27:06.830
I'm too fucking old to make it so fucking work.
Somebody get me a journal,

447
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.550
a journal tool and some soft fucking underwears.

448
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.120
Okay.
Buzzfeed said this about me undies.

449
00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.820
They feel like actual heaven against your skin.

450
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.930
We're going to assume heaven is really soft in this context.

451
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.650
Well don't you pay bud buzzfeed or do they just review shit?
I don't ask men.

452
00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.750
Well isn't that a nice magazine?
I'd like to be asked.

453
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:34.660
Things feel like I'm being heard.
As men said,

454
00:27:34.661 --> 00:27:37.420
they feel like silk drenched in hand.
Lotion,

455
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.780
silt,
trenching,
hand like I know hand lotion makes your hands soft.

456
00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.690
And I know silk is soft,
so if you combine both of those,

457
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.340
but you also jerk off with lotion and if you tea,
if you put that on the fabric,

458
00:27:53.341 --> 00:27:57.120
now the fabric is wet and it's going to be sticking to your balls.
All right?

459
00:27:57.121 --> 00:27:58.470
This is why you don't ask.
Men thinks

460
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.190
these honorees are so soft.

461
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:05.190
They make Bob Ross's voice sound like Gilbert Godfrey.

462
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.870
They are so soft that Kenny g thinks about them to get inspired to write his

463
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:13.640
next son.
Kenny g taken a hit there.
What did Kenny Dell,

464
00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:19.410
me undies uses the coveted micro modal modal fabric that is a full three times

465
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:24.440
softer than cotton.
Take that big cotton.
Your big puffy on.

466
00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.540
Yeah and cotton's also white to you.
Fabric,

467
00:28:27.541 --> 00:28:32.460
toxicity fabric.
Patriotical cunt.
Speaking of Prince,

468
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:36.450
why not match your bottom half with your better half and get a matching prince

469
00:28:36.451 --> 00:28:39.750
for you and your partner?
Uh,

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.980

Hashtag me undies.

484
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.260
Alright,
butcher box everybody.
Ah,
here we go.

485
00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.490
Butcher box delivers healthy 1% grass fed,

486
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:47.140
grass finished beef free range,
organic chicken and heritage breed pork.

487
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:51.220
Did you guys see a Naples gutsy special yet?
Uh,

488
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.910
the Tennessee kid fucking a guy guys.
Absolutely brilliant.

489
00:29:54.911 --> 00:29:59.230
He has a great bit on free range chickens versus the ones that they,
uh,

490
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:03.730
that were not free to range about a,
it's on Netflix streaming.
Now look at that.

491
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:07.300
It's an ad within an ad.
The incredible quality of butcher box meets.

492
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:12.070
Start with the commitment to raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics

493
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.730
and hormones.
Cook with the peace of mind knowing you are eating healthy,

494
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:20.170
high quality meat.
Each box comes with at least eight to 11 pounds of meat,

495
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:24.670
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.
If you're a city slicker.

496
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.870
But if you fastball province subject,
that's all enough for you,
for your friend,

497
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.510
you can choose from five different boxes.
All beef ladies,

498
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.980
beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed box for you.

499
00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.630
Progressive People.
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

500
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.510
That's for the conservative.
You know,
that's for the,

501
00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.490
the people who want to keep their meat separate.

502
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.890
Once the overall only take these,
they are the Iris Katz's Deli meats.

503
00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.860
My favorite cut of meat is their heritage,
which breed pork.
Oh Man.

504
00:30:57.861 --> 00:31:02.750
And I have a fucking recipe.
I was at the airport there.
Oh,
grant,

505
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.220
grandfather bar here and GRANDPA.
And I was uh,

506
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:11.180
it was,
it was basically show,
now you can make all these meals and just one pot.

507
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:11.870
You know what I mean?

508
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.480
You know those great fucking things that comfort food that's going to make you

509
00:31:14.481 --> 00:31:16.940
fucking blow up.
I got a good one for pork chops.

510
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.460
Then I'm going to try this weekend.
Oh,
I can't wait.

511
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.840
I really am like a grandfather.
I'm excited about cooking pork chops.
All right.

512
00:31:23.841 --> 00:31:27.710
This month,
butcher box is offering the unlimited breakfast breakfast bundle.

513
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.840
What is this?
This includes two packages,

514
00:31:29.841 --> 00:31:34.841
a bacon and two pounds of breakfast sausages all for free in your first box.

515
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:41.150
Our Bacon is the best bacon you've ever had.
It's whole 30 approved.

516
00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:45.350
I don't even know what that means.
What the 30 people run in the bacon world.

517
00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.390
Uncurated nitrate and sugar-free.
This sausage is a healthy,

518
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.840
authentic version of a classic style pork sausage.

519
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:57.680
My mouth is watering,
like literally reading this,

520
00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:03.590
simply seasoned with salt and pepper and sage.
Oh my God.

521
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.470
What a way to start the day I eat that.

522
00:32:06.471 --> 00:32:10.210
I would start crying looking across the table and life would be like,

523
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:14.080
what's the matter,
honey?
It's just so good.
Um,

524
00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:15.230
right now new members,

525
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.890
we'll get two packages of bacon and two pounds of breakfast sausage added to

526
00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:23.240
your first box for free.
Plus you'll get $20 off your first box.
Go.

527
00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:28.241
Now while supplies last as this is a limited time offer.

528
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.430
These people know how to do it.
All right?

529
00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.520
You want Americans to buy your beef,

530
00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.930
you dangled free bacon and sausage in their fucking face and you set a

531
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.860
<v 4>Jesus Christ the amount of fucking,
you know what?</v>

532
00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:47.090
So you know the amount of fucking people in overalls right now that are like

533
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.560
half hard listening to this overall,
is that like the onesies for rednecks?

534
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.480
You know,
that's when they know that they grew up.
I ain't got no sleeves and my,

535
00:32:56.481 --> 00:32:58.970
hey buddy,
you don't know who you fucking with.

536
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.030
Ain't got no sleeves or or or fade on my one Z.

537
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.210
I'll walk out sad,
my onesy.
That's how I'd do it.

538
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.830
Um,
all right,
that's the podcast.
Everybody,
uh,
please enjoy the,
the,

539
00:33:14.831 --> 00:33:18.010
the musical interlude.
And then there's going to be a hat,

540
00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.360
another half hour bonus here of a Thursday afternoon just before Friday.

541
00:33:22.361 --> 00:33:27.120
Monday morning podcast.
A greatest hit.
I'm an episode from earlier.

542
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.810
Um,
so I didn't even mention last night.
So I went out and I did two sets.

543
00:33:30.811 --> 00:33:35.130
That's right.
Cause I didn't like feeling rusty and I,
uh,

544
00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.440
I got this whole new chunk and it came last night and had a great set.

545
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.700
And then Brian Kaylin probably said some of the nicest shit anybody said to me

546
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.790
as,
as a comedian.
I think he's absolutely fucking brilliant.
So,
uh,

547
00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:50.340
I'm actually gonna call him today and thank them for the compliment.

548
00:33:50.341 --> 00:33:53.160
It put me on a standup high,
you know,

549
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.020
which being the age that I am,
you know,
I,
I,
you know,

550
00:33:58.021 --> 00:34:00.370
I got called the grandfather and I,
and I have an Aa,

551
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.780
our p card and I've still never fucking used it.
Okay.

552
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.490
And if you're young and you don't know what it is,
that's,
that's awesome.

553
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.910
Enjoy the part of your life where you don't know what an AAR,

554
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.480
you're not qualified yet for one of those fucking things.
All right.

555
00:34:13.481 --> 00:34:16.180
That's the podcast.
Enjoy the music.
Have a great weekend.

556
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:19.450
You cunts and I will see you on Monday,

557
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:26.910
<v 8>Huh?
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.</v>

558
00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:31.580
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.
Huh.

559
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.010
Huh.
Huh.

560
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:47.830
Okay.
Hello.

561
00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.810
<v 9>Hey,
what's going on?
It's build births.
The Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

562
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.080
April 4th,

563
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.080
2011 or 2011 as I saw it so succinctly put this weekend by a,

564
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.350
the great comedian Patton Oswald.
That's how he said it.
He was on stage.

565
00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:18.910
I was doing a show with them,
the Kevin and being April foolishness show.
And uh,

566
00:35:18.911 --> 00:35:22.630
I noticed at some point at the Gibson MP theater,
by the way,
formerly known as

567
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:25.810
the Universal Lampi Theater for blues brother fans.

568
00:35:25.811 --> 00:35:28.000
You might recognize that name right?
Remember that?

569
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.870
Good Evening Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Universal Lampi Theater.

570
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.010
Here it is something,
something going on.
1985.

571
00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.730
So much in music today is preprogrammed electronic disco.

572
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.200
That's where the fuck they did that.

573
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.280
They were opening for Steve Martin at the height of Steve Martin's career when

574
00:35:44.281 --> 00:35:46.520
you had the white suit with the bow and Arrow going through it.

575
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.160
So that's the second year in a row.
I've got to do that wonderful program,

576
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.450
show performance,
whatever the fuck you call it.
And,
uh,

577
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.950
it was an awesome night of comedy,

578
00:35:55.951 --> 00:36:00.951
but there was something learned and all the filth and fun to read that I saw

579
00:36:01.051 --> 00:36:03.120
that night was pat and said 2011.

580
00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:04.770
So that's how I'm saying it for the rest of the year,

581
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.760
cause I can't say 2011 I have to slow down.
2011,

582
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.630
2011 season runs together.
2011,

583
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.470
all of a sudden everybody in the room relaxes.
Hey,
well with the friend,

584
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.820
we thought that that red headed guy was,
was,
you know who,

585
00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.060
who's left handed some of the times was a spawn of the devil.

586
00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.493
You know,

587
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.100
that's what they used to think about red heads and people who wrote with their

588
00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:32.280
left hand.
So basically I would,
if it was still the 18 hundreds,

589
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:36.000
I would be getting the shit slapped out of me and one of those fucking schools,

590
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.450
you know,
that they used to have on little house in the prairie.

591
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:42.780
We had grades two through eight.
We're all sitting in the same room.

592
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.310
Um,
tell me that was an inappropriate behavior going on there.
You know,

593
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.120
you're a senior in high school,
right?
All of a sudden the freshman girls come in,

594
00:36:52.121 --> 00:36:53.290
there's always one pervert.

595
00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:58.291
Your grade would descend on to someone who was basically a fucking child at that

596
00:36:58.361 --> 00:36:58.601
point.

597
00:36:58.601 --> 00:37:03.601
You can't tell me back in the day in the 18 hundreds when people got married at

598
00:37:03.611 --> 00:37:05.500
14 so they could pull together,

599
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:10.590
there's showing so they could go buy a fucking plot of land in some oxygen.
Huh?

600
00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:14.350
You're telling me some eighth grade,
it wasn't rolling up on a fourth grader,

601
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.000
you know,
like some Catholic fucking Prius.

602
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.180
I'm like a start that goddamned debate again.
Um,

603
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:26.230
speaking of which,
hey,
you know what,

604
00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:29.230
for some reason the theme delivered and Shirley's in my head today,

605
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:33.910
we're going to do it.
I'll think of that's been in my head before,

606
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:38.990
every once in a while TV that I watched way too much back in the day,
uh,

607
00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.560
pops into my head.
But anyways,
getting back to the,
uh,

608
00:37:41.561 --> 00:37:44.200
the Catholic Church thinks somebody sent me a little bible thing,

609
00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:49.650
said the dinosaurs are called behemoths in the Bible and about Outer Space

610
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:53.550
Aliens,
ships,
uh,
spaceships abductions is talks,

611
00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.970
talked about in a Ezekiel one,

612
00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.040
and these are from in the King James Bible.

613
00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.070
Now,
after all these years of trash in the Bible,

614
00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.070
I'd have I ever mentioned to you guys that I haven't even read the fucking
thing.

615
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:12.580
Oh,
I've tried.
I've tried to read the thing,

616
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:16.900
but it's all he said it under you with Evan,
the Fucken,

617
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.240
uh,
Polynesians said to the Persians,
I mean,
I,
I can't,

618
00:38:22.241 --> 00:38:25.960
I can't get through it.
It's like trying to reach straight Shakespeare.

619
00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:30.700
But as far as I remember going to church,
they said,
dad,
uh,

620
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:33.790
you know,
earth was created in six days.
On the seventh day,

621
00:38:33.791 --> 00:38:38.500
God rested and I created Adam and eve and they were in a,

622
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:43.270
they were in Eden hanging out.
Right?
Then all of a sudden,
you know,

623
00:38:43.271 --> 00:38:47.320
he lays down some rules.
He says,
Hey,
listen,
you guys are in paradise.

624
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:51.370
I just don't want you to go over there and eat an apple off of that fucking
tree,

625
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:56.350
you know?
Is that so god damn hard to not eat a piece of fruit?

626
00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.670
Who gives a shit?
It's fruit.
No one wants to eat fruit.

627
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.260
The only people eat fruit or kids whose parents are making a medium.
Okay.

628
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.670
Vegetarians and some 50 year old Wall Street guy who just suffered his third

629
00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:12.760
heart attack.
Then maybe a love of fucking apple so he doesn't die.

630
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:17.470
But other than that,
how easy is it not to eat an apple?
Right?
But Eve,

631
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.750
this stupid fucking whore that she is,

632
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.350
you know you're not going to tell me a key.
I can't do something.

633
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.580
And because she's abroad and you can't punch her in the face,

634
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.090
what does she have to worry about?
Huh?
Who?

635
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:34.600
Who the fuck is this God guy to tell me I can't go and have an apple?

636
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:35.950
So what does she do?

637
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.080
She marches right over there with their pubic hair blowing in the fucking wind.

638
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.930
Cause there's no shame at this point because there's been no sin.

639
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.410
Everything's great.
You can walk around and go pet a cheetah.

640
00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.390
It doesn't immediately,
or a leopard.

641
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.880
It doesn't immediately grab you by the throat,

642
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:57.370
fucking snap your neck and then drag you up in a tree so the lions can't get to

643
00:39:57.371 --> 00:40:01.000
it.
Or somebody else may be a fucking baboo,
you know,

644
00:40:01.001 --> 00:40:05.450
with it's psycho goddamn teeth.
Dino,
let's one of the,

645
00:40:05.451 --> 00:40:07.250
one of the fucking major,
uh,

646
00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.960
adversaries for a leper is a fucking baboons.
I never knew that shit.

647
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:16.640
They got those giant teeth who would have known,
you know,

648
00:40:16.641 --> 00:40:20.450
very agile,
left to right sort of movement,

649
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.480
like a water bug,
these insane things.
But Hey,

650
00:40:23.481 --> 00:40:27.740
let's get back to the Bible as far as I remember it,
right.
So they go z,
you know,

651
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.680
walking up to the fucking apple tree,

652
00:40:30.681 --> 00:40:35.330
like some one of those fic Toria secret whores walking down the first fucking

653
00:40:35.331 --> 00:40:38.630
runway.
Although she's not wearing heels,

654
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:41.540
she just walked in and she never steps on a Brock.

655
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.900
Doesn't step on some glass from a broken millo light bottle cause she's in

656
00:40:46.941 --> 00:40:47.930
paradise.

657
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.900
She walks right over there and some snake starts.
Yet that's what happened.

658
00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:56.900
Some snakes starts yapping in arrear,
right?

659
00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:59.060
Like some Douche on Facebook.

660
00:40:59.061 --> 00:41:03.050
Who finds your wife and her semi-hard pictures starts emailing her,
right?

661
00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.410
Worman his way into the relationship,
right?

662
00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.480
So this whore goes up and what does she do?

663
00:41:08.481 --> 00:41:11.150
She reaches up and she takes a bite of fruit.

664
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:16.280
She eats an apple as far as I've been told,
part of this nutritious breakfast,

665
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.110
part of a balanced diet sheets.
A fucking apple.
Maybe she wanted to be regular,

666
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:22.243
right?

667
00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.560
So she'd see apple and then God goes,
what the bitch?

668
00:41:27.561 --> 00:41:31.220
What the fuck did I t I am the one thing I say not to do.

669
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:35.270
And you got to go do it.
Go Yourself.
That's the end of paradise.

670
00:41:36.010 --> 00:41:40.810
And next thing you know,
she's putting a leaf over a fucking clam.
All right?

671
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:43.100
Adam's over there.
He didn't do ship.

672
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:47.420
And evidently he gets punished too because it's religion,
you know,

673
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.280
the punishment never has to make sense.
It just has to be really fucking scary.

674
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.930
So now they're both fucked.

675
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.990
Now all of a sudden the leopards want to fucking take a bite out of their ass,

676
00:41:56.991 --> 00:42:00.500
so they got to get sharpened.
Sticks and all this type of shit,
right?

677
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.260
Then according to the Bible,

678
00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.070
all of this that happened like fucking a couple of hundred thousand years ago

679
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.990
and then one day some narratives not getting pussy.
He's so fucking hard up.

680
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.700
He just starts digging in the ground.

681
00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.910
You know he's got all that sexual frustration.

682
00:42:16.911 --> 00:42:21.680
He just keeps digging in the ground and one day finds these dinosaur bones that

683
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.410
are way fucking older than the Adam and Eve story.

684
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:27.470
So it kind of kills the whole goddamn thing.

685
00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:31.100
Now that is far as I know is the story in the Bible,

686
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.630
how the Bible goes down and that's why people on the science side question the

687
00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:40.280
Bible.
Like I said,
I haven't read it.
All right,
so people who've read it,

688
00:42:40.281 --> 00:42:42.950
can you give me the cheat notes?
Are You Bible thumpers out there?

689
00:42:42.951 --> 00:42:45.890
We think the Bible is the best book ever fucking written

690
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:48.650
aside from the fact that when it was written,

691
00:42:48.651 --> 00:42:52.280
they still thought the fucking world was flat.
They thought if you were gay,

692
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:55.970
you give,
you go to hell and all that other intolerant horseshit in there.

693
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:00.530
But you know,
I never read the fucking thing.
So you know,
let me know.

694
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.080
Cause this guy's trying to reclaim,
trying to acclaim,

695
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.100
trying to claim that they address dinosaurs in the Bible,

696
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.570
calling them behemoths,

697
00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.680
which is amazing considering we never discovered the fucking bones until after

698
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:17.180
the book was written.
So how does that work?
Huh?

699
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:21.950
Was that when God was a burning Bush and all the fish was coming out of the

700
00:43:21.951 --> 00:43:25.910
basket and he just sort of muttered something about behemoths and nobody

701
00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:28.700
understood it,
but it was God.
So they just wrote it down anyways.

702
00:43:28.701 --> 00:43:32.530
Is that what you're going to claim?
Oh Jesus.

703
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:36.770
Oh Gee.
Hey,
um,

704
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.600
who can turn their world on with her tits?

705
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.120
Um,
what did I want to talk about this week?
How about the Bruins,

706
00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.820
Bruins making the fucking playoffs?

707
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.660
I'm predicting that the Bruins will once again make it to the eastern conference

708
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.630
finals and then,
uh,
then what's going to happen?

709
00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.510
I'll tell you what's going to happen is that they're not going to go any
further.

710
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.770
I Dunno.
I'm just going to say that cause hopefully they'll prove me wrong.

711
00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.690
Who knows?
We've got a great goalie.

712
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:09.140
You know what's scaring me is fucking Carey price up in Montreal has been

713
00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:12.200
playing fantastic.
All right.

714
00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:15.800
And for some reason when the Bruins have a great goalie,
it only gets us so far.

715
00:44:15.801 --> 00:44:19.310
But those sons of bitches up there with Ken Dryden,

716
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:25.010
Patrick Wall back and fucking 93 when they went on that in plausible run,

717
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.400
one like 19 overtime games,

718
00:44:28.401 --> 00:44:32.160
one of the great runs at winning the Stanley Cup all fucking time.

719
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:37.000
Um,
who knows?
I don't know.
I think the flyers will beat him.

720
00:44:37.001 --> 00:44:40.300
The flyers never seem to have problem with the Canadians.
Uh,

721
00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:45.270
they don't give a fuck,
right?
They're just going to punch you in the face.

722
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.590
Um,
anyways.
Hey,
listen to this shit.
You know something,

723
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:52.200
what happened to me twice this week is people just,

724
00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:56.580
they don't hear what the fuck I'm saying.
This is the classic thing.

725
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:57.980
When you're doing standup comedy,

726
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:01.110
you stand on stage and you tell a bunch of jokes and everybody laughs.

727
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.270
Everybody's having just a great time.

728
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:06.840
And then all of a sudden you come around to his subject that touches a little

729
00:45:06.841 --> 00:45:09.960
close to somebody's life and all of a sudden you're not telling jokes anymore.

730
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:14.190
Now you're making statements.
Well,
Lo and behold,
once again,
this happens.

731
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:15.390
I don't know if you guys are aware of this,

732
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:19.830
but my let it go special is now up on Netflix,
the unedited version,

733
00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:22.200
the version that I wanted the world to see.

734
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:27.690
But that dream was crushed because on comedy central,

735
00:45:27.691 --> 00:45:30.840
they have advertisers and that's how they make their money,
which I respect.

736
00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:34.230
So then,
you know,
they got to cut out some jokes.

737
00:45:34.231 --> 00:45:36.690
They get to start doing the Morse code because they say,

738
00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:40.410
fuck every other word and then Yada,
Yada,
Yada.
But now it's on Netflix.

739
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.690
Now it's on Netflix.
And you can watch that son of a bitch.
Ah,

740
00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.800
completely unedited.
So please tell your friends,
please tell your family,

741
00:45:49.801 --> 00:45:51.840
tell some of your enemies.
Um,
so anyways,

742
00:45:51.841 --> 00:45:56.190
so some are some woman evidently watch this.
Watch my special,

743
00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:00.720
my standup comedy special,
the one where I go on and act like an ass.

744
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:02.820
And I'm telling jokes just to make you laugh,

745
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.910
just to fucking appease my ego.
That's all on doing.
So anyways,

746
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.110
this lady starts off and uh,

747
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:17.730
she says offended by your stay at home mom bit.
She starts off.

748
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.190
Hi.
Obviously I'm a stay at home mom.
Why is that obvious?

749
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.650
Because you said you were offended by my stay at home mom bit.

750
00:46:28.651 --> 00:46:32.520
Why couldn't you be just an uh,
uh,
a supporter of stay at home moms?
Oh,

751
00:46:32.521 --> 00:46:36.360
I'm being a cunt right out of the gate.
Let's read this.
She starts off high.

752
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:40.320
Obviously I'm a stay at home mom and I love watching standup,

753
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:45.740
but I couldn't continue watching you based on your bit about stay at home moms.

754
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.700
You know,
I love about it.

755
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:52.701
It's an hour long special and I think I opened with that joke or it was

756
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:56.400
literally within the first five minutes and she had to shut it off.

757
00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:02.250
She says,
I'm really sorry you feel that way about stay at home moms.

758
00:47:02.251 --> 00:47:06.150
That's one of my pet peeves is when someone's about ready to take the piss out

759
00:47:06.151 --> 00:47:10.710
of me.
I hate when they apologize.
Okay.
You're not sorry.

760
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.050
You're not sorry that I feel that way.

761
00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:17.550
You fucking hate me because I feel that way.
All right.
Stop apologizing.

762
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.780
Oh God.
My voice is cracking.
Stop apologizing.
All right.

763
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:27.840
Um,
anyway,
she goes and the uh,
blah blah blah blah blah.
If it weren't for us,

764
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:33.320
there would be no one to drill holes and to do all the other important jobs that

765
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:36.700
you mentioned.
All right?
If it weren't for you,

766
00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:39.490
what do you just fucking meditate and you make a person

767
00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.330
you self centered fucking whore.

768
00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.840
Can you believe she just took credit for the creation of babies?

769
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:52.990
100% credit.
What about the guy who fucking sticks it in Ya?

770
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:57.750
Huh?
Oh am getting close.
Aw.

771
00:47:58.060 --> 00:47:59.230
What about that part of it?

772
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.280
But there was his son Harry sweaty man

773
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.980
pounding away at your fucking womanhood to completion.

774
00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:16.660
I might add a number of times during the course of a month,
two months,

775
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:19.870
possibly three months if you got,
you know,

776
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.030
if he got some sort of issue down there for some reason your year there.
The,

777
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.620
I dunno what the fuck.
I never tried to do it,
but I know,
yeah,

778
00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:29.170
we're having a difficult time.
We're trying to get pregnant,

779
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:33.460
but we're having a difficult time.
It's not the fucking part.

780
00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:37.540
It's the impregnation part.
She's just totally taking away all of that.

781
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:41.590
That evidently did.
She just sits there and all of a sudden she's pregnant.

782
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:43.030
Kind of like dead chicken.

783
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:48.031
The Bible hanging out with that fucking hippie bomb,

784
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.920
Joseph.
Right?
He's sitting over in the corner with his vaporizer.

785
00:48:53.921 --> 00:48:58.120
Hey Man,
I noticed it looks like you're putting on weight,
man.

786
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.380
You gotta lay us off the Dirito if man.
Right.

787
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:06.760
And all of a sudden she's fucking pregnant.
So evidently this broad,

788
00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:11.620
she's taking full credit,
full credit for getting pregnant.

789
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:16.840
Completely ignoring the man's part of it.
Show up,
getting close.

790
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:19.540
Oh,
that's,

791
00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:26.130
that's the noise I make when I climb x.
By the way,
I make a,

792
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:30.190
I,
I announced to the female and a really high pitch voice,

793
00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.530
sort of whiny voice and getting close,

794
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:37.120
and then I put my mouth right next to her ear and I go,
oh,

795
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.950
that's how it goes down in my world.
Um,

796
00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.490
some of the most Sophomore Kuma humor I've ever done.

797
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.630
And right now there's a bunch of guys laughing and as a bunch of females with

798
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.150
their nose all wrinkled that this,
this is what you listen to.

799
00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:55.810
This is what you think is funny.
Yes,
bitch,
this is what I think's funny.

800
00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:59.980
Why don't you go back out in the kitchen and finish making potato salad?

801
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.590
All right.
The fourth of July's coming up.
Um,

802
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.240
I made no sense.
Okay.
Um,
and if it weren't for us,

803
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:10.990
there would be no one drilling holes into all the other important jobs that you

804
00:50:10.991 --> 00:50:13.210
mentioned.
I didn't say they were important.

805
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:18.970
I didn't say those jobs were important.
You didn't even listen to the bit.

806
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.800
Let me continue reading here.
I said,

807
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:25.900
Oprah said that being a mother is the most difficult job in the planet.

808
00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:29.150
If said,
it's the most important job,
I would've gone with her.

809
00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.690
But she said it was the most difficult job.
That's that right.

810
00:50:32.691 --> 00:50:36.530
There was the seed of the bit that I created.

811
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:40.610
Okay.
Just like you creating the fucking kid.

812
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.310
But I don't feel like I created the joke on my own.

813
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.220
It took Oprah to say to,
to,

814
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.890
to plant the seed rule by saying,

815
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:54.050
by saying that it was the most difficult job on the planet.

816
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.820
All right.
That was her climaxing into my joke.
Pussy.

817
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.670
Oh,
that's disgusting.
Anyways,

818
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:06.140
so now I think everybody's wrinkle in their nose.
So here we go.

819
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.490
So she continues after not even hearing what I'm saying and she said,

820
00:51:10.491 --> 00:51:14.210
and the reason you stay in your pajamas all day,
that was a line I said,

821
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:19.540
talking about women is because you don't have one minute to change.

822
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.870
Try taking a shower and putting on on clothes and clothes on with children's

823
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:30.950
screaming and crying at the shower door.
It's 24,
seven.

824
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.940
It never stops.
Uh,
you don't click a time card.

825
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:38.270
You never get off work.
It's 24,
seven.

826
00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:41.120
You have absolutely no idea until you're in it.

827
00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:45.020
I made a lot of money in my career before motherhood,
motherhood.

828
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:49.370
I earned my MBA and other degrees.
I've lived and worked abroad.

829
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:53.510
Motherhood is the hardest job I've ever done.
I've never said it's,

830
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:58.580
I've never said it's not the hardest job that you've ever done.
Okay.

831
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:00.561
All right.

832
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:04.130
But I'm willing to bet that you've never done a job harder than working on a

833
00:52:04.131 --> 00:52:08.560
fucking oil rig in the middle of the ocean.
All right,

834
00:52:08.561 --> 00:52:09.394
sweetheart,

835
00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.350
being a mom is not more difficult than working on an oil rig in the middle of

836
00:52:14.351 --> 00:52:15.250
the fucking ocean.

837
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.030
How about that guy out there who worked on one and it fucking blew up?

838
00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.270
He's got second degree burns on his back.

839
00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:25.600
If they're going to turn into third degree burns and then he's eventually going

840
00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:27.130
to explode into flames.

841
00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:32.250
So his only option is to jump basically the equivalent of a three story

842
00:52:32.261 --> 00:52:34.060
building.
He jumps off it

843
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.780
<v 5>okay</v>

844
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.100
<v 9>with his rob burned up back into the salt water of the ocean</v>

845
00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.310
also now covered in oil.

846
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:48.300
He's covered in oil with second degree burns in salt water.

847
00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.190
Okay.
He can barely fucking breathe.

848
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:56.450
The fucking ocean is catching on fire because of the oil that's on the surface

849
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:58.790
of the water.
He has to swim out of that,

850
00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.760
get out into the ocean but not get too far away.

851
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:07.300
Cause he wants to get rescued now he's got to sit there treading water,

852
00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.190
hoping he doesn't get eaten alive by sharks or drown

853
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.940
or die.
I Dunno what else.

854
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.790
While he waits for the Coast Guard to come and pick them up,

855
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:22.040
now you tell me all the mothers out there.

856
00:53:22.041 --> 00:53:25.380
I want you to explain to me a day that was more difficult than that.

857
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.701
And not only that,

858
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:29.760
all this woman is doing is talking about the negative aspects of being a mother.

859
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:31.890
She's not talking about how rewarding it is.

860
00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.580
You don't get unconditional love from a fucking oil rig.

861
00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:37.690
It's not going to be sitting there at your deathbed,

862
00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:42.710
holding your fucking hand telling you that you know the oil rig is everything it

863
00:53:42.811 --> 00:53:46.530
is today because of you as a person.
Give me a fucking break.

864
00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:48.450
All right?

865
00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:53.450
And also you made the choice to become a mother by letting that guy get on top

866
00:53:54.781 --> 00:53:57.690
of you.
Oh,
getting close,
right?

867
00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:04.350
Typical fucking broad.
You're fucking idea.
She got,
anyway,

868
00:54:04.351 --> 00:54:08.700
she continues.
Your joke is so offensive and so totally wrong.
It's disgusting.

869
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.060
Another thing,
this is precious time to me.
In the evening.
Well,

870
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:14.340
I didn't fucking ask you to email me.

871
00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:21.580
Good Lord.
What a fuck she,
this is a mother.
Look at her working with the guilt.

872
00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:23.950
This is precious time to me.

873
00:54:23.951 --> 00:54:28.300
In the evening you are watching a stand up special that was going to take a

874
00:54:28.301 --> 00:54:33.120
whole fucking hour.
You shut it off.

875
00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:34.440
Seven minutes into it.

876
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.100
That gives you an extra 53 minutes to write two paragraphs.

877
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:43.490
They're so full of shit.
So anyways,

878
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.360
it's now she's trying to make me feel guilty like I'm taken away from her

879
00:54:47.361 --> 00:54:48.800
fucking day.
I know the thing.

880
00:54:48.801 --> 00:54:51.920
This is precious time to me in the evening when I can be taking a shower,

881
00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:56.210
read or watch a show and recharge for the next day.

882
00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.320
Wait a minute.

883
00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:01.790
You just told me that being a mom was a 24 seven job.

884
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:06.840
It never stops.
It never ends.
Here you are chilling out,

885
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:08.670
wanting to take a shower,

886
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:13.260
read or watch a show and recharge for the next day.

887
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:18.800
Jesus Christ.
She goes,
oh,
maybe later tonight when one of my children get up,

888
00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.990
I'm not on Facebook.

889
00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:25.340
I don't waste any time on the computer and I don't complain about things,

890
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:29.600
but this was so offensive that I made time for this email.
I'll thank you.

891
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:31.550
Thank you for taking time out of your day.

892
00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:37.480
You're unbelievably 24 seven day and you just had to say something then this is,

893
00:55:37.641 --> 00:55:42.170
this is awesome.
She,
this is how she answered email.
She says,
very disappointed,

894
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.820
Jamie.
Oh,
actually I never named names.
Okay,
so this is what I love about this.

895
00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:52.890
This woman is obviously going to be a great mom,
okay?
She's dedicated to what?

896
00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:56.810
She's walked away from her Mba career and all that type of shit so she can focus

897
00:55:56.811 --> 00:55:58.310
on her career.
Okay?

898
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.240
But what you can see here is the resentment that's already building because

899
00:56:02.241 --> 00:56:06.320
she's already throwing out guilt onto everybody.

900
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:11.030
That's what I love about mothers.
All right?
No one told you to become a mother.

901
00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:16.060
You made that fucking choice and now you actually have like resentment for your

902
00:56:16.881 --> 00:56:20.270
fucking job and you're starting to put it on your kids.

903
00:56:20.271 --> 00:56:23.500
I can tell you're already putting it on your kids because you're trying to it on

904
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:24.040
me.

905
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.790
You try to make me feel guilty that you took the time to send me a fucking I

906
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:29.111
email.

907
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:32.230
I didn't ask you to send me your fucking email and then you end it with very

908
00:56:32.231 --> 00:56:34.810
disappointed like I'm looking for your approval.

909
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:38.710
See you're already getting your God complex cause your fucking kids are looking

910
00:56:38.711 --> 00:56:43.300
at you like you know every God damn answer on the planet,
which you don't.

911
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:49.270
Jesus Christ.
So there they,
there you go.

912
00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.300
There you go.
People,
there it is in a nutshell.

913
00:56:52.301 --> 00:56:56.050
That's what it's like to be a standup comedian.
You make one fucking joke.

914
00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:01.330
Okay.
About an overstatement that someone said that being a mother's the most

915
00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:04.360
difficult job on the planet.
So what does that,

916
00:57:04.361 --> 00:57:07.240
that makes me think about all these other jobs digging for coal.

917
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.530
You now being president of the United States and having this haven't decide that

918
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:13.930
we're going to go to war and then you've got to lay to bed,

919
00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:18.490
go lay in bed knowing that a bunch of people are now going to die.
Babies,

920
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:19.930
women,
you know,

921
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:24.800
18 to 21 year old fucking people who signed up right out,
out,
out,
out,
out,

922
00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:28.520
out a God damn high school to be in the army,
marines,
Navy.
You've got it.

923
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:30.070
You're gonna make that.
You've got to lay in bed,

924
00:57:30.071 --> 00:57:32.920
try and get fucking eight hours sleep with that shit weighing on your head.

925
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.900
You know
that that was a joke.

926
00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:39.760
It's not the most difficult job in the planet.

927
00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:42.740
If you said it's the most important,
I would've gone with that.
All right?

928
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.870
I said I was arguing that it wasn't the most difficult.
Okay?

929
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:49.270
And this is what happens.
People,
they don't hear what you're saying.

930
00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.190
And then they go off on another 10 tangent.
Like this other fucking cunt.

931
00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.680
This is a guy.
All right,
this guy,
what the fuck did he talk?

932
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:05.680
Where the hell is it?
Ah,
Jesus.
Bill.
Uh,
Jesus,
look what you did.

933
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:10.570
You just slowed the whole fucking thing down.
Um,
oh,

934
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.540
I disagree.
He said bill loved the podcast,

935
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:16.480
but I disagree with you on the whole music downloading thing.

936
00:58:16.690 --> 00:58:21.310
Most of my music that I have that I have is not bought for good reason.

937
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:22.301
First of all,

938
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:27.301
the last two CD's I bought brand new from the store is skipped in multiple CD

939
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:30.790
players right out of the box.
Secondly,

940
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.380
artists only get about five to 10% five to 10 cents per CD,

941
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:36.970
which in the grand scheme of things,

942
00:58:36.971 --> 00:58:41.920
doesn't add up to much compared to the money they get from tee shirts and gigs.

943
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.420
Now,
don't get me wrong,

944
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.590
the people that just download thousands of CD's worth of stuff and never go to

945
00:58:47.591 --> 00:58:49.900
shows there.
The douche bags,

946
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:54.220
I tried to go to at least five shows a year.
Wow.

947
00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:57.370
And I go to Lollapalooza in Chicago once every three years.

948
00:58:57.371 --> 00:59:00.700
So Am I a to you built?
No,
you're not a loser.

949
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:03.190
You're just stealing music.

950
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:09.070
You're stealing fucking music and you're trying to shine it all up.
Like,
Hey man,

951
00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.930
the artist doesn't make any fucking money.

952
00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.980
You bought two cds from the store and they skipped in multiple places.
Dude,

953
00:59:15.310 --> 00:59:20.050
you can go to iTunes and you can download music in a digital form and that

954
00:59:20.051 --> 00:59:21.590
doesn't skip all right.

955
00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:26.120
You're trying to justify the fact that you still thousands and thousands of

956
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:28.550
dollars worth of fucking music.
And then you spent,
you know,

957
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.900
a couple hundred bucks

958
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:36.140
on concert tickets and tee shirts and shit.
And then,
and there you go.

959
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:37.550
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

960
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:40.790
<v 9>I didn't steal a hundred percent for you.
I completely disagree with you.</v>

961
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.130
I'm not saying you're a loser.
I'm saying you're a thief.

962
00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:46.900
You're stealing and you know you're stealing.
All right.

963
00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:51.040
I'm not a musician do it.
I bought cds.
I bought those things.

964
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:54.250
I know they start to skip,
but if I buy,
am I fucking upload them onto my,

965
00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:59.170
my computer.
But I,
I do all of my shit through iTunes.
But,
uh,
I don't,

966
00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:03.040
I don't steal music.
And when I did steal it,

967
01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:05.380
I addressed the fact that I was stealing music.

968
01:00:05.381 --> 01:00:07.810
I wasn't saying that I wasn't part of the fucking problem.

969
01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:10.570
Back in the day when it first came out,

970
01:00:10.571 --> 01:00:13.990
my eyes fucking dropped out of my head to free music.

971
01:00:13.991 --> 01:00:17.530
And I went to limewire and I downloaded a couple of hundred fucking songs.

972
01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:21.190
But in the end when people presented the argument,
dude,
just stay [inaudible].

973
01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:25.270
I couldn't get around it.
I was like,
yeah,
you're right.
I am.
So I stopped.

974
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:28.630
So I'm not saying I'm better than you and I'm not saying you're a fucking loser.

975
01:00:28.631 --> 01:00:30.790
What I'm saying is your steel at fucking music,

976
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.180
however you frame it and go into a couple of concerts,

977
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:39.100
doesn't make up for the fact that you stole the music.
You know,

978
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.350
it's like concert tickets cost money.

979
01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:45.830
It's like a concert ticket was free and you made a donation.

980
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.900
You still got something out of your money,

981
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.860
you got a tee shirt and you got a fucking concert tickets.
So you're,

982
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:55.400
you're acting like those monies make up for the fact that you stole music.

983
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.470
Like you didn't get anything out of the,
out of,

984
01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.680
out of the concert ticket and putting down money for a t shirt.

985
01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:03.260
You got to fucking rock show or hip hop show,

986
01:01:03.261 --> 01:01:07.620
whatever the fuck you went to and you got a t shirt that doesn't make up for the

987
01:01:07.621 --> 01:01:12.090
fact that you stole the fucking music.
It doesn't.
All right.
So like I said,

988
01:01:12.091 --> 01:01:15.270
I'm not saying you were losing your fucking thief.
Oh,

989
01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:18.060
I'm on my God damn high horse here.
Um,

990
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.560
let's get to underrated overrated here.
People,
uh,

991
01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:26.310
a topic that I thought was dying that I'm actually pleased to say is a,

992
01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:30.900
is making a comeback.
Oh,
before I do that,
I mentioned a few weeks ago that,

993
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.910
um,
the short film cheat that me,
Joe de Rosa and Robert Kelly,

994
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:42.090
uh,
wrote and acted in and Joe de Rosa did a phenomenal job directing this movie,

995
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:45.450
the short film.
We got it into the Tribeca film festival,

996
01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.790
which is one of the biggest film festivals out there.

997
01:01:47.791 --> 01:01:51.420
It's right up there with Sundance and all that type of stuff.
Um,

998
01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.300
and I wanted to give you guys to screening times.
If you're actually in the,

999
01:01:58.290 --> 01:02:01.440
uh,
New York area and you want to come down and support our film,

1000
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:05.030
we would love to see you down there.
We're going to try to hang out as,
as,

1001
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.440
as many screenings as we possibly can.

1002
01:02:07.441 --> 01:02:10.860
There's a couple of them that we're not allowed to go to just because this is

1003
01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:14.430
going to be industry there and they want to review the film and you know,

1004
01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:16.800
we can't be breathing down their necks,
making them uncomfortable.

1005
01:02:16.801 --> 01:02:20.220
So here are the screening times,
uh,
Saturday,

1006
01:02:20.221 --> 01:02:25.110
April 23rd at 7:00 PM is the first screening.

1007
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:28.590
Of course,
I don't have where the screening,
I'm such a fucking idiot.

1008
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.300
I'll give you this information.
I'll just tell you one of the,

1009
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.960
this Saturday at 7:00 PM Wednesday at 5:30 PM,

1010
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:41.130
that's April 27th and Saturday,

1011
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:46.131
April 30th at 4:00 PM and Sunday May 1st at 7:30 PM.

1012
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.690
Um,
I believe I'm calling in the opiod Anthony show this week,

1013
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.930
I believe Thursday this week,
uh,

1014
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:57.960
to Rosa and Bobby Kelly are going to be on there and we're going to have all the

1015
01:02:57.961 --> 01:03:00.750
rest of the information.
So I'm,
I what an idiot I am.

1016
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.940
Why am I such a fucking moron?
You know,
I'd go to the MM podcast.com we'll it,

1017
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:08.880
we'll have the actual,
the official fan page,
by the way.

1018
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.000
And he gets all the shit right.
I'm such a fucking more,

1019
01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:15.330
I was so excited to tell you guys all that type of shit.
And what did I do?

1020
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.330
What did I do?
I fucked the whole thing up.

1021
01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.493
<v 5>All right.</v>

1022
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:23.570
<v 9>You feel that?
Do you hear that silence?</v>

1023
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:27.830
The podcast has just screeched to a grinding halt and it's 100% my fault.

1024
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.100
Alright.
Underrated.
Overrated for this week.
All right.
Underrated.

1025
01:03:31.101 --> 01:03:34.190
This guy says ice cream sandwiches.
Uh,

1026
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:37.730
they are made from the cheapest ice cream and the crappiest cookies,

1027
01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:41.900
but they are fucking delicious and I can eat like five.
Um,

1028
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.910
I actually had a debate with Nia on this one.

1029
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:46.263
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1030
01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.480
<v 9>I thought he was literally talking about ice cream sandwiches,</v>

1031
01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:50.100
but she's saying because he said cookies.

1032
01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:54.150
He means those ones that have like the chocolate chip cookies and with that jet,

1033
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:57.780
that generic ice cream in the middle,
it's basically,
you know,

1034
01:03:57.781 --> 01:04:00.840
the filling that they put in hot dogs.
It's the ice cream version of that.

1035
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:05.490
And he said he can eat like five and a,
I am right there with Ya.

1036
01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.670
I'm right there with you.
I think I could eat,
I think I could eat six,

1037
01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:09.540
but I would get sick,

1038
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.860
but I could eat five just like you and I would not be sick and my body at no

1039
01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:18.290
point would be acting like what I was doing was incorrect until about,
uh,

1040
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.230
15 minutes later when I suddenly would have to take a nap.

1041
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.460
You eat really bad food and you have to take a nap.
Um,

1042
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.650
you get all sleepy or as black people call it the Itis,
you get the itis.

1043
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.490
I told you that story a long time ago,
didn't I?
I'll tell the tea again.

1044
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.730
The fuck I got an hour to kill here.
I know I got some new listeners.
Um,

1045
01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:46.530
I,
back in the day when I was on the,
uh,
the Chappelle show tour and it was me,

1046
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.330
Charlie Murphy and uh,
Don Rawlings who played ashy Larry,

1047
01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.970
we went out in 2004,
mid 2004 and toured.
I toured,

1048
01:04:56.010 --> 01:05:00.800
I stayed on the tour till about the end of February,
2005.
And,
uh,

1049
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:03.270
these guys used to break my balls about my shirts,

1050
01:05:03.271 --> 01:05:05.100
all my clothes and all that type of shit.

1051
01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.850
That actually turned into a bit when I did my half hour special,
that whole bit,

1052
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:09.150
that Ma,

1053
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:12.720
this motherfucker only has five shirts that came from hanging out with those

1054
01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:15.660
guys doing talent shows back in the day.

1055
01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:21.400
Drew Frazier and all those guys,
Rob Stapleton.
Uh,
well the room did,

1056
01:05:21.401 --> 01:05:22.870
I used to do Capone's roams,

1057
01:05:22.871 --> 01:05:26.140
all those things when I used to jump back and forth between the black rooms,

1058
01:05:26.141 --> 01:05:28.990
white rooms for mainstream rooms,
that uptown rooms as they used to call him.

1059
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:33.520
But anyways,
so these guys used to,
you know,
thanks,

1060
01:05:33.610 --> 01:05:35.140
you just give me shit and that type of stuff.

1061
01:05:35.141 --> 01:05:38.020
So we had gone out drinking or I had gone out drinking.

1062
01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:41.950
I was brutally fucking hung over and I just didn't want to listen to this shit.

1063
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:47.250
And we were driving from Chicago up to Vernon hills to do a,

1064
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:50.170
the Zane,
he's up there and it was a good hour,
hour and a half drive.

1065
01:05:50.171 --> 01:05:52.390
I don't know what,
but it's going to seem like five hours.

1066
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.260
And I could tell that they were just going to be fucking on my shit because I

1067
01:05:56.261 --> 01:06:00.980
was really hung over.
So what I did was I asked the,

1068
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.670
I don't know,
somehow I came,

1069
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:06.670
I walked out to try and get some fresh air and I saw that there was a Popeye's

1070
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:09.160
chicken,
like fucking two blocks up.

1071
01:06:09.161 --> 01:06:12.940
So I ran up there and got like a fucking,
I don't know,

1072
01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:17.050
a 17 piece of that shit with biscuits and all of that ship.

1073
01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:22.390
We will leave and right around 11 and we go and we get in the fucking limo to go

1074
01:06:22.391 --> 01:06:23.560
up there and I bring,
hey guys,

1075
01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:28.570
they got us some food and I ate one piece and watch them devour like another

1076
01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:30.910
five,
six pieces,
a couple of biscuits.
Right?

1077
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:35.920
And they were already giving me Shit and within fucking 15 minutes they were

1078
01:06:35.921 --> 01:06:37.270
fucking sound asleep.

1079
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:45.910
And I just sat there with a smile on my face with some of that greasy food,

1080
01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:49.400
my stomach,
but not enough to make me fall asleep.
Just enough to feel comfort,

1081
01:06:49.610 --> 01:06:53.160
comfort it.
Right.
And I had my sunglasses on and I cruised,

1082
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:55.990
although we cruise all the way up there and they slept the whole fucking way.

1083
01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.730
It's one of the brilliant moves and my standup career.
Um,

1084
01:07:00.731 --> 01:07:02.890
so anyways,
I'll speak into that shit.

1085
01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.110
I'm actually get myself into great shape here.

1086
01:07:05.830 --> 01:07:08.500
You want to know how I've been doing it?
Well,
I don't give a fuck.

1087
01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:10.930
I'm going to tell you anyway.
A A,

1088
01:07:10.931 --> 01:07:15.190
I mentioned back in the day I got a juicer and uh,
like most things,
you know,

1089
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:20.260
when you get something new,
you're all about it.
You're all about it for like,

1090
01:07:20.261 --> 01:07:23.620
I don't know what,
right.
A week,
two weeks,
maybe a month.

1091
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.590
And then one day you just blow it off.

1092
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:30.520
You just fucking blow it off and then it starts gathering dust.

1093
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:31.830
And then every once in awhile you,

1094
01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:36.220
you just look at whatever you bought your Ipad,
your fucking,

1095
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:37.420
I don't know what your,

1096
01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.660
whatever gadget you're hand is just over there collecting dust and you just had

1097
01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:44.170
that feeling like,
God,
I used to be so fucking into that thing.
You know,

1098
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:48.790
it's kind of like a relationship.
You know,
you meet some hot girl,

1099
01:07:48.791 --> 01:07:52.550
you're telling your friends do this is fucking cigs I've ever been with you.

1100
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.830
She's got like the perfect hits you ever do that you start describing a body to

1101
01:07:56.831 --> 01:08:01.350
all your fucking animal guy friends and then all of a sudden it turns into our

1102
01:08:01.351 --> 01:08:05.230
relationship,
you know?
And now it's your girlfriend and now you know,

1103
01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:09.760
I described the text to my friends or the fucking crazy thing,

1104
01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:14.590
she didn't bed,
you know?
And then what happens?
You're totally into,

1105
01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:19.070
or your bank in your bag and your bag in and then just one day you don't even

1106
01:08:19.071 --> 01:08:23.650
notice,
you're just not into it anymore.
Yeah.
Oh,

1107
01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.050
and then one day you're walking by and you look down at your pussy just

1108
01:08:27.051 --> 01:08:27.831
gathering dust,

1109
01:08:27.831 --> 01:08:32.420
like you fucking laser disc player and you're wondering what the fuck happened.

1110
01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:34.171
You know?

1111
01:08:34.171 --> 01:08:36.900
And that's the moment where you realize if you're with the right person or not.

1112
01:08:36.901 --> 01:08:40.890
Because if you decide that you're going to work at the relationship and get the

1113
01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:42.870
sparks going again,
you're with the right person.

1114
01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:48.680
But if you're just looking at it like a fucking old VCR.
Yeah,
no,
it's a,

1115
01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:52.050
it's time to move on.
That's what I think.
So anyways,

1116
01:08:52.051 --> 01:08:54.660
let's get back to the juicer.
Everybody.
So the Josar

1117
01:08:56.190 --> 01:09:01.190
evidently is a my fucking gadgets soulmate because I looked at it and I was

1118
01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:04.050
getting sad going,
you know what?
Like I got a fucking,
uh,

1119
01:09:04.051 --> 01:09:06.610
I got to get this thing back in my life.
I've got to find where,
where,

1120
01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:10.870
where did we lose the magic?
So I went to the health foods

1121
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:15.510
and I went in there like a little fucking,
you know,

1122
01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:21.440
Vegan.
I fucking go in there,
right?
Oh,
you know what's funny,
this,

1123
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.730
this displace right around the corner from where I live,

1124
01:09:24.480 --> 01:09:29.480
cells that coconut water that I absolutely love that I drank on Joe Rogan's show

1125
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:36.090
and that they told me they got on amazon.com and I ordered it on amazon.com you

1126
01:09:36.091 --> 01:09:39.170
know me,
I'm totally fucking,
I got the OCD like,
or whatever.
I,

1127
01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.020
when I get into shit,

1128
01:09:40.021 --> 01:09:44.670
I get into shit and it was like 20 something bucks to get like,

1129
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:50.300
like 12 of these things.
So it was already expensive.
And then you know,

1130
01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:53.850
if,
if you know,
you just do five to six business days,
who gives a fuck?

1131
01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:56.850
They charge you like three bucks.
But I was like,
no,
I want that shit in two days.

1132
01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:02.360
So my shipping cost was as much as the goddamn price of the coconut.

1133
01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:06.870
I paid like 40 bucks for 12 of them and then I go down the street went out when

1134
01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:09.690
I reintroduced myself to my juicer going,
hey baby,
let's,

1135
01:10:09.691 --> 01:10:14.460
you know what happened to us,
man.
Let's watch a movie tonight,
right?

1136
01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:18.820
I go over to the fucking a vegetable place.
Oh,
you know what?

1137
01:10:18.821 --> 01:10:22.150
That creepy little analogy just reminded me of I guess to some fucking show out

1138
01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.850
there where people are in love with inanimate objects,

1139
01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:30.300
like they actually like fuck offense or a bridge or they want to like marry the

1140
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:33.080
Eiffel Tower.
Can somebody please tell me what that show is?
I,

1141
01:10:33.081 --> 01:10:37.210
I really want to watch that because I saw that one that was fatal,

1142
01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:42.540
fatal attractions where people have wild animals that they try to turn to try to

1143
01:10:43.931 --> 01:10:45.280
turn into a,

1144
01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:52.690
they tried to turn into pets and those people were just so fucking stupid of me

1145
01:10:52.691 --> 01:10:53.800
that I couldn't watch the show.

1146
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:55.960
But I ended up hearing that that show was good because they get,

1147
01:10:56.410 --> 01:11:00.310
they get into the psychology of,
of why somebody gets into that.

1148
01:11:00.311 --> 01:11:04.330
All I saw when I saw that guy with the buffalo walking around his house and

1149
01:11:04.331 --> 01:11:09.010
every time he walked by him that buffalo would slam him into the wall and he

1150
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:14.210
looked like Wayne Gretzky getting fucking checked by sort of fucking normal size

1151
01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:16.690
hockey player and you'd just be like,
oh,

1152
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.370
is he would walk by now she just play and she just playing and shit.

1153
01:11:20.371 --> 01:11:23.580
It was so fucking stupid.
I,
I couldn't watch it.
So,
um,

1154
01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.220
anybody can tell me what the name of that show is,

1155
01:11:26.221 --> 01:11:31.110
where people are like in love with like a door,
you know,
dude,

1156
01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:36.060
how much alone time are you spending?
I mean,
I haven't heard that in jail.

1157
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:42.210
Well,
he in solitary confinement,
you get love with the walls.
I bet you do.

1158
01:11:42.211 --> 01:11:44.580
At some point,
some point you just,

1159
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.550
you just from just lack of human contact,

1160
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:52.950
you know that man brain kicks in where you get visually stimulated,

1161
01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:56.730
you've got to get visually stimulated by something and they would just be like,

1162
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:02.100
I bet it's like at some point during the day when the sun starts going down

1163
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:07.650
right in the shadow just hits the wall a certain way and he just,

1164
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:11.430
there you are.
There you are.
You sweet little naughty,

1165
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:15.840
naughty piece of plaster.
Ah,

1166
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.470
where you been for the last 23 hours?
I should,
I don't want to hear it.
You know,

1167
01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.180
so fucking creepy.
Actually.

1168
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:27.210
Somebody who's probably in jail or has been a jail is going to be oh man.

1169
01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:31.050
Actually when you're in solitary confinement there's no sunlight.
Ah,
right.

1170
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:34.740
Whatever.
Whatever the fuck it is.
You fuck the floor,

1171
01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:38.640
you know,
there you go.
Is that any prison book?

1172
01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:42.210
I think I hit my low point when I was consistently fucking the floor.

1173
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:46.280
Um,
all right,
let's continue on here.
So anyways,

1174
01:12:46.281 --> 01:12:47.700
so I've got my juicer back in my life.

1175
01:12:47.701 --> 01:12:48.840
That's what the fuck I'm trying to tell you.

1176
01:12:48.841 --> 01:12:50.790
So I go to the Goddamn health food store,
right?

1177
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:53.940
And you don't have to worry about going to the health food stores,

1178
01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:57.780
even though the aisles are really skinny,
much skinnier.
Then one of the,
uh,

1179
01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:00.300
grocery stores,
those fucking,
you know,

1180
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:04.560
people who actually eat healthy or are there just waif human beings.

1181
01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:08.190
They do yoga,
little wispy Lily,
lily knows dogs little whippets.

1182
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.600
They just like them,
you know,

1183
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:11.640
walking up and down the aisles with their fucking tail,

1184
01:13:11.641 --> 01:13:13.590
between their legs trying to pick out Zucchini.

1185
01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:18.890
So I'm going in there right suddenly feeling like I'm on roids cause I look so

1186
01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:22.620
much bigger app full of Shit.
There was a couple of decent size people in there,

1187
01:13:22.621 --> 01:13:25.470
but whatever.
So I go in there,
I pick out all this fucking,
uh,

1188
01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.710
fruits and vegetables to juice.
So that's,
I've been starting my day.

1189
01:13:28.711 --> 01:13:33.480
People start my day,
I fucking juice.

1190
01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:37.890
Then I go get my fucking pit bull.
We go for a walk,

1191
01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:40.530
we go for a hike for like an hour.

1192
01:13:40.531 --> 01:13:43.350
I come back and then I have a bowl of oatmeal with some,

1193
01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:46.020
a handful of raisins thrown in there.
That's how I start my day.

1194
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:50.010
And it's been fucking great for me.
I'm not trying to preach to you people,

1195
01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.800
I'm not trying to be a fucking breakfast Nazi here.

1196
01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.050
But this is what I realized with me.
This is how I get out of whack,

1197
01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.640
is if I start my day either with,
um,

1198
01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:04.530
I can't even just say toast and eggs,
but if I,
if I throw the Bacon in there,

1199
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.240
then it's really extra salty.
Then I got to throw a little jam on my toast,

1200
01:14:09.241 --> 01:14:10.890
you know,
to try to level myself,

1201
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:14.890
just like a fucking cocaine drinking alcohol to bring me down a little bit.

1202
01:14:15.370 --> 01:14:18.160
You know,
I got the salt salt's making me sleepy,

1203
01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:21.220
so I put the jelly on the toast to bring me back up right there.

1204
01:14:21.221 --> 01:14:22.210
I'm out of fucking whack.

1205
01:14:22.330 --> 01:14:25.260
Or if I have French toast or anything you put syrup on there,

1206
01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:27.550
my sugar goes through the roof.
Next thing you know,

1207
01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:31.600
I'm grabbing a handful of fucking potato chips,
you know,

1208
01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:34.660
like an hour later.
And then like for the rest of the day,
my blood sugar,

1209
01:14:34.661 --> 01:14:38.170
I don't know what it is.
It probably looks like a,
uh,
what do you got?
One of the,

1210
01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:42.730
one of those things where there Duh,
Duh,
Duh,
Duh.
The heart thing,
Sonogram,

1211
01:14:42.731 --> 01:14:45.460
whatever the fuck you call it.
Not a telegraph.

1212
01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.740
What do you call that fucking thing?
You know when,
when,
when you're,

1213
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:49.420
when you're laying there in the hospital

1214
01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:52.870
and there they are looking at your heart rate.
That's what,

1215
01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:54.790
that's what it looks like.
Salt,
sugar,
salt,
sugar.

1216
01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:57.580
That's what I do for the rest of the fucking day.
And then at the end of the day,

1217
01:14:57.581 --> 01:15:00.610
I take a big piece of cake and I shove it right down my fucking pie hole.

1218
01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:01.444
And that's my day.

1219
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:07.170
And then gradually my white doughy stomach starts to hang over my belt and then

1220
01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:10.660
I hate myself and then I start lashing out of people in the crowd.

1221
01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:16.480
So there you go.
That's what's been working for me.

1222
01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:20.830
Um,
so when and why don't you guys give it a shot if you want to,
if you don't,

1223
01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:24.610
I don't give a fuck.
Oh by the way,
hundred and 70 days without booze.

1224
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:26.770
And I actually fucked it up yesterday.

1225
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:32.490
I was at a party or a barbecue yesterday and I accidentally twice had two sips

1226
01:15:33.341 --> 01:15:37.570
of beer.
Okay.
So tactically in my world,

1227
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:41.200
my streak is still going because it was an accident.
But I,
I've,

1228
01:15:41.530 --> 01:15:45.700
I've had booze within the last 24 hours and this is,
this is what I've noticed,

1229
01:15:45.701 --> 01:15:48.460
which is really fascinating about the human brain.

1230
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.610
And I didn't realize this till I went to Stockholm,
Sweden,

1231
01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.530
when I did that Gig over there,

1232
01:15:53.531 --> 01:15:56.950
remember I told you that story and I went over there and everybody,
you know,

1233
01:15:56.951 --> 01:15:58.240
and I forgot that,
you know,

1234
01:15:58.241 --> 01:16:03.241
I didn't speak a word of Swedish and everyone's gone tries and tries and cars

1235
01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:05.650
your hydrogen.
And I was,
you know,
the fucking,

1236
01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.550
the comedian in front of me who was speaking English backstage went out there

1237
01:16:09.551 --> 01:16:11.680
and did his whole act and Swedish and was killing

1238
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:17.280
[inaudible] Rjr RJ to hygiene and the crowds like,
wow.

1239
01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:20.110
And I'm freaking out going,
are they even going to fucking understand me?

1240
01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.200
This is what I learned when I was in Sweden was I took for granted how much I

1241
01:16:26.261 --> 01:16:30.940
don't read when I'm in the states because I you just like,

1242
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.150
I think when you look at a stop sign you don't read stop,
you just,

1243
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:38.590
you just visually looking at it and I didn't realize that shit until I went over

1244
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:42.910
to Sweden and the amount of extra thinking that I had to do where I would be

1245
01:16:42.911 --> 01:16:46.480
looking at like a car and just be like,
okay,

1246
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:49.760
is that a taxi or is that a police car?
You know?
Or I,

1247
01:16:49.761 --> 01:16:52.570
I'd have to look at a storefront and just sort of try to,

1248
01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:58.330
cause I can't read the word,
it's in Swedish and it's like 97 fucking letters.

1249
01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:03.130
I'd have to just really sit there looking as a close.
Is there,

1250
01:17:03.131 --> 01:17:07.690
is there food in there?
Is that,
what the fuck is that?
That's what happened to me

1251
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:10.103
at the party.

1252
01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:15.410
I opened the refrigerator door and I saw this green can and I immediately

1253
01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:20.850
equated it with soda and I,
and in my brain told me it was a sprite,

1254
01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:25.860
turned out it was seven up and right next to it was a red and white can.

1255
01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:30.750
So I think,
I actually think it was just red.
So in my world that was coke.

1256
01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.480
So I reached for the coke,
opened it up,

1257
01:17:33.481 --> 01:17:38.481
took a sip of it thinking I was drinking coca cola and it was a Mexican beer and

1258
01:17:39.181 --> 01:17:41.580
I drank it and I didn't even record.
I don't know,
it was a weird tasting beer.

1259
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:45.780
I thought it was like iced tea.
And I looked down and I'm reading it,
you know,

1260
01:17:45.781 --> 01:17:49.550
and I actually,
I'm just looking for coke and I'm looking all over the words.

1261
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:53.580
And finally I see beer.
I'm like,
is this,
did I just drink a beer?
I was like,
fuck,

1262
01:17:53.581 --> 01:17:56.610
there goes my goddamn streak.
So of course he is laughing at me.

1263
01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:01.620
So then I go over and grab what I thought was a sprite was actually seven up.

1264
01:18:01.621 --> 01:18:04.760
I started drinking that and then later on the piano at the party,

1265
01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.590
you grabbed the wrong thing.
Once again,
I thought I was drinking coke

1266
01:18:09.090 --> 01:18:10.920
and I reached over and I grabbed it and another thing,

1267
01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.370
now the fucking swig of beer.
So I want you guys to know is my streak over,

1268
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:19.520
you know all you addicts out there.
What does that mean?
If you,
if you do that,

1269
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.870
if you're an AA,

1270
01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:25.250
do you have to turn in your chip and start all over again and go up there and

1271
01:18:25.251 --> 01:18:28.040
cry at the podium because you actually had a sip of beer?

1272
01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:31.610
Do I get any credit with the fact that I,
that I opened the bear,

1273
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:35.450
took the sip of the bear and just said,
oh fuck,
this is,
you know,

1274
01:18:35.451 --> 01:18:37.400
I thought this was coke.
It's a bear and I just set it down.

1275
01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:41.300
I didn't have any more anybody,
can you help me out here?

1276
01:18:41.301 --> 01:18:42.710
This is when I wish I took callers.

1277
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.740
I'm glad I don't take college because I think college really slowed down the

1278
01:18:45.741 --> 01:18:47.450
fucking show.
You know,

1279
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:52.310
half of them are fucking prank phone calls and then half the people,

1280
01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:56.480
it just takes them too.
God Damn Long.
Plus I like talking.
All right.

1281
01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:00.680
You haven't noticed the fact that I rarely have a guest on this show and I could

1282
01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:04.070
somehow keep it going for a fucking hour.
You know,

1283
01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:10.260
that's not an amazing ability.
That's,
that is an incredible personality.
Fluff.

1284
01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.120
All right.
Um,
more um,
underrated.
Overrated.

1285
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:18.300
A unpaid internships.
Overrated.

1286
01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:22.710
I graduated from college less than a year ago and had been looking for a job in

1287
01:19:22.711 --> 01:19:27.280
my area of studies for more than a year with no success.
Dude.
I,

1288
01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.420
my heart goes out to these fucking kids just getting out to out of college right

1289
01:19:30.421 --> 01:19:34.230
now in the,
one of the worst economies ever.
It's just fucking ridiculous.

1290
01:19:34.231 --> 01:19:38.920
They already overcharged your for your fucking education and these goddamn

1291
01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:43.590
bankers screwed the whole fucking economy up.
Anyways,
plumbing ahead.
He says,

1292
01:19:43.591 --> 01:19:48.510
while looking for a job,
I encountered numerous agencies that offer internships,

1293
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:53.460
but no,
but none for PE it seems.

1294
01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:56.220
How is that legal by the way?
You don't pay him anything.

1295
01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.930
It seems like many places.

1296
01:19:57.931 --> 01:20:01.680
Take advantages of the bad economy and the desperate job seekers to lure them

1297
01:20:01.681 --> 01:20:05.670
into doing work for free.
Unfortunately,
I'm one of them.
Dude.

1298
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:08.750
What kind of a fucking,
this is what,
you know,

1299
01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:11.530
I want to go undercover into corporate America and I want it.

1300
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:16.380
I want to see how that goes down.
How that,
how,

1301
01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.120
like is it just like the mob we like age,
not fucking personal,

1302
01:20:21.121 --> 01:20:23.280
it's business.
Oh,

1303
01:20:24.910 --> 01:20:25.743
<v 5>you know.</v>

1304
01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.080
<v 9>Well,
if you,
if you check out the market,
what the market will bear now is,
uh,</v>

1305
01:20:30.570 --> 01:20:35.030
it's advantageous if you're the employer to not,
uh,

1306
01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:40.300
to take advantage of the human resources and offer them a,

1307
01:20:42.321 --> 01:20:47.321
a negative cashflow contract.

1308
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:50.030
However they fucking deal.
They never just come out and said,
hey,

1309
01:20:50.031 --> 01:20:54.470
let's take advantage of the future and pay them absolutely nothing.

1310
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:59.810
So we can,
we can drive,
we can put rims on our,
our,
our flashy fucking cars.

1311
01:21:00.650 --> 01:21:02.060
Um,
anyways,
he says,
uh,

1312
01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:06.560
what do these agencies offer in exchange experience?

1313
01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:09.620
Building your resume,
making connections with other employees,

1314
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.210
promises of hiring after a short period and other bullshit like that.

1315
01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:18.830
He says,
fuck that.
And capital letters you mentioned in Joe Rogan's podcast,

1316
01:21:18.831 --> 01:21:23.831
how comedians should not offer their material for free in exchange for exposure.

1317
01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.460
And I completely agree.

1318
01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.900
These unpaid internships that are so popular right now need to stop.

1319
01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:35.210
I'm more efficient than some of my fulltime coworkers at my internships,

1320
01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.500
which are not a surprise.
Oh wait,

1321
01:21:39.501 --> 01:21:43.610
which are not a surprise,
are part of a worker's Union.

1322
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:47.690
And I work,
AH,
here comes my bed reading skills.

1323
01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.940
I got totally confused with his parentheses.

1324
01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.180
<v 5>MMM.</v>

1325
01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:55.540
<v 9>He says,
and I worked there only two days out of the week.</v>

1326
01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:00.740
It wasn't funny.
It would be sad.
So he's basically saying in those two days,

1327
01:22:00.741 --> 01:22:03.530
he does more work than the people who are members of the union.
You know,

1328
01:22:03.531 --> 01:22:08.531
that's something that unions have to address here is I'm all about unions.

1329
01:22:08.631 --> 01:22:09.470
But you know,

1330
01:22:09.471 --> 01:22:13.820
just because you now have the power to lean on a shovel doesn't mean you should.

1331
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:16.100
And that's what's really fucked over.
Unions.

1332
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:20.750
Unions were a great idea and people died,
had their heads kicked in,

1333
01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.270
got shot at by our own fucking army.

1334
01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:27.830
When guys like Andrew Carnegie had the connections to bring them in like he did

1335
01:22:27.831 --> 01:22:32.810
there and the fucking bags of the Allegheny out there in Pittsburgh or wherever

1336
01:22:32.811 --> 01:22:34.910
the fuck it was at,
that's now a mall.

1337
01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.073
<v 5>All right?</v>

1338
01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:40.820
<v 9>They needed those unions so we could avoid sweatshop,</v>

1339
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:44.780
the sweatshop labor conditions that existed in this country.

1340
01:22:44.781 --> 01:22:49.250
And then what happened aside from the map,
the mob taken over those things.

1341
01:22:49.251 --> 01:22:51.680
What happened is his guys use the unions,

1342
01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:56.710
the power of unions as a way to get over fucking paid and not to bust their ass

1343
01:22:57.051 --> 01:22:57.801
at work anymore.

1344
01:22:57.801 --> 01:23:01.460
So then they became the exact fucking thing that they were rebelling against.

1345
01:23:01.461 --> 01:23:06.460
So I understand why corporations move there.
They're fucking,
um,

1346
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.350
companies out of this country.
I also understand why that there had to be unions.

1347
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:16.540
As you know,
this is what it always comes down to is people are people rich.

1348
01:23:16.541 --> 01:23:20.050
People aren't the only greedy fucking assholes out there.
It,
you know,

1349
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:21.370
middle class and poor people.

1350
01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:24.160
If you put them in a position where they can be greedy.

1351
01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:29.080
The sad thing is most people will take advantage of this situation.

1352
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.340
This is not these,
and these are not unique theories.
This is the overall theory,

1353
01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:36.180
Harsh Siri that most people learn when they,

1354
01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.100
when they get out of their house and they get into the real world,

1355
01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:42.730
you realize that most people are cons.
There's very few good people out there,

1356
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.980
poor middle class or fucking rich,

1357
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:48.130
this very few people that will actually do the right thing.
So,
uh,

1358
01:23:48.131 --> 01:23:51.820
I 100% agree with that.
It would be,
you know,
speaking of unions,

1359
01:23:51.821 --> 01:23:55.990
it would be great if you could somehow start one.
You know,

1360
01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:58.930
that's what she needs to do is you need to get everybody on the same page and

1361
01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:01.360
say,
listen,
we're not saying you got to give us all of us,

1362
01:24:01.361 --> 01:24:05.980
but this fucking working for free is ridiculous.
Um,

1363
01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:09.430
yeah,
they're totally taken advantage of you,
um,

1364
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:13.480
because of the market.
But I guess if it's a good market,

1365
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:18.340
you guys can take advantage of them.
I don't know,
man.
It's just so,

1366
01:24:18.341 --> 01:24:19.720
I don't know who the fuck knows,

1367
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.420
but I definitely that there's just something wrong with having kids work for

1368
01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:24.580
fucking free.
All right.

1369
01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:27.550
And I will say to people who were in unions,

1370
01:24:27.551 --> 01:24:32.551
which I am 100 supportive in support of you motherfuckers need to work harder

1371
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.040
and you'll have a better,
um,

1372
01:24:37.330 --> 01:24:40.480
you'll have a better public image.
Now I'm not saying everybody in unions,
don't,

1373
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:42.250
you know,
they all have them lean on shovels,

1374
01:24:42.251 --> 01:24:45.730
but you know why you got that reputation.
Okay,
I'm Irish.

1375
01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:49.830
I know we got why we got the reputation for being a bunch of drunk motherfuckers

1376
01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:52.090
because so many of us are,

1377
01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:57.690
or at least enough of us got so fucking drunk that we completely wiped out any

1378
01:24:57.931 --> 01:25:02.430
sort of good Irishman out there.
Alright,
so there you go.
Oh,
another one.

1379
01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:05.280
Documentaries.
Underrated.
In the last few months,

1380
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:08.350
I've become a big fan of documentaries,
especially about Co,
uh,

1381
01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:11.880
are corrupted economy,
are fucked up culture in our diet,

1382
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.830
a dying planet and environment.

1383
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:18.240
I have to say these films put a really great picture as far as our civilization

1384
01:25:18.241 --> 01:25:20.340
goes.
Yeah,
I know.
That's why I kind of stopped watching them.

1385
01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:23.490
I just try to do the right thing in my own life.
If I,

1386
01:25:23.491 --> 01:25:27.330
if I watch too many of those,
they really depressed the shit out of me.
MMM.

1387
01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.030
The president has already looking bad and I did not see a way we can dig

1388
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:32.710
ourselves out of this hole that we've created.

1389
01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.650
I just don't understand why people dismiss these types of films.

1390
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:39.280
Are they trying to avoid the painful truth?
Absolutely.
I just said I was,

1391
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.210
are they in denial?
Absolutely.
There are ways and solutions to fix it,

1392
01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:46.810
but as long as we have,
uh,
democrats versus Republicans,

1393
01:25:46.811 --> 01:25:51.811
white versus blacks versus versus Spanish coal and oil energy verse,

1394
01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:53.850
uh,

1395
01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:58.830
Clean Energy and most importantly fucking paper money and stock markets,

1396
01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.840
nothing's going to change.
Yeah.
This guy,
this is,

1397
01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.640
this is exact conclusion that I came.
Um,

1398
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:08.420
although I don't agree that a lot of the clean energy they say is clean energy.

1399
01:26:08.421 --> 01:26:11.690
Like as much as I drive a hybrid,
which is really a scam,

1400
01:26:11.691 --> 01:26:15.980
it's only an electric car when it's going five miles an hour under.

1401
01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.410
Other than that,
it's just an underpowered gas car,

1402
01:26:18.411 --> 01:26:22.220
but it does burn clean and it does get great gas mileage.

1403
01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:24.230
But you know,
electric cars,

1404
01:26:24.231 --> 01:26:28.100
I mean those batteries eventually you have to dispose of those.

1405
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:30.320
And those things wreak havoc.
Basically,

1406
01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:33.530
human beings in general wreak havoc on the environment.

1407
01:26:33.531 --> 01:26:38.531
So I think the solution is you have to have some sort of population control and

1408
01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:42.950
they should do it sooner rather than later because if they did it sooner,

1409
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:48.070
we could avoid some sort of style on s slash Hitler solution because that's what

1410
01:26:48.201 --> 01:26:50.600
the fuck they're going to do.
Um,

1411
01:26:50.690 --> 01:26:55.690
I think the problem with human beings is we treat global problems the same way

1412
01:26:56.590 --> 01:27:01.220
are a college kid treats doing a term paper.
We do it the night before.

1413
01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.773
You know,

1414
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:07.190
remember y two K we knew that shit was coming and ended up not being a fucking

1415
01:27:07.191 --> 01:27:09.980
problem,
but everybody panicked in the final two months.

1416
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:13.040
They were talking about it for 10 years that we were going to have this possibly

1417
01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:16.790
have this fucking problem.
And we waited until the last fucking second.

1418
01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:19.460
And I think that the population problems going to be the same thing.

1419
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:22.430
The problem is too many fucking people.
There's no,

1420
01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.800
there's nothing wrong with chopping down trees.

1421
01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:27.900
There's nothing wrong with using coal.

1422
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:29.970
There's nothing wrong with driving a big car.

1423
01:27:29.971 --> 01:27:32.510
There's nothing wrong with any of that.
The problem is,

1424
01:27:32.511 --> 01:27:35.430
is that the 7 billion people on the fucking planet that,

1425
01:27:35.630 --> 01:27:40.290
because that's a problem.
All right?
We need to get that number way the fuck down.

1426
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:45.620
Whey the fuck down.
I would say under a billion
under a billion people,

1427
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:49.160
you need to do that.
So I think that you should just implement laws,

1428
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:53.360
the amount of people that,
uh,
kids that you can have.
And I also think that,

1429
01:27:53.361 --> 01:27:57.400
you know,
you should offer people money if they,

1430
01:27:57.430 --> 01:28:00.790
to not have kids,
uh,

1431
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:02.800
adopt kids recycle.

1432
01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.370
I think that they should do all of that type of stuff while they try to have

1433
01:28:06.371 --> 01:28:11.371
cleaner burning cars and that type of shit and just gradually let people kind of

1434
01:28:12.041 --> 01:28:12.874
die off.

1435
01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:15.183
<v 5>You know,</v>

1436
01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:19.280
<v 9>I,
I,
that's,
that's what I feel.
You know,
cause if you don't do that,</v>

1437
01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:23.660
then eventually,
um,
I think that we're going to run out of food,

1438
01:28:23.661 --> 01:28:27.440
run out of clean water and you're going to have the rich in their gated

1439
01:28:27.441 --> 01:28:31.670
communities and they're going to be guarded by the black water people and that

1440
01:28:31.820 --> 01:28:34.070
it's going to be shooting out the rest of us in their fucking heads,

1441
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:38.480
in our heads.
That's,
that's what I think's going to happen personally,
you know,

1442
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:43.340
if mother nature doesn't get his first all right.
That was uplifting.
All right,

1443
01:28:43.341 --> 01:28:46.160
let's get to,
uh,
let's get to advice for the week.
Uh,

1444
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:50.990
bill year and a half ago,
um,
where the hell am I?

1445
01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:52.130
A year and a half ago,

1446
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.750
me and this girl that I used to work with were hanging out a lot and fooling

1447
01:28:56.751 --> 01:29:00.710
around all summer.
Very nice.
It was pretty casual.
There you go.

1448
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:05.790
That's how you set it up.
It's pretty casual.
Wonderful.
And I think it just,

1449
01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:10.230
the artists trying to keep it there and as I've told you before,
what that is,

1450
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:14.040
it's the,
it's the time between you hooking up.

1451
01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:15.533
Okay.

1452
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.660
<v 10>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:29:16.660 --> 01:29:18.550
<v 9>When you keep it a casual and that type of shit.</v>

1454
01:29:18.551 --> 01:29:21.580
If you want to hang out and have drinks,
that's fine.

1455
01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.120
But when you get back to your place,
you do the deed and that's it.

1456
01:29:25.121 --> 01:29:27.220
She's got to go.
You can't hang out and watch a movie.

1457
01:29:27.221 --> 01:29:30.940
That's when they start getting feelings.
It's not fair to the female,
you know,

1458
01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.790
that's what you gotta do.
Don't call him all the fucking time.

1459
01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:37.060
You got to keep it fucking casual.
All right.
Continuing,

1460
01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:40.360
which is kind of hard to do when you work with them.
Um,
but anyways,
he goes,

1461
01:29:40.361 --> 01:29:41.171
it was pretty casual,

1462
01:29:41.171 --> 01:29:44.800
but that was only because we both knew I had to leave in August,

1463
01:29:44.801 --> 01:29:49.310
so we made a point to not get to cert.
Serious.
Beautiful.
Um,

1464
01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:52.570
once the summer ended,
I had to go back to school in Miami.

1465
01:29:52.571 --> 01:29:55.810
So our situation kind of ended,
but we stayed in touch.
Then recently,

1466
01:29:55.811 --> 01:29:57.220
this last spring break,

1467
01:29:57.370 --> 01:30:00.640
I went home for 10 days when I let her know I was going to be in town.

1468
01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:03.400
She said that,
uh,
that we had to hang out,

1469
01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:07.210
but only his friends because she had a boyfriend,
which I was fine with.

1470
01:30:07.690 --> 01:30:10.030
All right dude.
Now,
but I haven't read this one yet,

1471
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:15.310
but I gotta tell you right here.
Uh,
don't hang out with them more than once.

1472
01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.180
All right?
This is what you should do in that situation.
She's got a boyfriend.

1473
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:25.290
It's over.
All right?
So if she wants to hang out,

1474
01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:29.430
hang out in a public place,
and at the end of the night you say you gotta go,

1475
01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.110
don't bring up sex.

1476
01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:35.940
Don't fucking do anything like what you used to do.
She's got a boyfriend.

1477
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:39.360
You've got to walk away from that situation.
Not to mention if you,

1478
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:41.370
the two of you are just hanging out at any moment.

1479
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:45.570
Her boyfriend could walk in and you could get the old fucking claddagh ring to

1480
01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:49.200
the side of the fucking head.
Uh,
anyways,

1481
01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:55.370
so the first day I was there,
she came over to my house to hang out.
Okay,

1482
01:30:55.371 --> 01:30:58.940
that's a,
that's a red flag right there.
She's got a boyfriend.
You come to town,

1483
01:30:58.941 --> 01:31:02.240
she immediately drops her boyfriend and comes to hang out with you.
All right.

1484
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:06.830
After a half hour of that awkward catching up conversation,

1485
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:09.710
we went up to my room to watch a movie.

1486
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.910
Oh Geez.
Yes.
Wants to move.
He started,

1487
01:31:14.090 --> 01:31:17.140
she made sure to drive home.
Uh,

1488
01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:21.970
the fact that I should make a move on her because she's with someone else.
Yes.

1489
01:31:21.971 --> 01:31:25.850
See right here,
dude.
She's playing with your Dick.
She slapping it around,

1490
01:31:25.851 --> 01:31:29.390
making it go up and then she's going,
hey,
hey,
hey,
hey.
We got to take it easy.

1491
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:32.960
And then it goes back down and get,
she's fucking with you.
She fucking with you.

1492
01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:36.080
She's playing the up and down game from the OPN.
Anthony Show with your Dick.

1493
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:39.710
If you guys haven't seen that yet,
I'm telling you,
look that up on Youtube,

1494
01:31:39.711 --> 01:31:41.240
the opiate Anthony up and down game.

1495
01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:45.800
It's one of the most genius bits I've ever seen.
Fucking hilarious.
Um,
anyways,

1496
01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:51.380
I completely disregarded this.
Oh,
so she tells you.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Let me get,

1497
01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:54.560
let me go back here.
I really have to,
to drop my commentary here.

1498
01:31:54.561 --> 01:31:56.720
Why don't I just read the rest here.
Um,

1499
01:31:56.721 --> 01:31:59.150
so the movie starts and she drives home the point that they shouldn't,

1500
01:31:59.290 --> 01:32:03.610
he should make a move on her because she's,
she is with somebody else.
So he says,

1501
01:32:03.611 --> 01:32:07.090
I completely disregard this and I put my arm around her anyways,

1502
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:09.040
10 minutes into the movie.

1503
01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:15.070
You know what I respect that move.
By the way,
10 minutes into the movie,

1504
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:20.110
we're in a full on cuddle and she's doing that shit where she's running her

1505
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:22.210
finger up and down my arm.

1506
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.400
Then out of nowhere she flips around and climbs on top of me with that.

1507
01:32:27.401 --> 01:32:31.260
Fuck me looking arise.
Dude,
this is a great story.
She even,

1508
01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.650
she's even doing that preset,
slightly heavy breathing dude,
I'm not,

1509
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:38.740
I haven't read this.
I'm telling you she's going to pull the emergency chute.

1510
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:44.290
This is the Richard Pryor bit where they went to your dick is hard enough to cut

1511
01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:47.440
diamonds,
I believe is how Richard put it.
Or Mr Pryor.

1512
01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:51.970
Let me have some fucking respect here.
Saying Richard,
like I know the guy.
Um,

1513
01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:58.020
she drops in to start kissing me but stops in inch from my mouth and stays there

1514
01:32:59.321 --> 01:33:03.490
for a second or two.
Then she climbs off and goes back to cuddling.

1515
01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:08.740
Ah.
You know,
I do.
You're young.
You didn't know any better,

1516
01:33:08.741 --> 01:33:12.910
but if you were older,
you set yourself up for this.

1517
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:16.180
After recollecting myself,
I started to say something,

1518
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:20.500
but the second I started talking,
she flipped over and did it again.

1519
01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.530
But for a bit longer this time,

1520
01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:28.420
this time I asked her what the fuck she was doing and she giggled cunt.

1521
01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:32.680
Yeah.
Dude,
right there,
man.
This is the thing.

1522
01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.130
You got to take charge of the situation.
You got to tell you Dick,

1523
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:38.170
to stand down and be like,
look,

1524
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:41.510
either we're going to do this or we're not going to do this.
This is,

1525
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:44.800
I actually think at that point you should have just bounced around to there and

1526
01:33:44.801 --> 01:33:47.680
rubbed one out.
That's the power move right there,
man.

1527
01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.280
That's the move that's going to make you feel better than if he even fucked her

1528
01:33:51.281 --> 01:33:54.340
because she's still going to get something out of it.
She got to get laid right.

1529
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:58.030
So fuck debt.
You should have kicked her out right there and you spend like,

1530
01:33:58.031 --> 01:34:00.820
you know what?
This was a bad idea.
Shut this off.
You have to go.

1531
01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:04.270
You shouldn't be doing this.
You have a boyfriend.
See,
you flip it around.

1532
01:34:04.271 --> 01:34:08.320
You put the guilt on her.
She leaves you fucking rub one out,
right?

1533
01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.710
Then you don't give a shit that you didn't bang her and then you fucking go out

1534
01:34:11.711 --> 01:34:15.370
to the local watering hole.
You know you're going to run into some chick.

1535
01:34:15.371 --> 01:34:18.430
You went to fucking high school with your little older.
He little more manly.

1536
01:34:18.431 --> 01:34:22.090
You get the scruff going and you fucking tag her and fuck this girl.

1537
01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:27.040
She is a con.
She has a boyfriend.
She shouldn't be doing this shit.
All right,

1538
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:31.930
let's continue.
Um,
where the hell was I?
Uh,
this time though,

1539
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:35.920
she stayed,
she did it for about full,
full 30 seconds.
Okay.
So,

1540
01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:39.490
so we went back to cuddling for the next five minutes until she did it for a

1541
01:34:39.491 --> 01:34:41.680
third time.
This time though,

1542
01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.850
she stayed there for about 30 seconds and she wouldn't,

1543
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:48.250
and she would pull back every time I actually

1544
01:34:50.230 --> 01:34:55.210
kiss her so that she kept the inch between us.
Once she got off,

1545
01:34:55.570 --> 01:34:57.010
she started that giggling again,

1546
01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:01.880
which by then had gone from Q two annoying as hell and then slipped her shoes on

1547
01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.380
and said she had to go see dote.

1548
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:08.570
If you took charge and one of those you could have bounced her out.

1549
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:12.830
We didn't hang out again after that.
And now I'm back in Miami.

1550
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:16.190
I guess my question is what should I have done?
I guess I already answered it.

1551
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.720
And what the fuck was she doing?

1552
01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:21.890
Any answer would be great or even a rant about those annoying teasing cons.

1553
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:25.790
Thanks.
Well,
you know what,
dude,
I hadn't read this one.
I was a busy this weekend.

1554
01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:26.653
My,
uh,

1555
01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.230
the guy who helps me with my podcast who will remain nameless because that's how

1556
01:35:30.231 --> 01:35:32.540
I do it,
sent me this thing and I'm a little late today.

1557
01:35:32.541 --> 01:35:37.220
So it's the first time I read it.
Um,
yeah,
that's what she was doing.
She just,

1558
01:35:37.221 --> 01:35:38.054
I don't know,

1559
01:35:38.290 --> 01:35:42.230
you'd almost have to ask a female to get into the psychology of it,

1560
01:35:42.231 --> 01:35:45.530
but I could I guess like I think that,

1561
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:51.470
I dunno to,
does she want to just see that you still want to fuck her and that,

1562
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:55.310
like I can tell you this right now that her relationship with this other guy

1563
01:35:55.340 --> 01:36:00.290
isn't gonna work and she has made your fucking not major.
She's gay.

1564
01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.000
She's either really immature or eventually she has major issues and she'll fuck

1565
01:36:05.001 --> 01:36:07.670
up every relationship by doing shit like this.

1566
01:36:07.670 --> 01:36:12.590
And eventually she's going to be that old hottie hanging out at the wine bar,

1567
01:36:12.650 --> 01:36:16.610
you know,
with the crows feet around her eyes,
you know,
you know,

1568
01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:20.020
that check should just send me end up being that girl and then we'll look back

1569
01:36:20.210 --> 01:36:22.340
and regret at all the good guys that she fucking,

1570
01:36:22.341 --> 01:36:25.850
Dick teased as she was playing the fucking field.
But,
um,

1571
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:27.440
this is what you do in the future.

1572
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:30.320
The second a girl is doing some shit like that.

1573
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:34.880
The second she said,
listen,
just so you know,

1574
01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.980
I have a boyfriend,
we can't be doing this.
You should have said,
you know what?

1575
01:36:39.981 --> 01:36:44.210
You're right.
Let's not watch a movie
and write.

1576
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:48.440
Then you kick her out so you have some sort of power.

1577
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:52.250
All right?
And if you want to fuck a girl like that,

1578
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:54.050
you should have been the one saying no.

1579
01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:56.960
You should have been the one pushing her off.
All right?

1580
01:36:56.961 --> 01:37:01.961
Because it sounds like she has that fucking thing where you know she gets off on

1581
01:37:01.971 --> 01:37:04.880
the fact that you want our but can't have her.
All right?

1582
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.180
So if you're acting like you don't want her,
that fucks with her head like,

1583
01:37:08.181 --> 01:37:10.520
wait a minute,
what am I losing my pussy power?

1584
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:14.810
And you just literally back your way into the fucking boat.

1585
01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:17.330
Then you clubber over their head and then there you go.

1586
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:21.020
You got your fish in the boat.
All right?
That's how you do that.

1587
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:23.460
But I gotta tell you in the future,
do chicks like that?

1588
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:25.190
It just a complete fucking waste of time.

1589
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:29.420
You're already banged her so you're already dotted all the i's crossed all the

1590
01:37:29.421 --> 01:37:33.620
t's.
What the fuck you still doing your there because it's an easy,

1591
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.290
you thought it was an easy fucking lay when you got back,

1592
01:37:36.291 --> 01:37:37.490
which is understandable.
Okay.

1593
01:37:37.491 --> 01:37:41.030
But the problem is is you don't have your Dick and check your Dick is running

1594
01:37:41.031 --> 01:37:44.210
your fucking life.
You got to make the decisions.
All right?

1595
01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.570
And when you fucking do that,
you start winning those a lot more.
See,

1596
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:49.640
women have their pussies in check.

1597
01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.450
That's why they always win those battles 90% of the fucking time.

1598
01:37:53.451 --> 01:37:56.670
So there you go.
That's the little information that I can help you with.
What I,

1599
01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:58.140
like I said,
don't ever,

1600
01:37:58.141 --> 01:38:03.120
don't ever be afraid to fucking ask a female for advice on stuff like that.

1601
01:38:03.121 --> 01:38:04.830
Not only will they give you advice,

1602
01:38:04.831 --> 01:38:08.010
they actually enjoy doing it and they'll have way better advice than I do

1603
01:38:08.011 --> 01:38:12.810
because uh,
you know,
cause they're a fucking woman.
You know what I mean?

1604
01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.900
It's like he calling me or asking a plumber about fucking carpentry.

1605
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:19.950
Go to a carpenter.
All right.
That is the podcast for this week.
I hope you guys,

1606
01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.900
uh,
hope you guys enjoyed it.
Seemed like a fairly smooth one.
Right?
Um,
let,
let me,

1607
01:38:24.930 --> 01:38:28.530
can I whore out some dates here?
People,
can you hang with me this long enough?

1608
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:33.750
Huh?
Well maybe you're going to hang with me cause you're on final approach.
Oh,

1609
01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:37.260
you know what?
I can't stand.
This is what happened me the other day.

1610
01:38:37.261 --> 01:38:41.490
I went out to go buy a my fucking water cooler that I want to have just in case

1611
01:38:41.491 --> 01:38:44.850
a tsunami hits out here cause I live on a fault line and I always want to have

1612
01:38:44.851 --> 01:38:48.210
at least five to 10 gallons of water.
You know,

1613
01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:51.060
I'm already inland enough with the tsunamis not going to hit.

1614
01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:56.000
If a tsunami hits me here,
I'm telling you,
Utah's in trouble.
All right,

1615
01:38:56.370 --> 01:39:00.930
so I go to Lowe's hardware,
I go there online,

1616
01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.520
I look up to see if they have the one that I want and then,
you know,

1617
01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:06.690
and Lowe's has it.

1618
01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.250
So rather than just saying they only have it online,

1619
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:13.500
I'm assuming it's at the fucking store.

1620
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:18.030
So I jumped in my car and I drive over there and then they don't fucking have
it.

1621
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.520
They don't fucking have it.
And it's just,
you know,
just fucking drove me nuts.

1622
01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:27.150
So then I stop off at a sporting goods store to buy a pump because my football

1623
01:39:27.151 --> 01:39:28.140
doesn't have any air in it.

1624
01:39:28.141 --> 01:39:32.340
And this is what you do at 42 when you don't have any fucking kids,
you know,

1625
01:39:32.490 --> 01:39:35.880
you actually,
you still acting like you fucking 14 so I dunno,

1626
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:39.690
I just had that moment when I went into the sporting goods store.
You know,

1627
01:39:40.890 --> 01:39:42.780
I hate when they can't fucking help me.

1628
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:47.640
I'm asking a simple question and then I start to flip out and then they just

1629
01:39:47.641 --> 01:39:52.450
call me sir a million fucking times.
You Know Sarah,

1630
01:39:52.451 --> 01:39:54.390
I'm sorry sir.
But sir,
could you sir,

1631
01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:58.210
could you please net sharing this year please sir.
Thank you Sarah.

1632
01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.800
That fucking shit.
That's what reminds me of,
of flying on the plane.

1633
01:40:02.801 --> 01:40:05.350
If you do anything,
if you have your seat back,
Syracuse,

1634
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:07.900
could you please put your seat back up,
sir?
Thank you sir.

1635
01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:11.320
Syrah in order to expedite this series.
Sir,
could you please,
sir,

1636
01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:17.100
I fucking hate that.
And I that you know what I do then I through gritted teeth,

1637
01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.150
just say ma'am,
back a hundred times.
I'm sorry ma'am.
Yes ma'am.
Thank you ma'am.

1638
01:40:21.151 --> 01:40:24.960
Ma'Am,
could you stop Mami?
Me,
ma'am.
You fucking cunt,
ma'am.

1639
01:40:26.010 --> 01:40:26.843
I'm sorry.

1640
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:29.640
That's a little bit of fucking half an ounce of rage ahead to get out there.

1641
01:40:29.641 --> 01:40:32.640
Let me get back to hype in my dates here.
So anyways,
this week,
oh,

1642
01:40:32.641 --> 01:40:37.170
what a week I have,
I'm going to be at the record theater for two shows.

1643
01:40:37.170 --> 01:40:41.070
I believe the second show was already sold out.
So,
uh,
if you want to get tickets,

1644
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:44.010
you better fucking hustle there all for you fucking contents,

1645
01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.580
the Goddamn Internet.
We're not working in this room.
You know,

1646
01:40:47.581 --> 01:40:51.540
I really need to step my life up.
I'm,
I'm at the record theater at this,
uh,

1647
01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:55.570
this Friday,
April 8th for two shows.

1648
01:40:56.110 --> 01:40:58.330
I believe they're like eight and 10 are eight and 10 30.

1649
01:40:58.331 --> 01:41:01.400
I don't know what the fuck they are.
My God damn website won't come up.
Um,

1650
01:41:01.450 --> 01:41:04.330
that's in Baltimore outside of Baltimore,
Maryland.

1651
01:41:04.780 --> 01:41:09.640
And on Friday night I'm at the Tower Tower Theater in Philadelphia,

1652
01:41:09.641 --> 01:41:14.620
Pennsylvania.
Later on this month,
I got two more shows.

1653
01:41:14.621 --> 01:41:18.940
One is in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.
April 22nd at the PAPP's theater.

1654
01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:22.150
Um,
unbelievable response by the way.

1655
01:41:22.151 --> 01:41:24.520
I want to thank everybody beforehand in Milwaukee.

1656
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:27.100
Maybe that's why I had the Laverne and Shirley Song in my head.

1657
01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.920
Isn't that where that show was based at?
Um,

1658
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:32.020
and they also worked at a beer factory.

1659
01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:36.910
It's all coming full circle and on the 23rd,
I'll be at the uh,

1660
01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:41.230
Royal Oak Theater in Detroit,
Michigan.
Um,

1661
01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.810
both of those dates are selling unbelievably well.

1662
01:41:43.811 --> 01:41:47.080
Both of them are going to sell out,
so get your tickets as soon as you can.

1663
01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:51.670
And uh,
I want to thank everybody there for like,
I have not,

1664
01:41:51.671 --> 01:41:56.440
I've never played Milwaukee and I have not played Detroit since I did.

1665
01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:00.820
Uh,
the rich bitch tour,
the Chappelle show tour back in.

1666
01:42:00.821 --> 01:42:03.590
I think I did that in an oh four.
I,

1667
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:06.520

Jay Miller,

1686
01:43:16.930 --> 01:43:20.200
one of my favorite enforcers of the Boston Bruins is in,
uh,

1687
01:43:20.201 --> 01:43:22.060
is in the hospital recovering from pneumonia.

1688
01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:27.360
Just want to send him a get well soon wishes.
Um,
one of my favorites and a,

1689
01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:29.350
we're going to send a link,
a youtube video.

1690
01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:32.410
We've got some great youtube videos this week.
I almost forgot about those.

1691
01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:35.320
We're going to have one of Jay Miller holding his own against the greatest of

1692
01:43:35.321 --> 01:43:38.500
all time for my money.
Bob Probert and a,

1693
01:43:38.650 --> 01:43:42.760
what are the youtube videos for this week?
Oh,
we got some good ones.

1694
01:43:43.690 --> 01:43:47.450
I got one from that show.
Cheaters,
you know,
let's show cheaters with a gun.

1695
01:43:47.451 --> 01:43:51.040
You know,
they basically,
uh,
somebody thinks that somebody is cheating on them.

1696
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:52.100
So then what do they do?
They get,

1697
01:43:52.101 --> 01:43:55.010
they hired this company and they start spying on the boyfriend and girlfriend.

1698
01:43:55.011 --> 01:43:57.110
And when they confirm that they are in fact cheating,

1699
01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.020
they show up and confront him.

1700
01:44:00.021 --> 01:44:04.160
And this is one of the greatest ones I've ever seen.
They confront this kid at a,

1701
01:44:04.161 --> 01:44:07.760
at an ice rink after he just played a hockey game and you know,

1702
01:44:07.761 --> 01:44:11.150
usually the person who's cheating,
you know the dude is absolutely stunned.

1703
01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:13.670
This guy handles it absolutely perfectly.

1704
01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.310
He fucking breaks up with her.
She shows up.
She's like,
you know,

1705
01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.440
cause the chickies cheating with,
is that the ice rink?
She says,
yeah,

1706
01:44:21.441 --> 01:44:24.860
who the fuck is that?
You know,
what the fuck are you doing here?

1707
01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:28.220
And he just goes,
he just breaks up with her right on the spot.

1708
01:44:28.221 --> 01:44:31.730
He's leaning on his stick white wipe on the snow.
I mean the,
the,

1709
01:44:31.731 --> 01:44:33.800
the sweat off of his fucking nose.

1710
01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.760
He looks like a hockey player in between periods going like,
yeah,

1711
01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:41.090
we got to work on our for checking and I hope we can get that goal back in the

1712
01:44:41.091 --> 01:44:44.510
second period he wasn't even sweating and he just breaks up with her.
She's like,

1713
01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:48.260
yeah,
who the fuck is that?
What the fuck are you doing?
He just goes,
he goes,
yeah,

1714
01:44:48.410 --> 01:44:53.120
we're done.
What do you mean with done?

1715
01:44:53.121 --> 01:44:56.420
Just like that.
He goes,
yeah,
it's over.
She goes,
that girl,

1716
01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.460
because the other girl was uglier.
She goes,

1717
01:44:58.470 --> 01:45:01.910
you're going to dump me for that girl.
And he goes,
what can I say?
She,

1718
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:05.810
she does it right.
And he,
he didn't,
he didn't give a fuck.

1719
01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:09.710
He was barely looking at her.
He was just sitting there leaning on his stick.

1720
01:45:10.130 --> 01:45:14.120
He wasn't nervous that there was cameras there and he just fucking breaks up

1721
01:45:14.121 --> 01:45:16.430
with there and then his girlfriend doesn't know what to do.

1722
01:45:16.690 --> 01:45:20.480
She's so she ends up getting into a fist fight with the chickies cheating on and

1723
01:45:20.481 --> 01:45:22.520
he just sort of walks away into the locker room.

1724
01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.190
It's fucking phenomenal.
Um,
what else do we got?

1725
01:45:28.191 --> 01:45:32.840
We have some hippie chick trying to give a presentation to a bunch of corporate

1726
01:45:32.841 --> 01:45:35.900
people.
Um,
what the hell are these youtube videos?

1727
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:40.280
We got Paul Orndorff hyping the Hulk Hulkamania workout thing.

1728
01:45:40.281 --> 01:45:43.700
That's one of my favorites.
And A,
