that Trust is the currency and currency

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159
that Trust is the currency and currency
 

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.159
that Trust is the currency and currency
is trust because it's a promissory note

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169
is trust because it's a promissory note
 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.899
is trust because it's a promissory note
right and if people lie then the

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909
right and if people lie then the
 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.760
right and if people lie then the
currency gets to based very very rapidly

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770
currency gets to based very very rapidly
 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.870
currency gets to based very very rapidly
and so the economy runs on trust
