00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.720
Before you watch Winnie the Pooh force a sad, middle-aged Christopher Robin back to the Hundred-Acre Woods,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.320
Steven Spielberg had every 90's kid wondering:

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.260
What if Tinkerbell forced a sad, middle-aged Peter Pan back to Neverland?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.980
"I can see why you have trouble finding a happy thought.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.460
So many sad memories."

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.860
Er-er-er-er-aw.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.140
Gather around for Spielberg's least favorite Spielberg movie,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.520
"I wanna see Hook again because I still don't like that movie."

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.200
even though it's the best film in the entire Peter Pantheon,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.500
where by best, we mean least racist,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.880
most memorable,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.960
"Peter, come back! PETER!"

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.120
and containing the fewest covers of Smells Like Teen Spirit.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.820
♫ Here we are now! ♫

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.100
♫ Entertain us! ♫

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.640
Someday, I'll actually watch Pan to find out why that's in there,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.360
but today is not that day.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.480
Meet Peter Banning,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.100
professional cell phone haver.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.840
He's Robin Williams like you've never wanted to see him before:

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.780
grumpy,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.700
"I DO NOT BELIEVE IN FAIRIES!"

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.720
angry,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.600
"Would everybody just SHUT UP?!"

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.300
and completely shaved from head to toe.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.980
Eugh!

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.380
Glad they cut the scene where the Lost Boys went all 40-Year-Old Virgin on his chest.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.520
"D'AAAAH, KELLY CLARKSON!"

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.080
When his kids get taken off to Neverland,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.640
Peter Banning will have to become Peter Pan again.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.540
At the 100-minute mark of a 140-minute movie.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.400
How was I that patient as a kid?

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.820
Enter a spellbinding version of our own world

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.780
where the Peter Pan stories are all fiction,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.800
"Mr. Berry, well, Sir James,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.180
he wrote them all down in a book 80 years ago."

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.120
except they're not

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.180
because they're all based on historical events.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.400
"The stories are true."

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.220
Except for that one shot where they imply that everything was all a dream?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.900
"Hello."

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.840
What?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.620
And if that's not confusing enough,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.400
enjoy a family dynamic where Wendy has always had a crush on Peter,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.120
"I am the girl who held your favor the way I did."

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.560
but then, she adopted him as her own grandson

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.420
after he kissed her granddaughter on the lips while she slept

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.860
and she still clearly has the hots for him.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.540
"Grandma?"

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.160
That is so Bangawrong.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.460
Head for the second star to the right and straight onto morning

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.300
to the saddest place you can imagine:

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.140
Neverland,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.920
a prison island in a state of perpetual war

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.220
infested by a pirate army that's suicidally depressed?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.040
"Don't try to stop me, Smee."

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.380
"Oh, not again."

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.120
Yikes!

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.040
But there's also the Lost Boys,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.900
"BANGARANG!"

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.720
"BANGARANG!"

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.820
a tribe of tweenage murderers

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.400
who are probably starving to death on imaginary food

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.900
and can't hide the fact that after an eternity of battle,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.060
they're all broken children desperate for some structure and guidance.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.560
"Do you remember your father, Peter?"

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.140
"I wish I had a dad...

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.680
like you."

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.080
OK, how did I think this movie was fun when I was a kid?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.420
Was I that blinded by Rufio's half-shirted triple hawk?

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.540
"Rufio, Rufio, Ru-fi-o!"

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.140
Oh, yeah, he's still the best.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.000
So strap in for a movie that if you're over 30, you probably have really fond memories of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.540
because you focus on the incredible Hoffman performance,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.180
"I like it, I like it!"

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.000
the amazing production design,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.520
and your unconditional love for Robin Williams,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.080
but when you revisit it as an adult or were born after 1990,

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.800
you'll realize it's a sexually charged, violent movie about a mid-life crisis that takes 2 hours to really get going.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.740
But you know, for kids!

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.620
Yay!

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.960
"Oh, dear me!"

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.700
OK, I'm just gonna throw this out there, but where are Micheal and John?

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.920
Toodles, did you kill them?

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.460
"I've lost my marbles."
