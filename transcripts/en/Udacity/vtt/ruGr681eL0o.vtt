00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.900
The areas that IBM is taking this,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.610
and that we've concentrated
on is in health care.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.142
And you may be aware that we've
created a Watson Health Group.

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:17.130
An entire organization dedicated
to leveraging cognitive computing

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.390
technologies for the benefit of
improving the medical practice and

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.950
the health system.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.730
It includes everything from,
as I suggested earlier,

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.110
being able to determine
the best treatments for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.580
in college with patients based on
clinical evidence, clinical literature.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:44.690
Includes being able to help technicians
do a better job of diagnosing

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.350
a patient's symptoms through
medical imaging, right?

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.815
To be able to look at a medical image,
an MRI or

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:58.410
x-ray and recognize in that x-ray,
within that image

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.200
the anomalies that would represent
key issues with that patient.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.370
And oftentimes,
the level of resolution and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.210
clarity that even our own human
eyes not able to really pick up on.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.470
So healthcare is a big area.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.140
We're now focusing on
the Internet of Things.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.080
If we think about all of
the data coming in from

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.210
all the devices that
are deployed in our world today.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.890
Whether that's the information is coming
off our cars and where we drive to or

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.770
how we drive or the condition of
the car itself, out on oil rigs.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.005
And all the machinery this deploy there.

00:01:40.005 --> 00:01:43.490
In our homes and
the sensors that we have for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.820
taking temperature readings or
ambient air quality readings.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.011
On and on and on, all these sensors
are generating data that in

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:59.480
aggregate are hard to assimilate,
hard to understand.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.620
And it's hard to derive any inspiration.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.340
Given sort of the diversity information
and sort of all the noise, if you will,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.169
that exists within that data.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.120
So be apply a cognitive system, to be
able to look at all the signals and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.060
be able to derive meaning.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.980
And out of that meaning
derive insight and

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.910
inspiration that now allows us to
think about what we should be doing?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.830
How should we be responding
if we are on our oil rig and

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.600
our responsibility is to
maintain the equipment on that.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.690
How do we prepare for

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.590
that maintenance by evaluating the
information coming in all these signals?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.150
For in our home,
how do we make decisions and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.700
how do we get inspired by, how we can in
fact live better and more comfortably?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.800
If we're in a car, is there a better
way of getting to where we need to be,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.760
or be able to do that in a more
convenient and a safe way?

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.210
Those are areas that we within
IBM are concentrating on.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.120
Again, if we look at our ecosystem, the
number of areas that they're focusing on

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.090
is enormous, it's diverse, it's just
about everything that you can imagine,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.710
in our life, In our human experience.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.290
There's an opportunity for
an application to be brought to that and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.380
enhance it in some meaningful
way to make us more powerful,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.690
to make us able as humans,
to make better decisions or

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.290
to be able to consider information
that today is just overwhelming.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.930
There's just too much of it and
we can't simulate it all.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.000
And to be able to identify that,
if you will connect the dots, all right?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.880
To find the associations and all
the data that we would otherwise miss.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.500
Either because we don't have time to
read it all, which generally we don't.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.560
Or even more so, even if we did
read it all, we have biases, right?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.040
And those biases causes
to filter out real

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.120
information that exists, that if we saw
it we would be able to make use of.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:06.700
The way that pharmacists, or people in
the pharmacological research industry.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.740
People who are responsible for
coming up with new drugs.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.160
Most often than not,
it's not about creating a new compound.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.649
It's never been found before or
considered before, but

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:24.930
it's about finding new applications of
already known compounds to solving for

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.170
new medical problems.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.810
And a lot of that is about
connecting the dots.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.100
It's about finding the research paper or
the patent or the other sources of

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.650
literature where this compound had been
discussed had been evaluated but often

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.602
in a field that is completely unrelated
to the thing that I care about, that

00:04:44.602 --> 00:04:51.000
allows me to get an idea that eventually
leads to, perhaps a new drug discovery.
