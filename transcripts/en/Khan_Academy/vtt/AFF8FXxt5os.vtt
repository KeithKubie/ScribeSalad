00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's apply what we learned in
the last video into a concrete

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.810
example of the work done by a
vector field on something

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.560
going through some type of
path through the field.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.400
So let's say that I
have a vector field.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.800
It's defined over r2
for the x-y plane.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.160
So it's a function of x and y.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.330
It associates a vector with
every point on the plane.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.070
And let's say my vector field
is y times the unit vector i

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.240
minus x times the
unit vector j.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.980
And so you can imagine if
we were to draw-- let's

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.630
draw our x- and y-axes.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.240
I'll do it over here.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.840
If we were to draw our x- and
y-axes, this associates a

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.530
vector, a force vector--
let's say this is actually a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.340
force vector-- with every
point in our x-y plane.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.160
So this is x and this is y.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.805
So if we're at the point, for
example, 1, 0, what will the

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:05.480
vector look like that's
associated with that point?

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.360
Well, at 1, 0, y is 0, so this
will be 0, i minus 1, j.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690
Minus 1, j looks like this.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.446
So minus 1, j will
look like that.

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.630
At x is equal to 2-- I'm just
picking points at random, ones

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.665
that'll be -- y is still 0, and
now the force vector here

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.200
would be minus 2, j.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.330
So it would look
something like this.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.500
Minus 2, j.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.700
Something like that.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.110
Likewise, if we were to go
here, where y is equal to 1 and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.310
x is equal to is 0, when y is
equal to 1, we have 1, i minus

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.530
0, j, so then our vector
is going to look like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.610
that at this point.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.690
If we're to go to 2-- you
could get the picture.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:55.940
You can keep plotting
these points.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.400
You just want to get a sense
of what it looks like.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.690
If you go here, the vector's
going to look like that.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.910
If you go maybe at this point
right here, the vector's

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.733
going to look like that.

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:07.850
I think you get
the general idea.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.530
I could keep filling
in the space for this

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.460
entire field all over.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.140
You know, just to make it
symmetric, if I was here,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.690
the vector is going
to look like that.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.510
You get the idea.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.500
I could just fill in all of
the points if I had to.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.890
Now, in that field, I have some
particle moving, and let's say

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.080
its path is described by
the curve c, and the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.120
parameterization of it is x of
t is equal to cosine of t, and

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.270
y of t is equal to sine of t.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.070
And the path will occur from
t-- let's say, 0 is less than

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.480
or equal to t is less
than or equal to 2pi.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.400
You might already recognize
what this would be.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.960
This parameterization
is essentially a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.420
counterclockwise circle.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.680
So the path that this
guy is going to go is

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.730
going to start here.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.120
Well, you can imagine, t in
this case, you could almost

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.980
imagine is just the angle of
the circle, but you can

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.130
also imagine t is time.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.550
So at time equals 0, we're
going to be over here.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.260
Then at time of pi over 2,
we're going to have traveled a

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.820
quarter of the circle to there,
so we're moving in

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.020
that direction.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.690
And then at time after pi
seconds, we would have

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.150
gotten right there.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.730
And then all the way after 2pi
seconds, we would have gotten

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.180
all the way around the circle.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.440
So our path, our curve, is one
counterclockwise rotation

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.150
around the circle, so to speak.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.620
So what is the work done by
this field on this curve?

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.670
So the work done.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.920
So the work, we learned in the
previous video, is equal to the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.510
line integral over this contour
of our field, of our vector

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.720
field, dotted with the
differential of our movement,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.950
so dotted with the differential
of our movement dr.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.790
Well, I haven't even
defined r yet.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.080
I mean, I kind of have just the
parameterization here, so we

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.020
need to have a vector function.

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.230
We need to have some r
that defines this path.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.360
This is just a standard
parameterization, but if I

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.590
wanted to write it as a vector
function of t, we would write

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:33.760
that r of t is equal to x of t,
which is cosine of t times i

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.020
plus y of t times j, which is
just sine of t times j.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.170
And likewise, this is for 0 is
less than or equal to t, which

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.740
is less than or equal to 2pi.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.230
And this are equivalent.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.210
The reason why I took the pain
of doing this is so now I can

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.460
take its vector function
derivative, and can figure out

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.210
its differential, and then I
can actually take the dot

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.160
product with this
thing over here.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.120
So let's do all of that and
actually calculate this line

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.870
integral and figure out the
work done by this field.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.420
One thing might already
pop in your mind.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.900
We're going in a
counterclockwise direction, but

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.730
at every point where we're
passing through, it looks like

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.540
the field is going exactly
opposite the direction

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.950
of our motion.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.480
For example, here
we're moving upwards.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.350
The field is pulling
us backwards.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.970
Here we're moving
to the top left.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.550
The field is moving us
to the bottom right.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.010
Here we're moving
exactly to the left.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.590
The field is pulling
us to the right.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.900
So it looks like the field is
always doing the exact opposite

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.840
of what we're trying to do.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.300
It's hindering our
ability to move.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.670
So I'll give you a
little intuition.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.600
This'll probably deal
with negative work.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.080
For example, if I lift
something off the ground,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.290
I have to apply force
to fight gravity.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.820
I'm doing positive work,
but gravity's doing

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.940
negative work on that.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.930
We're just going to do the math
here just to make you

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.990
comfortable with this idea, but
it's interesting to think about

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.000
what's exactly going
on even here.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.490
The field is-- the field I'm
doing in that pink color,

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.770
so let me stick to that.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.100
The field is pushing in that
direction, so it's always

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.170
going opposite the motion.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.270
But let's just do the math to
make everything in the last

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.800
video a little bit
more concrete.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.950
So a good place to start
is the derivative of our

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.650
position vector function
with respect to t.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.670
So we have a dr/dt, which
we could also write

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.450
as r prime of t.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.100
This is equal to the derivative
of x of t with respect to t,

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.490
which is minus sine of t times
i plus the derivative of y

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.070
of t with respect to t.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.720
Derivative of sine of t
is just cosine of t.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.820
Cosine of t times j.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.840
And if we want the
differential, we just multiply

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:41.610
everything times dt, so we get
to dr is equal to-- we could

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.280
write it this way.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.700
We could actually even
just put the d-- well,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.300
let me just do it.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.860
So it's minus sine of t dt--
I'm just multiplying each of

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.290
these terms by dt, distributive
property-- times the unit

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:59.420
vector i plus cosine of t dt
times the unit vector j.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.270
So we have this piece now.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.880
And now we want to take the dot
product with this over here,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.150
but let me rewrite our
vector field in terms of in

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.570
terms of t, so to speak.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.030
So what's our field going to
be doing at any point t?

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.810
We don't have to worry
about every point.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.760
We don't have to worry, for
example, that over here the

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.900
vector field is going to be
doing something like that

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.960
because that's not on our path.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.850
That force never had an
impact on the particle.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.700
We only care about what
happens along our path.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.780
So we can find a function that
we can essentially substitute y

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.260
and x for, their relative
functions with respect to t,

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.180
and then we'll have the force
from the field at any

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.500
point or any time t.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.780
So let's do that.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.410
So this guy right here, if I
were to write it as a function

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.420
of t, this is going to be equal
to y of t, right? y is a

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:56.630
function of t, so it's sine
of t, right? that's that.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:05.210
Sine of t times i plus-- or
actually minus x, or x of

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.310
t. x is a function of t.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:13.070
So minus cosine of t times j.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.080
And now all of it seems
a little bit more

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.570
straightforward.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.170
If we want to find this line
integral, this line integral is

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.780
going to be the same thing as
the integral-- let me pick

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.050
a nice, soothing color.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.850
Maybe this is a nice one.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.010
The integral from t is
equal to 0 to t is equal

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:35.620
to 2pi of f dot dr.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.130
Now, when you take the dot
product, you just multiply the

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.830
corresponding components,
and add it up.

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:44.150
So we take the product of the
minus sign and the sine of t--

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.940
or the sine of t with the minus
sine of t dt, I get-- you're

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:56.845
going to get minus sine squared
t dt, and then you're going

00:08:56.845 --> 00:08:59.780
to add that to-- so you're
going to have that plus.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.250
Let me write that
dt a little bit.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.310
That was a wacky-looking dt.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:08.270
dt, and then you're going to
have that plus these two guys

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.500
multiplied by each other.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.260
So that's-- well, there's a
minus to sign here so plus.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.980
Let me just change
this to a minus.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:21.230
Minus cosine squared dt.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.830
And if we factor out a minus
sign and a dt, what is

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:24.730
this going to be equal to?

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:30.330
This is going to be equal to
the integral from 0 to 2pi of,

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:36.010
we could say, sine squared
plus-- I want to put the t --

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:41.130
sine squared of t plus
cosine squared of t.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.840
And actually, let me take the
minus sign out to the front.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.840
So if we just factor the
minus sign, and put a minus

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.140
there, make this a plus.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.370
So the minus sign out there,
and then we factor dt out.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.880
I did a couple of steps in
there, but I think you got it.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.390
Now this is just
algebra at this point.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.140
Factoring out a minus sign,
so this becomes positive.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.800
And then you have
a dt and a dt.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.510
Factor that out,
and you get this.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.070
You could multiply this
out and you'd get what we

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.830
originally have, if that
confuses you at all.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.110
And the reason why I did that:
we know what sine squared of

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.190
anything plus cosine squared
of that same anything is.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.400
That falls right out of the
unit circle definition of

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.850
our trig function,
so this is just 1.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.050
So our whole integral has been
reduced to the minus integral

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.090
from 0 to 2pi of dt.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.910
And this is-- we have
seen this before.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.970
We can probably say that this
is of 1, if you want to

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.670
put something there.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.160
Then the antiderivative of 1 is
just-- so this is just going to

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.380
be equal to minus-- and that
minus sign is just the same

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.510
minus sign that we're
carrying forward.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.520
The antiderivative of 1 is just
t, and we're going to evaluate

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.730
it from 2pi to 0, or from 0 to
2pi, so this is equal to

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:54.720
minus-- that minus sign right
there-- 2pi minus t

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.460
at 0, so minus 0.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.180
So this is just
equal to minus 2pi.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.130
And there you have it.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:06.960
We figured out the work that
this field did on the particle,

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.150
or whatever, whatever thing
was moving around in this

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.370
counterclockwise fashion.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.620
And our intuition held up.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.820
We actually got a negative
number for the work done.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.430
And that's because, at all
times, the field was actually

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.210
going exactly opposite, or was
actually opposing, the movement

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.570
of, if we think of it
as a particle in its

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.160
counterclockwise direction.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.910
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that helpful.
