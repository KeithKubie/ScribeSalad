00:00:00.584 --> 00:00:01.784
- [Narrator] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:04.616
is quickly review exponential growth

00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:07.161
and then use that as our platform

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:11.120
to introduce ourselves
to exponential decay.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.416
So let's review exponential growth.

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:15.989
Let's say we have something that,

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:18.739
and I'll do this on a table here.

00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:22.016
Just gonna make that straight.

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:24.988
So let's say this is
our x and this is our y.

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:29.126
Now let's say when x is
zero, y is equal to three.

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:32.313
And every time we increase
x by 1, we double y.

00:00:32.313 --> 00:00:35.230
So y is gonna go from three to six.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.117
If x increases by one
again, so we go to two,

00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:41.520
we're gonna double y again.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.770
And so six times two is 12.

00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:48.370
This right over here
is exponential growth.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.832
And you could even go for negative x's.

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:54.129
When x is negative one, well,
if we're going back one in x,

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.004
we would divide by two.

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:58.424
So this is going to be 3/2.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.394
3/2.

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:01.704
And notice if you go from
negative one to zero,

00:01:01.704 --> 00:01:04.793
you once again, you
keep multiplying by two

00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:06.731
and this will keep on happening.

00:01:06.731 --> 00:01:09.332
And you can describe
this with an equation.

00:01:09.332 --> 00:01:12.320
You could say that y is equal to,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.100
and sometimes people might
call this your y intercept

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.623
or your initial value,

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:19.340
is equal to three,
essentially what happens

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.989
when x equals zero, is
equal to three times

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:25.099
our common ratio, and our common ratio is,

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:26.602
well, what are we
multiplying by every time

00:01:26.602 --> 00:01:28.622
we increase x by one?

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:32.205
So three times our
common ratio two, to the

00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:35.675
to the x, to the x power.

00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:38.123
And you can verify that.

00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:39.298
Pick any of these.

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:42.316
When x is equal to two,
it's gonna be three

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:45.155
times two squared, which
is three times four,

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:47.352
which is indeed equal to 12.

00:01:47.352 --> 00:01:50.053
And we can see that on a graph.

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:54.036
So let me draw a quick
graph right over here.

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:56.794
So, I'm having trouble
drawing a straight line.

00:01:56.794 --> 00:01:58.711
All right, there we go.

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.385
And let's see.

00:02:01.385 --> 00:02:02.784
We could go, and they're gonna be

00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:06.121
on a slightly different
scale, my x and y axes.

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:08.538
So this is x axis, y axis.

00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:12.924
And we go from negative one to one to two.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.379
Let's see, we're going
all the way up to 12.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.629
So let's see, this is three, six, nine,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.157
and let's say this is 12.

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:30.358
We could just plot these points here.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:34.526
When x is negative one, y is 3/2.

00:02:34.526 --> 00:02:38.524
So looks like that, then at y equals zero,

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.524
x is, when x is zero, y is three.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.369
When x equals one, y has doubled.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.548
It's now at six.

00:02:46.548 --> 00:02:49.242
When x is equal to two, y is 12.

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:52.377
And you will see this tell-tale curve.

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.861
And so there's a couple
of key features that we've

00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.844
Well, we've already talked
about several of them,

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:59.317
but if you go to increasingly
negative x values,

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:03.329
you will asymptote towards the x axis.

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:04.768
It'll never quite get to zero

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:06.268
as you get to more and
more negative values,

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:07.655
but it'll definitely approach it.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:09.275
And as you get to more
and more positive values,

00:03:09.275 --> 00:03:10.790
it just kind of skyrockets up.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.630
We always, we've talked
about in previous videos

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.770
how this will pass up any linear function

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.579
or any linear graph eventually.

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.329
Now, let's compare that
to exponential decay.

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:26.179
Exponential, exponential decay.

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:31.065
An easy way to think about it,

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:33.452
instead of growing every
time you're increasing x,

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:35.914
you're going to shrink
by a certain amount.

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.711
You are going to decay.

00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:40.544
So let's set up another table here

00:03:41.474 --> 00:03:43.570
with x and y values.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.178
That was really a very,

00:03:45.178 --> 00:03:46.855
this is supposed to, when I press shift,

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:50.122
it should create a straight
line but my computer,

00:03:50.122 --> 00:03:51.393
I've been eating next to my computer.

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:53.579
Maybe there's crumbs in
the keyboard or something.

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.725
(laughs) All right.

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:55.570
So here we go.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.799
We have x and we have y.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.127
And so let's start with,

00:03:59.127 --> 00:04:01.124
let's say we start in the same place.

00:04:01.124 --> 00:04:03.541
So when x is zero, y is 3.

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:09.484
But instead of doubling every
time we increase x by one,

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:13.081
let's go by half every
time we increase x by one.

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.568
So when x is equal to
one, we're gonna multiply

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:19.306
by 1/2, and so we're gonna get to 3/2.

00:04:19.306 --> 00:04:24.014
Then when x is equal to two,
we'll multiply by 1/2 again

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:27.597
and so we're going to get to 3/4

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.430
and so on and so forth.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.795
And if we were to go to negative values,

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:34.886
when x is equal to negative one,

00:04:34.886 --> 00:04:37.615
well, to go, if we're going
backwards in x by one,

00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:39.751
we would divide by 1/2,

00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:41.539
and so we would get to six.

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:42.885
Or going from negative one to zero,

00:04:42.885 --> 00:04:46.642
as we increase x by one,
once again, we're multiplying

00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:49.253
we're multiplying by 1/2.

00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.097
And so how would we write
this as an equation?

00:04:51.097 --> 00:04:52.074
I encourage you to pause the video

00:04:52.074 --> 00:04:54.768
and see if you can write
it in a similar way.

00:04:54.768 --> 00:04:57.828
Well, it's gonna look something like this.

00:04:57.828 --> 00:05:00.244
It's gonna be y is equal to

00:05:00.244 --> 00:05:04.229
You have your, you could
have your y intercept here,

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.240
the value of y when x is equal to zero,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.002
so it's three times, what's
our common ratio now?

00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:11.696
Well, every time we increase x by one,

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.205
we're multiplying by 1/2

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:18.372
so 1/2 and we're gonna
raise that to the x power.

00:05:22.105 --> 00:05:25.031
And so notice, these
are both exponentials.

00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:28.172
We have some, you could say
y intercept or initial value,

00:05:28.172 --> 00:05:30.323
it is being multiplied
by some common ratio

00:05:30.323 --> 00:05:32.322
to the power x.

00:05:32.322 --> 00:05:34.116
Some common ratio to the power x.

00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:37.582
But notice when you're
growing our common ratio

00:05:37.582 --> 00:05:40.159
and it actually turns
out to be a general idea,

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.133
when you're growing, your common ratio,

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.495
the absolute value of your common ratio

00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:46.624
is going to be greater than one.

00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:47.856
Let me write it down.

00:05:47.856 --> 00:05:49.534
So the absolute value of two in this case

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:50.490
is greater than one.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.847
But when you're shrinking,
the absolute value of it

00:05:53.847 --> 00:05:56.094
is less than one.

00:05:56.094 --> 00:05:57.782
And that makes sense, because if the,

00:05:57.782 --> 00:05:59.507
if you have something
where the absolute value

00:05:59.507 --> 00:06:02.915
is less than one, like 1/2 or 3/4 or 0.9,

00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:04.562
every time you multiply it,

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:07.924
you're gonna get a lower
and lower and lower value.

00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:10.147
And you could actually
see that in a graph.

00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:12.812
Let's graph the same
information right over here.

00:06:12.812 --> 00:06:14.546
And let me do it in a different color.

00:06:14.546 --> 00:06:17.125
I'll do it in a blue color.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:19.082
So when x is equal to negative one,

00:06:19.082 --> 00:06:21.367
y is equal to six.

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:24.994
When x is equal to zero,
y is equal to three.

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:27.966
When x is equal to one, y is equal to 3/2.

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.990
When x is equal to two, y is equal to 3/4.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.385
And so on and so forth.

00:06:33.385 --> 00:06:37.293
And notice, because our common
ratios are the reciprocal

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:39.216
of each other,

00:06:39.216 --> 00:06:42.919
that these two graphs look
like they've been flipped over,

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:44.847
they look like they've
been flipped horizontally

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:47.491
or flipped over the y axis.

00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:51.010
They're symmetric around that y axis.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.631
And what you will see in exponential decay

00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:54.889
is that things will get smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.587
but they'll never quite
exactly get to zero.

00:06:57.587 --> 00:06:58.969
It'll approach zero.

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.333
It'll asymptote towards the x axis

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.537
as x becomes more and more positive.

00:07:03.537 --> 00:07:05.494
Just as for exponential growth,

00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:07.856
if x becomes more and more negative,

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:10.955
we asymptote towards the x axis.

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:12.014
So that's the introduction.

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:15.520
I'd use a very specific
example, but in general,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.903
if you have an equation of
the form y is equal to A

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:21.819
times some common ratio to the x power

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:23.607
We could write it like
that, just to make it

00:07:23.607 --> 00:07:24.640
a little bit clearer.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.213
There's a bunch of different
ways that we could write it.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:29.899
This is going to be exponential growth,

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:33.231
so if the absolute value
of r is greater than one,

00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.774
then we're dealing with growth,

00:07:35.774 --> 00:07:37.631
because every time you multiply,

00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:39.534
every time you increase
x, you're multiplying

00:07:39.534 --> 00:07:42.142
by more and more r's is
one way to think about it.

00:07:42.142 --> 00:07:44.894
And if the absolute value
of r is less than one,

00:07:44.894 --> 00:07:46.920
you're dealing with decay.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.490
You're shrinking as x increases.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.418
And I'll let you think
about what happens when,

00:07:51.418 --> 00:07:54.046
what happens when r is equal to one?

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:57.029
What are we dealing
with in that situation?

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:58.309
And it's a bit of a trick question,

00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:59.236
because it's actually quite,

00:07:59.236 --> 00:08:00.434
oh, I'll just tell you.

00:08:00.434 --> 00:08:03.754
If r is equal to one, well
then, this thing right over here

00:08:03.754 --> 00:08:05.095
is always going to be equal to one

00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:07.742
and you boil down to just
the constant equation,

00:08:07.742 --> 00:08:10.912
y is equal to A, so this would
just be a horizontal line.
