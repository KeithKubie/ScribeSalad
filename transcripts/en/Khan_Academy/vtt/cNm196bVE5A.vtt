00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.950
Let's say last year I put $100
into some type savings account

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.960
in a bank.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.670
So this is a year ago.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.620
And that now today, exactly
one year later, that $100

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.330
has grown to $110.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.143
So this is now.

00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:23.340
So if you look at things just
in the absolute dollar terms,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.210
things have grown by $10.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.070
So I made $10 off of an
original $100 investment.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.410
So I got a 10% return.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.070
But what I want to think
about is does this really

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.670
capture how much more I
can buy with this $110

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850
than I could buy with
that $100 before.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.540
Can I really by 10% more
goods and services today

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.320
than I could a year ago?

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.820
And to think about
that, let's think

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.880
about a hypothetical
inflation rate from last year

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.560
to this year.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.200
So let's say that the
inflation ended up

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.600
being 2% between a
year ago and today.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.530
If that's the case, what is $100
a year ago in today's money?

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.970
Well, if inflation was
2%, then $100 a year

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.490
ago would buy you the same stuff
that $102 would buy you today.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.140
So it would be $102.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:35.750
So what is the dollar
return in today's money,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.910
the current purchasing power?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.100
Well, we're getting $110.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.310
And we invested in
today's money $102.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.850
If we look at it
from today's terms,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.141
we invested something that
gives us the same purchasing

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:52.190
power as $102 today.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.890
And now it's giving us a
purchasing power of $110.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.450
So we've gotten $8 more
of purchasing power

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.140
in today's money.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.705
So what is the
actual real return?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.380
And we can do it
in today's money.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.760
And you could do it either way.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.080
You could discount the 110
back to a year ago money

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.390
and figure out the real
return there, and figure out

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.820
the product actual dollar
return, and do the calculation.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.010
Or you can do it
in today's money.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.660
And maybe I'll do it the
previous way in the next video.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.910
But the real return is we made
$8 over the course of the year

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.170
in today's money.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.120
And what we originally invested
in today's money was $102.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.340
And so we get our
calculator out.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.020
8 divided by 102 is 7.8%.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.812
So this is equal to 7.8%.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.510
So even though the
nominal return, if we just

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.040
look at what we got in
exchange for what we invested,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.980
even though the
nominal return was 10%,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.210
because there was 2% inflation
our actual purchasing power

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.183
only increased by 7.8%.
