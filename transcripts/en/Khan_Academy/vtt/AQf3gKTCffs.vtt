00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.855
- [Instructor] So one
question that biologists

00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:04.013
have long asked is how do plants know

00:00:04.013 --> 00:00:07.365
what to do at different times of the year?

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.037
And one mechanism by which they know,

00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:12.441
kind of, you could say,
what time of year it is,

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:15.604
is through photoperiodism,
photo for light,

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:17.925
and then period you could think of length,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.939
the length of the light,
or another way of thinking

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.387
about it, based on the day length.

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:26.804
And an often cited
example of photoperiodism

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:30.517
is that many plants
figure out when to flower

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:33.144
based on the length of the day.

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:36.588
Certain plants flower
when the days are long,

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:40.038
those are naturally
called long day plants,

00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:43.194
and there are certain
flowers, actually flower

00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:45.295
when the day is short, and those

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.261
are logically called short day plants.

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.061
So the day length seems
to have something to do,

00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:56.205
somehow regulates when the
plants actually flower,

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:58.596
but how does the plant actually do that?

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:01.910
How does it respond to
the length of the day?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.183
Well, different experiments
have been performed,

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.550
and for example, short day plants,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.634
let me scroll down here
to look at an experiment

00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:13.701
dealing with short day
plants, so it turns out

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:16.179
that short day plants,
when you look at this,

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.850
actually let's just look at the data

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.900
before I explain what's going on here.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.332
So this is just the hours of the day,

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:25.027
this is midnight, and then
we get back to midnight,

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:28.217
I guess that's one way to think about it,

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:31.548
and we can see here that
this is a short day plant

00:01:31.548 --> 00:01:34.371
because when the day is short,
when it's only eight hours

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.407
and the night is long, this plant flowers.

00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:40.110
So this one flowers, and when
it's the other way around,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.020
when the day is long
and the night is short,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.187
well, it doesn't flower, and
so this is a short day plant.

00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:53.972
And so an interesting question is,

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.969
is it the length of the
day that is dictating

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.798
whether the plant is flowering,

00:01:58.798 --> 00:02:00.833
or is it the length of the night

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.480
that is dictating whether
the plant is flowering?

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.311
And it turns out that for
many short day plants,

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:10.607
often, actually most of the
ones that have been studied,

00:02:10.607 --> 00:02:13.800
that if you have one of these short days

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.505
but you interrupt the
night with just a little

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:19.604
brief moment of sunlight,
just a few minutes of sunlight

00:02:19.604 --> 00:02:22.585
right over here, the
plant will not flower.

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:25.503
And so one conclusion that
you can take from this

00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:28.589
is it's actually not so
much the length of the day

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.479
because if it was just
the length of the day

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.625
it would make sense that
it would still flower here.

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.435
But it's actually the length
of an uninterrupted night.

00:02:35.435 --> 00:02:38.156
How long does the night
last without interruption

00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:40.323
from some type of a light?

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:44.783
And so this tells us that
these short day plants,

00:02:44.783 --> 00:02:48.816
it's actually more dependent
on the night length.

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:52.798
Night length, so you could
think of a short day plant

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:55.864
as a long night plant, but as we know,

00:02:55.864 --> 00:02:59.078
and over here we can see that
when you interrupt the day,

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.715
that doesn't make the difference,

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:03.594
the plant doesn't all of
a sudden start flowering

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:05.730
when it says, oh, I got
a little bit of darkness

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.407
in my day, my day has
been broken up somewhere.

00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:10.762
So this type of result,
when these experiments

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:12.945
have been performed, make us think, okay,

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.109
at least for many short
day plants it seems

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.144
like night length is
what actually matters.

00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:20.565
Now, for other types of plants,

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:22.724
and in everything I talk
about, this isn't absolute,

00:03:22.724 --> 00:03:26.051
it's not that all short
day plants operate one way

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.483
or all long day plants
operate another way,

00:03:29.483 --> 00:03:31.604
but this is to give you
a sense of the various

00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:35.070
mechanisms we find in the world around us.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.260
So for example, many long
day plants actually do

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.006
operate on the day, actually,
let me write this down.

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.012
So long day plants, you can
think of them in two groups,

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:49.291
there are the ones that are
dependent on night length,

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.104
so night length, and so,

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:54.698
a long day plant that's
dependent on night length,

00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:57.624
you could call it a short night plant.

00:03:57.624 --> 00:04:00.487
Short night, and these are called,

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:03.070
these are called dark dominant.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:05.796
Dark dominant.

00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:10.194
But you have other long day plants,

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:12.836
plants that might flower
when the days are longer,

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.375
say as we are entering the summer,

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:18.918
that actually are dependent on day length.

00:04:18.918 --> 00:04:21.576
And sometimes it's not
just the photoperiod,

00:04:21.576 --> 00:04:23.997
it's not just the day
length that is dictating

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.429
some type of biological process,

00:04:26.429 --> 00:04:30.277
it's day length plus
some other type of thing.

00:04:30.277 --> 00:04:33.940
So, plus other things
that might factor into it.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.574
And this type of thing
where you have day length,

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:38.855
or when you have some external cue,

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:40.803
plus maybe some other cues,

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:43.123
maybe some of these are
internal biological cues,

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.503
this is called an external
coincidence model,

00:04:45.503 --> 00:04:48.405
because the external factors
coinciding with maybe

00:04:48.405 --> 00:04:50.809
something that is happening internal.

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.559
And an example of that is a plant

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.260
where it produces mRNA every day,

00:05:00.054 --> 00:05:03.155
every day as the day starts to end,

00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:07.968
it starts to produce mRNA, and
this mRNA codes for protein,

00:05:07.968 --> 00:05:10.468
this is the Arabidopsis plant,

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.676
I can never pronounce things well,

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:17.099
but in the Arabidopsis
plant it produces every day,

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.287
this is just part of its circadian cycle.

00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:21.473
Circadian cycle is just this daily cycle,

00:05:21.473 --> 00:05:23.694
you can see that it
produces, it starts producing

00:05:23.694 --> 00:05:27.151
a lot of this CONSTANS gene mRNA

00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:31.522
and this CONSTANS mRNA
produces the CONSTANS protein,

00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:34.768
I'lljust call that CO for short,

00:05:34.768 --> 00:05:37.471
and the CONSTANS protein,
once it gets to a high

00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:42.204
enough threshold, the plant
is going to start flowering.

00:05:42.204 --> 00:05:44.329
And I'm oversimplifying the mechanism,

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:46.650
as all biological mechanisms
we see, when you dig down,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.864
it's a lot more detailed than this,

00:05:48.864 --> 00:05:50.811
but this gives you the general sense.

00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:52.267
But what happened, you might say, okay,

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.891
well if this is happening every day,

00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:58.165
if during the daytime I guess you can say,

00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:00.925
the mRNA levels are low,
but then as we get further

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:03.864
and further into the day,
the mRNA levels go up

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:07.614
and we start producing
this CONSTANS protein,

00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:12.503
if you start producing a bunch
of this CONSTANS protein,

00:06:12.503 --> 00:06:15.730
why doesn't this thing flower every day?

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.119
And the answer is when
this CONSTANS protein

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.798
gets higher and higher
but there isn't light,

00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:25.473
it just naturally gets degraded.

00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:28.076
It just naturally gets degraded.

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:32.246
So in the situation that
I'm drawing right over here,

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:36.425
if this is a shorter day,
well, this plant won't flower.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:40.592
But if we have a longer day,
if we have a longer day,

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:45.462
let me make the day a
little bit longer now,

00:06:45.462 --> 00:06:49.755
so if we have a longer day, so
if this day were to continue,

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:54.434
well, that triggers proteins
that actually protect

00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:59.321
these CONSTANS protein and
keeps them from being degraded.

00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:02.271
And so in this longer day situation,

00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:05.767
so in this longer day situation,

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:08.593
make it clear that the day
has gotten longer here,

00:07:08.593 --> 00:07:10.824
these things won't be
degraded, you can think of it

00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:12.886
as the light is triggering
things that are protecting

00:07:12.886 --> 00:07:15.725
these proteins, and so in
this longer day scenario,

00:07:15.725 --> 00:07:19.892
these things, this Arabidopsis
plant will actually flower.

00:07:22.938 --> 00:07:26.235
So the whole point of this
video is to appreciate

00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:30.565
that photoperiod can
affect whether a plant

00:07:30.565 --> 00:07:32.506
does something like flowering or not,

00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:34.906
and flowering isn't the
only biological process

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:37.135
that might be dictated by day length,

00:07:37.135 --> 00:07:40.013
and day length isn't the
only way of cueing to a plant

00:07:40.013 --> 00:07:42.989
what time of year it is or
whether it should regulate.

00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:44.799
And sometimes it's a
combination of things,

00:07:44.799 --> 00:07:48.654
sometimes it's a circadian
rhythm combined with day length,

00:07:48.654 --> 00:07:50.935
and we've also seen sometimes
it's not the day length

00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:54.867
but it actually might be the
night length that matters most.
