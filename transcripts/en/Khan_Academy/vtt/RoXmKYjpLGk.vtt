00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.580
Welcome back.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.340
I just want to do a couple more
of these problems, just so you,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.440
I guess, see a few couple more
problems and get some practice.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.040
So let's start with
another problem.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.440
As always, let me
draw my triangle.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.270
I always like to draw
it a little different

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.240
to confuse you.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:34.410
Let's say that this angle
up here is 0.36 radians.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.990
An angle is 0.36 radians, and
then this side right here, this

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.390
top side-- let me do it in a
different color-- this top side

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:53.190
in pink is square root of
73 units long or whatever.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.800
It could be inches or
feet or whatever.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.690
But it's square root
of 73 units long.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.060
So my question is, what is this
side here, this green side?

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.350
Well, how did we do this
type of problem last time?

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.600
We should figure out what
sides we're dealing with.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.040
Are we dealing with the
adjacent and the opposite, the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460
adjacent and the hypotenuse,
the opposite and the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.050
hypotenuse, and then we'll know
which trig functions we

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.370
should be dealing with.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.960
So we know this side, this pink
side-- and this pink side, it

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.090
should be almost second
nature by now, is the

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.450
hypotenuse, right?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.050
It's the longest side, and it's
opposite the right angle.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.600
So we know the hypotenuse,
and what are we solving for?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.480
Well, this is the angle we
know, so we're solving

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.000
for the opposite side.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.520
So we're solving for the
opposite side, and we know the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.000
hypotenuse, so what trig
function will we probably use?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.360
Let's write out our mnemonic.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.540
SOH CAH TOA.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.120
So what did I say before?

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.600
We're solving for the opposite
sign, and we know the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.245
hypotenuse, so we are going to
use the opposite and

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:02.470
the hypotenuse.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.600
So which of these is that?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.200
The opposite and the
hypotenuse, the o

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.420
and the h, right?

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.460
It's SOH, right?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.250
And SOH says that sine is
equal to the opposite

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.180
over the hypotenuse.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.050
Sine of an angle-- in this
case, it's this angle-- sine of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.900
0.36 radians-- remember, this
is radians we're dealing with,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.910
not degrees-- is equal
to the opposite side.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.730
And the opposite side is this
green side right here, so I'll

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.920
just write opposite instead of
writing o because o would look

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.720
like a 0-- is equal to the
opposite side over the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.470
hypotenuse, right?

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.920
This is just sine is equal to
opposite over hypotenuse.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.130
Well, what's the
hypotenuse length?

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.240
Well, it's the
square root of 73.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.970
These are p's, by the way.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.850
I know they don't look
like p's, but opposite.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.350
So the opposite side-- we're
just multiplying both sides by

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.680
the square root of 73-- is
equal to the square root of 73

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.200
times the sine of 0.36 radians.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.450
Now, once again, I don't know
what the sign of 0.36 radians

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.440
is in my head, but I'll
tell you the answer.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.000
The sine of 0.36 radians is
equal to-- I'm just rewriting

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.630
this-- the sine of 0.36
radians, if you looked it up on

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.550
a table or if you used your
calculator in radian mode, is 3

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.870
square roots of 73 over 73.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.560
And, of course, your calculator
is going to give you

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.420
something-- it'll give
you some decimal number.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.390
I won't write it this way.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.470
So just remember, this is this.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.490
And I just looked that up.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.270
There's no magic there.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.740
And the square root-- or you
could use a calculator.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.020
On the Khan Academy, when you
do problems, it'll actually

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.270
tell you what it is, so you
don't have to use a calculator.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.350
So now we just simplify.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.660
Square root of 73 times square
root of 73 is 73 over 73 is

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.760
equal to 1, so these
all cancel out.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.340
And we get the answer of 3.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.510
So this side right here is 3.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.900
And just out of curiosity, if
you wanted to solve for this

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.460
side, there's two ways
we could do it, right?

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.680
We could use the Pythagorean
theorem, because, you know, a

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.520
squared plus b squared is
equal to c squared, or we

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.510
could use trigonometry.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.400
I'll let you guess
what trig function--

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.490
actually, let's do that.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.330
Let's figure out that side
using trigonometry, and then

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.200
let's figure out that side
using the Pythagorean theorem,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.600
just to show that everything
fits together in math.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.660
So I wrote that 3 there, so I
can erase all of this stuff.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.050
Let me erase it.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.840
I shouldn't have
erased the SOHCAHTOA.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.570
Actually, we should have
that memorized by now.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.920
SOHCAHTOA.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.560
All right, so let's figure out
what this orange side is here.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.150
And if you think about it, we
could do it a bunch of ways.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.110
We could say, well, this is
the adjacent side, right?

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.990
Because we know the opposite
and we know the hypotenuse.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.020
So we could either use-- we
know the opposite, so we could

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.260
say what trig function uses the
opposite and the adjacent?

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.540
Well, that's tangent
function, right?

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:35.970
So we could say tangent
of 0.36-- let's call

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.110
this side A, right?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.720
A for adjacent.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.210
Tangent of 0.36 is equal
to the opposite, 3, over

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.770
the adjacent, over A.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.720
Is there another trigonometry
way we could think about this?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.580
Well, we also know
the hypotenuse.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.730
What trig function uses the
hypotenuse and the adjacent?

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.940
Well, if you remember,
SOH CAH TOA.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.730
CAH, cosine is adjacent
over hypotenuse.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:11.260
So we could say cosine of
0.36 is equal to adjacent

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.040
over square root of 73.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.630
And I'll just write SOHCAHTOA
here, just so you can

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.900
confirm what I'm doing.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.660
The TOA says the tangent is
equal to the opposite, 3, over

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.840
the adjacent, and CAH tells us
the cosine is equal to the

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.810
adjacent over the hypotenuse.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.300
So we could solve
either one of these.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.820
If we use the second formula,
we would get the adjacent side

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.980
is equal to the square root of
73 times the cosine of 0.36,

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.610
and then if you use your
calculator in radian mode, or

00:06:51.610 --> 00:07:01.650
I'll just tell you, that cosine
of 0.36 radians is equal to 8

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.810
square roots of 73 over 73.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.300
And you can confirm that by
getting a decimal number and

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.780
then-- making sure once again
your calculator is not in

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.880
degree mode, but
in radian mode.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.370
I think that's actually the
default mode in a lot of

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:15.960
calculators-- and
solving for this.

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.720
But once again, the 73, this
square root of 73 times this

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.100
square root of 73, is equal to
73, and then divided by 73.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.720
These all cancel out.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.320
How convenient, huh?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.460
And you get 8.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.220
So the adjacent side
is equal to 8.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.500
And so if we'd solved for A
here using the tangent

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.300
function, we should've also
gotten the adjacent

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:37.570
side is equal to 8.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.510
And just to show you that
everything works out from other

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:49.250
concepts, let me show you this
using the Pythagorean theorem.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:08:03.100
So 8 squared plus 3
squared should equal

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.970
the hypotenuse squared.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.100
The square root of 73 squared.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.530
Well, 8 squared is 64 plus 9
should equal-- what's the

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.820
square root of 73 squared?

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.690
Right, it's 73.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.250
And, of course,
64 plus 9 is 73.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.600
And sure enough, that
equals 73, so it works.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.470
Isn't that interesting how math
just kind of fits together?

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.180
I think at this point you're
ready to try the modules, the

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.790
Trigonometry II modules, and I
guess let me know if you

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.510
have any problems, or if you
want to see more videos.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.010
Have fun!
