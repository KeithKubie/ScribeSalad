00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.540
[Captions by Mary V. at Y Translator]
In today's video, we're going
to be taking a look at pulleys.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.980
One of the classic six simple machines.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.120
We'll take some measurements,
demonstrating how they work,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.080
and then we'll try building a scale model
of an electricity free elevator.

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.790
A pulley is one of what
renaissance scientists

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.920
referred to as the six basic machines.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.480
Six mechanical devices that
helped you change the direction

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.150
or magnitude of a force.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.950
The other five are a lever, a wheel and axle,
an inclined plane, a wedge and a screw.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.390
Today, we'll be looking at pulleys
and taking some measurements

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.550
with this fish scale to see what
happens to the different weights

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.320
on a rope as it runs
through one or more pulleys.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.320
After that, the plan is to build a scale
model of something I came up with

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680
a few years ago and maybe
other people have come up with it

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.220
hundreds of times before me.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.180
But the idea is to make an elevator
that uses just weights, ropes

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.100
and pulleys and no electricity.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.280
Here's the idea.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.360
A fixed weight will have two separate
pulley systems attached to it.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.120
One that makes it so you could
ride the other end of the rope up.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.950
And one that makes it so you
could write it back down.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.430
First off, we need a frame
that we can attach stuff to.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.452
So I've got a bunch of scrap
wood and we're going to start

00:01:05.452 --> 00:01:06.440
throwing some stuff together.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:31.180
[Music]

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.640
This is not the most
official-looking construction ever.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.140
Some pieces are kind of twisted
and warped and it's just not flat.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.520
That's because this is literally
just thrown together from pieces

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:43.020
that I already had just in my scrap
pile but it should work pretty well.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.630
The important thing is that this end
over here can take a good amount

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.860
of weight and we can do our tests on this.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.460
Here's the first pulley we're
going to do some tests with.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.940
It's designed to just be permanently
attached onto something.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.060
It doesn't move around
like some other kinds of pulleys.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.000
It just stays in one spot
but that's exactly what we want at first.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.600
[Music]

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.280
We've got our pulley attached
and we've got a thin cord

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.670
running through the pulley.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460
We're now going to attach
that on to this little clip.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.020
That's just to make
things a little bit easier

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.180
as we're disconnecting
and reconnecting stuff.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.960
We have here a fishing scale.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.800
We've got here what is
supposed to be a 10-pound weight.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.540
This is just sort of
a barbell exercise weight.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.980
We're going to just hook that on
with this little rope and see

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.100
what measurement
our scale gives us.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.120
10.17 pounds for those who are curious.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.620
That is 4.6 kilos,

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.420
so we can see just over 10 pounds.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.940
It could be that the weight
has a little bit of extra on it.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.890
It could be that this fish scale is
not 100% accurate but it's pretty close.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.020
It's supposed to be 10 pounds.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.540
It's showing up as almost 10 pounds.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.880
Now let's see what happens if we
connect this to our pulley system

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.120
and then use our scale to pull on that.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.030
All right. Let's add a little bit of a loop
into our rope right here so that we

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.600
can hook our scale on to it.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.480
Pull on the loop, weight goes up.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.160
All right turn our scale on.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.660
The scale is going to be upside down,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.440
but we should still be
able to see the numbers.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.440
So it was 10.17 pounds.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.880
10.17.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.870
We got exactly the same read out.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.780
A single fixed pulley does
change the direction of the force

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.100
but it doesn't change
the magnitude of the force.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.700
I've now got a 7.5 pound weight
with a hook attached to it,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.240
and we're going to put that
through the loop instead of our scale,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.310
and what we're going to see is that it's not
heavy enough to pull the 10-pound weight.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.020
Of course it's not.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.940
10 pounds is more than 7 and 1/2 pounds.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.400
Drop it the other way.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.920
We can see that the 10-pound weight is
of course enough to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.780
lift the lighter weight.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.730
With our 7 and 1/2 pound weight
attached to one end, if we now

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.790
attach the fish-scale to the same
spot, it's not going to take as much

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.650
pull because it's already got the weight.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.300
Same deal.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.240
We've got static friction coefficient to
overcome but we can see that what

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.020
we're getting on the scale varies
between about one and a half pounds

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.320
and well I think we got up to 6 there.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.700
But an equilibrium does seem to
be at about two and a half pounds,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.060
which is exactly what
we would expect to see.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.300
Let's change things up and try
attaching a single movable pulley to our

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.860
weight instead of one fixed pulley above.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.879
We've got our 10-pound weight,
we have a pulley attached

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.060
to the top of the weight.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.900
On one end, our cord is
just attached to the beam.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.639
It's not running through this pulley.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.140
It's just on the beam.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.960
Separate from that.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.400
And the other side we can
just pull with our hands.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.750
So how hard are we going to have to
pull on this rope in order to get

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.780
that weight to lift off the ground?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.240
Well let's look at it.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.020
If it's just suspended in the air.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.480
We know we have 10 pounds
of weight hanging down,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.820
and we've got two cords,

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.600
that means each cord
should have five pounds on it.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.720
And that's not really going to change.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.840
Even if we're pulling it up and down.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.360
We should still have five pounds
are suspended in this cord,

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.660
and five pounds suspended in this cord.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.060
Here we go.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.240
Here's our scale.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.880
Pull till the weight starts
lifting and we are at about 5 pounds.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.639
We pull really fast for a second.

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.449
It might register as even higher
but for the most part we get

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.820
approximately five pounds of force
necessary to lift this 10-pound weight.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.479
Now with our single movable pulley
system it cuts the weight down in half

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.279
but of course there has
to be a trade-off.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.180
You can see that if I move my hand,
I'm grabbing the rope right at the pulley.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.020
If I lift it from here,
all the way up to this beam,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.050
the weight didn't move
the whole distance to the beam.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.460
The weight moved half
of the distance to the beam.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.659
So it only takes half as much
force to lift this weight off the ground

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.820
but it only moves half as far.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.879
There has to be a trade-off and you
can't remove the amount of work it takes

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.280
to get that weight
up to its final height.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.460
And see to raise it all the way up,

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.180
my hand has to travel
twice the height of the weight.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.479
But now we have an issue back to where
we first started before we'd even

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.090
come up with the pulley in the first
place is that we're lifting up.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.930
Sure it's easier to lift up than it was
before but we're still pulling up

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.360
which is not as easy
of a motion as pulling down.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.740
So we can run it
through the fixed pulley again.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.920
And now we can pull down.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.860
And lift the weight up.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.120
The fixed pulley doesn't
change the magnitude

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.410
but it does change the direction.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.460
So this takes five pounds pulling up.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.300
That means this takes
five pounds pulling down.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.860
And of course if we move the entire
distance from the top pulley

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.980
to the bottom pulley,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.760
our weight moves
approximately half that distance.

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.760
I have to go back and pull it a
second time to get it all the way up.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.480
I've got a couple more pulleys so I'm
going to add another one to the top,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.110
another one to our weight and see
if we can reduce how much we

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.900
have to pull on this even more.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.500
All right.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500
The cord starts fixed
on one end of the beam.

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:54.469
It's going down through the first pulley
up through the fixed pulley on the top.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.220
Now we're going to come back down
through the second movable pulley

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.120
on the weight.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.820
And then we're going to go back
up to this newly fixed pulley.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.080
It's feeling pretty lightweight to me.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.160
Let's check how much it takes
to move this with two moving

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.900
pulleys and two fixed pulleys.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.420
It's showing up as anywhere
between one and a quarter pounds,

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.069
and almost four and
a half to overcome friction.

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:26.520
But what we should be looking at is
one quarter of the total weight

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.260
that would be two and a half pounds.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.699
Previously we attached our
seven and a half pound weight

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:34.729
to a single fixed pulley system.

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:37.220
And of course the 10-pound
weight lifted it right up.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.183
But now we've got a
system of moving pulleys,

00:07:40.183 --> 00:07:42.300
and we should see the opposite effect.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.900
Quite a bit in fact.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.540
There is very little resistance
there the seven and a half pound

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.780
weight just plummets to the ground

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.860
lifting the 10-pound weight 1/4 of
the distance to the pulleys at the top.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.520
Several years ago while I was just
doing some doodles, drawings,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.340
messing around with how
pulleys systems work,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.289
I thought of this idea that you

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:04.920
might be able to use
pulleys and weights

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.660
to build a sort of elevator.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.380
The concept I thought was pretty fun.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.860
And so what I wanted to do
is build a scale model.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.920
And it's not just one weight
that would lift you back up.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.260
It's a weight that has two
separate systems attached to it.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.260
One where the weight is
attached to a single fixed pulley,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.880
so the weight would pull you up,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.260
and another system
run at the same time

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.660
that has a movable pulley
and a fixed pulley.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.780
So your weight would
overcome the counterweight,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.180
and you could ride it back down.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.940
[Music]

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.640
We have our system all set up.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.440
We've got a 10-pound weight with two
separate pulley systems attached to it.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.450
The black one is a single fixed
pulley so it's not

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.640
changing the magnitude.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.240
It's still an even ten pound pull.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.260
But it is changing the direction.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.540
The weight goes down,
it pulls the rope up.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.420
The movable pulley changes our
magnitude dividing it in half

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.242
and the fixed pulley
changes the direction

00:08:58.242 --> 00:09:01.660
so that it's still the opposite direction
as the movement of the weight.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.080
So imagining that this whole thing
is a scaled-down tree-house,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.120
this weight represents the weight,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.842
this 7 pound weight represents the
person or you know, we'll say me,

00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:15.340
and this represents
the little ledge in the treehouse

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.340
of the treehouse itself.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.340
This is actually non-functional.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.120
It's just there to prove a point.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.960
The black cord which is on the fixed
pulley and that is currently

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.550
tied to something on the ground.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.540
And this little loop is where
our person can grab a hold.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.540
Now as we untie the rope from
where it's wrapped around this screw,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.980
 

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.240
the heavier weight takes over.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.960
Lifting this weight well almost
all the way up to this platform.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.660
Like I said this is just illustrative.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.980
We can just say that they
can climb on from there.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.160
Yay!

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.940
We have climbed up onto our platform.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.080
Just as we wanted.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.680
But now you need to get down
in the weight is all the way down there.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.560
So what you do, is you
clip into the other system,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.540
and climb out of the treehouse.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.440
You are now gently lowered down to the
ground by the pulley system and the weights.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.840
Of course the weight is now only
halfway there in the loop to

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.960
get back up is way out of reach.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.140
So what you need to do is just keep
pulling on the orange cord,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.200
lift your weight all the way back
to the top until you can reach

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.100
the loop for the other side again.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.680
This is actually one set up where
you would be glad that the pulleys

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.430
aren't 100% frictionless.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.680
If they were perfect pulleys then
as you jumped out of the tree house,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.560
you would actually still
drop at the full speed of gravity.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.180
You would hit the ground holding
a rope that took a whole bunch of your

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.170
weight off so it wouldn't be
like hitting the ground full speed

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.700
normally jumping out of the tree house.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.800
Your legs wouldn't be supporting
your whole weight but it'd still

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.020
probably be pretty scary to be
rushing in at the ground that quickly.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.420
Overall, the idea does work pretty
well and I hope that I get a chance

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.240
in the future to try this out
as a full-scale treehouse elevator.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.090
Guys thanks for watching,
and we've got more for you to see.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.060
The box up at the top will
take you to our last video.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.300
You should go check that out.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.100
The bottom box will show you what
YouTube thinks you need to be watching next,

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.600
and if you hit this bomb in the middle,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.140
you'd be subscribed to our channel
so you never miss out on a video.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.260
Don't forget to ring that bell
and we will see you in the next one.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.880
Talk to you then.
