00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These two elements over here are called the lower quartile and guess what--the upper quartile.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And in fact this range in between the upper quartile minus the lower one is called the interquartile range.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So this range is the data we used to calculate things such as the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
mean and data outside this range are the north.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is a simple but often very effective outlier removal technique that gives results extremely

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that often are attributed to things other than what you're trying to understand.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Obviously this works well because there's exactly 11 items in our data.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If there were only 10 items, you would've to shift this element around and you'll break a little bit

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of the symmetry but that's not a big deal because most of the results are very large.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now assuming it works for 11, give me the next number up that also works.
