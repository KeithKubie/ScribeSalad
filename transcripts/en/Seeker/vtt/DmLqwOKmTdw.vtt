00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Ughh...Is it hot in here

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
or is it just me?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.800
 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.620
Hey everyone! Thanks for watching DNews

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.620
I'm Julia. And I'm Trace

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.520
Humans are warm blooded, so you would think that

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.520
we would be warm all the time,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.000
but that's actually not what warm blooded means.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.920
There are those of us who are, well, cold all

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920
the time. But that doesn't mean we're cold blooded.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920
Cold blooded animal's body temperatures

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.920
are subject to the temperature of the room they're

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.900
in, whether that's the forest,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.840
sitting in the sun, or hanging out in the cozy

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.840
kitchen. On the other hand, warm blooded

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.840
animals have the ability to internally

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
regulate their body temperatures, independent

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.840
of their environment. It's called being

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.820
homeothermic, and it's common in

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.800
mammals. Humans average around 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.800
cats and dogs have around 101

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
or 102. Dolphins are around 95.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.400
Lions are over 102,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.000
but note that I said "average".

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Body temperatures can range, and in humans

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
women are usually colder than men

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
and older people are colder than younger.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.400
Temperature regulation starts in the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.400
brain and is controlled by hormones.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400
The brain takes into account the body's core

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
temperature and the temperature of the

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
outer skin. Fatter people tend

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400
to feel warmer because their core

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400
organs are all toasty. Though

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400
their extremities are colder. While

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.380
people with lower BMI's tend to feel

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
colder because blood pumped through the extremities

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
needs to be really warmed up

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.300
when it gets back. Warming the blood is the

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
major way we can regulate our internal

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300
temperatures. When thermoregulator cells

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300
in our skin detect a cold environment

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.400
they constrict our capillaries and blood vessels

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.000
in a process called vasoconstriction.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This can cause the flow to slow as little

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
as 0.02 liters per minute

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the far-flung parts of the body,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the highest can be 2-3 meters per

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
minute. The lack of warm blood is what

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
makes my hand and feet cold,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.400
and yours too.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.400
Yes, which of course has to do with the amount

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
of body fat, but also has to do that

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
women's bodies work harder to keep their core

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.600
body temperatures up, in comparison

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600
to men. This leaves fewer energy

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.000
resources to warm the extremities.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Human biology dictates that men tend to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.900
have more muscle mass and women tend to have

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.900
more fat. The working of muscle

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.900
generates heat, while fat cells store it.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.900
Researchers at the University of Utah

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.900
measured the temperatures of men and women's

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.900
hands and found men's hands

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.900
were 90 degrees on average, while

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900
women's were 87.2

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.900
And a study in The Lancet found the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900
hormone estrogen is part of this

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.400
temperature regulation system too,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.400
which is a whole other bag of

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
cats. During the menstrual cycle,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.000
a woman's body can change as much as 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which is a huge difference when you're talking about the

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
core temperature of a human.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Age, diet, exercise and sleep will

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
also effect body temperatures

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.400
and the amount of warm blood getting to our extremities.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.200
People who are more active tend to have

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200
warmer hands and feet overall than those

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.000
who don't. People who smoke have more vasoconstriction

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.180
cooling the extremities. When you fall asleep

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.100
women's body temperatures lower more

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.960
rapidly than men's. Of course

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.960
some of this is person to person

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.960
dependent. My feet are frozen

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960
at night, but during the day

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960
I'm always hot. And it's

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.960
not even just about being physically hot,

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.960
it's also our perception of temperature

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.960
which affects our feelings of

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.200
whether we're hot. Right! If you're surrounded

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.200
by people you are comfortable with you'll feel

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.200
warmer. Also, a Canadian study

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.200
found people who are lonely or feel

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.200
isolated are more aware of a

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.160
cold body temperature, while socially

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.160
connected people tend to feel

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.160
warmer. That's true. What about you guys,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.040
are you always hot? Are you always cold?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.040

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.040
over here about whether shivering

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.040
could help you lose weight.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.040
Thanks for watching DNews, see you later, guys!
