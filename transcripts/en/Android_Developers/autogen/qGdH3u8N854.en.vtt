00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.670
 Tom Greensted: Hello and welcome. 

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.680
 My name is Tom Greenstedt, 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.590
 I am the collective product manager for mobile devices 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:04.340
 The Guardian. " 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.450
 I am really aware that I have given the short word 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.440
 At its closing session today, 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.510
 So I will limit my words as much as possible, to some extent 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.720
 You drink a drink. 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.570
 I'll talk about how 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.590
 We tried, specifically the application team over the past year, 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.630
 Provide some new work methods that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.070
 Emerging creativity lies in 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.237
 Development teams themselves. 

00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:30.070
 It seems that the industry in general has taken 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.236
 A really long time, to be frank, publishing industry, 

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:36.180
 In particular to accommodate that development 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.290
 Is a creative process in itself, 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.560
 And that teams of software developers and designers 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.220
 They actually have creative ideas. 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.310
 And that what we bet on is the real attempt to extract this creative energy. 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.410
 There are now many different ways to free ideas 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.475
 And try to put features to the public, 

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:53.320
 There are also many different ways to graphically draw them. 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.770
 But for the occasion of the purpose of the word 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.940
 I will draw it graphically on two different axes, 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.190
 On the X axis, we have 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.810
 There is a self-generated creativity - ideas 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.570
 Which you create yourself, 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.850
 And trying to implement them. 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090
 At the other end, we have creativity 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.940
 The supposed - the things that others give you. 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.770
 On the Y axis, we have a payoff on business. 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.899
 So, we have features that are deployed 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.440
 Ultimately, it will achieve high business value and high value 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.340
 Users. 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.590
 It should be noted that these two things 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.120
 Synonymous, and here we have things of low value, 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.470
 They are either things that do not appoint anyone 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.420
 Or which do not benefit the business at all. 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.920
 So, I will 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.580
 Highlight some of the different ways we have worked 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.030
 And how to draw a statement on the two different axes. 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.680
 Well, what could be a good example of the right upper side? 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.252
 Well, the strategic features, right? 

00:01:47.252 --> 00:01:48.710
 If they have strategic features, they are 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.520
 Maybe it is very, very high value 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.150
 Because they work in parallel with the entire business strategy, 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.040
 As they are probably, imposed ideas where 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.260
 The business is required by the team to implement them. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.340
 In our case, it may be, team, that we want to 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.619
 Many more users log in to the app. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 So, we get something like unfinished business. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.090
 I will now discuss the backlog, 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.010
 The tendency towards self-innovation to a small extent, 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.459
 Because software developers, especially those working in flexible teams 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.125
 They can choose which cards they think 

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:18.610
 Really important. 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.780
 But find themselves imposed on them things, 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.490
 People like me are trying to arrange the backlog. 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.560
 Then we find bad ideas, 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.300
 Bad ideas tend to, 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.480
 Especially from senior management - 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.550
 I am recognized for this - to impose low-value creativity. 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.120
 We really need to do this, team. 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.420
 Crap, it's a failure. 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.780
 Then we find mistakes and responsibility. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.090
 I was trying now to locate a place to put this. 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.417
 Well, the teams at "The Guardian" 

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:54.000
 To guide the genuine care of product quality, 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.880
 So they find individual mistakes, 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.254
 The individual religion then adds it when they think that 

00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.780
 Really important. 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.435
 These things are of little value individually. 

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:04.060
 And yet I do not want you to think 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.270
 I say that quality is not important. 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.070
 Quite the opposite - quality is crucial. 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.610
 If we talk about it in general, you might go up there, 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.720
 But when viewed on an individual basis, 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.590
 They reflect relatively low quality, 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.810
 But it is more self-inflicted. 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.110
 Now, we will move on to talk about innovation days. 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.750
 Raise your hands if you know what is the day of innovation? 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.300
 Well, not the big number. 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.495
 Raise your hands if you already participate in the innovation day? 

00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.750
 Well, almost the same number. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.415
 Well, innovation day is 

00:03:32.415 --> 00:03:34.540
 Day assembling a large number of developers in a single room, 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.430
 She says to them, set out and created something new and made an offer in the end. 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.830
 So it is in some respects the clearest example 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.090
 For self-generated creativity. 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.450
 Now, innovation day projects are often very valuable. 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.325
 In fact, The Guardian has an internal software package 

00:03:49.325 --> 00:03:52.560
 Analytical called Ophan, it's amazing, 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.830
 It's a great, 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.150
 It was the product of one of our innovation days. 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.170
 But often - so it's worth saying 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.920
 That it should be placed at the top here, 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.840
 But mostly innovation projects are not arranged 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.384
 Within strategic objectives 

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:06.550
 Because it is really an opportunity for software developers 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.810
 For start and creativity. 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.400
 Sometimes ideas are great, 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400
 But insufficient resources are available to support them, 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.290
 It can not be implemented because of other things 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.670
 Conducted by the business. 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.350
 Sometimes these days are frankly an opportunity for the crowd to entertain. 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.880
 Sometimes, ideas of innovation days are very, very valuable. 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.330
 However, innovation days often have low returns 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.475
 For the long-term value of the business 

00:04:27.475 --> 00:04:29.600
 Now I'm talking about a specific feature, 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.766
 There are a lot of really good reasons 

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.750
 To hold innovation days - to give an opportunity to software developers 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.950
 To work together. 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.890
 It's a really great way to make people who 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.770
 They do not talk to each other talking. 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.020
 But if you're only interested in individual features, 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.612
 The innovation days themselves are not long enough 

00:04:46.612 --> 00:04:48.820
 It is not focused enough to produce consistent returns 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.528
 Of the business. 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.750
 So for me, the most important question is, what suits this place? 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.940
 You can access the way to work 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.990
 They are of very high value 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.300
 And liberate the inherent creativity in the development teams, 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.600
 And are really good returns on business? 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.820
 For us, the thing that fits this question mark 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.429
 Is the construction week. 

00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:13.970
 Now the construction week, as you probably guess 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.340
 It's a bit like a day of innovation but instead of just inventing 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.673
 Something as fast as you can to view it 

00:05:18.673 --> 00:05:20.220
 To the public, you create it 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.190
 To the stage where the principle can be tested. 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.157
 Instead of a day, it is a week. 

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.490
 The reason behind making it a week is to give 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.120
 Pinch enough for development teams, engineers and UX designers 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.380
 To create something concrete 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.500
 Is already convincing. 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.370
 Like Innovation Day, it frees creativity 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.250
 By giving them a great deal of self-awareness, 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.870
 So they choose the thing they start to create. 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.700
 There are some rules governing it. 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.100
 The most important thing in this regard to come out with a strategic value, 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.070
 Is to have a strategic theme. 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.900
 Well, the weeks we've had over the past year 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.820
 About monetizing mobile devices, 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.350
 Innovation in editing, core allocation factors, 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.310
 Increase application speed and raise responsiveness. 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.880
 Solutions are not enforced, 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.400
 The job of someone like me was to reach the subject, 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.140
 And allow teams as many as possible 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.510
 Work and come up with the most creative ideas 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.700
 Emanating from them in an attempt to achieve this. 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.640
 We were taking time at the beginning of the construction week 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.690
 To understand deeply what we will try to implement, 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.980
 The output was in fact testable. 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.650
 This requires access to 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.850
 A place where we can get realistic feedback from actual users. 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.210
 Well, this is an example of our recent construction weeks. 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.850
 My wonderful team is working on this. 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.440
 It should be noted that the team is not limited to engineers only, 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.398
 This is Frank, 

00:06:40.398 --> 00:06:41.100
 It is designed, 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.058
 We have Sabhagit, 

00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:43.490
 It is a mobile editor. 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.924
 We have Helen at the top, she's a UX researcher. 

00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:47.840
 When you make weeks of innovation, we try to form a team 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.317
 As large as possible. 

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:51.900
 Now, I have mentioned that one of the main things 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.180
 Is that the output is testable. 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.930
 I wanted to think a bit 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.904
 What I mean here. 

00:06:55.904 --> 00:06:57.570
 Since the idea of ​​the creation week 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.870
 Is to access useful things useful to users. 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.780
 So what do I mean by testability? 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.970
 Well, we have a testing hand at UX Lab. 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.024
 Now, this is great, but what we look forward to from 

00:07:08.024 --> 00:07:10.440
 The build week is access to something 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.826
 It is tested away from the laboratory. 

00:07:12.826 --> 00:07:14.200
 After that, we have our alpha program. 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.190
 Now, we're using Alpha on Google Play 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.410
 To make stand-alone versions of Android apps 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.220
 Be available to any user 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.930
 Within "The Guardian." 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.010
 The alpha program is amazing 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.340
 To test the stability of the version with 600 users 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.450
 At the end of the construction week. 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.587
 It is also a great way to entice stakeholders. 

00:07:32.587 --> 00:07:34.170
 There is no such thing as finding someone 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:35.470
 Suddenly a feature did not know they existed 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.060
 For the first time it meets one of the needs 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.560
 And hasten their introduction into production. 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.880
 We also use the beta program. 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.540
 If you're interested in signing up for the beta program, 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.260
 You can follow this url at the top. 

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.110
 Beta is running for thousands of Android users, 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.950
 Usually we get into some of the amazing ideas that are 

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.470
 Resulting in weeks of construction directly to beta. 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.160
 Or we test MVT and A / B for the first impression of the release 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.160
 In the immediate environment as well. 

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.240
 But the main point is that we ask for the difference 

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.470
 Spend one week understanding the problem deeply 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.220
 And access to more creative ideas 

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.145
 To solve and prove 

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:11.270
 Whether thoughts are successful or not. 

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.820
 [INAUDIBLE] Prove? 

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.280
 Is this really demonstrable? 

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.746
 Do I have examples where this worked? 

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:18.495
 When you combine these slides together, 

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:20.661
 Someone called me from Google 

00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:23.635
 To ask about content, should not it be "likely?" 

00:08:23.635 --> 00:08:25.350
 I replied, no, no, it was "demonstrable". 

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.530
 This is a clear. 

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.620
 Well, what are some examples - to stamp out - 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.714
 Which helped the construction weeks "The Guardian"? 

00:08:31.714 --> 00:08:33.380
 Well, the first thing was the Hide Ads button. 

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.559
 If you look at ads 

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:35.767
 On the right side here, 

00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:37.383
 There is a lovely little button to hide. 

00:08:37.383 --> 00:08:39.299
 Was the product of the mobile monetization week, 

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.890
 It leads users to a paid subscription to our free application. 

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.990
 Now, when the developers reach 

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.210
 To this, seemed a good idea, but given 

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.950
 The internal controversy is fully appreciated 

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.240
 Inside "The Guardian," we never reached a stage 

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.490
 This feature is actually released, 

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.475
 Ads are conflicting with subscriptions 

00:08:57.475 --> 00:08:59.580
 In the app, they are different revenue providers. 

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.990
 As a result of creating this feature within the build week, 

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.940
 We had the opportunity to test them really quickly 

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.315
 And access to discussions 

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:07.860
 About if the idea was good in the shadow 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.874
 The existence of real statistical data predicting the decision. 

00:09:09.874 --> 00:09:12.040
 As you can guess, if you use an Android app, 

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.510
 The decision to publish the button was in the application, so we did this 

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.490
 There has been a significant increase in the rate of conversion to contributions. 

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.750
 Search and Profile - [INAUDIBLE] 

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.150
 From customization to each of your reading records, 

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.670
 This was not available, and a developer was created 

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.987
 This beautiful collection of profile and search. 

00:09:31.987 --> 00:09:34.570
 She entered the UX lab directly, and received a great deal of admiration 

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.890
 We published it in three weeks, I think. 

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.480
 It's another type of feature 

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.922
 Which showed real benefits to users 

00:09:40.922 --> 00:09:43.130
 Who look forward to returning to articles that 

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.870
 They have already read it. 

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.160
 what is next? 

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.590
 In the relevant construction week of the assignment 

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.535
 A member of the developer team met 

00:09:49.535 --> 00:09:51.160
 With a service developer 

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.440
 They created a new recommendation engine, 

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.650
 Which we will most likely call Discover. 

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.233
 It has not yet been put out but it is likely 

00:09:57.233 --> 00:09:58.390
 His appearance this quarter of the year. 

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:00.600
 This type of investment is what business activity is 

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.050
 As a whole to run out if done 

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.760
 Insert its creation into the strategy 

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.430
 From the beginning. 

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.832
 But due to its beginnings in the construction week 

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:09.540
 We had the opportunity to test it very quickly 

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.700
 To enter it into the alpha program. 

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.680
 Similarly, it uses the Read It To Me application - Read It To Me 

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.810
 Text-to-speech engine in Android 

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.160
 To allow you to use any part of the content of "Guardian" 

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.590
 Without a screen. 

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.510
 It's great that it was in the construction week we held last week 

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.580
 It works not only on your phone but also on Wear 

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.770
 Now, it works with audio files. 

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.071
 This is another application of "The Guardian" as a whole 

00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.570
 To get out probably more spontaneously 

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.350
 Where we focused on the written word 

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.590
 Which can be fully understood. 

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.640
 But by adding editorial innovation 

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.839
 To be the theme of the construction week for our engineers, 

00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:49.130
 We have already had the advantage 

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.264
 To increase participation significantly, 

00:10:53.264 --> 00:10:54.180
 We are happy. 

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.690
 This is my happy team, 

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.232
 Well, what advice do I suggest to you here? 

00:11:00.232 --> 00:11:02.690
 If you have had weeks of innovation, they are astonished. 

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.580
 I say to those of you who develop from top to bottom, 

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.620
 Which is sometimes required and necessary, 

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.920
 There is an amazing middle ground. 

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.820
 This is the middle ground to explain the problem well 

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.870
 And give the teams the opportunity to start 

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.840
 Design and testing solutions. 

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.940
 Well, if you do not underestimate this, 

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.565
 Try it at least once 

00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:24.085
 You will see the result, and you will be surprised 

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:26.520
 Delightfully. thank you very much.
