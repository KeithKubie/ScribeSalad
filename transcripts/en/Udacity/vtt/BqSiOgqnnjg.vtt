00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.677
The rate is included in this line, where we calculate the interest. The

00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:07.010
interest calculation has to happen inside the loop. Because the balance is

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.820
incremented by a different amount every year. If we moved this line out of the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.744
loop, it would only happen once. And our interest would always be $10. Even

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:19.532
when we already have 100,000 in the bank. So I'll put that back. There is some

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:23.288
magic numbers still in this code. Maybe these should actually be named

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:28.576
variables. So I could take this, and make this into the target. And I can take

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:33.145
out the rate, and call it a rate. Now this code is much more readable. We can

00:00:33.145 --> 00:00:35.890
see that it goes well the balance is less than the target, and the interest

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.529
increments by the balance plus the rate.
