The neutral stimulus which was the bell was repeatedly paired with the

00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:08.760
unconditioned stimulus which was the toy gun to elicit a response and that was

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.507
Greg flinching. So what do we now call the bell after this repeated pairing. Is

00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:19.676
it the neutral stimulus? Is it the conditioned stimulus? Is it the

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:23.659
unconditioned response? Or is it the conditioned response?
