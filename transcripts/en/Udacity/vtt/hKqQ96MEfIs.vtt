00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.706
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know that we're leaving the left side alone. So I'll just go ahead and

00:00:03.706 --> 00:00:07.660
write 300 again. And then we know we need to distribute multiplication by each

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.440
of the terms in the first set of parentheses to each of the terms in the second

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.494
set of parentheses. So let's start with the 15. I need to multiply it by the 10

00:00:15.494 --> 00:00:19.348
and by the x. Then I do the same thing with the x. That gets multiplied by both

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:23.656
of these terms as well. From there, we just simplify within each term and

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:28.211
combine like terms. Awesome. But we know that I love everything written in

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:33.055
standard form for polynomials. So that means we need the term with the highest

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:37.035
degree first. So we get 300 equals x squared plus 25x plus 150.
