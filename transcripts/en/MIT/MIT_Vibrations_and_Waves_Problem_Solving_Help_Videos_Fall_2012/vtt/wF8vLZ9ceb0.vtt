00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.550
PROFESSOR: So welcome back.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.170
And today, we will
solve one type

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.890
of problem, a very
important problem,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.770
basically, the following.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:44.060
Suppose all that you have is a
single charge, but it can move.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.560
Here is the origin
of coordinates.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.700
This is the charge,
Q. Its position is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.570
given by some vector, z of t.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.140
And the charge can move.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.140
It can have a velocity.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.210
It can have an
acceleration, et cetera.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.250
And the problem is,
somewhere in space,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.680
at a point, p, what
is the electric field?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.740
What is the magnetic
field at all times?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.070
That's the problem.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.600
Now the differences between
different particular problems

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.070
will be where we are and what
the charge is moving et cetera.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.850
In particular, we
will consider problems

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.110
where this charge is oscillating
in a simple harmonic motion.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.860
It's along a line.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.480
And then, in another
problem, we'll

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.530
consider it's rotating
with uniform velocity.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.090
But in principle, we
could be doing anything.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.230
So how do you calculate
the electric field?

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.340
How do you find out what the
magnetic field is everywhere?

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.600
Also, if there is an
electric and magnetic field,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.040
there will be flow of energy and
energy flux or pointing vector.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.930
What will that be
at that location?

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.810
And finally, if a charge does
accelerate here and it does

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.240
radiate energy, and
the question is,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.810
what is the average total power
radiated by such a charge?

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.920
Now this kind of problem
is extremely important.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.680
It's important
just from the point

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.960
of view of understanding
how the world works.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.020
There are charges
all over the place.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.730
And they are moving.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.920
And they do produce
electric magnetic fields.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.410
A problem like this
gives you insight

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.590
how the phenomena takes place.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.320
But let me tell you
immediately, in general,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.442
this is a horrendous problem.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:03:01.950
You know that, if you
have charges in space,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.580
and you have electric
and magnetic fields,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.140
the charges, the currents, the
electric and magnetic fields

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.670
have to satisfy Maxwell's
equations, those

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.360
four Maxwell's equations.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.600
So you can imagine
how complicated

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.930
it must be to find electric and
magnetic fields, in general,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.950
for some arbitrary
motion like this.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.780
And the answer is, you would
never be asked to do that.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.970
And you would never have to do
that, in general, analytically.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.440
If you really had a problem
like this that you had to solve,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.776
in general, you would
do it on a computer.

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:43.275
All right?

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.590
But let me continue.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.350
But it turns out that,
under certain conditions,

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.680
this problem is not so hard.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.210
And yet, it contains
all the physics

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.600
and gives you all the
insights you need.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.980
And that is the
following situation.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:25.840
If you have the charge moving
in a confined region, which

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.010
is much smaller,
whose dimensions

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.930
are much smaller than the
distance at which you are

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.640
interested to calculate the
electric magnetic fields,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.290
suddenly, this problem does
not become hard, or in fact,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.480
not hard at all,
relatively speaking.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.790
So in some sense-- and this
often happens in physics

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.630
when you are given
the problem-- you

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.000
have to have an understanding
of the situation

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.730
in order to understand what the
person is asking you to solve.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.040
So in a situation like
this, the buzz words,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.650
or what you would find
is, for example, say,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.860
there is a charge.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.180
It's accelerating.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.280
Calculate the electric field at
a distance far from the charge,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.040
or the far field,
as it's called,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.460
rather than the near field.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.090
And the reason for
it is the following,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.240
in this case, that
the hard part of this

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.440
is calculating the field
relatively near the charge,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.180
because there, you
have a superposition

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.580
of this static field, for
example, the Coulomb field.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.780
If a charge is moving,
it's like a little current.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.580
And so it produces
the magnetic fields

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.150
through the Biot-Savart
Law, et cetera.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.940
But these fields drop off,
like 1/r, from the charge.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.690
And so, if you are
far away, then,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.690
in general, in most
situations where you're

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.350
interested in understanding
what's going on,

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.490
you can ignore those fields,
because the further you

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.800
are away, the smaller they are.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.190
And they become negligible.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.440
There is another
contribution to the field,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.600
to the electromagnetic field,
a very important contribution.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.970
And that is-- and
in fact, you know

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.880
that, in vacuum, without
any charges there,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.920
you can have electric and
magnetic fields present

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.810
that come from propagating
electromagnetic waves.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.460
And it turns out that, if
you have a charge which

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.490
is accelerating,
that does produce

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.120
an electromagnetic wave.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.520
And that does not drop
off as 1 over r squared,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.430
but as 1/r, much more slowly.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.940
So if you are far
away, you are dominated

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.450
by the propagating
electromagnetic wave.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.480
Now it's not that
this is trivial,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:59.490
but certainly, the propagating
electromagnetic wave

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.540
is much easier to calculate
without the presence

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.530
of these other fields.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.330
Now Professor Walter Lewin
has done that in his classes.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.810
He has shown how, if you
have somewhere a charge which

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:28.780
is accelerating, how it
generates an electric field far

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.380
away from that charge
and a magnetic field.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.630
I won't derive it
for you, but I'll

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:40.669
summarize what you have learned.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.290
Now for a second, I'll
just want to point out

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.660
why the problem of
electromagnetic waves

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.420
is more difficult than,
say, that of a string.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.080
The analogous problem we
want to recount for a string

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.840
is the following.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.970
Suppose you have a string,
you hold it at one end.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.610
Right?

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:08.200
And suppose I move this
one end sinusoidally?

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.780
You know that a string
like this is a line.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.750
And in there are
oscillators, infinitely

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.420
close to each other,
infinite number of them.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.700
All right?

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.290
Each one moves along a single
line, say, up and down.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.290
So for each one,
it's a single number

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.600
tells you what the
displacement is.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.600
You know that the string
satisfies the wave equation.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.460
If you put a
boundary at one end,

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:54.140
the oscillator, the first one,
is somehow externally driven.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.470
That excites the
next one, et cetera.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.580
And you know that
the wave propagates.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.280
Now in the case of
electromagnetism

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.890
of this kind of a problem,
the situation is very similar,

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:11.550
but you have this
extra complication.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.880
In the string, each oscillator
was on the straight line

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.050
and only moved up and
down in one direction.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:28.170
For a charge, every point
in space you could imagine,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.530
there is an oscillator.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.060
The excitation of
that oscillator

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.660
is the electric and
the magnetic field.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.020
That's the analogous
to the displacement.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.310
But notice, already,
two quantities,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.830
electric and magnetic.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:47.220
Here, for the string,
you had the displacement,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.870
a single number
in one direction.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.860
Here, the electric and
the magnetic fields

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.340
are vector quantities.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.040
So not only do you have them
spread in three dimensions,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:05.760
instead of along the
string, the displacement

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.780
is a vector quantity.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.250
So is the directions in
three-dimensional space,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:11.010
et cetera.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.030
So that, in principle,
is the same,

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.940
but it is much more complicated.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.940
But coming back
now, fortunately,

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:26.230
if you analyze what happens,
if you take a charge,

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.760
if it's stationary,
it does not radiate.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.150
It has the Coulomb field,
which, as I told you,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:35.160
drops off like 1 over r squared.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.330
If it's moving with
uniform velocity,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.720
for example, it does
generate magnetic fields.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.570
But again, they drop off.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.350
It doesn't radiate.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:53.310
But if it accelerates, then
it does produce, far away,

00:11:53.310 --> 00:12:00.330
an electron, a field
which propagates.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.830
And as Professor Walter Lewin
has showed in his lectures,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.500
you find the following.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.780
That if I have a charge
which accelerates,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.690
at the time when
it's accelerating,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.360
it produces an
electric field, which

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.519
I can summarize
with this formula.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:27.435
So it's the following.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:37.350
Suppose, at the origin,
somewhere I have a charge.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:42.710
And it accelerates, say,
in some direction, up.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:48.610
And I am interested what
is the electric field that

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:54.570
propagates outwards
in some direction, r.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:04.600
What one can show
is that this charge

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.175
will propagate in all
directions, including

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:08.800
this direction.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:18.970
But there's only one
component of the acceleration

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.860
of the charge which gives
rise to the production

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.280
of the field which propagates.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.370
And that is the
component which is

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.230
perpendicular to the
direction in which I'm

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:38.470
interested to calculate
the electric field.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.140
So if the charge, for example,
is accelerating upwards,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.900
like this, then it's
only the component

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.950
of this acceleration which is
perpendicular to this line that

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.580
gives rise to the
electric field.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.660
And one can calculate it.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.230
And its formula is
rather straightforward.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:07.540
You find the electric
field at some distance, r,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.605
from the charge.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:18.600
At time t, is
related to, as I say,

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.940
this acceleration of the charge,
but only the component, which

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.750
I call aperp, the component
of a perpendicular

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:35.500
to this line, that's
this quantity.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:45.070
And what is interesting is the
field here that is produced

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:53.290
is proportional to this
perpendicular component

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.130
of the acceleration.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:01.030
But there is a difference
in time because,

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:05.630
as this charge
accelerates-- it's

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.140
analogous to take the string.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.330
When I took the
end of the string

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.780
and I moved it, at
that instant, the kink

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.100
got produced which
propagated along this string.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.510
Same happens here.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:23.900
If I have a charge
which accelerates,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.760
it produces an electric
field which propagates.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.390
And it propagates with
the velocity of light, c.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:40.010
So the field over here is
given by the acceleration

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.950
of the charge at a time,
t prime, which is earlier.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.290
If you're interested in
the field here at time t,

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:55.060
then you have to know what was
the acceleration of the charge

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.160
here at the earlier
time, t prime,

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.670
which is equal to
t minus r/c, which

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:08.350
is the time the electric field
took to get to that point.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:09.430
That's the tricky part.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:14.780
This is the only tricky
part of this equation.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:20.290
So the electric field at
the position r at time t

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.560
is related to the
acceleration of the charge,

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.950
the perpendicular
component of it,

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:30.280
at an earlier time times
some constants, the charge

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.610
and a constant.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.331
And it drops off like 1/r.

00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:35.830
OK?

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.320
So this is the crucial equation.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:00.370
It tells us that, as I
say-- I'm repeating this,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.960
because it's so important.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.230
Whenever I have a charge
which is accelerating,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:11.079
it, at that instant,
produces an electric field

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:16.050
which is moving outwards
at the speed of light.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:21.730
Its amplitude is dropping
like 1/r, all right?

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.740
And goes on forever.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.400
Now you know from
Maxwell's equations,

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.890
if you have an electric field
which is propagating like that,

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.660
associated, there will
be a magnetic field.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.940
This is now just the
same as you've always

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.960
seen for electromagnetic waves.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.990
I like sort of visualizing.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.880
If an electromagnetic wave
moves in that direction,

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.170
and the electric field is this
direction, at that instant,

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:55.120
there will be a magnetic
field perpendicular to it.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.380
And the B is proportional
to E. And they both

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.040
move forward like that.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:00.790
OK?

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:06.170
So if this is E, then
you can get from a B.

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.670
They are proportional
to each other.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.800
There's just that constant,
C, because the units.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.720
And they are perpendicular
to each other.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.220
OK.

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:17.660
So if you understand
this formula,

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.480
all the problems that you
would be normally asked

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.060
can extremely
easily be done, OK?

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.040
Once you know E
and B, of course,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.350
you can calculate
at every location.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.080
The Poynting vector is just a
cross product between those.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.260
And I just summarize them on
the formula we may need later.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.640
So I'm now going to
start from scratch

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.090
by taking a concrete example.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.710
All right?

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:49.750
So if this refresher didn't
help, maybe the problem

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.500
itself will.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.955
So now let's take
a concrete example.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:02.840
I'll take a single
charge, Q. OK?

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.130
So I have a coordinate system.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.750
Here is my origin
of coordinates.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.690
And I'll take a charge
here, charge of magnitude,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:18.670
Q, moving up and down,
up and down sinusoidally.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.970
So it's given by
the amplitude z0.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:28.980
It's moving along the
z-axis, cosine omega t.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.580
This is the motion.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:35.630
Of course, something
must be moving it.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:41.780
But the assumption here
is it doesn't in any way

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.080
affect the electrical
and magnetic fields.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.850
So that's the only
thing that we have

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:48.480
to consider in the universe.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:54.150
And the question are,
at different places

00:19:54.150 --> 00:20:00.660
in space, what is the
electric and magnetic field?

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:10.260
So for example, one place is a
distance, R, along the z-axis

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.150
up.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.790
So it's not along the axis.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.886
So the position where we
are interested, where p is,

00:20:20.886 --> 00:20:25.530
has coordinates 0,
0, R. In other words,

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.590
it's a distance, R,
along the z-axis.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:33.165
And we are all
asked, at this time,

00:20:33.165 --> 00:20:40.780
R divided by C, what is the
electric and magnetic field

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.840
at that location?

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.570
OK?

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.130
That's the first
part of the question.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:49.850
Well, that, I hope you've
already done in your head.

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:53.500
If the charge is moving up
and down like this-- oh,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.320
and by the way, I
have to emphasize,

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.300
this problem, in general--
except this one part--

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:07.080
you are able to do only if
we satisfy what I said here,

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:13.860
that the region within which
the charge is moving or located

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.490
is small, compared to the
distance where I'm asking what

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:20.380
the electric and
magnetic fields are.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:26.100
So here, it says for R
very much greater than Z0.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.640
So whatever I say
from now on, I'm

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.720
making the assumption
I'm very far away.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.170
I only have the radiated field.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:40.340
I can ignore the complicated
fields like Coulomb's field

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.870
and Biot-Savart, et cetera.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:43.370
OK.

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.550
So the first part,
even without this,

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:50.150
I can do because
imagine we are asking

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:54.050
what is the electric
field along the z-axis.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:56.655
And so suppose I am
at that location,

00:21:56.655 --> 00:21:59.060
and I'm looking
down at the charge.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.380
What do I see?

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.870
I see the charge going
towards me and away from me,

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.570
and towards me and away from me.

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.190
So it does have
velocity at some stage

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:12.320
and suddenly has acceleration.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.010
But the acceleration is
towards me and away from me.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:19.650
So what is the
perpendicular component

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.320
of the acceleration
in my direction?

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.990
0.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.490
At no time do I see the
charge accelerating sideways.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.550
I only see it going
towards and away from me.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.720
So the aperp is 0.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.950
And then I go back
to my equation here.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.750
If aperp is 0, it doesn't
matter what you do with it,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:44.960
E will be 0.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.360
If E is 0, B is 0, because they
are proportional to each other.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.825
So at all times
this will be 0, OK?

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.280
The next part of the question.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.840
And let we quickly tell you, in
the next part of the question

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:09.760
it says, now let's have this
charge not move up and down,

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.048
but along the y-- sorry.

00:23:14.048 --> 00:23:15.024
No.

00:23:15.024 --> 00:23:16.000
No.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.310
I misspoke.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.210
Let's leave this
moving that way.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:27.330
But instead of looking
along the z-axis,

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.840
let's look at the
point along the y-axis.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.610
So at the point 0,R,0,
or in other words,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:40.900
at distance R from the origin
along the y-axis, again,

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.550
at this time.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:54.790
And then the third one, it asks
let's look at it at 30 degrees.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:24:00.750
So now, in this case, we
look at in the direction

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.270
where it's in the y,
z plane, but at 30

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.170
degrees to the z-axis,
so in some direction

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.860
there where the
coordinate is this.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.250
OK?

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.040
And the whole purpose
is to just get

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.100
you a feel how accelerated
charges radiate

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.040
in different directions.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.370
So the first one I've
already done for you.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.820
OK?

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:38.980
But here, let me just
repeat myself or point out.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.480
In each part of
this question, we

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.056
are a distance, R,
from the charge.

00:24:46.056 --> 00:24:47.430
Now you can say,
well, the charge

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:49.620
is moving a small amount.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:56.450
But the whole essence of
making this a doable problem

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.120
and getting a situation
which you can solve

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.800
is where all the
motion of the charges

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.640
over distances
which is very much

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.900
smaller than where you are.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.860
So because R is very
much greater than z0,

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.820
from the distance of
the accelerated charge,

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.650
from where you want to
calculate the electric field,

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.110
you can assume is
constant in distance R.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.590
So in all parts of
this problem, you

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.210
are the same distance away,
but at a different angle.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.350
And in all cases, we are
asked to find the field

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:44.350
at some time, t, when
this is oscillating.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.290
Let's go to the second part.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:55.425
How about in a direction
which is along the y-axis?

00:25:55.425 --> 00:25:57.330
All right?

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.480
So in the y direction,
if something

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.680
is accelerating in
the z direction,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.160
that is perpendicular
to the y-axis.

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.140
And so for the second
part, the acceleration

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:20.650
of the charge at
time t prime, is

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:26.190
simply I have to take this
and differentiate it twice,

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.380
all right?

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.100
And so we've done it.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.800
This is this.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:38.880
And this acceleration, that has
a component in the z direction

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.520
which is perpendicular
to the y direction.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:48.990
So in our formula,
this is Eperp.

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.790
And so we can plug
it into that formula.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:56.690
And we get that
the electric field

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:02.490
at position R along the
y-axis is given by this.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.400
And I just took that formula--
let me just remind you--

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:12.170
I have just taken this formula
and plugged in the aperp.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:16.780
And I end up with this equation.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.440
And so I see that, if a charge
is oscillating up and down

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.550
like that, it does radiate
perpendicular to it.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:30.580
This is the nearest analogy
to that string case.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.370
If the string is
moving like that,

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:38.680
it propagates a wave
along the string.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.970
And here, if a charge is
accelerating like this,

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.230
it does radiate
along that direction.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.290
This is the magnitude.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:53.360
And as a function,
that's what it is.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.100
The actual problem
was not in general

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:08.090
what it is, what will
it be at the time R/C?

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:15.620
Well, at t R/C, this is
R/C minus R/C. This is 0.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.370
So this is cosine
of 0, so this is 1.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:23.290
And so we get, finally,
that at that time,

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:28.520
the electric field
is equal to this.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.910
It's just that times 1.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:32.880
This is the electric field.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.700
What is the magnetic field?

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.290
Well, as I told you, if you
know the electric field,

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.630
B is perpendicular to
it, proportional to it.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:45.350
And there's just a 1/C. So
they here have it C cubed.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:51.760
And the magnetic field
will be in the x direction.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.530
The electric field
is always parallel

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:59.550
to the accelerated charge.

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:04.300
The magnetic field is in
the perpendicular direction.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.190
Also, it is important to
remember the minus sign.

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.550
I come back to this formula.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.400
This minus sign
is very important.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.410
What it's saying
is, at the instant

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:25.640
when the charge is
accelerating in that direction,

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.090
the electric field it produces
is in the opposite direction.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.540
So when this is accelerating,
at the instant this accelerates,

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.540
it produces an electric field
which goes in this direction.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.880
And that field
propagates like that.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.860
OK?

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:43.680
And the magnetic field
is perpendicular to it.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:49.570
And so that is the Part 2.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:54.700
And now we come to doing the
third one-- it's actually

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.290
the same problem--
where we are considering

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:04.640
the radiation at the slightly
more complicated angle.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.410
So far, we've looked at the
charge is moving up and down.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:13.310
We said there's no
electromagnetic field radiated

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.315
upwards, or downwards,
for that matter.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.230
Along the y-axis it is.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.690
And of course, if we
took any other location

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:30.570
in the plane of our x, y,
in the horizontal plane,

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:33.810
in all directions,
it will radiate

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.820
in a similar manner
as along the y-axis.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.070
And finally, just
for completion,

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.480
let's take one more direction.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.480
And what the problem said, let's
consider going at 30 degrees

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.810
to the z-axis.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.580
That's an angle like that.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.750
What is the electric
field that is

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.580
generating in that direction?

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.630
Again, this is just
to give us practice

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.600
at calculating vectors,
components, et cetera.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.920
So I will do that now over here.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:09.300
So this is the
solving the Part 3.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.450
So what we're
interested in, we have

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:18.280
this charge moving up and down.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.520
And we're interested in the
radiation a long way away,

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.170
a distance R away
from this charge,

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:31.350
but at some angle like
that, with just 30 degrees

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.900
to the z-axis.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.250
So in order to
use that formula--

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.790
it's all the time
the same thing,

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.550
I'm just using
the same formula--

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:47.830
I need to calculate the
component of the acceleration

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.720
of the charge which
is perpendicular

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.660
to that direction, OK?

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.010
Now there are many ways.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.595
You can do it in
your head, if you

00:31:57.595 --> 00:32:01.010
are good at
manipulating vectors.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.990
Here, I wrote it, in case you
wanted a complete formula.

00:32:06.625 --> 00:32:10.640
Here is how the
perpendicular component

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.160
is related to the
acceleration, a.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.100
And at the beginning there,
I summarized it for you.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.660
But you can do it
any way you want.

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.080
I did it this way.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:29.810
And so I am taking this charge
and calculating, at some time,

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:35.820
t prime, what is the
component of the acceleration

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:42.420
of the charge in a direction
perpendicular to the direction

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.600
in which I am considering
the radiation.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:51.210
And this is what it comes out.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:57.130
If you remember, I know what
is the motion of the charge.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.400
You've seen it over there.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.670
So I know what z is,
a function of time.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.500
Therefore, I can calculate this.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:09.130
And that's what it
comes out as, alright?

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:13.510
Here, I formally
use this equation.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.500
So it's as before.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:29.200
We will be interested in the
electric field at the position,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:34.490
R, so at a time which is later.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:39.580
In other words, t
minus R/C is the time

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.940
at which the prime time,
t prime, at which I'm

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.230
interested in this acceleration.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:49.910
And that's what
it looks like, OK?

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:52.630
Now, I can simplify it.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.220
I'm not going to
waste your time.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.380
You can go through this algebra.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.880
Simplify it here.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.300
And then I take
this acceleration

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.300
and plug it into that
equation, which tells me,

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.830
if I know the perpendicular
component of acceleration

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:13.270
at this earlier time, I
know what the electric field

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.860
is at the time t.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.560
And this is what
it comes out at.

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:22.690
So the electric field
in a direction 30

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:29.150
degrees to the z-axis,
or in other words,

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:32.630
at a distance, capital
R, from the origin.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:37.350
Or in other words,
at the coordinates 0,

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:44.050
R/2, R root 3 over-- and this is
the y-coordinate, x-coordinate,

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:48.679
y, and z-- at this time, I
plug this into that equation.

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:52.060
And I get this
and the direction.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.310
If you do it formally, you
immediately get the direction.

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.400
It's not very hard.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:03.320
It'll be, in fact, it's
60 degrees to the z-axis.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.370
All right.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.980
So that's what the
electric field will be.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.610
Then, knowing the
electric field,

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:14.850
again, I know that E and B are
perpendicular to each other.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:18.610
They are proportional to each
other, except for the 1/C.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:19.320
All right?

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.540
And so, at the same
location, I can calculate B.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.590
And I get this.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:30.730
The magnitude here
and here are the same,

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.010
except for one power
of C here, C cubed.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.320
The direction is different.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.470
B will be the x direction.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.480
And that, you could
do in your head.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:53.819
If the charge is oscillating
like this, at all angles,

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:55.360
you'll still have
the magnetic field,

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.690
which will perpendicular
in that direction.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:35:59.440
All right?

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.630
And you can check for yourself.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:09.450
This half is simply
the sine of 30 degrees.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.090
OK.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:14.500
So I've gone very
slowly, intentionally,

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:21.265
and taken the simple
situation where

00:36:21.265 --> 00:36:24.020
a single charge is
oscillating up and down

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.580
and I've calculated for
you the electric field,

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:31.780
the radiated electric
field, up and down, at 0.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.640
In a horizontal plane, I've done
it effectively, all locations.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.540
And I've done it
at an angle, theta,

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:41.660
where theta was 30 degrees.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.900
I could repeat this for every
angle, theta, every location.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:50.870
So in fact, just taking
more and more cases,

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.700
we have calculated the
electric and propagating

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:59.440
electric and magnetic field
in all directions, all right?

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.546
And we calculated the magnitude
at a distance from the origin.

00:37:04.546 --> 00:37:05.045
OK?

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.880
It drops off like 1/R we saw.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.200
And like the other field, we
drop off like 1 over r squared.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:24.280
And so this charge, which
is oscillating up and down,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:29.870
radiates in all directions,
but with different magnitudes,

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:33.580
biggest in the
plane perpendicular

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:37.710
to the vector describing
the acceleration.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.010
OK.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:47.045
Now the next thing that I
will do now is the following.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:38:00.020
Let's take the same
situation and try

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:07.960
to calculate the total power
radiated by the charge.

00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:12.430
So I've taken this same problem.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:17.160
There is the charge
oscillating up and down

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:24.280
with amplitude z0
cosine omega t prime.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:30.980
And what we see-- well, we
know that it radiates energy.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.570
If it radiates energy,
of course, normally,

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:40.950
it would have to finally stop.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.730
But I'm assuming there is
some mechanism which uniformly

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:52.420
maintains the motion of these
charges in a certain motion.

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.710
Energy will be radiated.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:39:01.410
And I want to calculate what
is the total energy radiated

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.990
per second by this charge.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.957
And the way we are going to
do this-- so the question now

00:39:09.957 --> 00:39:16.040
is, for this particular charge,
oscillating like we discussed,

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.120
what is the total energy
per second-- in other words,

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.100
power-- radiated at
the time t prime?

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.280
Clearly, if it's
radiating energy outwards,

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:34.910
by conservation of
energy, the amount

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.250
of energy coming
out of this will

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:43.090
be the same as the
amount of energy crossing

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:50.930
a sphere of radius,
R, at a later time.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:56.580
So if I calculate the energy
crossing a sphere at the time

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:01.220
t, where t is this
t prime plus R/C,

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.240
at a later time, that
will be the total energy

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:11.440
per second radiated by this
charge at the time, t prime.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.900
So I will now
calculate the energy

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:22.500
per second which is crossing
the surface of this sphere

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.720
at the time, t.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.450
Well, how much energy
is crossing the surface?

00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:34.340
We know that, at the
surface of this sphere,

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:41.240
there is, at every location,
an electric field which

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.140
is parallel to the
surface, because this

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.280
is perpendicular to R.
The electric field is

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.080
perpendicular to this.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.310
So at this location, for
example, the electric field

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.530
will be like this,
crossing it, part

00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.080
of the surface of this sphere.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.000
There will be a magnetic
field perpendicular to it.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.470
And so, at this
location, there will

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.720
be a energy flux, the
so-called Poynting vector,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.800
the energy per second
crossing a unit [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:20.050
And that's this vector,
s, the Poynting vector,

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.030
which, as you know
from Professor Walter

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:27.740
Lewin's lectures, is E cross
B. I forgot my vector sign

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:35.550
on top of the B. These are
vectors, of course, E cross B.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:40.700
Now we know, for an
electromagnetic wave in vacuum,

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.280
that the E and B are
perpendicular and proportional

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:48.060
to each other, just the
fact the C. So this will

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:54.430
be the magnitude of E squared
divided by this mu 0 times

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:57.400
C, because B is E/C.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.310
This is a scalar quant--
these were vectors.

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:00.970
This is a scalar.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:09.000
So this is the energy flowing
per unit area, per unit time

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.455
at the surface of this.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:20.000
And the E will depend on
the location on this sphere.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.060
So what is the
total energy that's

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:28.700
leaving the charge
at time t prime?

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:34.330
It will be the sum
of all the energies

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.410
that are coming
out per unit area

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:39.940
along this surface at time t.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:46.140
So it's going to be
the integral of SdA.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:50.410
What I'm doing, basically,
calculating at every location

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.870
S multiplied by the area
there-- so that gives me

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.010
how much energy goes
through that area--

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.470
and adding them
across the surface

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:03.600
everywhere around
the complete sphere.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.350
That will be the total
energy leaving here.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.170
So imagine this is
oscillating up and down,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:14.460
radiating these
spherical waves outwards.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.670
And they cross this surface.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.190
And at every place, there is
energy flowing, the Poynting

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.790
vector.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.850
And here, I'm adding them all.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:28.790
This will be the
total power radiated

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:32.521
by this charge at that
earlier time, t prime.

00:43:32.521 --> 00:43:33.020
OK.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.660
So I now have to just log
through and calculate this.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:42.615
S, I have to
calculate from this.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:51.190
And then I have to
calculate the piece of area.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.120
Well, let me tell
you what I will do.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:01.480
From what we've learned
from the earlier part,

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:11.150
the magnitude of E only
depended on this angle, theta,

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.220
and this distance.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:18.080
So imagine, along the
surface, I take a slice

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:26.470
this surface, like this, where
every point along this surface

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:32.890
is at an angle, theta,
to the z-axis, OK?

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.040
And it's a thin slice.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.890
So what will be this distance?

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.830
I'll take this to be d theta.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:49.450
This distance is R, so that
distance is already Rd theta.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:55.050
If I multiply that
by 2 pi r sine theta,

00:44:55.050 --> 00:45:02.020
r sine theta is the
radius of this circle.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.850
So this total area going all
the way around this sphere

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:14.790
is 2 pi r sine theta
multiplied by Rd theta.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.050
OK?

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:22.720
So now along this,
everywhere, S is the same.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.970
So if S is at that
angle, theta, and I've

00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:31.250
multiplied by 2 pi R
sine theta Rd theta,

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:36.120
this is the piece of area,
if I multiply by that,

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:43.370
this gives me the total
energy flux or power

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:52.490
that is leaving the sphere
along this part, all

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:57.070
the way behind there,
all the way around.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:45:59.960
OK?

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:03.920
Now what is the total
energy per second leaving

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.950
this complete sphere
is the addition

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:11.010
of pieces like that for
the complete sphere.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:15.730
So it would be the
integral of this

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:18.390
for theta going from 0 to pi.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.410
And then I've covered
the compete sphere.

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:26.770
So that will be
this integral, which

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.870
is the power radiated
by the charge.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.540
OK, if you've understood
that, then it's

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.550
just pure algebra now.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:39.470
S, I can calculate,
because I know

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:44.180
it's the magnitude of
E squared over C mu 0.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:47.550
But that, we've already done.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.070
We did it for 30 degrees.

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:50.310
And now do it for theta.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:54.430
So here, instead of having
sine 30, which was 1/2,

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:57.870
I have sine theta there.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:03.215
So that squared gives me
this divided by C mu 0 that.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:15.120
And of course, it depends--
so this is what E is.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:22.880
But it's oscillating as
cosine omega times this.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.080
And we have to square it,
because this is E squared.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:33.760
So this is what the
Poynting vector is at,

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:39.370
the angle theta, distance
R away at time t, OK?

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.830
And therefore,
the total power is

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:48.060
this multiplied by that
integrated from 0 to pi.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.980
I've just rewritten
it, this quantity,

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.450
plugging that into here.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.470
I end up with this.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.090
Everything does not
depend on theta,

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:03.320
except sine theta, which
you have a squared from here

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.950
and another sign from there.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.980
So I get sine cubed
theta d theta.

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.150
OK, we're home.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.600
So that's the answer.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.400
Because this you can do,
I won't waste your time.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.310
The way to do it is you can
take sine theta d theta to be

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:25.170
d cosine theta, and
then integrating sine

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:28.080
squared theta d cosine theta.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.600
And if you do that, you get 4/3.

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.250
So I plug 4/3 in
for that integral.

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:38.790
This is the answer, OK?

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:46.810
So what we see
now, through any--

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:51.390
and it's independent of R, which
I hope did not surprise you.

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:53.880
It's a statement of
conservation of energy,

00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:56.520
because you have this
charge oscillating

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.000
up and down, radiating.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.370
Through every sphere of radius
R, the same amount of energy

00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:06.345
has to go through,
or otherwise, you'

00:49:06.345 --> 00:49:08.350
d be gaining or losing energy.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.057
So that's a check.

00:49:10.057 --> 00:49:10.640
You can check.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:14.130
If R came into this formula,
you would have made a mistake.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.360
And the only place
where it does,

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.010
is only-- it oscillates,
so at any position, R,

00:49:21.010 --> 00:49:23.890
the energy going through
oscillates, because it's

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.840
a wave going out, OK?

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.550
So this changes the phase,
but not the magnitude.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:33.600
In the actual question,
it asked for what

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.920
is the time average
that's radiated outwards.

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.760
So we want to know the
time average of this.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:49.375
And that's the time
average of that is here.

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:58.980
You know that the time average
of cosine some function of t

00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.980
is 1/2.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:04.670
If you take cosine--
sorry, cosine squared,

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:05.940
which was in here, cosine.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:09.200
So the time average of
cosine squared is 1/2.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.790
So finally, we get that
the average, time average,

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:17.070
power leaving this
oscillating charge

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.434
is given by this formula.

00:50:18.434 --> 00:50:19.725
It's actually a famous formula.

00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:24.310
It's called
[? Lambor ?] formula.

00:50:24.310 --> 00:50:25.340
OK?

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.260
So that's the total
energy radiated.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.670
Fine.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.050
We have a few minutes
left, and so I'll

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:37.420
do one more quick problem.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:56.160
OK, just for variety--
so far, we've

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.520
considered a charge which
is accelerating up and down.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.230
And be considered all
permutations and combinations

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:05.940
about what happens to the
electromagnetic field going

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:06.860
outwards.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.490
Now let's consider
something else,

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.140
a charge which is
going in a circle.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:21.180
Let's consider that a charge,
Q, which is rotating in the z,

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:28.170
y plane with a
uniform velocity, v,

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:33.520
given by omega z0 where omega
is the angular velocity of this.

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.470
So we have a charge going
like this, uniform velocity.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.160
What is the radiated field?

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:50.030
What radiated electric and
magnetic fields are produced?

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:56.060
Well, go back to
where I started.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.980
The charge is moving
with uniform velocity.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:08.240
Static charges don't radiate,
but accelerated charges do.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.290
Does this charge accelerate?

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:14.920
It's moving with a
uniform speed in a circle,

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.170
but does it radiate?

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.270
Well, you know that,
if an object is

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:25.160
going with a uniform
speed, V, around a circle,

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.220
it's all the time
accelerating, right?

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.480
It's accelerating
inwards all the time.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.540
And so this charge is
accelerating inwards.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.740
So at every instant
of time, it's

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:45.570
accelerating like this,
so as this moves more.

00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:49.560
So all the time, it has
a constant magnitude

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:55.550
of acceleration, but the
direction changes all the time.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:59.995
So this charge, at every
instant of time, will radiate.

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:09.380
And it will radiate in all
directions, like before.

00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:14.700
For simplicity, so we don't get
overburdened by mathematics,

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.730
let me just think for a
second what a-- let's just

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:20.123
talk qualitatively.

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:32.080
I can describe the motion of
a charge going like this by,

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.440
at any instant of time,
it has a position.

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:42.670
This is Z0 vector
is the position

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:46.020
of this charge at time t prime.

00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:52.780
I could write it as Z0 cosine
theta y plus Z0 sine theta Z,

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:54.460
all right?

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.160
That's the y-coordinate.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:58.210
That's the z-coordinate.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:05.790
If that is the position, I
can rewrite this like this,

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:16.490
because theta, of course,
is given by omega t prime.

00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:20.770
It's rotating, right?

00:54:20.770 --> 00:54:22.160
What is the acceleration?

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.645
I differentiate this twice.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:29.073
So here is the acceleration.

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.200
So if we consider
the two components,

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:43.540
what I see is that this charge
has a component in the y

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.590
direction and in the z
direction, like this.

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:52.650
And so it will, at every
instant of time, radiate.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:58.390
I can decompose the
radiation, using this formula,

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:01.360
into the two components.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:06.770
And what we see is that the
two components are out of phase

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:09.465
from each other by 90 degrees.

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:17.350
So for example, if I am
straight ahead looking at it,

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:23.210
I will see a charge which
is accelerating up and down,

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:26.480
like that, and out
of phase, like this.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:31.770
So it will radiate
straightforward a component

00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:37.320
like this, oscillating, and
out of phase by 90, like that.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.930
And what is that?

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:39.430
You know.

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:41.465
That's called circularly
polarized light.

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:46.190
There are many
ways to look at it.

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.340
You can either look
at the components,

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:51.770
or you could look
at the rotation

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:55.290
of the electric vector.

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:57.160
At the moment, I
am looking at this

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.240
from the point of
view of components.

00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:03.680
So if I look at this, straight
at it, what I will see,

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:10.260
an electromagnetic wave
with the electric vector

00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:13.360
polarized vertically,
and another one

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:18.850
polarized horizontally,
out of phase by 90 degrees.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.550
And so, at any
location in space,

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:25.510
I'll see an electric vector
which is rotating like this.

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.460
Of course, there's a magnetic
vector perpendicular to it.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:32.150
And that we call,
circularly polarized light.

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:38.630
So this will radiate in that
direction circularly polarized

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:39.840
light.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.610
If I look from
above, what do I see?

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:45.410
The charge is going
like this, so I just

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.250
see this component
from above-- you

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:51.470
can look at the two
components-- like that.

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:55.470
So straight up, I'll see
linearly polarized light.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.460
If I look from the side, I
see it's going up and down.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.090
I will see also
linearly polarized,

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.310
but in a different direction.

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:10.050
So a charge like
this, as before,

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:12.400
will radiate in all directions.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:16.640
But the extra complication now
is, in different directions,

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.830
it'll be different polarization.

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:20.990
For example, if I'm
looking at this from here,

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:24.180
this crazy angle,
what I will see

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:28.380
is I will see a component from
the acceleration like this,

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.930
and from that, but they
have different amplitude.

00:57:31.930 --> 00:57:36.179
And so I'll get the
two polarizations which

00:57:36.179 --> 00:57:37.720
are different
amplitudes, corresponds

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.770
to elliptically polarized light.

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:43.100
So in this direction, I'll
see an elliptically polarized

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:44.700
light.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.680
And using this formula
any place in space,

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:52.430
you can calculate the
electric and magnetic field,

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:56.320
just doing the same as
we did before, but take

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.530
the full vector description
of the perpendicular

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.820
component of the
acceleration of the charge.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.010
So let me stop there and
just sort of summarize.

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:12.230
In principle, we've
done just very little.

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:16.680
What we showed today
is, in general,

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.480
if I have a charge which
moving with some velocity,

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:23.440
some acceleration,
et cetera, it'll

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.150
be surrounded by a
very complicated field.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.470
There will be the Coulomb
field, the Biot-Savart field,

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:31.120
the radiated field, et cetera.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:34.139
If you need to solve the
complete thing properly,

00:58:34.139 --> 00:58:35.180
you will need a computer.

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.730
You can't do it.

00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:42.540
But if you are only interested
in the radiated field which

00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:47.240
is far away from the
accelerated charge,

00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.570
it turns out the situation
is sufficiently simple,

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:54.310
you can do it almost on
the back of an envelope.

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:57.620
All you need to know, if you
are interested in the field

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.460
in any location, is
you ask yourself,

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:07.950
at an earlier time, what
was the charge doing?

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:13.680
And by earlier, I mean
at time that light

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:17.650
had time to come from
the charge to me.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.130
So I take that distance, R/C,
and at that earlier time,

00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.030
I need to know what
the charge was doing.

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:28.870
I ask myself, in which
direction it was accelerating?

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:31.590
I take the magnitude
of acceleration,

00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:35.740
which is perpendicular to the
direction in which I'm looking,

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:40.710
and I calculate that and
multiply by some constants

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.640
that we've done
over and over again,

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.960
and that will tell me what
the electric field is.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.900
From that, I can get
the magnetic field,

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:49.360
and I get the full radiation.

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.210
Thank you.
