Welcome to "The
Next Level," people.

00:00:02.301 --> 00:00:04.470
I want you to say hello
to tonight's comedian.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.273
I'm talking about my
guy, Malik S, who comes

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.941
to us from Miami, Florida.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:09.642
Come on, man.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.110
Get a guy some love.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.479
[cheers and applause]

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.480
Good to have you.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.648
- Good to see you, man.
- Same thing.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:17.450
- I like the outfit.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.418
Let's talk about you teaching.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.452
And I heard that
you taught, man.

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:21.487
Yeah, I'm a teacher, man--

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:22.889
English teacher.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:23.990
- What grades you teach?
- Sixth and eighth grade.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.724
Sixth and eight grade?

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:25.491
- Yeah.
- Get out.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.326
Yeah, man.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.259
Yeah.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.127
Successful teacher?

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:28.995
Like, you actually--

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.062
No, not really.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.730
Substitute teacher,
or a real teacher?

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.565
- No, a real teacher.
- A real teacher?

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:33.666
Yeah, for a year--

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.303
well, not a whole year.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:38.337
We went to spring break.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.306
You know you get that week off?

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.374
I ain't going back.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.508
You ain't going
back after that?

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:43.509
Public school?

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:44.510
Oh, god, I didn't go back.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.378
Public school?

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.612
Public school.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:47.880
They gave me a week
to think it over.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.715
I was like, fu--

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.120
The crazy thing is, you know,
spring break is kind of, like--

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.321
like, April.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:58.023
School ends in, like, May, June.

00:00:58.123 --> 00:01:00.493
So I had enough
sick time to take

00:01:00.593 --> 00:01:01.527
off for the rest of the year.

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.662
You said, I'm not coming back.

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:03.830
So I really still
had a job, but I

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.331
was just like, ah, I'm sick.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.433
OK, I saw this picture,
and I just want I want to--

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.768
I want to ask the
people what they think.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.470
I'm gonna show you
guys what Malik looked

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.305
like when he was teaching.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:15.642
This is-- this is--

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.510
this is what he looked like.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.944
That's exactly
what I looked like.

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.246
That's what he looked
like when he was teaching.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.348
But this is-- this in
Miami, Florida, though.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:25.051
And this is 2003--

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:27.653
you got to think, like,
that was the look.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:31.190
Yeah, but how-- how
did you go from here to--

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.024
to there?

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.192
Like, what--

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:34.894
Well, 'cause-- 'cause
they kept backing up.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:40.232
So-- so it was like, I was
going have convertible dreads.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:42.168
So I'll just say, you know what?

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.268
Cut 'em off.
