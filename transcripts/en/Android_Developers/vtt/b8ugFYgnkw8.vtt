00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.860
So when we last left
off, we had successfully

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.970
learned how to unlock
achievements and increment

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.960
achievements by
a certain amount.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.560
And this is great.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.770
This is progress.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.860
But you may have
noticed that I did this

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.580
by embedding these achievement
ID strings directly

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.660
into the code.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.172
And for a lot of
you, this probably

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.380
makes you wince and you were
like what are you doing?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.050
You're l embedding strings
directly into the code.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.009
This is terrible style.

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.591
And you should be
ashamed of yourself.

00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:33.325
And I am.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.450
So I'm just going to take
a few moments to fix this

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.580
before we go ahead and implement
the remaining two achievements.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.045
Now probably as
a game developer,

00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:43.500
you're going to do
something even more

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.920
sophisticated than
what I'm doing.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.790
You're probably going to save
all these IDs in a properties

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.952
file somewhere you
can easily read in.

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:54.760
In my case, I'm just going to
do this by creating an e-note.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.860
So let me go over to my GM
and achieving manager here.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.740
And let's create
a little e-note.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.500
So I'm going to use our
type def and NS_ENUM

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.670
macro that Apple
has provided for us.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.540
It'll be an NS integer.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.600
And its name-- we'll call
it GMN Achievement ID.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.910
And this will be
defined as-- I guess

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.660
I will enter these
achievements in the same way

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.040
that they are entered
in the Play console.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.520
So we're going to say
Achievement ID Lucky Guess.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.856
And we'll make
sure this is zero.

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:42.860
Then we can add Achievement ID.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.570
Send to Guesser.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.910
Achievement ID First Time,
and Achievement ID OtnayOotay.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.060
There we go.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.180
And now we can go ahead and
change these method signatures

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.870
so that instead of
passing in it in a string,

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.940
we're actually going to pass
in our GMN Achievement ID ENUM.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.330
So I'm going to change this
here from NS String to GMN

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.059
Achievement ID.

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:15.600
And I'm going to
the same thing here.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.070
And then in our .m file, we can
go through the work to actually

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.980
translate these
into real strings.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.710
So, again, you
might be doing this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.150
by looking at some kind
of file in the device.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.850
But for me, I'm just going to go
ahead and create a simple array

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.720
here.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.400
So we're going to declare
Static, NSString, Const,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.775
Achievement IDs.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.430
And I guess I can go ahead and
a copy and paste these directly

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.670
from our Developer console.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.650
Let's look it up here.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.750
Here we go-- Guess My Number.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.419
And Achievements--
all right, cool.

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.960
We can just copy
over this first one.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.976
And, yes, this is
kind of a pain.

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:20.350
But we only have
to do this once.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.260
And there we go.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.230
We now have a range of
Achievement ID strings.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.310
Where each one of
these strings is

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.570
placed in this
array in a way that

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.180
corresponds to their ENUM value.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.660
So looking up an actual
Achievement ID string

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.390
from the ENUM should
be pretty easy.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.440
So now we can finally
update our methods.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.440
So I'm going to change
this from NS String

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.660
to GMN Achievement ID.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:09.640
And then we will say our NS
String Achievement ID as String

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.260
equals Achievement IDs.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.399
OK, that's a lot
of Achievement IDs.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.990
Sorry for not
naming these better.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.016
But now that we
have this thing, I

00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:29.100
can now just copy paste
it in here and we're done.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.080
And you know what?

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.640
We can just do the
same thing down here

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.160
in our Increment Method.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.630
Pop that in.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.730
This is now a GMN
Achievement ID.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.160
And we can put that in here.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.660
Whoops.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.710
Actually, before I
go on, I realized

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.730
I need to go into my game model.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.780
And, yeah, we've
got some errors now.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.880
Let's go ahead and replace this
call with our Achievement ID.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.120
First time.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.770
And then we can similarly
replace this one

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.260
with Achievement
ID Centiguesser.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.040
And, by the way,
gosh isn't it nice

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.390
now that we have this auto
completion for us that

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.420
lets us know exactly
what Achievement we want

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.780
to be adding here.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.840
Anybody that's
reviewing this code

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.170
can immediately figure out
what Achievement I meant

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.060
to increment just by looking at
this very logically named ENUM

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.800
instead of completely
opaque string

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.740
that has no other context.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.580
So I like this a
whole lot better.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.800
It makes the code cleaner.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.330
And makes it easier to read.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.410
And we got Auto Complete.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.900
Hooray.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.626
All right, so now
let's run this thing.

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.250
We see that we're
still getting errors.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.940
And this is actually because
in between the last two

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.640
recordings, I upgraded my
G+ Library from 1.4 to 1.5.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.730
And it turns out it now
wants this other framework

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.050
to access the Address Book.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.810
I'll show you why it needs
that in a later lesson.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.390
But let's go back here.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.360
Go into our Frameworks.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.110
And let's add Address Book.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.400
Build this.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.630
All right.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.920
Everything's good.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.870
Let's try this again.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.660
All right, see we're back.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.320
I can check out my Achievements.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.070
Everything seems to be working.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.120
Let's go ahead and
implement these last two.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.230
So I'm going to stop this.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.960
We're going to go
back to my Game Model.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.320
And I think these last two are
actually pretty straightforward

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.830
here.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.050
Let's add the Otnay
Ootay Ipray one.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.417
We can do that right here.

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:51.500
Basically what I can do
is I can look at the guess

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.030
and say if the
guess is either less

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.970
than the Player
Min, what we know

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.220
is the minimum logical value
for the player or our guess,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.990
is greater than our player max.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.730
Then that was not really
a very good guess.

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.510
We could do
self.achievementManager.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.290
Unlock Achievement with ID.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.930
Achievement ID Otnay Ootay.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.460
Love that Auto Complete.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.760
And our Lucky Guess Achievement
is also pretty easy to add.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.560
Right here in this section where
we discover that we've won,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.340
we can just look at
the number of guesses

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:35.560
and if it's equal to
one then we can say,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.780
hey self.achievementManager,
let's unlock

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.850
that Achievement with the ID.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.630
Achievement ID Lucky yes.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.090
And now we can go
ahead and test these.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.410
Now I am not going to test
the Lucky Guesser Achievement.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.120
We would be here a very
long time if I did.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.580
Or I guess maybe I could cheat.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.379
But there we go.

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:03.420
There's our Achievements.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.390
Looks like we still have
our First Timer one.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.150
Don't have our Lucky Guess one.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.370
Let me play Easy Mode here.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.430
And I'm going to say--
I'm going to guess 50.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.270
And it's saying
it's lower than 50.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.860
Hmm.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.030
Well, what if I
were to guess 60?

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.750
Well that's not a
very good guess there.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.610
But I have seen now that
the Achievement lot Unlocked

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.190
banner appears.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.050
And if I were to go back
and look at my Achievements,

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.200
it now shows up there in
my list of Achievements

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.690
that I've earned.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:35.299
So that's pretty good.

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.130
One issue you might
be noticing, though,

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.929
is that it's hard to test
these more than once.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.690
Right?

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.530
At some point you're probably
going to have a Test Plan.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.199
And one of those things that
your testers should be doing--

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:49.990
if they're not, they
should be doing this--

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.840
is to make sure that you can
earn all these Achievements.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.650
And you don't want to be
creating new test accounts

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.180
every time you want to test
a new set of Achievements.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.520
So I think it's important to,
at least for testing purposes,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.790
to figure out how to
reset your Achievements.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.000
And we can look at doing
that in the next lesson.
