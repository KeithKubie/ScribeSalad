I think architects are more necessary

I think architects are more necessary
 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.970
I think architects are more necessary
than ever um because technology can

than ever um because technology can
 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.009

sometimes create the illusion that a

sometimes create the illusion that a
 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.470
sometimes create the illusion that a
building can be created without a

where technology has helped so far is in
the building of extraordinary shapes

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630
the building of extraordinary shapes
 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.760
the building of extraordinary shapes
that architects can imagine so you know

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770
that architects can imagine so you know
 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.389

was once possible to imagine strange and

impossible to build today technology

impossible to build today technology
allows us to build almost anything but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280
allows us to build almost anything but
 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.939

the computer can't create those things

it can't make them up an architect has
