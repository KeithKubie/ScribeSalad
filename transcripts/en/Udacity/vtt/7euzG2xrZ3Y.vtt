We want to thank everybody at Cal State University and Moss Landing Marine

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:05.182
Laboratories for letting us come here and learn all about operant conditioning

00:00:05.182 --> 00:00:09.003
and classical conditioning. But now I think its' time for us to head back, let

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:14.755
these girls take a break and start talking about social learning. Thank you.

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:18.636
&gt;&gt; Wave goodbye.

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:19.698
&gt;&gt; Bye.
