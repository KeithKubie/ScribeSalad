So personal motivation for
an app has really kind of

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.820
guided my learning,
as far as iOS development goes.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.160
One of the first apps that I really
wanted to build was an app for

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.250
reading comics.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.780
When I started reading
comics on my iPad,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.800
there weren't a ton of apps
that were really good.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.050
So, I started looking into
what the problem entailed and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.580
it included things like opening up
zip files and reading byte data.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.430
And without that motivation for
developing this tool for

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.310
myself, even though it may not
be useful for anybody else.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.560
I never would have gathered that
knowledge and learned all the different

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.360
things about the lower level development
that I otherwise wouldn't have
