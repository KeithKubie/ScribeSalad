00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, the answer--that's a 60% and here is why.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
At the threshold of Herd Immunity, the expression in the red parenthesis has to be 0.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we vaccinate even more persons, the number of susceptible persons shrinks further,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and this expression becomes negative, and now we can solve for the number of susceptible persons.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And we get 1/5 days divided by this coefficient--the days answer

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we get the number of 40 million persons--that's 40% of the population of 100 million.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If the number of infectious persons is negligible at that point of time,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
the remaining 60% have to be in the R compartment of the model.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They have to be immune.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If more than 60% of the population are in the R compartment, this expression is negative

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and we can never have an epidemic outbreak.

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So 60% is the threshold of Herd Immunity.
