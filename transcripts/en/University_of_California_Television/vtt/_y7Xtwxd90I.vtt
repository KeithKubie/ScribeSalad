- I'm Margaret Chowning, Professor
of Latin American History

00:01:03.115 --> 00:01:06.433
and Chair of the Moses
Lectureship Committee.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.390
We're pleased, along with
the graduate division,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.760
to have invited this year, Emmanuel Saez,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.060
this year's speaker in the Bernard Moses

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.653
Memorial Lecture Series.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.760
As a condition of this
bequest, we are are obligated,

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.660
we're also delighted, but we're obligated

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.630
to tell you how the endowments
supporting the lectures

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.143
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.760
In 1937, University of
California President,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.470
Robert Gordon Sproul and
the UC Board of Regents

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.170
established the Bernard
Moses Memorial Lectureship

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.520
in the Social Sciences.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.630
The Lectureship honors the
memory of the late Bernard Moses,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.330
a Professor of History
and Political Science

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.720
at the University of California

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720
from 1875 to 1911 and
an Emeritus Professor

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.893
from 1911 until his death in 1930.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.350
Professor Moses earned
a worldwide reputation

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.590
for his contributions to
understanding the problems

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.093
of the Latin American Republics

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.880
and was a pioneer scholar
of Latin American History.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.600
Professor Moses served as a
member of the United States

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.363
Philippine Commission from 1900 to 1904.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.310
Past lecturers have
included Herma Hill Kay,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.320
Lloyd Ullman, Nicholas Riasanovsky,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.900
George Lakoff, Kenneth
Stampp, Eugene Hammel,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.173
Ken Jowitt, and Carolyn Merchant.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.730
Now I'd like to say a few words

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.253
about our lecturer today, Emmanuel Saez.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.680
Professor Saez is professor of economics

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.838
and director of the Center
for Equitable Growth

00:02:43.838 --> 00:02:46.880
at the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.760
His research focuses on
tax policy and inequality,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.260
both from theoretical and
empirical perspectives.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.756
Jointly with Thomas Piketty,
he has constructed long-run

00:02:57.756 --> 00:03:01.401
historical series of income
inequality in the United States

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:05.750
that have been widely
discussed in the public debate.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.060
His research has advanced
our understanding

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.920
of income inequality in
relation to taxation,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.490
a critical and timely issue in the wake

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.970
of the recent economic recession.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.290
His landmark article, Striking It Richer:

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.294
The Evolution of Top
Incomes in the United States

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:25.810
revealed the vast and growing gap

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.370
between the incomes of the
nation's highest earners, the 1%,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.460
and the rest of Americans.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.488
Saez has not only pioneered useful methods

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:38.290
for understanding
long-term income patterns,

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.970
but has also explored
theoretical possibilities

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.610
for equitable growth.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.300
He continues to probe the
dynamics of income inequality

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.123
and produce models for optimal taxation.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.810
Emmanuel Saez received a BA in mathematics

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.490
at the École Normale Supérieure in 1994.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.280
He earned both an MD in economics from

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.420
the department of laboratory of applied

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.530
and theoretical economics and a PhD

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.900
in economics from MIT in 1999.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.020
He served as an assistant
professor of economics

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.110
at Harvard University from 1999 to 2002,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:19.780
and joined the Berkeley faculty in 2002.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.250
He was awarded the John Bates Clark Medal

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.370
of the American Economic
Association in 2009,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.420
and a MacArthur Fellowship in 2010.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.213
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Emmanuel Saez.

00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:36.902
(audience applause)

00:04:39.788 --> 00:04:40.788
- Thank you.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.010
Thank you, thank you very
much for this introduction.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.940
Thank you all for coming
tonight to this lecture.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.050
So tonight, I will talk about the research

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.720
that I've been carrying out
with many other researchers

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.900
about income inequality
evidence and implications.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.690
So let me introduce the topic.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.090
So as you all know free market economies

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.150
generate substantial economic growth,

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.080
but they also generate
inequality and indeed,

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.410
historically, this has
been the main criticism

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.740
of free market economies.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.010
And therefore this raises two
set of issues for economists.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.010
The first one is a positive question

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.380
about measuring and
understanding inequality.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.150
What is the level of inequality?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.893
How does it change over time?

00:05:36.893 --> 00:05:40.380
What are the factors
that drive inequality?

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.870
And the second, this
raises policy questions.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.530
That is, should the government
try and reduce inequality

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.970
using redistributive
policies such as taxes,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.480
transfer programs, and an
array of regulatory policies?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.080
So those are the questions
that I would like

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.640
to talk about tonight.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.281
So a simple way to measure inequality

00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:10.200
is to ask the question, a simple question,

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.200
what share of total market
income goes to various groups

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.020
in the income distribution,
such as the top 1%?

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.670
So what fraction of total
income does the top 1% earn?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.650
So it turns out that to
answer that question,

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.823
income tax statistics are
probably the most valuable

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:34.220
resource because they have been available

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.710
for a very long time, almost
a century in United States.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.710
Like, the federal individual
income tax turns 100 next year.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.000
It started in 1913,
and it's also available

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.160
across a wide range of countries.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.020
So with Piketty, indeed
we have used those data

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.672
to analyze income concentration
in the United States

00:06:58.672 --> 00:07:02.410
starting in 1913 when the data start,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.930
and since then, we've
continued this research agenda,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.480
and many other researchers have joined in,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.880
so that a large number
of countries, about 25,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.670
have now been analyzed and those studies

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.550
have been summarized in various studies.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.880
And we've put online
in what we have called

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.709
The World Top Incomes Database,

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:28.940
which is a website that
you can easily go to

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.010
and you can see, you know,
in read the countries here

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.860
that have been studied, so most of Europe,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.273
North America, a few developing
countries, and in blue,

00:07:38.273 --> 00:07:43.273
the countries that are
currently being studied.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.650
So, let me show you some evidence

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.140
from this collective research,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.070
first starting with the United States.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.070
So, this simple chart
here shows you the share

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:03.230
of total pre-tax income,
so before government taxes

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.333
and before the government
redistributes those taxes

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.910
in part in the form of transfers,

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.910
that go to the top 10% from 1917 to 2010.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.540
And so what you can see in this graph,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.540
is that the shape of this
curve, as the forms a U,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.020
with very high levels
of income concentration

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.092
with the top 10% capturing
almost half of total income

00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:35.270
in the first part of the 20th century,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.180
then a precipitous drop
during World War II,

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.627
that brings the share down to the low 30s,

00:08:42.627 --> 00:08:45.160
and you can see that for three decades,

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.320
that top 10% income share
stayed relatively low,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.910
then of course, the striking thing

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.280
is what has happened in the last 30 years,

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.280
where you see that share has
grown up pretty much back

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.230
where it was at the
beginning of the century,

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.543
reaching a peak of almost 50% in 2007.

00:09:05.543 --> 00:09:07.850
Note that it has dropped somewhat

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.130
during the Great Recession,
but you can se that already

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.840
in 2010, it's started back up,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.900
showing that the Great
Recession is certainly

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.880
not an event that per se is going

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.560
to dramatically change the picture.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.560
Now, notice that the increase
here from 33 to 50% in 2007

00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:34.406
is 17 points of total income
have gone toward the top 10%.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.259
What is striking is to
see how concentrated

00:09:38.259 --> 00:09:40.940
this phenomenon has actually been,

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.289
and you can see that in the next chart,

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:47.640
where we decompose the
top 10% into three groups.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.640
So the famous top 1% from
the press are in black,

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.240
and the next groups, the next 4% in blue,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.423
and the next 5% in red.

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:01.520
So the combination of those three groups

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.327
is what constitutes the top 10%.

00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:07.610
And so the striking thing
that I want you to notice,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.097
is that most of the
variations actually come

00:10:12.097 --> 00:10:14.456
in the top 1% group, and in particular,

00:10:14.456 --> 00:10:18.420
the very large increase since the late,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.650
since the 1970s has really been
concentrated in the top 1%.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.270
That goes from 9% to a maximum of 23%.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.943
So it's 14 points out of those 17 points

00:10:29.943 --> 00:10:34.180
I was mentioning before
really is top 1% phenomenon.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:37.300
You can see that those
upper middle class groups

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.300
below increase slightly,
but not nearly as much.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.775
And so actually the higher
you go in the distribution,

00:10:45.775 --> 00:10:48.450
the more extreme it is.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.590
So here we take the top
point one percent this time,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.473
and you see that the
increase, they captured only

00:10:54.473 --> 00:10:59.270
2.5% in the late 70s,
and they reached a peak

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.863
of about 12% in 2007.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.980
Okay, so given this
evidence, you may ask me,

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.980
why do we care about top income shares?

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.206
Don't we care more about
how the middle class

00:11:18.206 --> 00:11:20.650
or the poor are doing?

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.110
So at the onset, I should say, you know,

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.440
the emphasize the first point,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.590
inequality matters because people evaluate

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:32.080
their economic well-being
relative to others

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.660
and not in absolute terms.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.085
That is, if people were really behaving

00:11:38.085 --> 00:11:41.390
as most economic models assume, that is,

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.600
you value how well you are
doing only in absolute term,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.173
I probably wouldn't be here tonight

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:51.380
with such a big group of
people listening to me.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.950
Inequality is interesting
because the public

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.150
cares about it, and the
public cares about it

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.420
because we don't function,
or we don't think,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:00.780
in absolute terms.

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:04.300
We think in relative terms.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.750
Now, the second point I want to make

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.140
for why top income shares matter.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.910
They matter because those
changes that I've pointed out

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.810
to you have been actually so large

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.910
that they really
dramatically affect the way

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.670
you value economic
performance, country-wide.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:30.370
So to put it simply, the surge
of the top 1% income share

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.810
has been so large that income
growth of the bottom 99%

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.810
is only about half the
growth of the average income

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.843
in the economy.

00:12:42.898 --> 00:12:45.924
That is taking away the top
1% and you divide by two

00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:50.180
the growth rate, real
growth rate per family

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.220
in the economy over the last decades.

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.980
Okay, and then of course, I
can make points three and four,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.150
that is, the surge in top
incomes naturally gives

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.150
top earners more ability to
influence the political process.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.490
So a variety of pathway,
you know, think tanks,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.260
lobbying, campaign funding,
etc., even though we know,

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.010
that of course it's not
the sole determinant

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:21.390
of electoral outcomes, but
certainly they play a role

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.760
and they play a growing role
as their incomes increase.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.200
And finally, these indeed matters

00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:32.970
because it can undermine
confidence of the public

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.720
in the economic and political system.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.440
And when this confidence is undermined,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.730
of course, the public will want changes,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.530
and we hope that in a
democracy, of course,

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.620
those changes will take place through

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.772
a democratic reform and
there are many historical

00:13:47.772 --> 00:13:51.240
examples, and I'll come back to them.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.240
So just to show you
numbers, recent numbers

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.400
that illustrate what I just said.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:04.400
So here in this table, I show
you average income growth

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.590
per family, you know, before taxes.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:12.590
So those are pre-tax market
income over the last 17 years,

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.940
starting in '93 to 2010,
average incomes have grown 14%,

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.480
which is not a very large number.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.070
It's about slightly less than 1% per year.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.550
Top 1% incomes have grown much faster,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.960
almost 60% income growth,
and the striking thing

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.020
is that when you remove the
top 1% that has done so well

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.440
and you look at the bottom 99%,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.250
the growth is divided by about two.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:45.250
You know it goes from about 14% to 6.5%,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.960
so that effectively the
top 1% captures about

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.363
half of total economic growth.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:57.250
So here I've broken the period
in a number sub-periods,

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.530
you know, putting in red the recessions,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:02.239
and in black the expansions.

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:05.610
In all periods, in all expansions,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.300
during the Clinton administration,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.874
the Bush administrations,
and the recent recovery,

00:15:09.874 --> 00:15:14.874
the top 1% does a lot
better than the bottom 99%,

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.233
but the difference was that
in the Clinton administration,

00:15:20.233 --> 00:15:25.233
the bottom 99% was still
growing at a pretty fast rate.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.680
So that inequality was
not so much on the radar

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.470
screen in the press, in the public,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.050
in the policy discussion.

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:38.680
That changed, you know, the Bush expansion

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.910
was different in the sense
that there you really had

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:43.840
an enormous difference
with the bottom incomes

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.570
growing only 7% in the five
years of the Bush expansion

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.150
relative to the more than 20% growth

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.750
during Clinton administration.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.010
So of course, during the Great Recession,

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:59.940
both groups lost quite a bit of ground.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.470
The top 1% fluctuations are
always bigger in recessions,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.259
but what is really striking
is that the bottom 99% lost

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.800
about 10% in real term,
in per family income,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.480
before government taxes and transfers.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.501
In reality, the net
effect was lower thanks to

00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:20.290
a number of transfer programs, you know,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.043
food stamps and federal
that kicked in and helped,

00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:26.870
unemployment insurance
partly replace those income.

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.624
But this fall for the bottom
99% is truly enormous.

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:33.050
That is, we haven't
seen anything like that

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.883
since the Great Depression.

00:16:35.883 --> 00:16:38.700
And in the first year
for which we have data,

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.680
what is striking is that in the recovery,

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.680
you know, 2.3% gain in
2010, almost all of that

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.720
has gone to the top 1% with
virtually no growth yet

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.040
for the bottom 99%.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.870
So those numbers are
striking, and they illustrate

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:02.510
why inequality is so much discussed.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:06.820
So let me continue with U.S evidence,

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:11.124
showing you something
about the composition

00:17:11.124 --> 00:17:16.124
of top incomes, and that's
very important for discussion

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.160
that is going to follow.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.370
So here it's not super visible,

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.620
but what this graph shows you, if you look

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.530
at the top line here,
it's the share of the top

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.510
point one percent, what
I showed you before.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:32.164
But what you see next
is that for each year,

00:17:32.164 --> 00:17:35.180
the income of the top point one percent

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.920
are decomposed into various groups,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.480
starting with salaries, business income,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.710
capital income, and capital gains.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.389
And so what I want to point out is that

00:17:46.389 --> 00:17:49.240
in the early part of the 20th century

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.670
you see that the vast
majority of top incomes

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:55.890
was composed of capital income,

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.770
which are returns on assets.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.710
So what happen is that here
you have the Gilded Age,

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.710
where a few big business
monopolies developed,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.342
they were nicknamed the Robber Barons,

00:18:08.342 --> 00:18:11.440
so build enormous fortunes.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.240
That here, the Robber Barons here are old

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.020
or they've passed the
fortune to their heirs,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.120
so these people at the
top of the distribution

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.260
are really, if you will, rentiers.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.899
People who live off
the very large fortunes

00:18:23.899 --> 00:18:26.540
that were accumulated through business

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.840
in the decades before.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.210
And those fortunes come down dramatically,

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.640
you know, during the Great Depression,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.167
the New Deal of Roosevelt, World War II,

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:38.040
and they stay relatively low.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.900
And then what you see here is a phenomenon

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.947
that is quite a bit different,

00:18:42.947 --> 00:18:46.737
and you see there is a lot
less black here than there

00:18:46.737 --> 00:18:49.660
and there is a lot more salaries.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.980
That is a dramatic increase
here in top incomes

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.960
as being first the creation, if you will,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.860
of new fortunes.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.930
So you can think a`bout the new companies

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.900
that have emerged, you know, Microsoft,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.730
Google, Facebook, etc., and also,

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.410
new forms of jobs, like the
hedge fund managers, etc.,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.010
that have built fortunes.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.360
The point is that those are new fortunes

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.803
that people initially make
through their labor, okay?

00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:20.755
Most of the people now at the top

00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:24.130
have been self-made, or if you will,

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.220
they are earning their
income through their labor.

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:32.220
They are not inheriting huge
fortunes from prior decades,

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.231
and that's very important
because that affects

00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:38.680
a lot the way the public perceives

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.400
whether the process, you know,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.900
inequality is fair or unfair.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.870
Naturally, most people tend to think

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:50.870
that in a well-functioning
market, earned income is fair.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.740
In contrast, you know, if you've received

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.100
an enormous fortune from your parents,

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.257
the public values that
a lot less, you know,

00:20:00.257 --> 00:20:04.890
and could understand
why you should be taxed,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.580
for example, through
inheritance taxation, etc.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:13.580
So that certainly plays
a role in the debate.

00:20:15.369 --> 00:20:20.369
So the next thing, so
let me re-emphasize that

00:20:22.414 --> 00:20:25.819
in the short run, the
top 1% has taken a hit

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:29.100
in the Great Recession,
because capital gains,

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.550
stock options, business
profits that constitute

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:37.380
the bulk of top incomes
are hit a lot harder.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:42.380
In contrast, wage earners
that live below the top 1%,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.580
so in the top 10% but not in the top 1%,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.290
do well, so you see this
is a striking thing.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.850
I haven't pointed out, but you see that

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.500
during the Great Recession here,

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.930
where top incomes fall, you
see that the next two groups

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.970
do actually gain, and the same was true

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.130
during the Great Depression.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.750
So those are salaried people, you know,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.428
in the upper groups,
so you can think about

00:21:07.428 --> 00:21:11.990
well-paid university
professors would be an example

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.329
of people living in those groups.

00:21:14.329 --> 00:21:16.109
We tend to keep our salaries, you know,

00:21:16.109 --> 00:21:19.490
even if there are budget cuts, etc.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:24.280
We tend to do pretty well in bad times.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.180
But the key thing from this graph is that

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.740
you can see that during recessions,

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.600
so for example, in the
dot-com crash of 2000,

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.140
top incomes aren't so lost a lot.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.940
And actually a lot of that
was lost in California

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.400
for new companies, etc.,
tech companies collapse.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.030
But you see that that fall doesn't last.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:51.259
The top incomes bounce back
and we are already seeing it

00:21:51.259 --> 00:21:55.350
here at the end of the Great Recession.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.207
Top incomes are starting to bounce back.

00:21:57.207 --> 00:22:00.786
And contrast that with
the Great Depression here,

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:03.730
where you don't, you see them
bouncing back a little bit,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.110
but not for long, and then
they continue dropping

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.330
during the New Deal and World War II.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.720
So this contrast is very
important because it shows you,

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.400
and that's something you can
see as well in other countries,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.840
is that first top incomes
are hit by a shock,

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.750
so it can be here, a Great Depression.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.180
In other countries it can be a war.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.709
But if there isn't a significant change

00:22:25.709 --> 00:22:28.210
in government policies,

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.670
top incomes will typically bounce back.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:34.680
And in the historical
case where they don't,

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.981
it's because the government
has really changed

00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:41.430
the rule of the game through
a number of regulatory

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:46.430
and tax policies that drives
down the income concentration.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.860
So here in the current policy debate,

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.410
certainly we are not
contemplating policy changes

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:59.340
that are nearly as large as
what was done in the New Deal.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.760
So my best bet is that, no
matter what the outcome is

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.850
of the negotiation about the fiscal cliff

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:08.660
between what President Obama has proposed

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.390
and what the Republicans
would like, those parameters,

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.635
are probably not radical
enough to dramatically affect

00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:20.635
the picture of income
concentration in the United States.

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.150
Okay, so now let me go back

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.710
to the World Top Income
Database and give you

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:30.730
some international perspectives.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:35.730
So let me start here with
English-speaking countries.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:41.930
So in this chart, besides
the United States in black,

00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:46.953
I have put the United Kingdom
in red, and Canada in blue.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.020
And so what is striking in this chart

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.240
is that all three countries
follow pretty similar trends.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.910
All three curves are U-shaped.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.880
They all start with high
levels of income concentration,

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:02.000
that's the top 1% share.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.060
It falls a lot, it falls even the most

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.470
in the United Kingdom,
and then it goes back up,

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.660
perhaps not as much as in the U.S.,

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.473
but still significantly so.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:17.340
So you might ask, maybe this
is a universal phenomenon,

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.910
this U-shape, this is
actually not the case.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:25.610
'Cause if we now look at
continental Europe and Japan,

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.710
so I've picked two European
countries, France in black,

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.900
Sweden in blue, and then Japan in red.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.133
You see that the first part of the picture

00:24:36.133 --> 00:24:38.840
looks quite similar to what we've seen

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.250
for the English-speaking countries.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:45.200
A dramatic drop that is very important.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.130
In the beginning of the 20th century,

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.050
those European countries,
Sweden, you know,

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.350
who is now known as the
most egalitarian country

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.717
had actually enormously high
income concentration actually.

00:24:55.717 --> 00:24:58.700
Off the chart, as you
can see here for Sweden.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.420
You know, I've put the
same scale as the U.S.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.603
And all three countries here
do experience a large drop

00:25:09.334 --> 00:25:13.800
in income concentration that
follows the historical pattern

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.640
or the historical events in each country.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.797
You see that for Japan, the
dramatic event is World War II,

00:25:20.797 --> 00:25:24.640
and you know and then the U.S. occupation

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.030
and economic policies, you know,

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:28.170
actually decided by the U.S.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.580
France, you know you have first a shock

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.510
in the 20s, then the war.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:34.940
Sweden has big shocks
in the inter-war period.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.520
Not so much in World War
II, because they weren't

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.180
part of the conflict.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.521
Bottom line, through different
historical processes,

00:25:42.521 --> 00:25:45.520
all three countries have dropped down

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.290
their income concentration dramatically,

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.567
like the English-speaking countries.

00:25:48.567 --> 00:25:53.060
And so what is different
is that, in recent years,

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.550
the increase in income
concentration in those countries

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:59.070
is not nearly as large as
what has been experienced

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.290
in the English-speaking countries.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.168
It has gone up some, but
you see if you compare

00:26:05.168 --> 00:26:07.240
the charts that are on the same scale,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:12.240
you see it's really quantitatively
very, very different.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.490
So this point is important
because it shows you

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.640
that the very large increase
in income concentration

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.460
for the United States is
not a universal phenomenon,

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:28.470
which means that it cannot
be explained solely by,

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.190
say, changes in technology
and globalization,

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.320
because all those economies
are advanced economies

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.080
that go through pretty
much the same technological

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:42.080
and globalization forces.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.170
What those graphs show
you is that there is more

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.860
than just technology,
obviously, the way institutions

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.969
and government policies react
to technological changes

00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:58.969
play a major role in the
shaping of income concentration.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:03.140
So in terms of those policies,

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.140
I'm going to focus next on
the role of top tax rates,

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.740
which is indeed, I will hopefully
convince you of that fact,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.640
that this is a major component
explaining the changes

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.450
in pre-tax, even before
tax, income concentration.

00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.381
So you've, all of you,
I'm sure have heard about

00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:31.870
the debate on how much
we should tax the rich.

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:34.836
Indeed it is at the
core of the negotiations

00:27:34.836 --> 00:27:38.710
on the fiscal cliff, but so,

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.560
here is briefly summarized, the situation.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:47.560
So pre-tax, top U.S. incomes
have surged in recent decades,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:52.250
with the top 1% income
share increasing from nine

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:56.640
to about 20% today.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.250
Okay, so that means, that if you,

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.980
there is a lot more money now at the top,

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.260
so potentially, a lot more income to tax.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.110
So there is perhaps fiscal
reserve has built up

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:09.870
definitely at the top of the distribution.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.480
So in 2010, top 1% income
earners pay an average

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.900
federal individual tax rate of 22%.

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.580
And so that represents
in taxes 2.6% of GDP.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.710
And so if you do a very
naive computation and say,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.200
let's increase their
tax from 22% on average

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:32.227
to 33% on average, you
would raise 1.3 GDP point,

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:37.150
which is 200 billion per year,

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.880
which is, you know, according
to the ten-year projection

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.140
that is used for formal budgeting,

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:45.900
that would be 2.6 trillion.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:50.900
Obama has proposed raising
taxes by about 1.6 trillion

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.950
on this group, and that
is about 1% of GDP,

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:59.370
basically bringing back
the taxes on top incomes

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:01.210
to what it was in the early

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:02.790
part of the Clinton administration.

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:05.170
So it doesn't go from 22 to 33,

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.263
but it would go from 22 to perhaps 28%.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.660
So obviously you can
see with those numbers

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.900
that indeed the top 1%
has a large potential

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.902
tax capacity, but higher
taxes on the top 1%

00:29:21.902 --> 00:29:25.148
might discourage economic activity,

00:29:25.148 --> 00:29:28.450
encourage tax avoidance, so
that those naive calculations

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.663
might not give you the right numbers

00:29:30.663 --> 00:29:32.780
to really understand what would happen

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.210
if we were to increase
significantly taxes on top earners.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.713
So, let me discuss
briefly economic effects

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:44.451
of taxing the top 1%.

00:29:44.451 --> 00:29:48.076
I will show you that
indeed there is strong

00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:52.100
empirical evidence that
pre-tax top incomes

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:57.100
react to top tax rates, that
is the naive calculation

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.700
is wrong in the sense
that there is a response

00:30:02.019 --> 00:30:05.949
to the tax system at the top.

00:30:05.949 --> 00:30:09.460
However, just knowing
that there is a response

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.640
is not enough to decide
whether it's a good

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.870
or bad thing to tax top incomes.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:17.703
You have to understand
what is the mechanism

00:30:17.703 --> 00:30:20.980
through which top incomes respond.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:25.980
And here in this slide I've
laid out three scenarios.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.400
So the first one is a
classical supply-side scenario,

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.140
that's the conservative argument.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.170
You tax top earners
more, and they are going

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:39.560
to work less and earn
less, and in that scenario,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.210
obviously top tax rates
should not be too high,

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:47.623
because it's self-defeating
above some point.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:54.210
Second scenario is about
tax avoidance, tax evasion.

00:30:54.923 --> 00:30:58.389
Top earners are going
to avoid or evade more

00:30:58.389 --> 00:31:01.550
when top tax rate increases.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.180
So that increasing tax
rates in the current system

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.980
is also going to be self-defeating.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.469
The very big difference,
though, with this scenario

00:31:09.469 --> 00:31:12.320
is that if you're in scenario two,

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.420
there is a smarter solution,

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:18.760
which consists in first
fixing the tax system

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.600
so that you eliminate
avoidance opportunities.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.190
And there is a very large literature

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.290
that's showing, indeed,
that the rich are savvy

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:31.530
about exploiting tax
avoidance opportunities

00:31:32.469 --> 00:31:35.660
when they arise, but also
that the government policies

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.440
play a major role in shaping how many

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.440
of those tax avoidance
opportunities are present.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.580
So in that sense, I
agree with both parties,

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:52.360
Republicans and Obama, that
broadening the base at the top

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.857
of the income distribution
is very important,

00:31:55.857 --> 00:31:59.215
and it is indeed a first basic
step that you need to make

00:31:59.215 --> 00:32:02.250
if you want to effectively be able

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.540
to raise revenue from the top.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.530
But then the second thing
is that once you've brought

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:10.174
in the base at the top,
that's when precisely

00:32:10.174 --> 00:32:15.174
you are in shape and you're
able to raise top tax rates.

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.900
Now, a third scenario
that I want to point out

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.900
is rent-seeking, and so is the
Occupy Wall Street movement.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.530
That's a scenario that has been discussed

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.990
much more widely in the press.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.520
The idea there is that
the very large gains

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.390
that we've seen in those
early charts, perhaps,

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.193
are not due to more economic activity

00:32:43.193 --> 00:32:47.925
created by the top 1%, but
by the ability of the top 1%

00:32:47.925 --> 00:32:52.410
to extract, at the
expense of the bottom 99%,

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:56.763
a larger share of the economic pie.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.460
And it's possible that the top 1%

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.210
is more able to extract
a larger share of the pie

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.390
when top tax rates are
low, because it gives them

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:13.330
more incentives, if you
want, to go more aggressively

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.343
after higher levels of compensation.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.350
Which means that top
incomes are going to react

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.180
to top tax rate, but
the policy implication

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.440
is radically different.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.410
In that case, you want high top tax rates

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.290
precisely to prevent top
earners from aggressively

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.920
extracting a large share of income.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.250
Okay, now so I've laid out the
three theoretical scenarios,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.043
so which situation are we in?

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.070
The first graph I want to point out here

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:51.070
is going back to the top
1% in the U.S. in black,

00:33:51.189 --> 00:33:55.144
but now I've put also on that graph

00:33:55.144 --> 00:34:00.144
with this scale here in red,

00:34:00.249 --> 00:34:05.043
the top marginal tax rates for the federal

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.060
individual tax rate, and so
what you can see very clearly

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.410
is that the top individual
tax rate was very high

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:16.291
starting with the end
of the Great Depression,

00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:19.300
World War II, post-World War II,

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.980
and then came down dramatically
starting in the 70s.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.350
So that you can see that the red curve

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:29.630
is the inverse image of the black curve.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:34.177
And remember, the black
curve is pre-tax income.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.457
The share of total pre-tax
income going to the top 1%,

00:34:40.457 --> 00:34:41.290
and so that, in principle,

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:43.830
there is no mechanical relationship

00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:48.577
between the two curves, so
when you see this evidence,

00:34:48.577 --> 00:34:53.577
and it's also borne out by the
analysis of other countries.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.490
You have to conclude that indeed there is

00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:59.870
a strong relationship,
that is if the U.S. were

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.630
to go back to very high tax
rate, like 70%, 80%, 90%,

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.980
it's very unlikely that
top incomes, pre-tax,

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.617
would stay at the very high
level that they are at now.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.700
So you see, just to put
that in perspective,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:20.650
the debate today is between
Clinton versus Bush tax rates,

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.833
so you see it's 39.6 versus 35.

00:35:24.229 --> 00:35:26.360
This is a minuscule change relative

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.020
to the enormous changes in top tax rate

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.860
that the U.S. has experienced.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.890
That's why I was saying early on

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.701
that probably going back to Clinton

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:41.701
is not going to dramatically
affect top incomes.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.790
But certainly if we were going back

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.490
to what it was under Carter, you know,

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:50.000
or Eisenhower, etc., it
would make a big difference.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
So, now of course, this
chart here showing you

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.020
the relationship between pre-tax incomes

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.620
and top tax rates doesn't tell us in which

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.660
of the three scenarios we are in,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.230
and it's critical to know where we are in.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.310
So the first one I want to dispel

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:13.270
is the notion that tax
avoidance explains everything.

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:15.363
So that's a criticism that we've received

00:36:15.363 --> 00:36:17.457
now more from conservative circles

00:36:17.457 --> 00:36:20.671
saying, look, this is a nice chart,

00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:23.830
but perhaps it's a chart just showing you

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.930
that the rich are savvy
about avoiding taxes

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:31.560
and doesn't tell us anything
about how really the rich,

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.810
how rich they are relative to the average,

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.650
because you are only
picking up tax avoidance.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.930
Namely, now top earners do
report their full income

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:43.720
and that's why they look so high.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.431
Back then, with tax rates so high,

00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:50.550
they were hiding their
income and that's why

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.560
you didn't see them on the tax statistics.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.359
So the reason why I
think this is not right

00:36:58.359 --> 00:37:00.833
is for the following reason.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.430
To get this right in
principle here in black,

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.161
you would want the full
economic income of the top 1%,

00:37:11.161 --> 00:37:13.170
that is their income that is taxed

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:15.970
according to the regular tax schedule,

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:20.970
plus the extra income that
avoids the very high tax rates

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.243
by showing up in other
forms that are tax favored.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.248
And it turns out that this black curve

00:37:28.248 --> 00:37:33.248
is the sum of the ordinary
income taxed at the high rates,

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.640
plus the tax-favored capital gains.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:40.230
That is if use in this graph,
if I add in this chart,

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.530
ordinary income, that's
the white curve here,

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.650
it is slightly lower, but you can see

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.820
that overall, it follows
the black pretty closely,

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.070
in the sense that the gap between the two

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.230
are capital gains that are taxed

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.340
at the very preferential
rate over the full period.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.470
So if the conservative critic was right,

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.950
this gap should be enormous.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:07.360
In the 1960s, when the
gap in the two tax rates

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.360
was so large, and it should
be smaller, you know,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.960
in the period where that gap closes down.

00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.690
So sometimes that's
perhaps the simplest way

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.710
I can try to convey to a broad audience

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.100
why, I think, studying
those things carefully,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:28.159
that tax avoidance cannot
explain those trends.

00:38:28.159 --> 00:38:33.071
So now, if it's not tax avoidance,

00:38:33.071 --> 00:38:37.213
it really becomes a stark debate
between the supply-siders,

00:38:37.213 --> 00:38:41.330
you know, the top 1% are our job creators,

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:44.318
and by taxing them a lot,
you are going to kill jobs,

00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:47.800
versus the rent-seeking scenario,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.260
the top 1%, you have to
tax them or otherwise

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.190
they are going to extract
a lot more, and steal,

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.210
if you want, from the rest of the economy,

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.280
namely the bottom 99%.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:04.720
So how do we tear apart
those two strikingly

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.485
different scenarios?

00:39:06.485 --> 00:39:09.070
So first let me say that I
don't have a definitive proof.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.930
What I'm going to show you
are a few suggestive charts.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.010
That's a very big question.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.840
I wish, you know, economics
was advanced enough

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.330
that I could give you a true answer,

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.330
but at least the goal of economists

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:25.000
is precisely to try and
understand those things.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.907
So if we're in the rent-seeking scenario,

00:39:28.907 --> 00:39:32.880
the growth of top 1% income should come

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.386
at the expense of the bottom 99%.

00:39:37.386 --> 00:39:42.386
And conversely, and
indeed, what is striking

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:46.460
in the U.S. is that, in
the historical record,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.900
the growth of the top 1% income

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:53.900
versus the bottom 99%
income looks that way.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:01.410
That is, it is not a tide
lifts all boats together.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:07.840
It really looks like, when
the bottom 99% is doing well,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.810
the top 1% is doing
poorly, and conversely,

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.980
when the bottom 99% is doing poorly,

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.840
the top 1% is doing well.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.509
So this chart shows you that.

00:40:17.509 --> 00:40:21.600
So here I've shown in white the evolution

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.427
of bottom 99% income, and
in black, top 1% incomes

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.597
starting from a base 100 in 1913.

00:40:29.597 --> 00:40:31.360
And so what you can see is that,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.900
first part, you know, all groups do poorly

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.410
because of the Great Depression,

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.910
but starting with the end
of the Great Depression,

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.522
the New Deal, you see that the bottom 99%

00:40:42.522 --> 00:40:45.460
jumps up and grows actually very fast.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.460
Up to the early 70s, while the
top 1% grows very modestly.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:56.490
In contrast, starting in the late 1970s,

00:40:56.490 --> 00:41:01.490
the top 1% start increasing very fast,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:07.210
while growth for the bottom
99% slows down dramatically.

00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:12.370
So you see that indeed
you know that you hear

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.880
a lot perhaps more among economics

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.310
that in the end growth trumps everything,

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:19.770
and that's true if you look perhaps

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.730
at two or three centuries, but if you look

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:27.360
at just a few decades, it
doesn't look like that.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.262
That is one group can experience
a very different growth

00:41:30.262 --> 00:41:35.262
situation than another group
and that shows up here.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:43.060
So of course this evidence is not enough

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.839
to conclude so you would want to see,

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:49.796
you know, to bring more data.

00:41:49.796 --> 00:41:52.570
And that's what the
World Top Income Database

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:56.180
can help you with, to
see whether the patterns

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.234
that we've seen for the U.S.

00:41:58.234 --> 00:42:03.234
are borne out in other countries.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.409
So the first thing that is very easy

00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:09.520
for which we have very good evidence

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:11.980
and that I can be confident about,

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.320
is the first thing, that is,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.990
that the fact that there is a strong link

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.825
between top tax rates and
how much the top 1% gets

00:42:18.825 --> 00:42:22.900
is indeed true.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.780
So the best way to see this is to look

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.760
at the evolution over time.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:31.500
So this is the world in the early 1960s,

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:35.070
where I've put the top
marginal tax rate here,

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:40.070
so a measure of the tax
burden on very top incomes,

00:42:42.023 --> 00:42:44.430
against the top 1% income share.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:47.470
So that's, and that time in the 1960s,

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.360
top income shares are not very high.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.907
Most countries are below 10%

00:42:51.907 --> 00:42:54.270
and there is a distribution of tax rates,

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.630
but you can see that a very large number

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:01.630
of those rich countries
are adopting top tax rates

00:43:03.057 --> 00:43:06.240
that are very high, very high
from today's perspective.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:07.647
And what is striking here is that actually

00:43:07.647 --> 00:43:12.440
the U.S. and the U.K. were
the most extreme countries

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:17.440
in terms of how high they were
setting their top tax rates.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.911
You know, countries like France and Sweden

00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:24.050
were not as extreme as
the U.S. and the U.K.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:26.993
Now, turn to the world as it is today

00:43:26.993 --> 00:43:31.670
and you can see that the
dots all shifted to the left.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.300
That is today, there is no country

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.080
that tax top earners at more than 60%.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.730
And at the same time the
dots move to the left,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.740
they also moved back up in that direction.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.772
So as top tax rates went down,

00:43:47.772 --> 00:43:51.760
the top 1% pre-tax started to do better,

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.780
of course, with the U.S.
being the most extreme case,

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.808
so that if you really plot the change

00:43:58.808 --> 00:44:02.688
against the change that is by how much

00:44:02.688 --> 00:44:05.619
the country cuts its top
marginal tax rates from the 60s

00:44:05.619 --> 00:44:09.900
to the present and how well the top does,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.800
that is by how much the top
1% income share increases.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.670
You can see that there is a
very strong correlation here.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.520
You know, with the U.S.
being the case study,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.810
the most extreme case study
that I describe in detail.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.955
But you can see that more
or less, the countries array

00:44:24.955 --> 00:44:27.913
themselves along a diagonal.

00:44:29.652 --> 00:44:32.606
Here the countries that don't
cut their top tax rates,

00:44:32.606 --> 00:44:34.280
and there are a number of them,

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.920
don't see much change
in top income tax share.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.510
The countries that cut a lot

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.060
tend to see very large increases.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.210
Now, of course that doesn't answer

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.710
whether it's a good or a bad policy again,

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:49.360
so what you want to know,

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.550
the ultimate question
actually where the debate

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:56.460
really focuses on is that
is cutting the top tax rate

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.850
good for economic growth or not?

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:04.850
And, again, you can use
this area of countries,

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:08.770
so if you just plot,
again, the same countries

00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:12.040
by how much they cut their
top marginal tax rate

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:17.040
since the 1960s and how
growth has been doing

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.230
at the macroeconomic level,
you know GDP per capita,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.110
real annual growth.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:26.140
I see a cloud that bears no
relationship, apparently,

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.093
with tax policy but the
cloud is really dispersed,

00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:32.850
in the sense that countries
that were very poor in 1960,

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:36.710
like Portugal, Ireland,
Japan, grew very fast,

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:38.700
while countries that were a lot richer,

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.490
like Switzerland and the U.S., of course,

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:43.960
grew slower, so this is
not very informative.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.500
So to tighten that cloud,
you want to control

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.210
for initial growth,
which is what we do here.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:55.140
So this is growth per
capital taking into account

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.160
that some countries start
richer than others in 1960,

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.750
so naturally are not
going to grow as fast.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.360
So you see that the cloud tightens,

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.570
but it's hard to see a
very strong link here.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:11.000
That is, if the conservatives were right,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.770
we should see a diagonal here.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.600
If the Occupy Wall Street were right,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.600
it should be totally flat,
because changing the top tax rate

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.780
changes the way income gets distributed,

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.564
but doesn't affect growth.

00:46:27.564 --> 00:46:30.660
You know, perhaps it goes down slightly,

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.550
but it's not significant statistically.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:35.720
If you look at the U.S. and the U.K.,

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.907
they have a growth
experience that is no better

00:46:38.907 --> 00:46:42.370
than countries like Finland or Germany

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.640
that have had dramatically
different tax policies.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:51.250
So again, this is an
analysis at the macro level.

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:53.890
It doesn't prove the case,
but it shows you that

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:55.910
just by a comparison of countries,

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:00.130
it's hard to detect strong growth effects

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:05.130
of cutting taxes at the top,

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:08.650
while it is very easy to detect a change

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:13.610
in income distribution pre-tax
by cutting taxes at the top.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:21.210
Okay, so conclude my presentation,

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:26.210
the U.S. historical evidence
and international evidence

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:29.970
shows that tax policy plays a key role

00:47:29.970 --> 00:47:34.540
in the shaping of the pre-tax income gap.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:39.540
High top tax rates reduce
the pre-tax income gap,

00:47:39.586 --> 00:47:42.540
perhaps, apparently, without
hurting economic growth.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.585
So that you know, looking at the choices

00:47:46.585 --> 00:47:50.570
the U.S. faces, if it's a discussion

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:54.590
between the Obama plan
and the Republican plan,

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:57.910
the changes here in tax
rates are not so large

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.180
that they are going to dramatically affect

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.073
the pre-tax income gap.

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:04.740
So, indeed you will get
more revenue by taxing

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.470
the richer more, but you are not going

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:10.280
to fundamentally change
the inequality dynamic.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.620
Now, when the public favor,
we know that the public

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:21.561
is in favor of slightly
higher taxes on the rich,

00:48:21.561 --> 00:48:25.550
in the end, my reading of
the historical evidence

00:48:26.591 --> 00:48:29.180
and the present evidence is
that the public will favor

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:33.062
more progressive taxation
only if it is convinced

00:48:33.062 --> 00:48:38.062
that top income gains are
detrimental the bottom 99%.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.680
So in the same way that during the,

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.360
after the Great Depression
and during the New Deal,

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.590
those top incomes were
accumulated fortunes

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.410
that didn't really mean
much for economic growth

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:53.150
because they were coming from the past,

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:56.770
so they were, the rich
were criticized as rentiers

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.780
and the public was willing to accept

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.280
a dramatically different tax system.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.650
I think for the public to accept again

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:10.650
very high tax rates, the
psyche really has to change

00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:16.410
in this direction, and that's why the type

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:21.120
of economic analysis, really
understanding what happens

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:24.220
and what drives those changes at the top

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:28.030
are so important for tax policy.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:33.030
So let me stop here and I'm
happy to take some questions.

00:49:34.041 --> 00:49:37.041
(audience applause)

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:44.540
- [Margaret] Question number one,

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:46.899
looking at the historical record,

00:49:46.899 --> 00:49:50.250
what is the likelihood
that high-income inequality

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:53.630
in the U.S. can be
reversed without violence?

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.933
For example, wars, either
external or internal.

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:05.304
- That's a good and difficult question.

00:50:05.304 --> 00:50:10.304
I would say that, again if we
look at the historical record,

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.365
a dramatic drop in income concentration

00:50:16.365 --> 00:50:21.200
almost always happens
with a big shock first.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.850
A big shock that the
government has not directly

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:25.870
or purposely manufactured, so it can be

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:28.150
a Great Depression in the United States,

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:33.150
it can be World War II
in a country like Japan.

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.890
However, the shock is not enough,

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.270
the shock really needs then to lead

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:42.770
to dramatically different policy.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:47.770
So, the U.S. had its shock
recently in the Great Recession.

00:50:49.264 --> 00:50:54.240
I think that would have
been the time, really,

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.240
to change dramatically
policy-making regarding

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.820
policies regarding the rich.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:05.000
It was done a little bit
on the regulatory side

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.730
with financial regulation
that was increased

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:11.660
but not increased nearly
as much as it was increased

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.420
during the Great Depression.

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.480
On taxes, at the top,
we didn't see anything,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.920
because we saw an extension
of the Bush tax cuts.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.010
I think, I mean personally, I view that

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.330
as a missed opportunity, because in 2009,

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:27.950
you could explain to the public that

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:30.560
this dramatic increase
in income concentration,

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:33.056
a lot of it coming from finance,

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:36.440
did not bring good effects
in the U.S. economy,

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.040
and that was the moment,
perhaps, to convince the public.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.840
So it didn't happen.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.530
We're out of this crisis to some extent,

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:51.310
so I don't see a dramatic
change in U.S. economic policy

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:55.450
in the foreseeable future
without seeing first

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:57.493
some sort of dramatic event.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.073
- [Margaret] Okay, thank you.

00:52:02.073 --> 00:52:07.073
This is a sort of related
question to the point

00:52:07.590 --> 00:52:11.700
you were just making, a
question about timing.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:16.640
Why are you telling us this
story now and not years ago

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.772
when it might have
counteracted the Tea Party?

00:52:19.772 --> 00:52:21.710
(audience laughter)

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:25.460
- Okay, so on this one, I would say that

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.000
we've been telling this story
for a very long time actually.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.810
We did, that U.S. study first came out

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:35.270
at the very beginning of 2001,

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:40.100
so more than 10 years
ago, but at that time,

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:43.100
it was just the beginning
of the dot-com crash,

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.960
but it had been such a
good growth experience

00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:49.130
in the United States in the 1990s,

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:54.117
that really inequality was not
at all on the radar screen.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:57.900
So the press wasn't
necessarily that interested

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.360
in this type of story.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.880
So it took years, you know, as the public

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.690
and the press was experiencing
some sort of disconnect

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:11.040
between relatively good
economic performance

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.170
during the Bush administration,
if you look at GDP growth

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:17.800
measures, they didn't look bad.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.780
And yet, people were
feeling that they were

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.260
not getting ahead, and
that's when our numbers

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.510
started getting traction
because they could explain

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:27.794
why the bottom 99% wasn't feeling

00:53:27.794 --> 00:53:31.103
a large fraction of that growth.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.868
- [Margaret] Okay, a
question related to the

00:53:34.868 --> 00:53:37.959
first question about violence.

00:53:37.959 --> 00:53:41.780
Do you think there is a
danger of political turmoil

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:45.840
worsening if economic
inequality is not reined in?

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.770
- Yes, so this, yes, so
actually I should have

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:51.560
said that in the first
question, so I'm glad

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:55.731
to have a chance to go back go it.

00:53:55.731 --> 00:54:00.731
I didn't show you that chart
about developing countries

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:03.940
because that shows income concentration

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:07.033
in Argentina, South Africa, and the U.S.

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:10.600
What I want to say is that the U.S. here,

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.350
you can see has a level
now of income concentration

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:16.370
that is comparable to developing countries

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:18.730
that are known to have
extremely high levels

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.463
of income concentration.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:25.704
And indeed, an issue for those countries,

00:54:25.704 --> 00:54:29.470
and that's, of course, very
well-known in Latin America,

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:31.810
that is the political turmoil in many

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:36.620
Latin American countries comes
from issues of inequality.

00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:40.010
There is a feeling that there is an unfair

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:43.050
distribution of wealth
and economic resources,

00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.600
enhanced incomes, that
leads people to choose

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:52.300
radical policy options, and
then we encounter revolution,

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:54.870
and you end up with
right-wing dictatorships

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:59.790
fighting left-wing guerrillas, etc.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:03.399
But political turmoil that
is definitely very harmful

00:55:03.399 --> 00:55:08.399
to economic development, so
that has been the situation

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:11.030
in a number of Latin American countries.

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:16.030
But the case of Europe and other countries

00:55:16.310 --> 00:55:19.630
shows you that you can
have changes in policies

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:24.170
that are not accompanied
with economic turmoil.

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:26.740
That is you can have situations where,

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:29.340
you know, like the United States
is actually a good example,

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:33.614
where you can have really radical policies

00:55:33.614 --> 00:55:37.917
regarding top incomes, with
tax rates that are just

00:55:37.917 --> 00:55:42.207
seem inconceivable today, above 70%,

00:55:42.207 --> 00:55:46.480
and that being accepted by the
vast majority of the public.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:50.890
And actually both major political parties,

00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.920
so I would say there is a risk.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.190
We don't know how it is going to turn out.

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.260
I hope, you know, it will be a repeat

00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.954
of the New Deal rather than a situation

00:56:03.954 --> 00:56:07.380
like Chile or Argentina.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.147
- [Margaret] Okay, and
following on that question.

00:56:10.147 --> 00:56:13.400
Do you see any relationship between

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.150
your research and the growing incidence

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:20.470
of land grabs for agriculture
and mining investment

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:24.090
primarily in the global
south by large corporate,

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:28.633
equity, and even national investors?

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:33.470
- On this one, I would
say yes, the land grab

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:38.470
and land reform is at
the core in all the issue

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:42.220
of redistribution in developing countries,

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.150
because the way inequality
manifests itself

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:48.561
in a country like, not so much now,

00:56:48.561 --> 00:56:53.220
like Argentina was in it by
very unequal land division,

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:57.640
so one of the first
things that you want to do

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.230
to try to improve redistribution is

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:01.633
what's called land reform.

00:57:03.126 --> 00:57:04.520
That is, sharing the land more equally

00:57:05.387 --> 00:57:07.100
and also theories that says
that that's good for growth

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.052
because that motivates
the small land owners

00:57:09.052 --> 00:57:12.973
to work hard on their
products, and that way,

00:57:12.973 --> 00:57:17.070
of course, this is not
relevant for an economy

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:22.070
like the U.S. today,
but it was historically

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.415
an important phenomenon.

00:57:25.415 --> 00:57:30.090
It's also interesting related,
I mean it's peripheral

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:32.485
to this question, but I
think it is very interesting

00:57:32.485 --> 00:57:37.485
that probably if we had
been able to go back further

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:40.493
in the past here, in the 1800s,

00:57:40.493 --> 00:57:44.900
the U.S. probably had less inequality,

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.420
if you exclude the slave problem,

00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:51.110
which is a very big one, but
if you look only at whites,

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:53.060
probably there was less
inequality in a country

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.510
like the U.S. than in Europe,

00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:58.838
in large part because land
was more equally distributed

00:57:58.838 --> 00:58:01.325
in the U.S. and it was so abundant

00:58:01.325 --> 00:58:06.290
that a lot of people
could get relatively large

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:07.828
shares of land.

00:58:07.828 --> 00:58:08.690
While in a country like France,

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:13.000
and my co-author Thomas
Pikkety has studied the income,

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
or the economic disparity
in a country like France,

00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:20.710
you know, at the eve of
the French Revolution

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:22.410
was just astonishing.

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:25.040
So it just shows you
that with the same method

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.638
you can go back in the
past, using also tax records

00:58:29.638 --> 00:58:34.373
and look at those issues
of land distribution.
