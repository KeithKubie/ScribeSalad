00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:09.709
Meet Dermatophagoides farinae.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:11.542
Crawling around on eight legs,

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:16.933
this creature has no eyes to appreciate 
the kaleidoscope of colors around her.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.891
She relies on her extraordinary 
sense of smell

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:23.942
to lead her to food 
and safe places to lay eggs.

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:27.003
And she’s smaller than a pinhead.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.342
Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite.

00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:32.693
Less than a tenth the size of an ant,

00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:37.634
a dust mite’s whole world is contained 
in the dusty film under a bed

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:39.982
or in a forgotten corner.

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:43.353
This realm is right under our noses,
but from our perspective,

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:49.851
the tiny specks of brilliant color 
blend together into a nondescript grey.

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:53.264
What are these colorful 
microscopic particles?

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:57.542
What distinguishes the dust in your
house from, say, sand on a beach

00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:01.383
is that it is a mixture 
of many different ingredients.

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:03.092
It can contain grains of sand,

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:04.300
dead skin cells,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.092
tiny hairs and threads,

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:07.363
animal dander,

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:08.274
pollen,

00:01:08.274 --> 00:01:09.712
manmade pollutants,

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:11.812
minerals from outer space,

00:01:11.812 --> 00:01:14.713
and, of course, dust mites.

00:01:14.713 --> 00:01:16.463
Dust mites eat animal dander,

00:01:16.463 --> 00:01:17.534
human skin,

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:19.414
and some fungi.

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:21.873
We shed dead skin cells constantly,

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:25.511
and wherever we live, 
they mix into the household dust.

00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:27.271
The same goes for our pets:

00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:30.192
their dander and hairs enter the mix,

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:34.492
as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton
fibers from our clothes.

00:01:34.492 --> 00:01:38.043
These components make 
every household’s dust

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:42.252
a unique blend of bits 
from its particular inhabitants.

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:47.032
Household dust also contains substances 
that blow in from the wider world.

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:49.162
Depending on the local geology,

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:53.101
finely ground quartz, coal, 
or volcanic ash

00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:56.291
might enter the air as atmospheric dust,

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:59.362
along with pollen and fungal spores.

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:03.143
Industrial activities also contribute 
cement powder,

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:04.683
particles from car tires,

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:07.912
and other chemicals to the airborne mix.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:11.778
The combination of these elements 
can be as unique as a fingerprint.

00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:15.613
In Spain, where the land 
is rich in carbonate materials,

00:02:15.613 --> 00:02:20.213
dust contains 20 times as much calcium 
as dust in Nigeria,

00:02:20.213 --> 00:02:22.553
where the geology is quite different.

00:02:22.553 --> 00:02:24.853
After a particularly violent storm,

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:27.971
scientists identified dust from 
the Sahara Desert

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:31.092
thousands of miles away in London,

00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:33.842
based on its specific composition.

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:34.702
In the future,

00:02:34.702 --> 00:02:39.412
we may be able to pinpoint the origins 
of dust samples even more specifically,

00:02:39.412 --> 00:02:43.162
down to a particular neighborhood 
or even house -

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:48.522
something that may be 
of great help for forensic specialists.

00:02:48.522 --> 00:02:52.132
In addition to markers of humans, 
animals, and landscapes,

00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:56.072
dust also contains particles
from further afield.

00:02:56.072 --> 00:02:59.892
When a star explodes in a distant galaxy,

00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:04.852
super hot gases vaporize 
everything nearby.

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:09.662
Then, the dust settles;
minerals condense out of the gas.

00:03:09.662 --> 00:03:12.814
Floating out there between planets 
and galaxies,

00:03:12.814 --> 00:03:18.102
this extraterrestrial dust contains 
tiny pieces of extinguished stars

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:22.584
and the building blocks 
of future celestial bodies.

00:03:22.584 --> 00:03:26.330
Every year, tens of thousands 
of tons of cosmic dust

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.461
lands on Earth and mingles 
with terrestrial minerals.

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.632
This blend of chemicals, minerals, 
and intergalactic particles

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:38.372
settles out of the air onto
surfaces in our homes,

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:41.932
mixing with the detritus 
of each house’s occupants.

00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:43.374
Stars explode,

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:44.783
mountains erode,

00:03:44.783 --> 00:03:46.893
and buildings, plants, and animals

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:52.352
are all slowly but surely 
pulverized into fine grey powder.

00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:54.863
We’re all destined to become dust,

00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:57.913
but it’s also possible 
that we came from it.

00:03:57.913 --> 00:04:03.231
Interstellar dust has been found 
to carry organic compounds through space.

00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:06.101
It’s possible that 
billions of years ago,

00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.433
some of these cosmic particles 
were the seed of life

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:11.372
on our little blue planet.
