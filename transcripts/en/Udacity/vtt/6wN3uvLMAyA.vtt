00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.180
So I'm going to ask you something. Which is if

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.750
we consider again our function print sum, the one

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.760
that takes two integers and prints the sum. How

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.300
long would it take to exhaustively test this function? And

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.950
this is a very simple one. There's just two

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.240
inputs, right? So we can just enumerate them all.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.950
And put them throw them at the computer form,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.440
and wait for the results. How long would that take?
