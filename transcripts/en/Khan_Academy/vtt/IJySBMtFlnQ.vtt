00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:02.931
Voiceover:Say you're out
flying kites with a friend

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:04.073
and right at this moment

00:00:04.073 --> 00:00:06.419
you're 40 meters away from your friend

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.607
and you know that the length of the kite's

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:11.445
string is 30 meters,

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:12.793
and you measure the angle

00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:14.708
between the kite and the ground

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:15.700
where you're standing

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.579
and you see that it's a 40 degree angle.

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.678
What you're curious about is

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:22.802
whether you can use your
powers of trigonometry

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:25.840
to figure out the angle between the string

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.919
and the ground.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.752
I encourage you to pause the video now

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:31.613
and figure out if you can do that

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.495
using just the information that you have.

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:38.206
Whenever I see, I guess,
a non right triangle

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:39.684
where I'm trying to
figure out some lengths

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:41.705
of sides or some lengths of angles,

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:45.025
I immediately think
maybe the Law of Cosine

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.250
might be useful or the Law
of Sines might be useful.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.708
So, let's think about which one

00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:51.361
could be useful in this case.

00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:53.701
Law of Cosines, and I'll
just rewrite them here.

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:55.738
The Law of Cosine is c squared is equal

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:57.650
to a squared plus b squared

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.283
minus 2ab cosine of theta.

00:01:02.283 --> 00:01:04.738
So what it's doing is it's relating

00:01:04.738 --> 00:01:07.107
3 sides of a triangle.

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:11.798
So a, b, c to an angle.

00:01:11.798 --> 00:01:13.749
So, for example, if I do 2 sides

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:15.300
and the angle in between them,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.666
I can figure out the third side.

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.288
Or if I know all 3 sides,

00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:21.266
then I can figure out this angle.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:22.435
But that's not the situation

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:23.281
that we have over here.

00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:27.730
We're trying to figure
out this question mark

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.202
and we don't know 3 of the sides.

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:31.395
We're trying to figure out an angle

00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:32.722
but we don't know 3 of the sides.

00:01:32.722 --> 00:01:34.185
The Law of Cosine just doesn't seem,

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:35.755
at least in an obvious way,

00:01:35.755 --> 00:01:36.795
that it's going to help me.

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.017
I could also try to find this angle.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.024
Once again, we don't know all 3 sides

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:41.897
to be able to solve for the angle.

00:01:41.897 --> 00:01:44.924
So maybe Law of Sines could be useful.

00:01:44.924 --> 00:01:50.340
So the Law of Sines, the Law of Sines.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.546
Let's say that this is,

00:01:52.546 --> 00:01:54.775
the measure of this angle is a,

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:56.440
the measure of this angle is lower case b,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.197
the measure of this angle is lower case c,

00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:00.207
length of this side is capital C,

00:02:00.207 --> 00:02:01.955
length of this side is capital A,

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.283
length of this side is capital B.

00:02:04.283 --> 00:02:05.655
The Law of Sine tells us

00:02:05.655 --> 00:02:09.846
the ratio between the sine
of each of these angles

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:11.940
and the length of the opposite side

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.133
is constant.

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.372
So sine of lower case a over capital A

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:19.910
is the same as lower
case b over capital B,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.760
which is going to be the same as

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.485
lower case c over capital C.

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:27.526
Let's see if we can leverage that somehow

00:02:27.526 --> 00:02:28.892
right over here.

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:33.157
We know this angle and the opposite side

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:35.904
so we can write that ratio.

00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:41.297
Sine of 40 degrees over 30.

00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:43.227
Let's see. Can we say
that that's going to be

00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:45.302
equal to the sine of this angle over that?

00:02:45.302 --> 00:02:47.399
Well it would be, but we
don't know either of these

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.955
so that doesn't seem like
it's going to help us.

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:51.710
But, we do know this side.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.427
Maybe we could use the Law of Cosines

00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:54.661
to figure out this angle,

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:56.319
because if we know 2 angles of a triangle,

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.184
then we can figure out the third angle.

00:02:58.184 --> 00:02:59.659
So let's do that.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.514
Let's say that this angle
right over here is theta.

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:04.820
We know this distance right
over here is 40 meters,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.860
so we can say that the
sine of theta over 40,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.467
this ratio is going to be the same

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.232
as the sine of 40 over 30.

00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:19.141
Now we can just solve for theta.

00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:22.494
Multiplying both sides times 40,

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:26.013
you're going to get, let's see.

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:28.476
40 divided by 30 is 4/3.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:38.173
4/3 sine of 40 degrees is
equal to sine of theta,

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:40.621
is equal to sine of theta.

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:42.279
Now to solve for theta,
we just need to take

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:44.175
the inverse sine of both sides.

00:03:44.175 --> 00:03:54.297
So inverse sine of 4 over
3 sine of 40 degrees.

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:55.537
Put some parentheses here,

00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:57.670
is equal to theta.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.975
That will give us that angle here

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:01.321
and we can use that information
and this information

00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:04.321
to figure out the angle
that we really care about.

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.255
So, let's get a calculator out and see if

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:07.764
we can calculate it.

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:10.193
Let me just verify, I am in degree mode.

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:11.602
Very important.

00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:13.841
All right, now I'm going
to take the inverse

00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:25.562
sine of 4/3 times sine of 40 degrees,

00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:26.797
and that gets me,

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:29.570
and I deserve a little bit of a drum roll,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.524
58, well if we round to the nearest,

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.099
let's just maintain our precision here.

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:40.308
So 58.99 degrees roughly.

00:04:40.308 --> 00:04:47.271
This is approximately
equal to 58.99 degrees.

00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:49.529
So, if that is 58.99 degrees,

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:50.750
what is this one?

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.676
It's going to 180 minus
this angle's measure

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.013
minus that angle's measure.

00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:56.249
Let's calculate that.

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.160
It's going to 180
degrees minus this angle,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.016
so minus 40,

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:03.073
minus the angle that we just figured out.

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:04.676
Actually I can get all of our precision

00:05:04.676 --> 00:05:07.383
by just typing in second answer.

00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:09.075
So that just says our previous answer

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:10.899
so I get all that precision there

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:15.008
and so I get 81.01 degrees.

00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:16.525
So, if I want to round to the nearest,

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:18.333
let's say I want to round
to nearest hundredth

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:21.685
of a degree, then I'd say 81.01 degrees.

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:24.602
So this, this right over here,

00:05:24.602 --> 00:05:28.602
is approximately 81.01
degrees and we're done.
