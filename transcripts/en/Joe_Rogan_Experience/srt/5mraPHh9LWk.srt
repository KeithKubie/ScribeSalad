1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,040
One, two, three.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,580
[inaudible].

3
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,200
So

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,380
the demand, Leonard Skinner, the actual
man landscape died. Is that what happened?

5
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,330
Yeah, I guess he was like a
gym coach. Hang on, let me
eat this Mike Condoms. Yeah,

6
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,300
he was at on them free day. He was, yeah.

7
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,560
Evidently the gym teacher that they
named their band after. Really? Yeah.

8
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,720
So He's dead. That's it. That's a
wrap. We all go folks, uh, this,

9
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,920
this show as all are sponsored by the
fleshlight. Uh, if you have not tried one,

10
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:02,470
Doug Stanhope, and I know we were
discussing this before the break,

11
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:05,500
but we decided to save it. You have
not, I have not fucked a fleshlight. Oh,

12
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:07,450
you're still a fan of masturbation.
Everything.

13
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,690
Only in the most clinical medicinal,

14
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,920
like quickly get this out of me way.
You don't spend any time like lusting,

15
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,460
no lust, no. None whatsoever.
When did that stop happening?

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,020
I gradually over years, I mean,
I remember even at the man show,

17
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,070
I'd fucking no interest in the jug ease,

18
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,360
just so dull. At a certain point in
time in your life, you're forcing it.

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,980
If you're still chasing it, you're forcing
it. It's like, what are you doing? Yeah.

20
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,420
Well,
I remember if you had told me a 20 are,

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,740
you'll lose your sex drive it like what
would you do if you weren't trying to

22
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:42,880
fuck people like,

23
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,180
and then you'd think at 43 what could I
have done with my life if I wasn't just

24
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,570
trying to fucking blow
loads and chicks? Well, I,

25
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,780
I definitely haven't stopped beating off,
but I see where it's ridiculous.

26
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,950
I just want to to cam ones by the way.
Huh? I just fucked one of the canned ones.

27
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,330
Totally different than the other one
was like a drunk, sloppy chick. Oh,

28
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:08,830
it's really sloppy and loose in our
own flashlight. Get on that shit. Oh,

29
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,040
it was good. It was a manufacturing
issue. It's mixing up your bitches.

30
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:15,660
It was good. It was meant for a
different kinds of Brian. It's,

31
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:20,130
this is what it's meant for a girth
here. See, it looks like a beer and a,

32
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,730
you opened up top and it's a fake
vagina. That's the idea behind. Good.

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,830
I'm Brian is not a fan of this one.
I fucked up.

34
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,860
I fucked a rubber vagina once and blew
a load in it and then fucking just put

35
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:33,130
it,

36
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,130
put it away and then a couple days
later I grabbed it and it fucking stunk.

37
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,070
Like all get out to look at this one.
It's a, it's a fake vampire. Yeah,

38
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,580
that's the, it's a vampire mouth.
The twilight series. All right.

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,820
What is wrong with people?

40
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,680
If the aliens didn't need more evidence
that were retarded and it's time to land,

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,750
look at this fucking thing. Look at this
thing. Can they see it? Yeah. Come on man.

42
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,584
Really

43
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,700
wake me up by your mouth that you
fuck what? Yeah, they're good though.

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,990
They're great. Very good.
As far as masturbation since
or anything, I'll try one.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,040
And if you think about it in terms of
just being pragmatic and doing body

46
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,600
maintenance,
when you shoot a load with this,

47
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,110
you're going to shoot a bigger load and
it's going to take a couple more days

48
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:22,720
for you to build up.
No one could call you a sellout for this.

49
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,760
Like I asked all traps blue ribbon sponsor
a tour and I like switch beer and for

50
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:34,570
a minute like I've got, oh,
it's, I'm going to get drunk
anyway. Who gives a shit?

51
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,060
What kind of beer? I'm
drinking, not selling out.

52
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,150
There's something about Pabst blue
ribbon that's become cool again.

53
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,230
Like the fact that it sucks.
It's, yeah, it's, it's, it's
been that way for a while.

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,360
Yeah. Yeah. The fact that it
blows is the selling point. Yeah.

55
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,820
It didn't used to be right. [inaudible]
hipsters to the poor thing. $3 PBR.

56
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,970
I just don't like drinking out of
cans on stage. That was my big beef.

57
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:55,900
Get a fucking bottle.

58
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,070
There's a dude as a comic in New York
named Jon Tobin and um, when we were, uh,

59
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,600
I was living, I know that name. He's does
a radio show and a, I think in Buffalo,

60
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,390
someone upstate New York.
Anyway, yeah. When we were, uh,

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,720
I was in my early twenties, we
got fucking wicked drunk on, um,

62
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,480
on 40 ounces, like black beer, you know,

63
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:20,440
like old English and track
man cobras one size 18.

64
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,950
And I had just moved to La and
we drank that, I don't know,

65
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,420
maybe three of them and I was
passed out on a sidewalk. Yeah,

66
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,440
we had these and we watched a show a of
the movie superfly and did commentary on

67
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:32,794
supply.

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Just two white guys talking like black
guys drunk out of their fucking mind of

69
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,440
forties on forties it's a
different kind of drunk.

70
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:44,860
It's a reckless trunk engineered by the
government. It's pretty, pretty clear.

71
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,440
Alex Jones was saying that
something is given men estrogen,

72
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:53,140
which is causing men to be gay
was like toothpaste or some shit.

73
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,200
It was one of my favorite ones.
He's ever die manager.

74
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,350
Said he saw you on an Alex Jones.
I haven't seen it yet,

75
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:03,250
but he said it was hilarious how you'd
bug to the camera when he was going

76
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,680
fucking crazy.
You just look at the camera and go.

77
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,730
Well it was a double whammy of crazy
cause I was on with Eddie Bravo and he

78
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,220
probably wants to talk about
chem trails because Eddie Bravo,

79
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,270
I love him to death,

80
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,030
but any problems convinced that the
government's spray and shit on us.

81
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,440
It's a fucking crazy story and I even
tried to come to Eddie Bravo with some

82
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,220
science.
I said,

83
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,480
well I know this dude who's a pilot and
he explained to me that those clouds are

84
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:29,050
created by a certain amount of moisture
in the atmosphere combined with the

85
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,990
turbines at the jet engine and it creates
these clouds. That's what happens.

86
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,710
But this video's on youtube,
man, his videos and he just
won't buy it, man. He just,

87
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,950
he's convinced. So here we are.
I'm trapped. And Alex Jones,

88
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,760
well I'm doing a documentary
on that right now.

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,000
The government is definitely spraying us.
It's a hell of an Alex.

90
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,080
And then Eddie Bravo is going jam once
this documentary coming out and I'm going

91
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:50,914
fuck

92
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,560
spraying the population like they have
that day. When did he do it at night?

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,950
There'll be a lot of people. The
airmen. Yeah. This is a giant.

94
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,670
He's this cut to syphilis.
Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is.

95
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:06,860
A giant one for the whole population.
It's not really working.

96
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:11,650
It's kind of a real slow process but
there can to keep the spray gun trance.

97
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,910
Have you ever seen those up?

98
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,980
Like trucks are good on your street and
spray for bugs and like in the middle of

99
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,250
the night like that more
scary cause that's really,

100
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,590
the government definitely has worked on
some weather. And don't get me wrong,

101
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,950
I mean I think for sure they have
sprayed people at certain point in time,

102
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,210
you know there's video
when people can say,

103
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,210
oh there was some shit and I'm sure
they probably tried it. I mean,

104
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,830
but it's probably very specific areas
and the V for a very specific reason and

105
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,350
some fucked up experiment that didn't
let the people know they were in on.

106
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:40,910
But I'm sure they did it or not doing
it every day here too, aren't they here?

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,010
They're getting sprayed onto, yeah. Yeah
man. But I'm immune to that shit. Yeah.

108
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,170
He posted this one photo that was really
crazy. And then I went and I was like,

109
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:52,700
wait, where was this photo taken? Airport?
No, no, no. It was right next to lax.

110
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,360
And I'm like,

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
cause I found a store behind him was like
the stores that I googled the name of

112
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:56,841
that store.

113
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,630
And I found out that he was right next
to lax when he took that photo and on he

114
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:00,464
believes in it.
Man,

115
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,480
he believes that they're a man who
knows really bad on his show because I

116
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:08,600
couldn't really like, you know,
bust on him cause I know him.

117
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:10,470
We've known him for years. Jones. Yeah.

118
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,770
But I couldn't take them
seriously and I couldn't,

119
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,160
he was evidently thought I was coming
in as more of a on his side guy.

120
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,840
Yeah. Cause he hasn't seen me
since we did that Kevin Booth DVD.

121
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,980
I always try to find
things that I do believe.

122
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,470
I try to be as friendly as possible with
them. I really like Alex as a person.

123
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,230
He's a fun guy. I enjoy going to
the, we went to the fights with them,

124
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,290
we ate with them, we hung out with
him. He's a good guy. He's just,

125
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,690
he's just crazy and all
wound up and everything.

126
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,420
So I was trying to find some common
ground where I actually agree on them.

127
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,740
Like I always bring up some stuff like
you know like a operation Northwoods.

128
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:48,500
Yeah. That's the one. That's
the good one. And you know,

129
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,420
of course you can get into
the Kennedy assassination,

130
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,090
but that gets a little gray.
It's like, who knows what
really happened there. Yeah.

131
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:55,280
I can't put together last year very well.

132
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,910
So fucking the further back in history,

133
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,510
the more open to interpretation.
There's some shit though.

134
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:07,170
That's really interesting that, uh, that
he turned me onto. One of them was, uh,

135
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,760
uh,

136
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,760
one called operation midnight climax
where the government ran brothels in New

137
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,350
York and in San Francisco and where
they did LSD, LSD. Yeah. That's John's.

138
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,020
That's true. Yeah. And he turned me on
to that and I was like, wow. And again,

139
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,730
once you see that those things are real,
Northwoods and mk ultra,

140
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,500
all that, yeah. Then you go, well,

141
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,830
they could be doing anything and then
you realize, I don't give a fuck. Yeah,

142
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,110
I agree.
It doesn't affect my day.

143
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,560
I've been coming to that exact same
conclusion that there's certain things in

144
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:39,500
life that you're putting all your energy
towards and they're not helping you at

145
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:43,790
all. Right. You know, nor
are they stopping anything.
You're not helping the cause,

146
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,060
you know you're not out there,
but you know,

147
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:51,170
but it is worth I guess pointing out so
that maybe someone somewhere along the

148
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:55,200
line here are some of the shit you say
and laughs at it and thinks maybe know.

149
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,040
It's almost even

150
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,060
one direction or another.

151
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,730
It's almost like being at a
magic show and being able to go,

152
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,660
I know how you did that. Yes. All right.
You're still going to have a show.

153
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,990
I'm not going to fuck up your whole Vegas
experience, but I know how you did it.

154
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,690
So chicken based on some
comics yelling that out.

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,000
Maybe it just makes them up their game.
Maybe that's all.

156
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,960
It's something that stuff I'm interested
in, but I had to stop with that.

157
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:20,550
Making yourself so Alex Jones, like
where you just get crazy. Yeah,

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,470
I'll be at three o'clock in the morning.

159
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:26,610
I'll be fucking clicking on some link
about some new loophole that Goldman Sachs

160
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:31,020
use and some fucking Matt Taibbi article
and I'm just going fuck me to stop your

161
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:35,140
business knowing not only that, I
don't, what the fuck am I going to do?

162
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,640
What am I gonna do? Am I going to devote
my whole life to this? You know, I could,

163
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,990
shit I like to do.
Yeah.

164
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:43,560
I want to know how many times Alex
Jones shows up at a city council meeting

165
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,880
about fucking streets sweeping laws.
There's some not something he can affect.

166
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,190
Yeah, that's interesting. You
probably doesn't ever do that. Yeah.

167
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,080
What about do that Doug?
Stan hope.

168
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,310
But right now demons are
ascending upon our government.

169
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:00,870
They are deep embedded in our
political system. Doug Stanhope,

170
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,000
you go on the road,
you'd tell your jokes,

171
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:08,001
you think all swell and good
because are you dying FEMA camps?

172
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,040
So don't worry about the volume mean
birds. I was trying to do my, uh, my,

173
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:18,720
uh, I can't do it. Well, what's his
name? Fucking conspiracy theory. Oh,

174
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,770
just Jesse Ventura that show they
conspiracy theories look so bad.

175
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,370
Like we don't realize there's Rumsfeld,

176
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,800
he's trying to tell me that the
Kennedy assassination might have been,

177
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,360
yeah, one low. Not Real.
Well, no, they overproduce it.

178
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:42,990
So he sits down with his
writers like and they,

179
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,950
they hit them to some conspiracy
that he's not aware of,

180
00:10:46,951 --> 00:10:48,090
but I'm going to go right up.

181
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,070
And then he's surprised that a former
governor just can't walk into the CIA and

182
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:57,210
look at fine whenever he wants.
The former pro dumb founded,

183
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,820
this was reduction of here's
where your rights are going.

184
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,080
[inaudible] gentleman who talks like this,

185
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,230
this is how we're a little bit of a
load in his mouth just to, just to,

186
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,680
just like he looked at Tim,

187
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,740
let's just floating around with her for
middle shoulder governor from Torah.

188
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,660
Did you see him on the opiate Anthony
when Jim Norton tore him apart? No,

189
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,150
no I didn't. Fucking beautiful.
He got douchey with Darren.

190
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:24,030
He got bullied with Norton and the last
thing you should do is get bullied with

191
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,190
Norton. Cause that's what people have
done to him his whole life. And he's like,

192
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:28,460
fuck you. He was like physically
intimidating. And when,

193
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,040
when he's talking about like a legitimate
question about nine 11 or whatever it

194
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,700
is, conspiracy theories, and
he's legitimately questioned
him, you know, in a, in a,

195
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:40,350
in a, in a a really not a condescending
way at all. And Torah gets fucking crazy.

196
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,890
And then Norton gets crazy
back and Ventura winds up
leaving and walking off the

197
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:46,920
shot. What do you want to hear it? Do you
want to hear it? Yeah, here we go. Yeah,

198
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,640
let's put it,

199
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,470
it's great because it's like
the most comics were picked on.

200
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,030
Most comics were,
would do shit

201
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,760
around when we were younger. Yeah. And
the last thing comics like is a bully,

202
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,940
right? You know, if someone like this, so
this was like, when I, when I heard it,

203
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:06,941
I immediately texted him and called him
up and when I saw him I said it was the

204
00:12:07,001 --> 00:12:08,260
most awesome thing I've ever seen.

205
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,620
It was beautiful because Jim Norton is
a fleshy ball of 150 pounds and Jesse

206
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,290
Ventura is a fucking former navy
seal, his big giant head. And he's,

207
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:20,770
what was he getting in his face? He
just got stupid with them. You know,

208
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,940
it's like the way he describes things.
If I take this out of the stand, well no,

209
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:29,770
he's not the God damn comic. Good. Can
I keep trying to lean into it? Uh, yeah.

210
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,580
Yeah. The stand is an awkward situation.
This whole couch was a terrible idea.

211
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,980
I mean,
I need something.

212
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,430
I can't look over there because not
only do I not like to see myself,

213
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,970
but it's a delay. So I'm seeing myself
minutes ago. I'll have to look at it.

214
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,410
I'll show. All right. Yeah. I
don't like looking at fucking,

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,630
we used to have a chat in the chat.
The problem with the shadows,

216
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:52,000
who would be like, fuck good.
shop.call. Calm, calm, calm.

217
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:55,060
Like the chat would be flooded,
bigger tech.

218
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:58,710
Suck my dick or tick like a hundred times
in a row. And you'd be like, Oh God,

219
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,050
it's such a fucking outlet of hate.
The whole Internet.

220
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,290
I never like Google search my
name or anything like that.

221
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,890
Oh, that was awesome.
That was Google saying

222
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:16,420
cos he smirked. Be smirk. He's Marcus.

223
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,670
Every fucking show I do.

224
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,340
People will yell out to every show,
every show,

225
00:13:24,341 --> 00:13:29,000
but fuck it if people are yelling
shit out. That's of, and that was,

226
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:33,430
I never even really did. I talked about
it on stage a few times, but yeah,

227
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,360
I heard the,
the audio,

228
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:37,080
you talked about the time that you and
I did it where I thought you were going

229
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:41,860
to die, but every fucking show, like
it was like my closing bit for here.

230
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,450
It was a,

231
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,640
there was one of the weirdest psychedelics
situations for the folks at home. Uh,

232
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,730
Doug and I were doing the man show and
it was like in the death throes, right?

233
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:55,300
It wasn't right. Yeah. Here we
had to spend all night writing,

234
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,750
trying to save the fucking thing. We knew
it was a disaster. We got fucked. I mean,

235
00:13:58,751 --> 00:13:59,270
look,
we,

236
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,740
we both appreciate the fact that everybody
was disappointed by how that show

237
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,810
came out, but no one was more
disappointed. And we were,

238
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,440
the whole thing was a mess. And look, we
don't need to get into details, but uh,

239
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,800
if you, unless you want to, no, no, no.
It's, yeah, it's over. Was terrible show.

240
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,720
But there was some great shit in it.
I defy anybody to watch the uh,

241
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,090
my midget sketch. You what is it?
Another man's midget cause your,

242
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,250
your sketch a defy anybody to watch
that and tell me that's not hilarious.

243
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:26,530
Where are you trying to steal the
old mentioned from the man show.

244
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,860
Bring them over to the middle. Knew we
had shared with us, I mean it was a,

245
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:33,020
it was the wrong thing at the
time because our show is not a,

246
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,040
the learning experience was priceless
cause that was my first real television

247
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,800
and just knowing how they fuck it up.
We could have,

248
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,560
we could have done
something on the Internet,

249
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,920
we've could have done something like
Internet style where there was no input

250
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,560
whatsoever and we could have had a
great fucking time. Right. And when,

251
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,680
when they came to me with the idea,
the idea was we're going to have nudity,

252
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,970
we'll blur it out immediately.

253
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:59,600
I'm thinking Joey d is going to be naked
at the beginning of every show is just

254
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:04,250
telling someone about that. And then the,
and then I said on what? About squares?

255
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,800
And they said he could bleep it out,
bleep out, talk about whatever you want.

256
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,960
They go,
it's a good thing if we get sued,

257
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,590
this is what stone Stanley guys tell me.
If we get sued, it's a good thing. Yeah.

258
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm like, we are gonna
fuck shit up. I'm like,

259
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,380
I'm just can't wait for
abortion monologues in chaos.

260
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:21,080
And when we got in there,
it was totally different story.

261
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,290
As soon as we got in and the audience
wouldn't have liked it any better. No,

262
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,960
they would've still hated it,
but we wouldn't have had the fuck.

263
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,580
We would've had the bags on our heads.

264
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,010
We would've had to rebuild and
make a new audience. You know,

265
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:33,650
there was one point in time with John
Stewart didn't use to host the daily show.

266
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,230
Right. You know, people forgot there
was that other guy and it really,

267
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,540
we shouldn't have called the dementia.
We should've said,

268
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,670
we are really into the idea of taking
over that time slot or that idea that

269
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:47,450
doing this new show. What? It told us to
pound sand probably go fuck ourselves.

270
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,800
Yeah. Yeah, they were,

271
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:51,650
they were convinced that that name was
going to sell everything and that was

272
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,140
going to be the big push and there's
name brand. I'm like, it's it,

273
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:56,780
but it's not the same. Sheldon at the
same guys, they're not here anymore.

274
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:59,690
None of the writers are here.
What the fuck you talking
about? Can you do it? Fear,

275
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,740
fear factor, 14 hours a day. That
was, I got so greedy. I was like,

276
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,770
I am going to have two shows at the same
time and I was just thinking this stuff

277
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,710
up, that money I could never
work again. Never work in again.

278
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,890
I'm never working again, but that
was a dumb I down. Terrible idea.

279
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:14,390
You should never do more
than one television.

280
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,910
If you didn't have to work would
you stop? No, not stop doing.

281
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:23,840
Stand up and maybe, yeah. I
like doing the UFC too, man.

282
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,290
It's nothing I do right now is really
work. You know, between Standup, I mean,

283
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,910
I can or I can regulate how many times
a year I'd go out and the UFC. I,

284
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,580
I look forward to it. It's fun. It's like,
yeah, what am I going to do this weekend?

285
00:16:34,581 --> 00:16:37,690
I could stay at home and I can go to
the movies or I find it Indianapolis.

286
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,210
I want some dudes beat the fuck out of
each other from five feet away and I get

287
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,790
paid for it. I get to call. It
does, it never feels like work,

288
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,490
but if it was like a sitcom
or something like that, yeah.

289
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:50,290
Do you got to shut it off for a, did you
get, did you guys want to hear that? Uh,

290
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,230
yes. Yes. Yeah. And then what's, let's
reintroduce this. Okay. I, this is,

291
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,360
so this is Jesse Ventura
and opion Anthony,

292
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,670
Jim Norton and him get into an argument.
Right?

293
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,720
Okay. I'll talk to y'all. [inaudible]
can you hear that? Yes. Okay.

294
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,740
Cheryl, that yes, bodies identified.

295
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:17,540
Ah, well we'll just fly
with that. What the hell?

296
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:20,990
My government told me that. So you
know why I don't believe my governor.

297
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,840
You believe Saudi Arabia's go go
over there flying planes around.

298
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,040
But here's why I don't
believe my government,

299
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,250
my government is lying to me so many
times they lied to me about the Gulf of

300
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,520
Tonkin incident. Isn't that
pretty important? Be like,
I want to go back that far.

301
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:39,100
You want to go back to far
with the Kennedy? We can't
go back to avoid via dog.

302
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,410
You said to me, we were with those,
got all the shopping in 2004 pounds.

303
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,820
So we're not going back that far.

304
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,500
We said we send our guys off
to war without giving a shit.

305
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,050
And I'll tell her that's not true. I
agree with you. When did you go to war?

306
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,300
I've never been in the door and that door.
So you don't know.

307
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,600
But I say pull them out of everything.

308
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:59,130
So because I've never been in the
military when we are attacked by I feel a

309
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:03,030
nation, we should not, it should be
proven first. I feel we proved that.

310
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:03,870
You feel we didn't.

311
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:07,440
Do you also feel that fucking Bush was
behind nine 11 so we're always going to

312
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:10,260
disagree.
Go put fucking words in my mouth.

313
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:14,330
You feel that the u s government
was behind it and I didn't say that.

314
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,360
Josh. I met covering it out where
you have not been told the truth.

315
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,940
So you feel like, well, okay,
wait a minute. All right.

316
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,440
If you'll call them down in a moment,
you're yelling. You said the ads, right?

317
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,860
When you're the governor,
they slot

318
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,530
bring you up to yours. You know, wish I

319
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,460
saw that you said about,
you know you're not going to let me talk.

320
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm out the door and talking.

321
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,060
The whole time while you're doing is
yelling for people and you don't want to

322
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:47,140
address point by point. You Act like
we say, send our boys to our fucking,

323
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,220
we've never said that I agree with you,
but I want to pull them out of Jeremy.

324
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,900
I want to pull them everywhere.

325
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,420
The U s military should never
be dying for other countries.

326
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't care for Roya
happened. Scan them. Outcome.

327
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,180
I don't care if Kim Jong Il bikes itself.
That's not my business.

328
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,980
I just think that if we were attacked,

329
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,020
we have the right to
honor military to respond.

330
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,380
So that's not something warmonger
saying fuck the voice. Send them over.

331
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,130
That's what I want to
see.

332
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,230
It just sits and looks at Jimmy.
Why Awkward?

333
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,750
That was a fair point I just made
you were wrong when you said that.

334
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,680
I don't know.
I didn't listen.

335
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,740
I talked over you. Yes. Nutritional
yelling at me cause I'm not talking.

336
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm not yelling at you. I'm just telling
you about your point. You would shoot.

337
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:41,080
It does. It's something. So let's say that
you guys are just full of Shit. You're,

338
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,430
you're warmongers. You know, it's
like that's not the truth. Yeah. Yes,

339
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,500
I stand corrected. Thank you.
You're a great American web.

340
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,620
How much have a great American,
but I'm not a warm in their country calls.

341
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:56,160
You're there. Hey, I've never been in the
military. So you're brave. I'm a coward.

342
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:56,994
I have no right week.

343
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,220
Let me stop there for a second.
Stop there for a second. You know,

344
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,940
if you ever listened to something and it
was a long time ago and you have it in

345
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:07,941
your head as being one thing and
then watch it again and you go,

346
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,820
wait a minute.

347
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,560
Well I remember when they had the loose
change guy on there and they fucking

348
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:17,220
decimated them. But he's not
a, he was not a performer.

349
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:21,270
He's not integrative physician
to those guys. The fucking,

350
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:24,990
there's so many New York guys and
I think Jimmy Norton is funny.

351
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:28,530
He's a great guy. Off the cuff,
probably the funniest comic.

352
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,430
What I saw when I saw the video was I
originally, I must've not seen it all.

353
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,250
I must've saw just Jimmy shouting him
down and he walked out of the room.

354
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,430
I must not have seen the debate that
went on to discussion that went on before

355
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:41,740
it. I must not have,
cause I remember that.

356
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,180
I think I just remember him standing
up the point we're about to get to.

357
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:47,980
I don't remember that part at
all. If you watch, I just watched

358
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,690
the most dangerous man in America. The
Daniel Ellsberg story. What does that,

359
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,390
it's a,
he released the Pentagon papers.

360
00:20:55,391 --> 00:21:00,220
He was a top advisor to the Pentagon
during Vietnam and knew that it was all

361
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:02,050
bullshit from the Gulf of Tonkin.

362
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,130
All this secret shit that we were doing
and release the papers to the New York

363
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:11,080
Times, uh, is, uh, Nixon called him
the most dangerous man in America.

364
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:11,620
It's,

365
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,620
and it was like 20,000 pages of all
the fucking lies that were told about

366
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:20,350
Vietnam.
And you watch that fucking movie,

367
00:21:20,351 --> 00:21:25,351
Jim Norton and tell me that they don't
send people into fucking to die for no

368
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,850
reason other than political.

369
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,550
Jim Norton is a good guy,
but he's a Republican.

370
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,660
He's got like this right wing lean
to him. It's a lean, you know,

371
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:37,660
he goes conservative and I think he does
it because he gets support from them.

372
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:40,870
And I think he likes it. And I liked the
idea of it. And, and, and he's correct.

373
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:41,261
Absolutely.

374
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,890
Though a lot of people who are liberals
who call themselves liberals are whiny

375
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:49,510
constantly to shut the fuck up. Oh yeah.
No, I think liberals fuck up more stuff.

376
00:21:49,511 --> 00:21:54,160
Way More in my day, in my, my,
my own personal life. Yeah.

377
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,780
You can't smoke in bars.
That's not Republican. Yeah.

378
00:21:58,781 --> 00:22:00,430
You should be able to smoke
wherever the fuck you want.

379
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:02,380
If a bar decides they're
going to stop smoking,

380
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,480
and I understand it for the
patrons that worked there,

381
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,570
but you can find plenty of
patrons at smoke and if they want,

382
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,050
they want to quit while you know what?
They should quit the job and quit smoking.

383
00:22:11,051 --> 00:22:14,110
Okay. You can't be around smoke.
Right. I totally understand your point,

384
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,450
that it's bad for your health,
but there's people that do smoke.

385
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:17,860
It'd be more than willing
to take those jobs.

386
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,840
At the old days when I was playing pool,

387
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,560
we all pool halls were smoking
and I didn't mind. I liked it.

388
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:26,230
There's something about
it, man, and I'm just,

389
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:30,130
I'm using that as a frivolous example,
but it was the first one that came to my,

390
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,040
but the, as far as the nanny
state itself is concerned,

391
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,600
that's mostly liberal policies. Yeah. He,

392
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,260
so it's Norton's anti
liberal and he's right.

393
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,560
There's a lot of Cottey fucking throwing
their cigarettes out of their Prius.

394
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,140
How many fucking times have you seen
that? I've seen that seven times. Yeah,

395
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,140
it's cause it's so ironic.
I always go a number five.

396
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,830
The fucking guy throws a cigarette out
of his Prius the other day with a meat is

397
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:52,000
murder bumper sticker.

398
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,470
I want to just fucking grab
him and pull his head off.

399
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,240
Just just rip it right off his fucking
week spine to shut the fuck up.

400
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,750
So I understand where Norton is
coming from. I understand this,

401
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:07,390
this rebellion against, but it's, there's,

402
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,570
there's absolute proof that the
government has put people in harm's way.

403
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,600
Absent proof.
They're profiting off of relentless proof.

404
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:18,630
Not just a few aberrations but relentless
over a course of time repeatedly.

405
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,070
And No, you don't know about it until
long after the fact years. So yes.

406
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,890
The fact that I, I would,
if I had to bet money,

407
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:31,891
I would say on some level nine 11
was an inside job on some level.

408
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,030
But what they do is they take every
possibility and combine them though as

409
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:40,600
though they're all actual fact.
They were not really planes.

410
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:43,720
What we're seeing our drones, ladies and
gentlemen, if you look at the bottom,

411
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,040
you can see the box very clearly.
I'm

412
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,910
looking at two pixels. One
Gray, one's white. I don't
know what the fuck it is at.

413
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:53,330
All. I fear is like there's no parts of
the plane that went into the Pentagon,

414
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,120
but yet you look at a picture and be like,
there's this big parts and say, well,

415
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,390
you know, yeah, there's
fucking broken wheels and shit.

416
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:02,690
With that plane hit the Pentagon for sure.
There's a video of it.

417
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,070
He was living and people
who like to do video,

418
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,280
it was only like a play and I'm like,
fuck, do you know it's one frame,

419
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:10,880
things going 500 miles an hour and it
slams into a building and explodes.

420
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:12,020
And why do you think it's a missile?

421
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,420
It can be anything I'd be at somebody's
throwing a football, you know,

422
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,254
it doesn't matter.

423
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,060
Like there's little things like the fact
that they show a lady hanging out the

424
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:24,980
whole of the World Trade Center where
the plane made a whole waving for help,

425
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,280
but you're, and you're
thinking just logically, okay,

426
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,380
if it's hot enough to melt steel,

427
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,740
how is that woman sitting there
and address waving out the window?

428
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,580
How is she not on fire? So stuff
like that. Yeah, that, yeah.

429
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:42,170
Maybe there is a scientific
explanation for that.

430
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,450
Well that is disinformation
is all about right.

431
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:47,240
You say some absolutely ridiculous
things like what people don't know,

432
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:51,380
ladies and gentlemen,
there were Ufo is stationed in New Jersey.

433
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:53,510
They needed a distraction
to get out of the state.

434
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,470
They'll add shit like that to shit.
That's real.

435
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,970
And then will that get all up?

436
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,470
That's what Jesse Ventura's show did
for everything it was talking about by

437
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:07,680
being overproduced and
acting like he never right.

438
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,430
Are you telling me that problem?

439
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,580
Are we better get out? Go file.
Wait, this is your TV show.

440
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:20,390
You just walked in and you didn't know
what it was going to be about. Well,

441
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:21,590
you know,
once you're on the set,

442
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:24,370
what are you going to do if you're
Anthony Bordain, you gotta eat the snails.

443
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,280
Hey you are you on for another nine 11
thing was the the amount of people on

444
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:31,100
those planes cause you and I,
we fucking fly for a living.

445
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,640
And why you go there at like 30% capacity?

446
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,840
Like how often do you get on a fucking
plane where there's only a third full?

447
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,870
Yeah, very rarely but all
of her essay. So again,

448
00:25:44,871 --> 00:25:48,520
there's things that made me, you know,
brought up buildings, seven questions,

449
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,050
building seven's the big one tonight.

450
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,260
Building seven's the one and I don't
claim any knowledge. Okay. This is,

451
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,020
people get all frantic when you start,

452
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,880
you're questioning the
fucking official story.

453
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,780
So what are you a truther you wouldn't
have fucking known living truther like

454
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,860
you cannot be interesting to me. I don't
give a fuck. I didn't, I don't know.

455
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,210
I don't like New York.

456
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,150
I was in Irvine last night,
fucking horrible spectrum center,

457
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:18,740
this adult destination mall
and I said around, as I said,

458
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:23,570
a fucking nine 11 happened here. I don't
think it would make national news. Maybe,

459
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,900
maybe one local guy would write a letter
to the editor complaining about how it

460
00:26:28,941 --> 00:26:33,110
ruined his reservations at pf Chang's.
That's pretty funny.

461
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,180
But yeah, I'm interested, but I don't, I
don't care. It doesn't affect my day. Um,

462
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,110
well I, I, I'm fascinated
and I'm interested in, and
I do care. I know, you know,

463
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,980
all jokes aside,
a lot of people died there and

464
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,980
people knew people who died there and
you will die everywhere all the time.

465
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,050
And it's crazy that you wear,

466
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,330
we don't such an influx of knowledge
right now that you can go online and find

467
00:26:54,331 --> 00:26:59,120
some shit that you should care about.
And I had to fucking cut. Um, I,

468
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,270
my list is full.

469
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,540
You have to care about enough already the
connections that were supposed to have

470
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:07,500
the people that we don't know because
they were born in Connecticut as opposed

471
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:11,240
to people that we don't know that were
born in Iran and not buying that. That's,

472
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,600
that's where it gets ridiculous.

473
00:27:12,601 --> 00:27:15,990
It's like with the connection
of information that we
have with the Internet,

474
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,070
at a certain point in time,

475
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:20,820
they're not gonna be able to keep selling
the whole idea of, of a, a planet or,

476
00:27:20,821 --> 00:27:23,790
or have a, an individual
country or an individual state.

477
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,300
They're going to have to eventually just,
we're, we're going to have to go to one,

478
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:29,520
one CR, one world government.
Yeah. I'd have to, you know,

479
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,870
pro new world order in that sense.
Yeah. We have to be the same thing.

480
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,780
We can't be fighting over
each other because you know,

481
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,380
this guys are like a million people
die in Iraq and ember goes, hey,

482
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:42,050
as long as it doesn't happen over here,
but it is that is over here,

483
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,100
this over here, over
there. It's the same thing.

484
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:47,040
It's the people you don't know there
were born somewhere else who fucking got

485
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,430
jacked like yeah.
And if we tore down borders,

486
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:53,420
I could stop caring about
people closer to me. Yeah.

487
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:57,570
It's like you get trapped in that whole
idea of, you know, this is my team,

488
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,260
these are my people and you know, someone
fucking plays a country music song.

489
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,290
And throws up a flag and I'm
man, fuck it. It feels good.

490
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,680
It feels good to be in
right. All right. Feels good.

491
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,250
God bless America feels good singing
around with a bunch of other people and

492
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,590
you're all drinking.
Where are resilient people?

493
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,410
How has that fucking baddest
mother fuckers on the plant?

494
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:20,320
Wu on July 4th I didn't blink
after [inaudible] and you're drunk.

495
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,520
And that's how people get recruited.
That's how, that's what happens. You know,

496
00:28:23,521 --> 00:28:27,030
you shouldn't be great if,
if generations didn't overlap,

497
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,000
what do you mean to carry on the nonsense?
That way if there was a great ever,

498
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,170
if people like we just showed
up now with all the, you know,

499
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,520
the basic skills, motor
skills, you know, instincts,

500
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,240
but we still had the innocence
and ignorance of a baby.

501
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,320
Like one generation dies and then the
next day the next generation starts.

502
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,800
So they can't pass down
ridiculous notions like nations.

503
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,210
And you ever stop and think when you
see all this crazy shit and this is what

504
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:58,200
I'm on lately.

505
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:01,770
They ever stop and think about all this
nonsense that keeps carrying on despite

506
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,980
the access to information that we have.
And you ever look at it and go,

507
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:07,800
maybe this is like a natural pattern.
You know,

508
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:09,490
I've got this thing I've
been tripping out on about,

509
00:29:09,491 --> 00:29:11,730
and like animals and natural instincts.
I'm like,

510
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,160
we look at like wolves and we see
the Alpha, the Beta out of the pack.

511
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,320
We know he'll likely die on his own.
And we go, hey, you know, that's just,

512
00:29:19,321 --> 00:29:22,680
that's it. It's hard as fuck to be a
wolf, you know? And they have to do that.

513
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:26,040
That's natural. And we look at bees
making beehives, that's all natural.

514
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,520
But we never look at ourselves as the
direction we're moving in his natural

515
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:33,330
juice. Maybe possibly super
fucking incredibly complex,

516
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,350
but ultimately natural.
And this idea of, you know,

517
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:40,680
that we have so much control and
so much power over our future.

518
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,500
Maybe that's a crock of Shit May,

519
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,180
may be the reason why all this nonsense
is in place is because that's like a

520
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:46,291
little,

521
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:50,200
almost a universal order to keep this
process moving in the direction it's

522
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:54,460
supposed to be moving in as what? I
probably didn't get the word in edge wise,

523
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:59,160
but with Alex Jones, he would say he was
trying to make the point because I am a,

524
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,550
you know, hugely against
procreation and uh, he was a, well,

525
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,990
you know how the fucking,

526
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,500
if we don't keep making smart
people than fucking dumb people,

527
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:10,480
if you're going to have a fuck off,

528
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,820
yes, she will always be out
numbered. And eventually, yes,

529
00:30:16,821 --> 00:30:21,340
smart people don't have to exist.
What if smart people stopped procreating?

530
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,050
Then you give the earth to the dumb and
you don't fucking create poor bastards

531
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:29,050
who have to suffer in it.
I used to think until I had kids,

532
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,230
I used to think that like procreation,
like who gives a fuck?

533
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:35,440
What are you gonna make another person?
Does it matter? And then once I had kids,

534
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:38,110
I started realizing,
well, this can be fun.

535
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,160
You can enjoy the shit out of this and
he can make these little happy people and

536
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:45,520
it makes your life more happy and it
makes their life have you get a chance to

537
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:47,440
make this little person
a raise them happy.

538
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,120
I don't claim to have any information
about what the fuck is going to happen to

539
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:54,720
the world and although
our take your scent,

540
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,340
your your similar cynical view
that you know we're fucked.

541
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:01,150
We're going on a certain
road, overpopulation, the
pollution of the environment.

542
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,900
Nobody seems to care the corporatization
of these small countries and fucking

543
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:08,110
rob them of the resources and pollute
them and this and that and war and fucking

544
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:11,620
chaos and where the fuck is it all going
to go? I'm not completely convinced.

545
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,030
I don't think I have the answer.

546
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,610
I don't think I could have ever imagined
that this could have taken place.

547
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:16,720
If I was a monkey.

548
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,500
I could never imagine that we'd be
doing a fucking podcast right now,

549
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,770
just sitting in my office just shooting
the shit and it would spread through the

550
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:27,100
Internet and you can do whatever the fuck
you wanted and that this would be the

551
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:28,690
kind of thing where
you could reach people.

552
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,710
I get emails from people from Australia,
from fucking Tanzania.

553
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,210
I get Italy, China. I get emails from
all over the world. Somehow or another.

554
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:41,560
This has had some of them say, you
suck. A lot of them do. I suck in China.

555
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,630
Most of my emails honestly,
are really positive.

556
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:46,540
Every now and then I get some Umea.
You a youtube douchey ma'am,

557
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,570
but I like to think that it's always
one guy too. There's this one guy,

558
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:50,910
the only way Douche always.

559
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,640
What my point was that I could never
have imagined this taking place,

560
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,000
so why am I pretending that I know
how this is all going to turn out?

561
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,990
Why am I pretending that I have a
little fucking do man, it's coming.

562
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:05,440
You know apocalypse too for
sure. No, not necessarily,

563
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:08,620
but that's when I stopped giving a fuck
is when I realized I'm not going to

564
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:11,170
procreate. So it doesn't
matter. Duncan Trussell mind,

565
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:14,410
fuck me last week and that was
it. Monday, when do we do this?

566
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,880
We've got Dunkin Monday,
Monday.

567
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,330
Dunkin mind fucked me on Monday
by saying something like,

568
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:22,390
how do we know how long
we get to live for?

569
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,900
And he was talking about reincarnation.
He was like, maybe we live forever.

570
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,230
Maybe reincarnation is you live this life.
And then you know,

571
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:33,610
you think you're fucking going off
a bridge and a truck and you know,

572
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:35,830
you wake up from the dream,
you're like, fuck, I almost died,

573
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:38,500
but you did die and you're
just in this new thing now.

574
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:43,460
And this is life with embedded memories
and embedded ideas and you keep going on

575
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,320
and on. And there's times where I stopped
back and I look at my past and I ma,

576
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,960
I'm not convinced that was me.
Look Dude, see these right here.

577
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,080
These are all my, my martial arts metals,
these are all from taekwondo tournament.

578
00:32:57,081 --> 00:33:01,460
When I won the US Open and a
silver medal in the U S Cup,

579
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,780
we had a problem. Please gentlemen,
you know what to make me hard sign. Um,

580
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,250
but anyway, I don't believe I run those.
I don't believe I really used to do that.

581
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:12,190
I don't believe I know how to do it still.
And I,

582
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:15,040
I'll go out and I'll hit the bag and
something or something like that and I go,

583
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,680
oh, I guess I really know how to do that.
Like somehow I know that's in my head,

584
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,840
but I don't believe that that's
really me. You know, that was,

585
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,760
that was so many years ago. It's a
different human being. Your fault.

586
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,380
Every cell in your body is
replaced every seven years. Yeah.

587
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,540
You know what's weird about
his, uh, in theory, by the way,

588
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:33,950
I thought of it as a
afterwards, unfortunately, but
I understand what he's saying.

589
00:33:33,951 --> 00:33:36,080
Where you, you, you, you wake up
and you're like, oh, you know,

590
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,700
you might've just re born or whatever.
Right.

591
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:42,650
But you're still getting old the whole
time. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.

592
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,500
He might be right. Be The memory
of you getting old is this life.

593
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,740
You don't know whether or not the memory
of you getting old is just taken from

594
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:51,440
another life or not. You have no idea. You
have no idea how long you've been here.

595
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,620
It's all nonsense.
Every time you wake up,

596
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,420
you're trusting that you're on the same
track in the same game that you're,

597
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:02,930
you know, on the, in the
same fucking movie. And then
the same. Yeah, there's the,

598
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:05,930
every time you wake up, look,
everybody's scared to die.

599
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,250
But nobody is scared to go to sleep.

600
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,730
And they ultimately seemed to be
the same thing. I mean, chemically,

601
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:11,541
they're even the same thing.

602
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:15,080
Your brain produces DMT when you're
in rem sleep and they believe it also

603
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:16,880
produces it when you're about to die.

604
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,600
And they think that's responsible for
all these crazy near death experiences.

605
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,120
And you know, you've had the empty, you
know what the fuck I'm talking about.

606
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,010
If you didn't know that that existed and
then someone was trying to describe it

607
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:31,130
to you, they would do it. No justice,
right? They'd be like, you could talk.

608
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,690
You could talk all day.
You can't now. Yeah. It's,

609
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,520
you can't describe it is what you always
say before you try and that shit's

610
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,390
happening to you every night and you're
going to die and that shit's going to

611
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:44,810
happen when you die. We don't know. We
don't know what the fuck we are. We don't.

612
00:34:44,811 --> 00:34:49,400
We do not know. This is real. You assume
that it's real because I'm, I'm agreeing.

613
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:52,100
It's real and your ingredients real
and we're all in a room together,

614
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,420
but this is all just trust.

615
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,210
I'm just trusting that you guys
were even fucking real. You know?

616
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:57,560
I'm trusting that.
You know what I'm saying?

617
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:02,570
I'm trusting that this this day that I
woke up isn't some new life that I just

618
00:35:02,571 --> 00:35:06,200
started because I was some fucking trucker
in Iceland and I went into a frozen

619
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:09,560
lake. You know who the fuck knows?
You're the only one they exist to.

620
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,920
Couldn't be like everyone else is
just like a part of your brain.

621
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,030
That's the theory.

622
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,030
There's a lot of people who subscribe
to the theory that the reason why the

623
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:21,920
world is ending is because your life
is ending and your life is really the

624
00:35:21,921 --> 00:35:26,300
creator of this universe and this universe
all exists in your mind and as you

625
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:29,120
get closer to death,
the world becomes more and more fucked up.

626
00:35:29,121 --> 00:35:32,870
Fascism and fucking government
control and their chips in my brain.

627
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,160
Really it's always old people that
do that the most. Sure. It's not like

628
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,570
it was your, not like you were those
old people by the way are in your mind.

629
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,260
How about that?

630
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,260
How about those old people aren't even
real and the old people in your mind that

631
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:50,310
are playing this fucking game out with
you. Yeah, but uh, if you knew that,

632
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,820
if you knew that was the case, it would
fucking ruin your day. What it though?

633
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,610
I would still enjoy the fuck out of it.
I can still enjoy it.

634
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,920
Like it's just a strange ride. Groundhog
day though. He didn't enjoy that. Yeah,

635
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,360
but that was different at the same
fucking life over and over again.

636
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,050
Brian's not talking about slightly
different every time. Saying, if I, if I,

637
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,400
if I consent that you are just part
of my imagination and I'm creating you

638
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,150
[inaudible] that would suck.
Well, the real question is
what the fuck? What a guy,

639
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,840
what would wake up every day? Go?
What should I have Joe Rogan, dude,

640
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:25,050
I made them up. And that's
not just me. It's you. You're,

641
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,820
you're living in your imagination.

642
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,440
I would hope that I have
a better imagination than
why it's fucking fantastic

643
00:36:33,211 --> 00:36:35,130
list if I am,
let me tell you something right now.

644
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:39,620
If I am just a player in your imagination,
I am honored at what you've created.

645
00:36:39,621 --> 00:36:44,430
Like fucking fly across the room. Oh
No, no, no, no. Brian in the chest. No.

646
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,660
I imagine like,
no,

647
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,900
you've done an amazing job with your
imagination as a bit player in your

648
00:36:48,901 --> 00:36:50,130
imagination.
I just want to tell you,

649
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,970
thank you very much for everything
you've created the pores. It's brilliant.

650
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,300
It's brilliant. It's brilliant making you
blow smoke up my ass. You, you're right.

651
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,890
You are the master.
You're the man behind the curtain.

652
00:37:00,891 --> 00:37:04,400
Don't even know what I'd have you say
if you were in my imagination. Listen,

653
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,440
you've done an amazing job what you've
done in Afghanistan, the quagmire.

654
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,520
You know what I really love?

655
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:11,640
I really love the drug war
references that you throw into it.

656
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,820
The fact that we're over there in
Afghanistan and they produces 90% of the

657
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:17,340
world's opium.
I love how you may be my imagination.

658
00:37:17,341 --> 00:37:20,970
Not only would you be
heaving compliments upon me,

659
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:25,971
but you'd you'd give me Vaginas
to in a can to fuck fucking

660
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,240
Dick. I want to thank you for the pouty
lips stuff. Yeah, man. I love those.

661
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:35,910
My space pictures that you created.
I love how you made Justin Bieber.

662
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:39,240
Justin Bieber's brilliant brains,
right? When you think it's over right?

663
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,730
When you think it's over. Well, there's
no begin to be no more, no more, no more.

664
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,390
Boom. A new one. More ridiculous
than ever before. He's a fucking I.

665
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,190
I don't know why.
I know I have to know who that guy is.

666
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,090
I don't watch any shows like that.
I don't even listen to music,

667
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,920
but I know who Justin Bieber's I don't
watch gossip fucking shit. It's yeah,

668
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,930
it's something you could bury me in the
ground under eight feet of fucking soil

669
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,080
and leave me there like a fucking David
Blaine trick and I would still somehow

670
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:14,040
find out who Justin Bieber is and not
know why. I don't know why either.

671
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,150
I haven't even heard his voice.

672
00:38:15,151 --> 00:38:18,240
I don't need not even know what his voice
sounds pointing. Get Yogurt with him.

673
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,740
I don't know what he looks like.

674
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:23,430
I just know the name and he's
a big pop sensation. N N.

675
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:28,110
Dot com I go to for my mainstream news.
Okay. I go there and there's an article,

676
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:31,380
Kim Kardashian upset
about playboy pictures.

677
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,920
She's upset because some pictures when
she posed for playboy in 19 seven got

678
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,170
released and somehow
they're on the internet.

679
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,650
That's like tiger woods getting pissed
off because they showed a fucking old

680
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:44,830
golf game. Right. You know, like
what the fuck are you talking about?

681
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:48,340
This is like real news. How do I know
about this? I can't stop breathing.

682
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,330
I want to know the
details. What happened? Oh,

683
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:51,820
well the guy who did the playboy shoot,

684
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,390
he had a bunch of images that are
unreleased and finally he released them.

685
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,830
That mother Fucker,

686
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,680
especially since you can get
pissed after you've had that,

687
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:04,000
that porn video either that porn video
was like one of the dirtiest porn videos

688
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:08,800
I've ever seen. Big fucking
throbbing. Black big. Okay.

689
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,740
Big Black Dick.

690
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,360
Confident young black man who is handsome
and athletic and she was sucking his

691
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:19,690
hard black Dick. That's a wrap.
You can't complain about anything.

692
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,320
You crazy bitch. You made it,
but I don't know why I know her.

693
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,910
I mean [inaudible] you know her because
she wants you to know her and I fucking

694
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:32,530
hate it. I brilliant out of
my head. I do hate it, but I
don't. I love it. I love it.

695
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:36,520
I love the retardation of it all. I mean
we, yeah, we would be out of business.

696
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,510
I didn't have everything in the
world to hate. We would be puking,

697
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:43,060
but we wouldn't be funny.
We wouldn't be funny if we didn't.

698
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:45,460
We'd have little name tags on right now.

699
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,160
We'd have to have our
hair cut over our color.

700
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,090
If I didn't know who
fucking Kim Kardashian was.

701
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,860
I don't agree with the whole Buddhist
monk ideology of living wearing robes.

702
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,520
No masturbation, no fun. Because then you
miss out on some of the fun of hating.

703
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,340
You miss out on some of the fun.

704
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,790
There's like an a part of me that
knows that this is the wrong path and

705
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:09,800
lightened meant when I start shitting
on people and fucking torture them.

706
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,240
But there's another part that
goes, fuck you. Stupid. Fuck.

707
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,390
I'm trying to figure out
the way the Internet is.

708
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,380
It's only a matter of time and it's
actually going on now before the just

709
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:27,760
regular civilians are open to the
same kind of fucking hate mail. Yes.

710
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:32,260
Internet trash talking that we deal
with on a regular basis where you know,

711
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,320
you go out to lunch on a date
with some woman and she goes, Huh?

712
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,930
He had puts on her Facebook. He had stinky
breath and he's fat and I was boring.

713
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,060
And she links to your Facebook. Well, no,

714
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,540
the guy's going to have someone from
fucking four Chan finds it and then they

715
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:51,100
start a thread on animal and it's fucked.
Paul Revolution, he w n e, d, You know,

716
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:54,370
emailed this guy, you, you're
fucking constellations,

717
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,760
but you're going to find out what people
really think about you and you're not

718
00:40:57,761 --> 00:40:58,330
going to like it.

719
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:03,100
And it's like change what we take for
granted as just being honest versus being

720
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:08,101
civil and people are really gonna have
to start just Larkin owning who they are.

721
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:09,280
I, yeah, I agree.

722
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:12,730
And I think another thing that's going
to happen is that this is only one stage

723
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,040
and an endless stage of disclosure.

724
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,880
And then what we're at right now is the
beginnings of transparency between all

725
00:41:18,881 --> 00:41:21,010
people and all information of all,
all acts,

726
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:23,310
everything you've ever done and
everything you've ever thought, right?

727
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,010
We're eventually going to be able to like
literally sink up to one fucking hive

728
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:30,670
mind that going to happen. Google.
Yeah. It might be Google, right?

729
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,100
Google might be skynet. Yup. Well
whatever know it's, it's, it's

730
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,010
inevitable. I mean everybody
wants to again, make me hard,

731
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:37,850
ladies and gentlemen is signed.

732
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:41,030
The keeps falling for the folks that are
on iTunes that don't get to see this.

733
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,720
When Doug and I were on the Mankato,
I know we complained, but this is,

734
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:47,760
this is pure evidence that was,

735
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,870
that was the best story about how hard
we had a game show that we created called

736
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:54,710
make me hard.
And it was,

737
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,460
it was one of the best things we
did when it actually turned out.

738
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,730
And the reason why I was one of the best
things we ever did is because there was

739
00:42:01,731 --> 00:42:06,560
tranny cock cock. Yeah. But we, we
the the show is called make me hard.

740
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,610
And then when we actually made
the show and when we, you know,

741
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,340
talk to the comedy central people and
everything, they didn't like hard,

742
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:17,030
hard was too dangerous.
They wanted it to be make me stiff.

743
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,000
And we were like what the fuck
is the difference is the most,

744
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:23,030
this was right before
we're about to tape too.

745
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:25,200
So our department has to rush that.

746
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
They allowed fucking full open tranny
cock open tranny cock cause we're going to

747
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:35,780
blur it out. Simulated fellatio on a
banana by images. This is what happened.

748
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:38,660
All the language. It's just this
was the Gig. There was a kid,

749
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,110
they would strap him to a chair and
they would put it, this harness,

750
00:42:42,111 --> 00:42:45,470
actually I should back up because a
lot of people probably don't remember,

751
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,310
make me laugh,

752
00:42:46,311 --> 00:42:50,750
was a game show where people tried
not to laugh while comics try to make,

753
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,990
but the guys would get in their face
and say silly things. So make me hard.

754
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:58,640
We set them up where they have this box
on their package and we would decide

755
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:01,520
when it lit up indicating that
they had an erection. So we had,

756
00:43:01,521 --> 00:43:05,780
so they had to try to not get a
boner during these sexual, uh, yeah.

757
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:08,930
So of course it would go off, midgets
would eat bananas. It would go off.

758
00:43:08,931 --> 00:43:11,270
And we had this really hot tranny.

759
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:15,050
She was so hot that Eddie Bravo and I
were at the comedy store one night and we

760
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,760
were coming down that we've
got a park at the high end.

761
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,410
The comedy store parking lot was
full and we're coming down the ramp,

762
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:22,570
but she was coming up at eight. He's
going, God damn that pitches on. Look,

763
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:26,210
this chick coming up right now. Whoa.
She's so pretty. I go, that's a dude.

764
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,890
I've seen his dick.
That's how hot like her name is.

765
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,320
Vanity and choose totally believable.

766
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:36,200
If you ever think that you
can't get tricked by a tranny,

767
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,240
there's no way I would know. I
wouldn't know. You wouldn't care. She,

768
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:45,830
yeah, she blew a dude. We know and yeah,
just did it because Weiss, yeah, twice,

769
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,470
once on the set.
And then once that,

770
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,670
and then she called him after she was at
our hotel and he was back the next day

771
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:56,270
or something. He's so hot. We're
calling him, her name was vanity.

772
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:59,750
And you can find her like, I
think it's vanity, Tsu, Google.

773
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,940
I've found her to show it to people who'd,
who'd blame him? So anyway, the, we,

774
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:06,650
the, the guys, you know,

775
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:10,970
strapped to this table and she climbs all
over him and he licked her tits. Right.

776
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,490
I can't remember. Poor fucking
guy. We tortured this guy's
memory forever. So He's,

777
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:19,310
he's like, everyone's going,
yeah, yeah, yeah. People cheering.

778
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,320
And then she pulls out this trainee Dick
that looks like, like a poison monkey.

779
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:27,260
Dick look like it looks sick.

780
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,040
Like it had been hitting so many
female hormones. It was like an old man

781
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,660
in a wheelchair. That's what a tickler.
And she pulled it out. It was black,

782
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,250
it was black. As it functions, there's
a bunch of snow. No, it's done.

783
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,370
It's all done.
I mean it's just hanging out there.

784
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,490
It probably feels good when
you suck. It's still, you know,

785
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,180
even a soft dick feels good if you
suck it right. But I don't think,

786
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,961
I don't think there's any,

787
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:52,440
unless she pops Viagara maybe she'll talk
for Agora and I still have a hard dick.

788
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,160
Wow. But she's just so full of
female hormones where he is.

789
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,960
Do you know if it's something that's
kind of crazy and I, I, before,

790
00:44:58,961 --> 00:45:03,500
I shouldn't have ever said this, but now
I think I can do it. Uh, I used to read,

791
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,300
start reading penthouse magazine reading
recently and there was this thing at

792
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:11,940
the end of the magazine that
said, I'm coming next month,
pet pet of the month. Uh,

793
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,260
and then there was this girl's
photo and stuff like that.

794
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,900
So I became friends with her on
Twitter just to follow her around.

795
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:18,190
And see who this girl is.

796
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:21,580
And then the following month she
wasn't to the pet of the month.

797
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:24,730
And then so then I started following
her Twitter a little bit more.

798
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,290
And she's a guy

799
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,250
what? And they just kind of kind of like,
hmm. They just swept it under the rug.

800
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,800
So a dude snuck in and became
a penthouse pet ivy league.

801
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:40,020
They obviously did a photo shoot
because it was saying next dude's name.

802
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,450
I don't remember man. It was like
it was, you got to come was like,

803
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,450
where's Alex Jones on this? Well I can
tell you what months it was. It was like,

804
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,460
how about this? How about you
Google that shit? Find out what?

805
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,430
I don't think it's no one caught it,
I think.

806
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,190
I think I just noticed it because
I followed her on Twitter.

807
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,880
Why do you think she's a dude?
Because she's a dude, if I know.

808
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:02,750
Cause you sucked his neck. If you look
at the, if you looked at her and then,

809
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,190
and then she talks about it.

810
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,010
She was talking about it on her Twitter
for talking about being a dude. Yeah.

811
00:46:07,011 --> 00:46:10,610
And then she heard Twitter just
went away. Whoa. They paid her off.

812
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,860
I think I paid her, I don't
know, older. She's fucking,

813
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,370
imagine if you were
seeing drivers allegedly,

814
00:46:16,371 --> 00:46:19,280
let's just say you're a truck driver
and Cincinnati and you beat off to the

815
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:22,040
fucking July edition of penthouse
and you find out what's up, dude.

816
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,970
He probably got a good lawsuit some
fucking like it was like, well,

817
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:30,260
[inaudible] tell. I just want to know
why they didn't notice that. It may be,

818
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:33,350
how can you tell maybe she has
a disease maybe or something.

819
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,730
Maybe she has a disease.
What the fuck does that mean?

820
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:41,630
Brung it something bad.
Dub World. The whole world.

821
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:46,250
The fucking sex world. That's a strange
world. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty fucking,

822
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:52,500
I don't hate to use the word
shallow. Yeah, but yeah,

823
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:57,350
it's the, using the word gives a
different connotation than what I mean,

824
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,930
but they're really, there's
not, it's like sex itself.

825
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,020
There's not a lot of ways to
go with it. Right. All right.

826
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:07,130
I stuck my Dick and I can. All
right. Is that different? Does not.

827
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,280
So the people that are involved in that
tend to be people who are easily amused.

828
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,980
Yeah. What I always said about like
there was a bunch of friends who uh,

829
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,160
they took me to this marijuana policy
project thing at the playboy mansion and

830
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:25,280
they were all going off. Wow. I'll call to
the man. She know HEFCE the fucking man.

831
00:47:25,281 --> 00:47:28,380
Look what Hef did. Look would have
dad and I and I stopped about I go,

832
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,230
do you guys,

833
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,130
there's a big difference between being
attracted to girls like you are right now.

834
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:34,060
You guys are attracted to girls.

835
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,230
There's a giant difference
between that and making a living,

836
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,680
taking pictures of them
naked so guys can beat off.

837
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,820
And that's the whole world you live in
and you have a mansion and you pay them

838
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,730
to hang out with you because you
think that it's a cool image.

839
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,610
So you have all these
girls that you're on,

840
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,860
you have the payroll and you're this
old dude. Like you're the fucking man.

841
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,720
One of my favorites bucket bits. You ever
did? But yeah, that was bad that day.

842
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,670
Just something fucking creepy about that.
This creepy about anybody that's,

843
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,510
that's getting money off of other people
being naked and they're rich and the

844
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:12,010
people who are to pour, right?
Like that's, that's that,
and again, it's all it is,

845
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:15,970
is fucking nudity and fucking,
yeah, it's like playing a Kazoo.

846
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,400
There's only so many fucking,

847
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,920
you can put a little bunch of
Kazoos together and make it,

848
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:25,090
cause you orchids is just,
that is true music at the end of the day.

849
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,910
But that is true.
But if you're a young,

850
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:32,860
raging man with a fucking
throbbing Boehner and, and
a strong sex drive in your,

851
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:34,870
you know, 19 or 20, you know,

852
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:39,250
1920 and you're hanging out in Vegas and
you're at a club money in your bank in

853
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:44,020
new checks every night, that's exciting.
Right? No, it is. It is, but it's, it's,

854
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:49,021
that is a market that's been created by
the falls and morality and people that

855
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:53,230
are against sex and make it as
difficult thing to obtain. Right.

856
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:56,620
If people were just fuck right away
and get that out of your system,

857
00:48:56,621 --> 00:49:00,910
you could like Europe,
like I don't, I don't know.

858
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,620
There was there more liberal.
But yeah, again, you don't
see when you go to Europe,

859
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:09,700
you don't see the shit we
have here fucking sex in
advertising and titties on a

860
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:13,870
billboard because it's not built up to
be that big a deal. It's such, you know,

861
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,940
such a a, what's the
word? Fucking holy grail.

862
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,490
Just to see entities so they don't,

863
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:25,120
it doesn't have the leverage
over there that it does here.

864
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,320
Remember we both grew up in
Massachusetts and a lot of Catholics and

865
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:33,190
Massachusetts, Catholic school girls.
I mean it's a fucking, it's a joke.

866
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:37,240
It's a longstanding joke. Why are Catholic
school girls whores? I mean not horse.

867
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:40,420
Cause why are they freaks? Why
they freaks? They're freaks.

868
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:44,230
Because that's the last
thing their parents want.
Right? That's the last thing.

869
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,910
The parents want to control them.
The fucking teacher wants control.

870
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,320
They make them wear crazy outfits and
then also on those outfits become hot.

871
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,570
You want to fuck them cause they're
wearing those outfits. I mean,

872
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:56,930
is that the most ironic shimmer leaders,
Catholic school girls and fucking that,

873
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:01,160
that outfit. Schoolgirl outfit.
That's the outfit. Like all the guys.

874
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,120
And you're like watching football
on Thanksgiving and like, yeah,

875
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,160
I'd watch it judge for the cheerleaders.

876
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:11,350
Like you're from a such a repressed sexual
place that just a girl that's vaguely

877
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:15,460
skippy growing up in the Oh death

878
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,020
I believe. Do you watch mad men?
I'm fucking absolutely awesome.

879
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,270
I it's, it's fantastic. It
really, if you, if you look at it,

880
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:27,860
it is a glorified soap opera.
But that era

881
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,700
is so well done.
I'm not totally familiar with the show.

882
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:36,701
I've only seen like little clips out
advertising from the 1940s fifties late

883
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,780
fifties, early sixties. Here's
what I know about that show.

884
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:43,550
There's a bread head on
that's ridiculously hot. Yeah,
she's pretty hot. She got,

885
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,270
she got fat this year. It's a
big to do and oh, she's gotten,

886
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:50,000
she's gotten wider in the Lazy Lazy.

887
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,310
It became some big to do where uh,
yeah,

888
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,170
cause people have pointed out that she
got fat and then there's the other,

889
00:50:57,171 --> 00:51:01,340
how dare you say she's
fat than season one money.

890
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,520
Like you wouldn't be happy to be with her,
but the why,

891
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:09,680
why can't she get fat and professional?
Hot chick up bad.

892
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:14,330
She's just up saved. She's fat.
Fat is only fat as a description.

893
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:19,100
You decide it's an insult.
It's a description.

894
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:24,710
Totally true. Indian, your indigenous.
It's a description. You're fucking tall.

895
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,770
You're short. You're pat. I used
to have a joke about Mexicans.

896
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,850
It wasn't about Mexicans,

897
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:32,480
but it was about the Roswell incident
where you know the, the aliens,

898
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,170
you remember that junk was, no, I don't
remember the joke, but the joke was, um,

899
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,330
you put Roswell, it's going to be a
Mexican joke. I'm already kind of get,

900
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,670
the joke was that the
government released, Eh, they,

901
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,680
they had a press release to say that
they had a crashed Ufo and alien bodies.

902
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,970
The alien bodies is bullshit. I did it
just to make the joke better. And then,

903
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,640
then the next day they say, they came
out and say, Oh, we made a mistake.

904
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:58,940
It was just blown. And I say, what
about the aliens? Those were Mexicans.

905
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,550
They were on a blown, they were
tracking some shenanigans took place.

906
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:06,160
I said that in one night at the comedy
store and this chick yell out, Hey,

907
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,030
yeah, like describing Mexican
as a Mexican. Like, it's a bet.

908
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:12,680
Like I said,
anything wrong with Mexicans.

909
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,490
I've never had a anti race joke
in my entire life, but any race.

910
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,570
So to think that I would do it about
Mexicans, but just that I said Mexico,

911
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,650
it was like she had a right to stand up,
hands on hips,

912
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,060
long nails stretched out.
Hey,

913
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,820
like she found a fucking, she
found an opening. I had to stop.

914
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,480
I stop my show and address the issue.
Oh,

915
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,570
I still don't know you as something
you're not supposed to say.

916
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,030
My friend Brian wants got mad at me now.
This Brian, Brian Frazier or writer, uh,

917
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,890
there was something happened and uh,

918
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:50,570
I said I was trying to chew you down
and he's Jewish and he was super,

919
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:54,010
super sensitive and he got really mad
at me and he was right. I mean, I'm a,

920
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:58,370
it was kind of a racist statement,
but, oh, but, but you didn't cook.

921
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,990
I'm Italian. And if you said, oh, look
at this fucking dopey Guinea, you know,

922
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:06,470
with this gold chain and
this stupid slicked hair, I
started laughing, you know,

923
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:10,250
it's not me. Okay. It's, it's,
yeah. What are you acting
like a Guinea? You know, if I,

924
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:11,630
if I had a chain on it, he
was like, what are you going,

925
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:14,630
who are you acting like Guinea? I
wouldn't be upset, but Jew you down,

926
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:15,710
like someone tried to shoot you down.

927
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,060
That's a particularly insulting side
of a demeaning expression about Jewish

928
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:24,040
people. And he got that day.
They tried to mark drifty. Yeah,

929
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:29,310
they're a little bit frugal. No fiscally
responsible. Again, it's a self imposed.

930
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:34,200
Oh Shit. I'm going to be, he got
so mad once this fucking guy,

931
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:37,380
this it. Brian was a, he's a really
funny guy. He was a great comic,

932
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,830
but a really high strung guy and
um, uh, it's stopped doing comedy.

933
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,750
I think he just writes now.
But we were in a,

934
00:53:42,751 --> 00:53:45,210
we had a cake together in
Fremont and by the way,

935
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:48,960
he was a bodybuilder at the time
and all natural but enormous,

936
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,810
like the proof positive that you don't
have to do steroids to get big because I

937
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,950
know this guy never did anything.

938
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:55,320
He was eating like Broccoli
and never even took vitamins.

939
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,730
But he just was obsessed
and at giant muscles to the
point where I tell him like,

940
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:02,730
you can't go on stage with teachers on
like you go on stage with tee shirts,

941
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:05,340
just carrying the fuck out of people. You
don't look funny. You know, like funny.

942
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:05,510
I go,

943
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:09,450
you didn't need to wear like a suit or
along a baggy shirt that covers you up.

944
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:10,530
You're intimidating.
I,

945
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:13,230
I can't look at anything but you
on stage with these giant muscles.

946
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:16,760
So we did this gig together on
the road and uh, he had a throat,

947
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,370
sore throat and he was apologizing for
the sore throat. You know, he's like,

948
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:25,020
I'm sorry to the, to the guy who ran
the club. And um, he, uh, he goes,

949
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:28,140
I'm sorry I was a bit sick all week,
guys, go please. You were hilarious.

950
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:32,250
He killed it was great. You guys were
awesome. And, um, he goes, I'm just sorry.

951
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:34,200
I just really,
I wish I could've done a better job.

952
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:39,150
He was really just a nice guy and the
guy goes, relax with like a playing,

953
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,400
what are you Jewish?

954
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,960
He says this because Brian had a crew
cut and he has blonde hair. But yes,

955
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:50,850
he's Jewish. His fucking name is Brian
Frazier. Like Frazier's that Jewish name.

956
00:54:50,851 --> 00:54:52,410
Like you wouldn't even put that together.

957
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,790
But then you think Joe Frazier chooses
a Jewish name is German. All right,

958
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,820
well I have no idea. I wouldn't, I
wouldn't see Frazier and Phil, your heap.

959
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:07,530
I say Fraiser's a German name. No, isn't
that Jenny? No, I don't know the whole,

960
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:12,420
it's not Liebowitz. It's not obvious,
but I mean the guy, look, he's blonde,

961
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:15,690
he's blonde and he does not look
Jewish. Right? And he's a bodybuilder.

962
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,110
He looks like he looks like some dude
you pulled out of a farm in Iowa and he's

963
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:22,140
ready to fucking kick your ass
and date rape your sister. Right?

964
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:23,610
That's what he looks like.
But he's a nice guy.

965
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,220
Brock Lesner is what you're
saying. Exactly. You can't say

966
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:33,050
so he goes fucking nuts and he can't
talk cause it's flushes your fucking ass.

967
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:37,530
All Jewish and he's red in the face
and this guy can't realize that.

968
00:55:37,531 --> 00:55:40,230
He's telling me he's being serious
for like the first couple of seconds.

969
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:43,290
I'm like, fuck, what am I
going to do here? I'm like,

970
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:46,920
what am I gonna fight my friend to keep
them from killing this asshole? I'm like,

971
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:49,860
I'm here in Vermont. I'm
thinking I'm going to go to
jail. I'm ready to this hall.

972
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:53,620
And Brian is just big giant tree
trunk neck. No, fuck that. Gosh,

973
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:57,300
I have Josh any serious. And the guy
has to realize that he's serious.

974
00:55:57,301 --> 00:56:00,840
And Brian is like leaning over the
desk like screaming and the guy's face.

975
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:05,370
And I'm like, so what happened? I have
to talk him down and nothing happens.

976
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:07,800
It's fucking anticlimactic
story. Of course. He's Joyce.

977
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:11,220
She was very upset about being
called Jewish. Yeah, but they don't.

978
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,600
But with the insinuating the Jewish,
well, he was Jewish. People Complain,

979
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,520
they just complain a lot. They're never
going to really do anything. Right.

980
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,770
Why are you, why? Why you have
such a sense of guilt, right?

981
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,580
What are you Jewish?
I'm sorry,

982
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:31,540
I got that from every fucking
Jewish comic I've ever heard.

983
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,230
That's why I say that. I'm sorry. Yeah,

984
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:40,100
there's a lot of guilt going on in
the Jewish world. Again, if you,

985
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,470
Ari Shaffir as the best story about
being, you know, Ari was raised like,

986
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:48,580
like really strict orthodox
Jewish and he had to read the,

987
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:51,490
Tom would like 10 hours a day.
He lived in Israel,

988
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:55,420
like he did the whole deal and he said
that they told him that masturbating,

989
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:57,580
when you masturbate your seed,

990
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:02,440
when it leaves your body goes into a
demon's womb and gives birth to handicap

991
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:05,890
babies.
Which is true.

992
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,190
Absolutely true. True. Could you
fucking imagine if somebody that's,

993
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:14,350
that's what your mom was telling
you and you're like, oh my God,

994
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:17,590
I know this can't be real, but I
got to go with it. This crazy bitch.

995
00:57:17,591 --> 00:57:18,580
I'm never going to figure it out.

996
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:22,420
Like walking through the mall and
apologizing to people in wheelchairs.

997
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:24,250
And when I was in first grade,

998
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:28,420
I went to Catholic school and I can very
remember very clearly thinking that I'm

999
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:31,540
fucked because I know I don't
know what life is all about,

1000
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:33,310
but I know these assholes don't either.

1001
00:57:33,311 --> 00:57:35,620
And they're the ones who are going to
tell me they're the ones going to tell me

1002
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:36,970
and I'm fucked.
I'm fucked.

1003
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:39,340
Because they're not telling the truth
and they're not right and I'm fucked.

1004
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,030
I remembered that, that thought. I
really remember it from being like six.

1005
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,790
That's a terrible fucking feeling
for a kid to think that the,

1006
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:50,320
the people that are, that are raising you
are retarded. No, wait, what's going on?

1007
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:53,950
I'm going to jerk off into a g a demons
pussy and it's gonna make a retard baby.

1008
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:58,830
Really? Really? Yeah. You gotta fucking
video of this, you know, could you just,

1009
00:57:58,870 --> 00:58:01,240
why are you just saying
this? You just, you know,

1010
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:03,220
because it was written
somewhere and you're gonna,

1011
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:05,650
you're gonna teach me and I'm five.
You fuck.

1012
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,510
I always, I, I, I was,
no, that was, sorry.

1013
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:12,140
That was someone else
has just talking to no,

1014
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,370
I thought it was just telling him this.

1015
00:58:14,371 --> 00:58:18,960
He was that stupid meeting I had with that
lawyer guy. But uh, yeah, I would, yeah.

1016
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:21,840
Doug's Stan hopes lawyered up. Ladies
and gentlemen, I am lawyered up.

1017
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,800
Look in high power. Don't get crazy.
The guy showed me that he had a,

1018
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:29,700
an autograft sheet of
acid from Timothy leary.

1019
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:34,330
That's a good lawyer.
Said when that's on your lawyer is warm.

1020
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,050
I might go to jail too.
He's going to jail first.

1021
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,740
I'm sure it's not going to jail acid.

1022
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:44,700
Did you want to jail first and you have
to wait with the artwork before you

1023
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:46,290
write the book. You have
to wait five years. Right.

1024
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:49,740
So that's the court ordered notice off
it off of it for five years after he goes

1025
00:58:49,741 --> 00:58:52,160
to jail. I ain't a fucking
great joke that uh, uh,

1026
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,850
there's a statute of limitations.

1027
00:58:53,851 --> 00:58:57,240
Like there's 13 more months before
I could do it. Really? Yeah,

1028
00:58:57,241 --> 00:59:00,090
I'll tell you off the air. Wow. Awesome.

1029
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,910
One of the fucking coolest things
about being friends with Doug Stanhope.

1030
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,940
I get to know the joke.
You bitches don't get to know shit.

1031
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,260
It's weird having material that
you can't do for 13 months.

1032
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,040
While you should know what you should do.
How strong is this story?

1033
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:18,500
How strong is the story? While the story
itself is, is, is strong, but I'll,

1034
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,010
this is what I think. There's
one joke, we'll the story itself,

1035
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:24,560
I think this is what we should do.
Actually. I'm actually doing the joke.

1036
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:28,540
I just had to change it around
a little bit. Oh, you know,

1037
00:59:28,541 --> 00:59:32,570
it'd be cool though is if you had
a show where you organize a show,

1038
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:34,850
let's say in Phoenix, Denver, whatever,

1039
00:59:34,851 --> 00:59:39,851
and pick a city and then told everybody
online and 14 miles or 13 months,

1040
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:44,180
two weeks, I'll be [inaudible].
I do it on the fucking road.

1041
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:49,160
If it were a decade ago, subject
was mother, mother. Okay. Oh,

1042
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:50,220
you know, you know, oh,

1043
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,150
the mother does something to you
perhaps could be legally responsible for

1044
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,650
something along those lines. Let's
just start. You're talking about,

1045
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:00,380
I'm talking about mother,
mother. We had that wrong hand,

1046
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,940
but that's all we needed. Yeah. We had a,

1047
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,880
our moms on the demand show
for that. Yeah. It was cool.
It was really fun. Oh yeah.

1048
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,610
But uh, I realized that my mom was not
nearly as crazy as your mom. Your mom.

1049
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:18,050
Mom's way more fun. My mom was boring
bread and your mom, your mom's hilarious.

1050
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:20,180
You're your mom used to review porn.
Dude,

1051
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:24,980
we had gotten about Doug's mom reviews
porn was the best bit that we did.

1052
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,070
She was so terrified about that.

1053
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,040
She moved to La to be an actress and she
did all these independent films for no

1054
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:37,880
money and stuff,
but when it came to working with me,

1055
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,320
she didn't even want me there.

1056
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:43,300
She was so nervous about me being
there and me thinking she was funny.

1057
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:47,060
She was great. She was great. Your
mom was hilarious and the whole idea,

1058
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:50,330
just a beautiful thing. It's like you
have this new vehicle for writing comedy.

1059
01:00:50,331 --> 01:00:52,900
You can write through your mom and
your mom was going to do it and these

1060
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:55,550
sketches and it's fucking
great. Really. I mean,

1061
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:59,900
the move would be honestly to just have
only, you know only right for your mom.

1062
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,210
Everything. Well, no.

1063
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:06,740
She tried to do standup comedy and it
was one of the most terrifying, awful.

1064
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:10,790
That's when I met you. I think she
had been on stage at the night.

1065
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:13,880
I met you at [inaudible],
didn't we? It was called union.

1066
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:16,370
It was next door to double. Oh, right,
right, right. Yeah, you're right.

1067
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:20,120
My brother had gone up to do
open mic and it was so awful.

1068
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:25,120
It was like the worst fucking comedy
you've ever seen and everyone knows me and

1069
01:01:25,221 --> 01:01:26,240
I think you were there.

1070
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:29,150
Kinda remember it now it's one of
those things where you just, you just,

1071
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,820
how'd you guys meet?
Were you,

1072
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,900
what were you doing at the time when
you go with this bar next to Dublin's?

1073
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:39,110
It was, I'd heard about him. I'd
heard about them from a Joe Diaz,

1074
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,780
which I use radio. Doug Stanhope so
funny motherfucker. You got to meet.

1075
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:46,340
That kid is good. We, I think
he was. Yeah, that's what,

1076
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,100
that's what Joey said. He's one of
us. Yeah. Where it was the real deal.

1077
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:52,790
Where's Joey Hollywood was
the last time you saw him?

1078
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,660
I haven't seen him for years. I
tried to bring him tonight. Yeah,

1079
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,760
I gotta get his number. I lost all
of fucking when I lost my phone.

1080
01:01:58,761 --> 01:02:01,550
What the Fuck Doug Stanhope not on,
I lose my phone.

1081
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:06,440
I twittered my phone number accidentally
send. The guy saw that somewhere.

1082
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:07,820
It's trying to send us a Doug Benson.

1083
01:02:07,821 --> 01:02:10,490
Doug Benson was going to the Vegas
for a UFC and I was like, yeah,

1084
01:02:10,491 --> 01:02:12,950
here's my number, get in touch
with me and get there. Fuck.

1085
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,890
And I realized once I sent it out
that I sent it out to the whole world,

1086
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,960
or at least a hundred thousand people.
How's that?

1087
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,670
So I got how many calls did
you get? My phone, my phone.

1088
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,510
I would turn it on and it would have so
many texts that detects would be coming

1089
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:27,620
in

1090
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:29,370
being,
yeah,

1091
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,420
every time I would vibrate with the new
texts it would get to a certain point

1092
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:36,170
where it's like a hundred hundred 50 and
200 and where the phone would just bang

1093
01:02:36,171 --> 01:02:38,350
shut off and reboot. Wow. Blue Black.

1094
01:02:38,351 --> 01:02:41,590
Where he would go black and it would
reboot [inaudible] they don't have any.

1095
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,600
My girlfriend was on my Facebook and it
accidentally when like online's so it

1096
01:02:46,821 --> 01:02:50,630
shows that you're online to all your
Facebook people end up fucking chat.

1097
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:54,680
Things just start popping up.
So as I got fucking shut this off,

1098
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,650
I don't have that set up
like that, I don't think. No,

1099
01:02:57,651 --> 01:03:00,170
you just have to turn it
on yours. Yeah, she had it.

1100
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:05,390
She accidentally turned it on somehow.
I don't mind Twitter and stuff like that,

1101
01:03:05,391 --> 01:03:08,930
but you can't let everybody looks like
when we had the chat online with the, uh,

1102
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,610
the, the podcast, it was just
too much. Too much access. Right.

1103
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:15,470
So much freedom is fucking anonymous.
Clouds,

1104
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:21,440
broken bottles up there, asshole.
Just smashing keyboards. Fuck, fuck.

1105
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,120
You know too many of them man.
Just too many.

1106
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:29,260
That's why I also get into with the
mother thing go the like I would,

1107
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:34,430
I used to be able to tell jokes.
Yeah, I'll take one. Definitely.

1108
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:39,950
I'd be able to talk about shit like that
on the road 10 years ago because they

1109
01:03:39,951 --> 01:03:42,980
didn't have the fucking youtube.
Everyone with a cell phone camera.

1110
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,900
What you do is you,

1111
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,100
I won't tell those stories on stage
because there's one of you little fucking

1112
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:54,101
rat fucks thinks out there that's got
to youtube it and then you then put it

1113
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,480
whatever it is. I fucked around
on my girlfriend last night.

1114
01:03:59,481 --> 01:04:02,900
I would fuck around our girlfriends all
the time. And if it was a funny story,

1115
01:04:02,901 --> 01:04:06,290
I would tell it on stage the next
night cause they don't know my fucking

1116
01:04:06,291 --> 01:04:10,110
girlfriend. Right. But now you can,
I'm in Pittsburgh does this, who's,

1117
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,290
who are they going to tell? But now, yeah,

1118
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:17,291
it's every fucking show has some little
fucking bitch that as proof to pry and

1119
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,561
pointed this out.

1120
01:04:18,561 --> 01:04:22,970
And I've been saying it on stage at
bootlegging is not even difficult anymore.

1121
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,490
The,

1122
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:27,350
I mean the expression comes from when you
actually had to have a heavy equipment

1123
01:04:27,351 --> 01:04:30,290
in your boot and it was
very difficult to get.

1124
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,300
Now anyone can do it so you're not fucking
cool for like good fucking tape of it.

1125
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,520
Yeah. I mean you were, you're,
everyone's equipped for it.

1126
01:04:37,521 --> 01:04:42,140
Every phone you buy has the ability to
record videos for mine I have, yeah,

1127
01:04:42,141 --> 01:04:44,480
I have one.
That's the biggest piece of shit.

1128
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:49,400
I can't even really text on it because
I can't figure out how to get a space.

1129
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:54,440
Okay. Texting me, hey, how's that? Yeah,

1130
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:57,470
it does. You're fucking $19. Why are you,

1131
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:00,890
why are you trying to avoid the future?
Well,

1132
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,150
because I don't enjoy it.
I don't like talking on the phone.

1133
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:06,620
I certainly,

1134
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:09,980
it's your fucking business of space right
here in the lower right hand corner.

1135
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:14,170
Oh, the lower see the under case
like you along stretched out. Yeah.

1136
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,190
Double wide do that. That's a space.
W One f when it first met Doug,

1137
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:23,190
one of the first videos I ever filmed
ever was going to Ohio University and it

1138
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:27,040
was a parents' weekend and Doug,
it was Ed Helms,

1139
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:30,910
Doug and the dude from a Chappelle
show, the real world, uh,

1140
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:34,270
Christian Finnegan and fitting in.
And so they, they think it's a,

1141
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:36,190
they advertise it as that clean,

1142
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,570
they accidentally put it on a family
friendly events for parents weekend.

1143
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,530
So parents with their incoming
freshman children. Right.

1144
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:50,140
And it was almost a riot and I filmed it
from the back with the shittiest camera

1145
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:52,810
ever.
And it's the worst video quality ever.

1146
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:57,520
But you could see people standing up
screaming at him and Doug just went harder

1147
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,650
and harder. It's like, oh,
let's do an abortion mentally.

1148
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,660
And it was like parents as
Christ 600 walkouts. Yeah. Yeah.

1149
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:05,494
It was amazing.

1150
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:10,960
That's awesome. I did a show and
I miss those days like having a,

1151
01:06:10,961 --> 01:06:13,510
having an audience that
knows what they're there for.

1152
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,730
You miss out on all of channels.

1153
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:20,710
Old School Fun that people being mad
at you. I did a a college in Olivette,

1154
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:23,950
Michigan and that was the same situation
where they were told that I was clean

1155
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,900
somehow or another Barry Katz probably
told him that cocksucker the booking

1156
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:33,340
agent. I get there, I go on stage, it's,
I'm standing on two cafeteria tables in,

1157
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:34,750
in a,
in a high school cafeteria.

1158
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:39,010
That's where the tiny little teeny
speakers and it's a football college.

1159
01:06:39,011 --> 01:06:43,000
They're all football players and just
full of good food like right when I get

1160
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:46,510
onstage just yelling Faggot,
fuck you fucking faggot.

1161
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:51,750
And so I just start lightened dudes up
left and right and when I do this guy

1162
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:52,830
comes up to the,

1163
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:57,280
the corner of stage and the alerts me
and lets you are not allowed to swear in

1164
01:06:57,281 --> 01:07:00,130
this show.
There's no swearing and I'm sitting here,

1165
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,240
these guys are screaming faggot at me.

1166
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,850
I'm standing on two tables. And if you're
pretending that these are real rules,

1167
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,060
that you have a structure,

1168
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:14,030
there's special words and are not allowed
with your shitty fucking set up and

1169
01:07:14,031 --> 01:07:17,130
this ridiculous. So I turned to
the crown, I go, this motherfucker,

1170
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,060
you see this guy right here? He
just told me, what do you guys,

1171
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:22,660
you guys are at least 18 right?
You're old enough to die for your country.

1172
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:26,320
This guy doesn't think you
should be allowed to hear swears.

1173
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:27,460
Do you believe this shit?

1174
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,230
This motherfucker right here told me
that I can swear to believe this shit.

1175
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,820
And they started going crazy.
I go,

1176
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:39,120
let's burn this fucking place to the
ground to start throwing chairs and shit

1177
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:43,930
and go crazy and screaming.
And I'm laughing and joking
around while I'm saying,

1178
01:07:43,931 --> 01:07:47,260
I ain't go no, don't burn to the ground.
So the guy goes, just say whatever you,

1179
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:48,370
Amy is gay too,
by the way.

1180
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,610
So I don't want to make it seem like
I'm adding a list for this guy's voice

1181
01:07:51,611 --> 01:07:54,310
making the list existed. He
goes, say whatever you want,

1182
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:58,090
don't be consequences later. Wow. That's
what he said. Say whatever you want.

1183
01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:01,450
I'm like, I'm going to do what the
fuck I do. Signs you get paid. Yeah,

1184
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,370
I got paid and he had to
pay me. Yeah, I didn't,

1185
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,620
I written didn't really get paid
cause this was the days of New York

1186
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:06,600
entertainment were buried.

1187
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,660
But what Barry Katz used to do is he would
book these colleges and you would get

1188
01:08:10,661 --> 01:08:13,270
a check and the check would
be to New York entertainment.

1189
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:16,010
You would give it to New York and
attainment and then would cut you a cheque

1190
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,120
supposedly. Yeah. Theoretically. Well,
Barry's expenses got a little out of hand.

1191
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:23,610
So he started spending people's checks
and wasn't paying anybody. But I,

1192
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,510
I had done a college gig in yeah,

1193
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,870
Tampa and then I banged
the girl who booked it.

1194
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:33,010
So I went back for whatever reason,
I don't know if it's in the same trip,

1195
01:08:33,011 --> 01:08:36,820
but anyway, I s she had
booked, it was backs.

1196
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,590
I was backstage and it was Darrell
Hammond, think it was brewer.

1197
01:08:41,591 --> 01:08:45,310
It was three guys from
Saturday night live. And, uh,

1198
01:08:45,311 --> 01:08:49,300
when they get off stage, they are
like, so where do we go to get paid?

1199
01:08:49,301 --> 01:08:52,720
And she goes, oh, uh,
Barry said just send,

1200
01:08:52,721 --> 01:08:56,530
I sent the check to him and
they all fucking went, no,

1201
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:58,450
you fucking gave it to Barry.

1202
01:08:58,451 --> 01:09:02,470
Get motherfucker now we're never
going to see our money. This is,

1203
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:05,170
I did in the late mid to late nineties.

1204
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:09,880
Barry Katz was one of the producers
on the first last comic standing. I,

1205
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:12,520
he's not involved in it now. I don't
know if he is, man think he is.

1206
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,790
Maybe [inaudible] name

1207
01:09:14,910 --> 01:09:18,870
famous manager. Yeah. Then at
that Dane Cook, I think maybe

1208
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:22,900
it was the first one where it was me. I
was one of the judges, Monique and buddy.

1209
01:09:22,901 --> 01:09:24,950
Oh that's right. Yeah. I forgot to buddy.

1210
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,310
I got mad at me cause I
called aunt out on stealing,

1211
01:09:28,450 --> 01:09:33,450
stealing shit from movies lines from
the movie boiler room about Manhattan.

1212
01:09:33,971 --> 01:09:35,920
Some guy comes up to a
gay guy and he goes, hey,

1213
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:38,680
they should put your people on
an island. And he goes, they did.

1214
01:09:38,681 --> 01:09:39,640
It's called Manhattan.

1215
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:43,650
It's funny, I have the actual
pilot of the last comic standing.

1216
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:48,570
They had you in it. I have a
copy of it. It is on you too.

1217
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:51,960
I have it somewhere on
youtube. It's called Shit
Funny House. I haven't seen it.

1218
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,290
Oh,
I've pulled in my leg.

1219
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:59,040
I looked high and low for the
more Jay more you and yeah,

1220
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:04,050
I did the presentation pilot for last
comic standing and a presentation pilot is

1221
01:10:04,561 --> 01:10:09,561
what they've filmed to show the network
what the show would look like if uh,

1222
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:14,220
in order to get picked up. So I lived
in a house for three days with five,

1223
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:17,280
there were five comics total
and we were the comics.

1224
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,340
John Heflin was the only one that you'd
know while there's Alex Stewart is a is

1225
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:27,000
a black comic. Yeah. All right.
Him and it was really fun.

1226
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,460
[inaudible] I can't remember her name.

1227
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:33,420
And then some other chick
that dates some comic.

1228
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,100
So the only one that made it through
to the heffer on one the second year.

1229
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:44,120
Second year, yeah. Yeah. After the,
after the first year. Because they were,

1230
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,930
they were acting like, well, if this
gets picked up, you'll be on it.

1231
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:49,820
That's why my manager
talked me into doing it.

1232
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:54,200
It was less money to do the presentation
pilot than to be on the road.

1233
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:57,320
But my manager's like, well,
you know, if it gets picked up,

1234
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,500
I mean it's already a presentation and
then we're sitting in the house going,

1235
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:05,420
if this gets picked up, how are we going
to act? Like we don't know each other.

1236
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,710
I'll coming into a house to live together.
I go,

1237
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,680
I don't think we're going to be on
it if it gets picked out. Fuck Jay.

1238
01:11:12,681 --> 01:11:14,160
More fucking

1239
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,220
cocky little concert.
Norton Jim Norton was on the first season.

1240
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:20,190
Wasn't anybody had to like leave
halfway through because, uh,

1241
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,650
I like to pretend comics that I,
uh,

1242
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:27,150
I don't know cause I left Bisbee
era to, to live in Bisbee, Arizona.

1243
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:29,370
So I don't know what's going on in comedy.

1244
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,710
So because I don't know
what they're doing,

1245
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:35,490
I just assume they're washed up and it's
a happy thought. And then I'll find out,

1246
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:39,750
oh fuck y'all get out arenas. I
don't know. I don't watch network.

1247
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:44,000
He shot a fucking TV show. I thought
that guy's washed up. Fuck yeah.

1248
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:48,510
There's a certain few guys. You root root
to crash. Yeah. There's a certain few.

1249
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:53,130
When you find out they're not doing
so good to you. Yeah, fucking prick.

1250
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:56,610
But you have to know it affects them.

1251
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:01,350
You know you're not a Boston
comic. No, not at all.

1252
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:05,580
Grew up in Wooster in Wooster. Tell us
18 as soon as I was old enough to leave,

1253
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:08,070
I put you on Boston comic.
Whether you like it or not,

1254
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:12,750
there's a reason why there's
so many fucking funny guys
from that shitty part of

1255
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:16,380
the country and it's not
shitty. Which shit is shitty.
Yeah, the weather's Shitty.

1256
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:20,490
The girl, I think everything about,
well, not everything obviously hyperbole,

1257
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:23,400
but I did not know the girls
were nice until I moved to La.

1258
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:27,000
I didn't know they were capable of
being nice fucking dumb as shit.

1259
01:12:27,001 --> 01:12:31,160
We're hillbillies, man. Eddie
Bravo's, Eddie, probably this girl.

1260
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:35,160
I met this girl in Boston and she,
it was just a fucking Hail Mary.

1261
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:38,520
Sacrifice two in the morning, move way
back in the day. Many, many decades ago.

1262
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,080
Anyway, she goes, why? While
he's like making out with
her and pulls his dick out,

1263
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:46,650
whatever, he goes, she goes,
he can't tell you friends,

1264
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:55,230
girls in Boston.
I tell you fans.

1265
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,450
That's,
that's what I remember growing up.

1266
01:12:57,451 --> 01:13:00,900
I remember the only time I ever got
to fuck with the girls were so sloppy,

1267
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:05,580
drunk and belligerent that it was like,
we had to argue before we get to fuck.

1268
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,370
And then when we did it, when it was over,
I was like, Oh, I've got gotta go home.

1269
01:13:08,371 --> 01:13:13,170
Get me the fuck away from this. You
better fucking call me. Call me.

1270
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:17,730
Like, there's still like
that. It's the cold weather.

1271
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,780
Is it the fucking savages that lived there
that came over on boats from Ireland?

1272
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:26,570
One of my first girlfriends
when I was like 16, 17. Uh,

1273
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,480
I kept in touch with her, you
know, remotely here and again.

1274
01:13:30,481 --> 01:13:35,481
And I remember I had to be in my
thirties going back and I call in,

1275
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:40,530
we will, yeah, we'll have a drink and
hey, you look really good. And she goes,

1276
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,690
yeah. She goes, yeah,

1277
01:13:42,691 --> 01:13:46,530
well maybe if you hadn't of Fuck
Sherry Munson would still beat again.

1278
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,920
17 years old.
Oh,

1279
01:13:55,921 --> 01:14:00,270
that's hilarious. Oh, oh, that's
so fucking funny. But they do.

1280
01:14:00,271 --> 01:14:02,850
They hold onto that shit forever.

1281
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,310
That's a fucking get
out of jail free card.

1282
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,340
It's one of those few pat myself on the
back times in my life is just comparing

1283
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:12,400
myself

1284
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,140
to most of the people we grew up with
and knowing that one night in my life

1285
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:19,360
would be something they wouldn't remember.

1286
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:23,590
That would be like the bucking
biggest shit. I don't remember doing.

1287
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:27,880
I've done television shows that
I don't remember. Wait, oh,

1288
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,880
you were on my show and I'm
like, Eh, sounds familiar.

1289
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,140
If they were on the news
once in the background,

1290
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:41,140
they'd have a still photo of it
somewhere in their fucking grubby or can

1291
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,320
Foxborough framing fucking
route nine route nine

1292
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:52,250
the auto mall. Oh. Oh, that's so true.

1293
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:53,151
There's a,

1294
01:14:53,151 --> 01:14:56,540
there's a feeling that I get when I
go back to that part of the country.

1295
01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:00,620
When I go to Framingham, I'll go to
Natick. You know I mean the Natick Mall.

1296
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:04,850
When I drive through Newton, there's
a feeling that I get lar. I escaped,

1297
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,680
got away from you. Fuck
you. Fuck your trapped here.

1298
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,210
That's what I feel like in Ohio.
Same thing,

1299
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,570
but I have to admit it's one of
my favorite places to perform.

1300
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,840
They're fucking crazy and Boston
and they don't give a shit.

1301
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,960
They want to hear the real shit.
They want to hear the real shit.

1302
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:23,240
They had the best comp when,
when?

1303
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:28,241
When I was coming up in the 1980s Boston
had the best local headliners in the

1304
01:15:28,341 --> 01:15:31,490
country. They were better. We've talked
about this on the show many, many times.

1305
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:33,590
We talked about it when Dane was on,

1306
01:15:33,591 --> 01:15:36,350
we talked about it when a bunch
of different guys were on there.

1307
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,380
They were the best comics in the country.
There were local headliners.

1308
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,620
Don Gavin was the best comic in
the country at one point in time,

1309
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:46,280
but no one knew it. He was the best,
but I got to watch the guys at HBO.

1310
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:49,220
I got to watch guys when they came in
town and did the live shows and I got to

1311
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:52,460
see Don Gavin. I'm like, he's the
best. He's the best he's doing.

1312
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:55,040
He's squeaky clean and he's crushing,

1313
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:58,880
destroying the point where I feel like
I'm going to quit. I'm a fucking fraud.

1314
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:02,900
What am I doing? I'll never be
like this. And we got, we had,

1315
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,570
we were forced to,
to see that like early on.

1316
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:09,040
You know Boston's a very strange place
when it comes to comedy man. Yeah. It's,

1317
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:13,670
it's uh, it's fucking
incest. It's an and says pond

1318
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:18,260
fucking Appalachian Mountain comedy.

1319
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:23,760
Y'All ain't welcome around here.
It's a fucking town of red heads.

1320
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:26,660
We don't send none out.
We don't accept none in,

1321
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,400
there's something about it though.
It's a fun place.

1322
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:34,490
Cause cause of the fact that it's so
cold there and it's so fucking miserable

1323
01:16:34,491 --> 01:16:37,310
for five months out of the year,
five nights out of the year you're like,

1324
01:16:37,311 --> 01:16:39,020
what the fuck are we doing living here?

1325
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:43,850
When you walk from your car to your house,
when you shut your car door,

1326
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:44,620
one

1327
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:49,000
to the fucking house, cheat, grueling. And
you get in your house, you're like, fuck,

1328
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:52,910
fuck, fuck. You shut the door and you
stand there for a couple of sentences.

1329
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:56,470
Summers,
you're fucking wet and full of mosquitoes.

1330
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:01,540
There's one day in fucking October where
you kicked through some golden fucking

1331
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:05,830
dead leaves under your feet and it's that
perfect crisp and you go, God, I see.

1332
01:17:05,831 --> 01:17:10,040
I love the change of seasons. No
you don't. No, don't you love that

1333
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,360
fucking one day.

1334
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:14,180
And that's the only one you noticed and
that there were other nice ones you had

1335
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:15,014
to work.

1336
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:21,390
You kidding me? Oh, it's so true. So true.

1337
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:25,650
There's nothing worse than working a
shit job in cold weather. Terrible.

1338
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:30,360
I didn't have to get up early to work
a shit job. Did construction many,

1339
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:31,920
many years.
My Dad was an architect,

1340
01:17:31,921 --> 01:17:34,440
so like throughout high school
when I wanted summer jobs,

1341
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,920
I got jobs on construction sites.
But every now and then, you know,

1342
01:17:37,921 --> 01:17:39,600
I would do something in the winter.
And you know,

1343
01:17:39,601 --> 01:17:41,880
when I graduated I did a
lot of shit in the winter.

1344
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:44,970
You'd go to these fucking houses,
they're framing a building. Look,

1345
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:48,210
somebody wants to their house built
in January. They don't say no.

1346
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:52,200
They just built a house in January and
you were in like 17 layers of pajamas

1347
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:53,190
under your fucking pants.

1348
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,490
You can't move like you're in a space
suit and you're hammering nails.

1349
01:17:56,491 --> 01:17:59,820
It's fucking zero out.
Yeah. I never did that.

1350
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:04,050
It's the worst. It was beautiful.
It was the best thing I ever did.

1351
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:06,810
The smartest thing that I ever
did when I was in high school,

1352
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,970
right when I graduated high
school at the very year,

1353
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,770
me and my friend Jimmy Lawless,

1354
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:13,770
Jimmy got me a job in this construction
site and Jimmy was like a carpenter's

1355
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:14,580
apprentice.

1356
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:19,380
He got me a job as a laborer and I
carried cement bags and pressure treated

1357
01:18:19,381 --> 01:18:22,470
lumber for two weeks. That's
all I did for two weeks. Uh,

1358
01:18:22,471 --> 01:18:24,930
carried cement bags and
pressure treated lumber.

1359
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:27,810
We were building a wheelchair ramp
at a knights of Columbus Hall.

1360
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:32,280
They needed a wheelchair ramp because
some new laws and all I did was that all

1361
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,970
day. And I did nothing. I had
nothing left. At the end of the day,

1362
01:18:35,971 --> 01:18:39,990
I couldn't work out. I couldn't,
I just ate. I couldn't work out,

1363
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:44,010
couldn't work out. Jesus. Not
even in my company like that.

1364
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:47,390
Something that you want to do.
After I was eating,

1365
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,980
that was back when I was fighting.
I was 18 years old.

1366
01:18:49,981 --> 01:18:53,310
I was fighting in tournaments. I had,
I had to train, I had to work out,

1367
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:56,850
so I forced myself to work
out and that taught me what?

1368
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,600
All right. I was going to say, if
you can't work, isn't that a workout?

1369
01:19:00,601 --> 01:19:04,100
If you can't work out, it's
not enough. You win your dudes.

1370
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:07,030
You're trying to kick you in the face.
You've got to do other shit. You gotta.

1371
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:07,903
You gotta make sense.

1372
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:10,410
Get in there with other dudes
trying to kick you in the face.

1373
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:13,990
You get the timing down. You have to, you
have to stay sharp. You can't just say,

1374
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:16,030
well, I don't need to work out.
I'm carrying bags of cement.

1375
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:18,970
Okay. All right. I would
say I hear workout.

1376
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,360
That's you're lifting weights with
the fucking sweatpants on. All right.

1377
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:27,640
Leg warmers. Yeah, but I,
I learned, I learned, fuck,
fuck. Hard work for no reason.

1378
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:30,520
Yeah, no, there's money in
it. I mean, there is a reason,

1379
01:19:30,521 --> 01:19:32,050
you know you're doing
it so you can get that.

1380
01:19:32,051 --> 01:19:34,390
Some people are predisposed
to that, but, and again,

1381
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:38,770
I know that people that do that
don't look at it like the hell.

1382
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:42,130
It's the same as people who
come up to you and say, Oh man,

1383
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:46,120
that's the scariest thing in the world.
What you do talk in front of people.

1384
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,270
I couldn't get up on that stage in
front of people. Well, so scary.

1385
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:53,910
It's not scary to me or I wouldn't
be doing it. Well it's, it's been,

1386
01:19:53,911 --> 01:19:55,360
your job is scary to me.

1387
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:58,930
Fucking selling shoes
for 30 years in the mall.

1388
01:19:58,931 --> 01:20:03,310
Only to have the place fucking go out of
business. Oh, selling crocs and a kiosk.

1389
01:20:05,710 --> 01:20:09,210
What do you do? I'm on the guy in the
mall. I the beat dazzled iPhone covers.

1390
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,870
That's pretty good. I make about
60 grand a year. I'm doing good.

1391
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:17,660
Did you use to sell meat or is
that Depaulo depaulo alright. Paul,

1392
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:21,120
one of you sold meat.
Dorna Var and the Polo or the same group.

1393
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:26,760
Angry white guys from Boston. Well. Yeah.
I said fucking white guy from my age,

1394
01:20:26,761 --> 01:20:30,390
from Boston. You depaulo was one of the
guys that I got a chance to see, uh,

1395
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,253
when I was coming up,

1396
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:34,530
when I was an open mic or he had a few
years and he was like two, three years in.

1397
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:38,740
Who's already really good. He's
one of those guys, Huh? When I,

1398
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:42,240
I went to see him at Caroline's, I
guess it was maybe two years ago. I go,

1399
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:44,760
how the fuck is this guy?
Not Gigantic.

1400
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:48,900
How is this guy not selling out
arenas? He was, but it was the,

1401
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:53,400
it was after Katrina and
then he said, uh, he goes,

1402
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:55,500
a lot more people would've been
rescued if it wasn't for the fucking

1403
01:20:55,501 --> 01:20:58,380
misspellings. I looked at this, this roof,

1404
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:00,630
this guy was trying to get rescued
off his roof. It's said hip on it.

1405
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,000
You want some hep trick that
fucking won in front of you

1406
01:21:06,990 --> 01:21:11,580
fucking howling. Howling. It's a late
night show at Caroline's. And I'm like,

1407
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,600
how is this not an arena?
I mean, I've known this guy
for two decades. How was he?

1408
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:18,600
How was he not one of the most,
you know, famous fucking comments.

1409
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:22,800
He is accessible. He's not just
comics clown. He's accessible.

1410
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:27,420
He's got that angry Boston thing, man.
It's just fucking, nothing funnier to me.

1411
01:21:27,860 --> 01:21:32,310
I know some dudes probably,
it's probably his fucking personality.

1412
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:35,850
People have to realize like, this is like
the fucking thing. Like, oh, like angry.

1413
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:38,280
And I'm like, you know
what? Fuck man. You know,

1414
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:41,090
just live your life with that kind
of hate. That's really bad for you.

1415
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:44,870
It's not real. Hates
fun. Exactly. Yeah. It's,

1416
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:49,770
it's [inaudible] hepatitis
qualify his personality.

1417
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:54,330
You have to understand this industry
is run by people and most of them are

1418
01:21:54,331 --> 01:21:57,420
fucking phony and they know
they're fraudulent. And so a,

1419
01:21:57,421 --> 01:22:02,421
a personality like Nick's is probably
very scary to the people who would put him

1420
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:05,460
in an arena. Yes. And so I think it would,

1421
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:09,840
it's probably his personality is
the reason because people are,

1422
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:14,310
that are afraid that they're going
to be found out as completely.

1423
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,560
Yeah. They don't want to
go like that around. Yeah.

1424
01:22:16,561 --> 01:22:21,000
They don't want to fucking walking mirror.
Nick played my brother on news radio.

1425
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:24,960
Oh, hell yeah. He uh, him and Brian
Cowen and a Epstein from welcome back,

1426
01:22:24,961 --> 01:22:28,320
Kotter brother on an episode of News
Radio where we just beat the fuck out of

1427
01:22:28,321 --> 01:22:31,260
each other. Like people were, you
know, like we were like someone,

1428
01:22:31,261 --> 01:22:34,200
can we cut to a clip of that?
Cause I have to piss desperate.

1429
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:39,930
I think that's why while,
while, while, while Doug goes
to p, Brian, do me a favor,

1430
01:22:39,931 --> 01:22:42,480
before you pee,
pull up Bobby Barnett.

1431
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:47,481
Pull up Doug's bit about Bobby Barnett
because one of my fucking favorite all

1432
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:51,410
time bits is your bit about Bobby Barton.
Just see the,

1433
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,680
that's what I was gonna talk about that.
And she,

1434
01:22:53,681 --> 01:22:57,110
she apparently now this woman from this
bit that we're gonna play is a boy.

1435
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:00,430
If you go to Doug Stam help.com I'm
sure in your archives you can tell your

1436
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:04,530
story. The story is fucking
brilliant. The bit is fantastic.

1437
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:06,220
It's from uh,

1438
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:08,920
keep the edge. Something to take the
edge off. Something take the edge off,

1439
01:23:08,921 --> 01:23:11,530
which is my favorite all time CD of yours.

1440
01:23:11,531 --> 01:23:14,470
Not because of your materials the
best cause it's, they're all pretty,

1441
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:16,450
in my opinion. They're all
equal. They're all great.

1442
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:19,290
But I love the music
behind it, man. I mean, I,

1443
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,940
that was my favorite CD to listen to.
And you,

1444
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:27,380
and that CD you took on this sort
of like a musical quality to your,

1445
01:23:27,381 --> 01:23:31,000
your delivery too, like in sync
with the, with, with the guitar.

1446
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:35,190
Henry Phillips and I used to do that
in la just for stories where like know

1447
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:40,460
anytime I was a full story,
I'd try to have him play with me,

1448
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:44,050
you know, goofy little clubs
around and he was, he was,

1449
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:48,280
he was in Houston when I recorded that
and I had recorded every night and wasn't

1450
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:51,280
happy with any of them. And it's Sunday
and there's only about 60 people.

1451
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:54,880
And I went, you know what? Fuck it. Why
don't we just try it with the entire set,

1452
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,050
not just the stories.
I,

1453
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,820
he had played with the blade to Bobby
Barnett before and uh, you know,

1454
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:03,880
transvestite hooker or whatever. He'd
played behind a few stories, storytelling.

1455
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:08,260
So I just, it was last minute like,
all right, let's just, it's beautiful.

1456
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,180
The set feels like that too.

1457
01:24:10,690 --> 01:24:15,310
It feels like a set where you had already
gotten enough sets in the bag where

1458
01:24:15,311 --> 01:24:17,930
you can be comfortable, you know
when you record something or, yeah,

1459
01:24:17,931 --> 01:24:21,370
it didn't give a fuck. Like tell people
if I'm, if I'm filming something,

1460
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:22,810
one of my film and a film in the special,

1461
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,830
there's an eight and a 10 got a
10 out of 10 I'm going to be like,

1462
01:24:26,831 --> 01:24:27,690
I gotta get this bit out.

1463
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:31,120
I'm going to get that bit out and
getting all technical once 10 minutes in,

1464
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:33,700
I'll be fine. Anyway, don't worry about
the eight. If you've got a babysitter,

1465
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:38,260
18 one one you can make, it'll be pretty,
pretty close, but I'll sit in the words.

1466
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:41,560
But yeah, there's a looseness in when
you know you already have it in the bag,

1467
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:45,370
but you can just go to like tomorrow
night I'm at some place called mortise in

1468
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:48,910
Indianapolis. There's zero
pressure when you perform your do.

1469
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,510
It's not a fucking, and I'm a
feminist, but hey, shut it off dude.

1470
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:56,620
Wait until we do it. But the
um, you know, when you're,

1471
01:24:56,621 --> 01:25:00,520
when you're filming something man, it's
like a weird, it's a weird pressure thing.

1472
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:03,370
You know, like you am, I make sure I
get this right. I only got one shot.

1473
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,890
Like I would never want to do
like Bill Hicks, relentless.

1474
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,770
Like he even said that he wasn't
comfortable in it. If you watch it,

1475
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,720
it's like it's got great material in it,

1476
01:25:10,721 --> 01:25:13,360
but it's definitely not his
best performance and delivery.

1477
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:16,120
It's cause he did it all in one shot.
It was one,

1478
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:19,660
one hour and a half performance ready go.
The cameras are on you.

1479
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:21,310
We're going to film this forever.
Fuck.

1480
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:24,580
It's hard to loosen up and the
crowd is tight cause it's like,

1481
01:25:24,610 --> 01:25:29,140
cause they know to the showtime special,
it's filling that Gotham comedy club,

1482
01:25:29,141 --> 01:25:30,760
which is a tiny club anyway.

1483
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:35,020
And now it's brightly lit with fucking
giant cranes coming over someone's

1484
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:38,290
fucking cocktail tables
though. I love that place. My,

1485
01:25:38,291 --> 01:25:43,020
I've never played there except for
that. When I filmed at, um, uh, the, uh,

1486
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,180
southern theater in Ohio,
when I did a talking monkey's in space,

1487
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:49,150
the guy who was the director of it as a
good friend of mine, Anthony Giordano,

1488
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:49,640
he's the,

1489
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:54,640
he directs the UFC and directs all the
UFC like little satellite programs.

1490
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:58,060
And I, he listened to me, I said, I
don't want any lights in the audience.

1491
01:25:58,061 --> 01:25:59,320
I want it like a regular show.

1492
01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:03,160
Let's just do a regular show
and we capture on camera.
But even then it's hard.

1493
01:26:03,170 --> 01:26:04,060
The first one was

1494
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:06,140
like, it was a little stiff. I felt loose.

1495
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,160
Like I haven't seen it
but scared to watch you.

1496
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,930
I'm scared to watch comedy. Why? Uh,
like I was telling him on the way up,

1497
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:19,010
cause I'm afraid after fucking
this long doing comedy,

1498
01:26:19,011 --> 01:26:23,300
I sit there and I go, have I heard this
before, if I heard this somewhere else,

1499
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:28,340
I've told you I caught myself
stealing my own material where I go,

1500
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:30,530
fuck,
this is funny,

1501
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:35,150
but it just seems so
familiar and I'll fuck it.

1502
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:39,770
I'll do it anyway. And then I like
find it in an old notebook. Oh, hey,

1503
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,170
this isn't fucking knew I wrote this.

1504
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:45,470
He used to do this
exactly seven years ago.

1505
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,780
Yeah.
So like when I do watch comedy at home,

1506
01:26:51,070 --> 01:26:55,700
like I'll make sure I'm sober.
I won't go to sleep with though.

1507
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:58,000
I wouldn't dare like the ideas.
We'll get into your head.

1508
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:02,710
My friend Mike McCarthy did that once.
A friend of mine back in Boston,

1509
01:27:02,711 --> 01:27:05,830
he went to sleep at the Dennis Miller
CD and he woke up with all these new

1510
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:10,320
jokes. But anytime you sleep
with TV, if you, you know,

1511
01:27:10,590 --> 01:27:15,410
your dreams will become
infused with whatever's what?

1512
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,010
To bed to fucking sports center.

1513
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:21,690
All of a sudden I'm being fisted by
a linebacker, but so, you know, I,

1514
01:27:21,710 --> 01:27:25,080
I'm scared of watching
comedy. Aye. Aye. Aye.

1515
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,100
Still enjoy the fuck
out of it. I, you know,

1516
01:27:27,101 --> 01:27:29,650
want the reason why I got into
comedy because I was a fan of comedy.

1517
01:27:29,651 --> 01:27:32,110
I was going to go see you in Irvine
last night, but I was just too lazy.

1518
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:37,570
I couldn't make that the drive from La
to Irvine at like 5:00 PM his death.

1519
01:27:37,571 --> 01:27:42,430
You might as well no fucking
shoes yourself up plan.
Yeah, it's death. But, um,

1520
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:47,730
I still agree with someone.
Like I saw Louis C k recently
at the Improv. I get it.

1521
01:27:47,731 --> 01:27:51,310
I get inspired by comedy.
If I see something that's
really funny, I get inspired.

1522
01:27:51,311 --> 01:27:53,320
It makes me want to write, you
know, it makes me want to go.

1523
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:57,610
Well that's the other thing is on TV,
it's never as good anyway,

1524
01:27:58,100 --> 01:27:59,660
so it's not hard to go,
ah,

1525
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:03,120
I'm not gonna Watch this special cause
it's a special and a special suck.

1526
01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:03,421
Well,

1527
01:28:03,421 --> 01:28:06,870
what I'm hoping is that eventually
everything will be accessible all the time

1528
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:10,320
and there will be no TV and no sets will
be special because everyone will see

1529
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:11,250
every set ever seen.

1530
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:15,330
Everyone will see everything that you
do ever over and over and over the next,

1531
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,860
the next level of technology is not going
to be, you know, something as simple as,

1532
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:22,050
oh here's a newer, faster phone. No,

1533
01:28:22,051 --> 01:28:26,490
it's going to be some super invasive
thing while you're allowed to turn on.

1534
01:28:26,491 --> 01:28:30,030
You're always on Cam and people could
just travel with you everywhere you go.

1535
01:28:30,031 --> 01:28:32,310
And people can watch every
fucking thing you do.

1536
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:34,710
And there's going to be like some
really popular channels where people

1537
01:28:34,711 --> 01:28:38,820
subscribed shows zero privacy,
zero none. Total transparency.

1538
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:42,570
There'll be no need for it. No need for
us. No one has anything to hide. Right.

1539
01:28:42,571 --> 01:28:45,300
Why are we, why do we have privacy
now? I mean you and I really don't,

1540
01:28:45,301 --> 01:28:48,000
you know people who are in the public
eye who talk a lot about their life on

1541
01:28:48,001 --> 01:28:50,280
stage,
you have a fraction of the privacy.

1542
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:54,460
Yeah, I don't, yeah,
short of wiping my ass.

1543
01:28:54,461 --> 01:28:56,190
I'm really fucking, yeah, I don't

1544
01:28:56,290 --> 01:28:59,650
what do you have a good situation or any,
any fucked up situation?

1545
01:28:59,651 --> 01:29:02,010
I don't mean good.
I mean anything where it's juicy,

1546
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:05,380
where's there's a story, don't you
get excited? Like you just said,

1547
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:10,200
like you just got a new puppy. When
I got, when my fucking dad died,

1548
01:29:10,201 --> 01:29:14,520
I was conscious of the fact that
a huge part of me was thinking,

1549
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:19,350
I'm going to get a lot of attention
for this. And what do you do with that?

1550
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:24,350
Like you fucking, you, you're aware
of that part of you that see like,

1551
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:27,780
right, you're right. But
you know other people do it.

1552
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:32,340
You know they fucking milk fucking
tragedy for attention on some level. Well,

1553
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:35,370
you know, I, I can't,
I can't talk right now.

1554
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:39,390
Something really bad happened with
the insurers. You Go, you all right.

1555
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:40,380
But you know,

1556
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:45,000
like I'm at least aware of
the fact that I enjoy the why.

1557
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,880
He used to get excited and when
girlfriends had said go wrong,

1558
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,730
cat died or dog got hit
by a car or something.

1559
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:55,560
Cause I knew we were going to fuck.
You're going to feel bad.

1560
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:57,930
I'm going to console you.
Next thing you know,

1561
01:29:57,931 --> 01:30:00,690
we're going to be getting afraid gone.
Speaking of fucking,

1562
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,580
I fucked a girl named Bobby
by now. Listen, this is one
of my favorite all time.

1563
01:30:05,581 --> 01:30:09,780
Stand up comedy bits. One A, one
of Doug's classics, Bobby Barnett.

1564
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,830
Check it out. Listen and uh, Doug,
we'll be right back in the meantime,

1565
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:16,910
Bobby Bar,
now it's probably the most,

1566
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,640
it just died.
Brian.

1567
01:30:20,430 --> 01:30:21,450
Beautiful woman ever match.

1568
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:25,850
There we go.
Something to take the edge off.

1569
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:29,500
Motivation for the clothes.

1570
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:33,470
What's on the iTunes?

1571
01:30:35,790 --> 01:30:36,623
That's true.

1572
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:41,370
But that kind of beautiful
girl who works retail

1573
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:48,150
beautiful.
If you life have a flash before your eyes,

1574
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:50,950
you'd have to stop at
that part and beat off

1575
01:30:54,390 --> 01:30:58,300
your hand.
Eyes rolled up smiling.

1576
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:08,240
She had short brown hair and big brown
eyes kind of beauty that hurts to look

1577
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:09,391
at.

1578
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:14,340
I met her in this strange bar in
Minneapolis and when I say strange bar,

1579
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:17,850
I mean I didn't know anyone there and
normally I would never have the balls to

1580
01:31:17,851 --> 01:31:21,450
approach a girl in a bar
that I don't know people.

1581
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:26,900
My big approach in of of strange bars
to go Sydney far into the bar all alone

1582
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:30,690
watch sports center.

1583
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:34,890
Like the only reason I'm in a crowded
dance club on ladies night is to watch

1584
01:31:34,891 --> 01:31:38,970
sports book charisma,
no volume and hope seller feel sad.

1585
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:42,030
But that night, I don't know, I was

1586
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:48,750
motivated or just intoxicated and
sometimes what's the difference?

1587
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:55,190
I talked to her and I don't don't know
what bullshit stories. I gave her money.

1588
01:31:56,350 --> 01:32:00,670
I played right into her hand, whatever
she said. I said what she wanted to hear.

1589
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:03,220
She hated long hair.
I was thinking of cutting that

1590
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:09,670
hated cigarettes on is trying
to quit whatever it was at work.

1591
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:14,590
She said tomorrow the twins
are playing the Red Sox,

1592
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:20,320
my team, the red sox. She goes,
why don't we go to the game?

1593
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:24,370
You can stay at my house because
it's right near the stadium,

1594
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,160
not for sex,
just out of convenience.

1595
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:31,720
Just exactly what I'd tell a girl
I was trying to have sex with.

1596
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:37,330
So I show up. We had one more drink
in her house and that led to kissing,

1597
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:39,220
which led to grind it,

1598
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:43,260
which led to some of the most vicious
dry humping I've seen since two behind

1599
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,420
school was like Horno with clothes on.

1600
01:32:46,421 --> 01:32:51,421
It was when it got to a point where I
realize it's not going to go any farther

1601
01:32:51,611 --> 01:32:56,260
than this cause every time I tried to
close the deal I can't. I'm not a slot.

1602
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:59,590
Well I am and I'll show you
how. It's not that hard. Really.

1603
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:05,020
Well I don't even know you.
Whoa. I'll have my agent facts.

1604
01:33:05,021 --> 01:33:08,680
My Bio along please.
It's starting to hurt here.

1605
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:13,780
Finally I gave up like a gentleman.
I rolled over,

1606
01:33:13,781 --> 01:33:17,460
curled up in a warm soft
pillow of my own testicle.

1607
01:33:17,461 --> 01:33:19,930
He went to bed.

1608
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:23,560
The next day we go to the twins game.

1609
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:28,830
Twins and play in the Red Sox is like
1994 three if you want want to look up the

1610
01:33:28,991 --> 01:33:30,970
statistics prove this story's true.

1611
01:33:32,710 --> 01:33:36,970
I'm being an asshole in the stadium cause
I'm already pissed and blue bald and

1612
01:33:36,971 --> 01:33:41,260
I'm a red sox fan so I am trying down,
up and down the bleachers.

1613
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:45,680
I go, Ooh, bad side. Yeah,
you're going to lose. And

1614
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:51,940
I keep doing this for six innings,
still a red sox again,

1615
01:33:51,941 --> 01:33:54,670
the shit kicked out of them.
They are losing that game.

1616
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,280
Five to 100 bottom of the sixth Bobby,

1617
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:01,980
she starts talking shit and so on.

1618
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:04,580
I tried to call her bluff. I say, listen,

1619
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:10,670
red sox lose this game. I will quit
smoking and cut my hair tonight.

1620
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:16,080
Red sox come back and when you turn
lose some of that old plussing girl

1621
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:25,430
somatically than that was stolen.

1622
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,460
I said,

1623
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:34,280
as soon as she fine.

1624
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:39,870
Mo Vaughn came to the plate
right out of the fucking phone.

1625
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:44,910
The Red Sox scored out
11 on answered abroad

1626
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,110
and Bobby Barnett sat in
the bleachers and turn gray.

1627
01:34:55,530 --> 01:35:00,500
She's driving me
silently.

1628
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,220
I turned to her and I said,

1629
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:07,130
so do you think guys an asshole
if I took you up on the bed?

1630
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:09,680
But she saying now,

1631
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:17,180
so would you think as an asshole if I
picked up a homeless guy and told you I

1632
01:35:17,181 --> 01:35:19,700
wanted to donate my winnings to charity?

1633
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:24,770
[inaudible] made good on the bed,

1634
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,680
but it was only

1635
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:40,310
shortly after that she decided she
didn't like the kind of person I was.

1636
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:45,860
I never talked to her again,
but she didn't Welch on the back.

1637
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:54,140
The thing is generally beautiful things

1638
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:57,590
always make me feel kind of empty,

1639
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,260
beautiful sunsets and beautiful mountain
tops because there's none of that you

1640
01:36:03,261 --> 01:36:06,470
can take with you. You can take
all the pictures in the world.

1641
01:36:06,471 --> 01:36:11,450
It never does it justice. You use every
word in your vocabulary to describe.

1642
01:36:11,451 --> 01:36:14,900
It never comes out the same.
You had to be there

1643
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:21,140
watching that beautiful mountain top.
There's always a guy next to you goes,

1644
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:25,310
doesn't it make you feel insignificant?
Yeah.

1645
01:36:25,311 --> 01:36:30,311
It really does have no need
to feel anymore insignificant.

1646
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:35,000
I feel very insignificant
every day I get that.

1647
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:39,530
I go to my hometown bar where all
my friends know my name and I'd feel

1648
01:36:39,531 --> 01:36:42,980
significant.
I don't need anything less,

1649
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:49,520
but a beautiful woman is different
cause a beautiful woman might fuck you.

1650
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:53,300
I went to a beautiful woman fucks you.

1651
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,300
It's like she's giving
you part of that beauty.

1652
01:36:56,330 --> 01:37:01,330
It's like she's giving you part of
our soul and that is yours forever.

1653
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:06,560
It doesn't ever go away.
You're beautiful mountain tops.

1654
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:09,020
We'll one may crumble to this.
See,

1655
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:14,260
your beautiful sunset might never rise
again by you thought would be Bobby

1656
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:19,160
Barnett. Yes you did.
You fucked me. Awesome.

1657
01:37:19,310 --> 01:37:24,310
Repo man with a thousand tow
trucks can never take that back.

1658
01:37:24,561 --> 01:37:29,561
[inaudible]

1659
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:35,190
I don't know if I just shut your shit off.
I hit a button on your thing.

1660
01:37:35,191 --> 01:37:37,410
Your gadget.
The kids want to get high.

1661
01:37:37,411 --> 01:37:42,160
They're just scrambling back
to the microphones now and
uh, ladies and gentlemen,

1662
01:37:42,161 --> 01:37:47,161
eyes talking with the Joe Rogan
and a turtle from entourage.

1663
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:52,590
We're discussing comedy bootcamp.
Oh yeah.

1664
01:37:52,591 --> 01:37:57,450
Comedy fucking bootcamp. [inaudible]
name's Chris. I'll feel folks in,

1665
01:37:57,451 --> 01:38:00,900
if you go to Doug shine help Stan,
hope.com. Doug Stan hope.com.

1666
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:05,940
I think that's one archive back one
archive doctors or a story about comedy

1667
01:38:05,941 --> 01:38:09,390
bootcamp. There's been a new trend
in the comedy community as of late.

1668
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:12,300
Is it comedy bootcamp.com?
Is that what it is? Yeah.

1669
01:38:12,301 --> 01:38:15,840
I'm not even sure their website,
but they have comedy training classes.

1670
01:38:15,841 --> 01:38:20,220
And you disagreed strongly
on the premise and practice.

1671
01:38:20,710 --> 01:38:23,750
Yeah, no, I, I think as a,

1672
01:38:23,751 --> 01:38:27,520
as a community comics all agree
that classes are bullshit.

1673
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:32,010
Unless they have to go teach them,
then they go, well, no. Yeah.

1674
01:38:32,011 --> 01:38:36,580
It's not all bullshit. Right. So yeah,

1675
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:39,040
there's this Guy Kyle cease,
uh,

1676
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:44,070
started a pretty hardcore like traveling.

1677
01:38:44,230 --> 01:38:46,390
He got Louie Anderson on the,
uh,

1678
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:50,710
on the ticket as Kyle and Louie
are going to travel. Yeah.

1679
01:38:50,711 --> 01:38:54,430
They go town to town.
The way they'll take an Improv for,

1680
01:38:54,431 --> 01:38:57,040
they'll get 80% of the door,
uh,

1681
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:00,490
and th th th and teach these comedy,

1682
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:02,710
you have to really read the fucking thing.

1683
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:05,560
So the comics get on stage, so
let's, let me get this straight.

1684
01:39:05,680 --> 01:39:09,310
So if they do this comedy class and they
go around the world around the country,

1685
01:39:09,311 --> 01:39:11,380
rather say if they show up the Improv and

1686
01:39:11,690 --> 01:39:15,770
yeah, Florida West Palm, it's
a comedy all day intensive,

1687
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:17,060
one day,

1688
01:39:17,061 --> 01:39:21,500
October 8th that the fucking
Fort Lauderdale funny market.

1689
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:24,780
So there's a hundred people in the class
and they all have to pay how much money

1690
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:29,320
between $403,000
depending on which course.

1691
01:39:29,321 --> 01:39:31,510
The one day course is only 400 bucks.

1692
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:37,640
A three day intensive master's stand
up is like 3000 but either way it's all

1693
01:39:38,561 --> 01:39:43,100
fucking nonsense. And this I, I,

1694
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:47,620
I've gotten emails from the guy, let's
just assume you've read the fucking thing.

1695
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:48,663
If not,

1696
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:51,810
go to it.
Go to [inaudible] dot com and yeah,

1697
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:56,440
pause this and because it's way too
much to get it in your car. Tough Shit.

1698
01:39:56,441 --> 01:39:58,970
Just you're going to have to do
the math if you're not a comic,

1699
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:02,490
you don't want to hear all the
fucking discourse anyway. It's really,

1700
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:06,420
it's an inside kind of thing.
But the fact that it's scumbag,

1701
01:40:06,421 --> 01:40:08,970
hurry to tell someone,
oh yeah,

1702
01:40:08,971 --> 01:40:12,990
I can make you a fucking master stand
up and fucking three short days.

1703
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:18,850
He, they really called him master
stand up mastery is the $3,000 course.

1704
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:21,860
That's strong words. Yeah. Yeah. Mastery.

1705
01:40:22,250 --> 01:40:26,330
You're going to be a master of
this 10 years, right. I mean,

1706
01:40:26,331 --> 01:40:29,780
I barely think I know what I'm doing
now and I'm 22 years in, you know,

1707
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:34,070
but I know I saw declining it.
If I had a fucking time machine,

1708
01:40:34,250 --> 01:40:37,880
I definitely wouldn't recommend you going
back in time any earlier than 10 years

1709
01:40:37,881 --> 01:40:41,810
into my camp comedy career, right. Camera.
I can't recommend any of those shows.

1710
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:44,330
Pre 1999 he says you're on your own.

1711
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:47,510
You want to go see it just for fucking
a point of reference to realize that

1712
01:40:47,511 --> 01:40:50,690
someone can suck really hard and
come back from that strong. Right.

1713
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,860
But I don't recommend those
shows. But, uh, so, so

1714
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,930
yeah,
you read the fucking thing

1715
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:58,800
so you don't, you don't think
that there's any way that there's,

1716
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:02,970
there's a benefit of having some sort
of a class to teach people standing.

1717
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:07,680
You can take it, you can get all that
advice for free. That was my major beats.

1718
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:09,790
Anything they will teach you in a class,

1719
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:14,791
any comic is glad to tell you for free
or just at the fucking bar at the Improv

1720
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:19,030
or just get a job at the out at the bar,
the old school way to do it. I agree.

1721
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:20,110
That is the old school way to do it.

1722
01:41:20,111 --> 01:41:22,880
But you're still not going to
learn until you do it. Yes.

1723
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:26,710
I want to teach you how to be like you
are. Cause comics aren't like actors.

1724
01:41:26,711 --> 01:41:31,570
We're not all going for the same part. We
have to be different. So to take advice,

1725
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:34,480
you're only telling someone
how to be more like you.

1726
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:38,260
Joe and I did attack Kyle cease
brutally because that's my,

1727
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:42,340
the fashion of my comedy where I'm
saying that his family should die.

1728
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:45,430
Something like that.
It's always us.

1729
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:49,480
It's always just to give a little flavor
to the update doesn't really mean that

1730
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:52,120
I don't want your family to die,
Kyle cease.

1731
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:57,280
But I think what you're doing is
negligent, irresponsible and uh, dishonor.

1732
01:41:57,460 --> 01:41:58,410
But you,
you

1733
01:41:58,580 --> 01:42:01,670
get so upset about it because it's,
I mean,

1734
01:42:01,671 --> 01:42:05,750
in terms of like negligent
or irresponsible shit that
the rest of the world sees,

1735
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:08,090
it's really fairly mild. Oh, course.

1736
01:42:08,091 --> 01:42:11,180
You'd just get upset about this one
particular subject because it's something

1737
01:42:11,181 --> 01:42:11,770
that you love

1738
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:12,710
because I'm calling,

1739
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:15,910
it's something that I know and it's
something I can make a difference.

1740
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:21,070
I can yell about fucking
government invasion of civil
liberties all day and it's

1741
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:23,170
not going to do a fucking
dicks were the difference.

1742
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:27,970
But I could say Kyle sees is a fucking
fraud and it might save you between

1743
01:42:27,971 --> 01:42:29,770
403,000 oaks.

1744
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:31,880
No,
maybe it's not a bad idea to get both.

1745
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:36,900
Maybe it's not a bad idea for someone to
go to one of these comedy bootcamps and

1746
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:38,120
you know,
just get turned out.

1747
01:42:38,121 --> 01:42:40,880
Look when I didn't know if I was
going to do comedy, you know,

1748
01:42:40,881 --> 01:42:42,950
I had been talked into doing
it by some friends of mine.

1749
01:42:42,951 --> 01:42:46,310
I just went to an open mic night.
I didn't know shit that open Mike night.

1750
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:50,810
If I had $3,000, you know, easily could
have been, you know, some comedy bootcamp.

1751
01:42:50,811 --> 01:42:52,560
Well fuck it, I'm going to
try it out. Like, you know,

1752
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:54,380
when there's 1920 year old kids are,

1753
01:42:54,381 --> 01:42:57,800
they're young and they have no experience
and it's not a bad thing to just get

1754
01:42:57,801 --> 01:43:01,370
somehow and other introduced to it.
And then once you get introduced to,

1755
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:02,900
you immerse yourself in standup comedy,

1756
01:43:02,901 --> 01:43:05,420
he started listening to a bunch of it
and watching a bunch of youtube clips.

1757
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,890
Then you read your story on it and listen
to you talk about it and go, oh, okay,

1758
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:12,140
this guy doesn't know what
the fuck he's talking about.

1759
01:43:12,141 --> 01:43:14,150
And he just knows what the fuck
he's talking about for him.

1760
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:18,180
Right, exactly. And
uh, I'll give you this,

1761
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:23,181
that it might act as a catalyst to make
you become committed and have always

1762
01:43:23,941 --> 01:43:28,510
thought about him doing some momentum.
Yeah. And so, you know, now it's like, uh,

1763
01:43:28,650 --> 01:43:32,730
hypnotism to stop smoking.
It doesn't fucking work.

1764
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:37,260
You're not hypnotized.
But the fact that you just laid out $250,

1765
01:43:37,261 --> 01:43:41,580
I'm going to tell you hypnotize for 30
minutes might make you not smoke just

1766
01:43:41,581 --> 01:43:45,150
cause you don't want to feel like a
Douche bag. So if it has that effect,

1767
01:43:45,151 --> 01:43:48,480
but what you're doing is you're,
you're gliding the market.

1768
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:53,060
He talks about how he's got all these
comics now and they're working together in

1769
01:43:53,061 --> 01:43:57,440
these communities and they having writer's
clubs together, what you're doing,

1770
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:00,560
you're,
you're saying everyone's innately funny,

1771
01:44:00,561 --> 01:44:03,230
which is so horribly untrue.

1772
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:08,210
And what you're doing is giving them
perseverance to keep fucking bothering

1773
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:12,860
bookers and bothering promoters and
clogging up open Mike nights with shitty

1774
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:17,420
comedy because you told them
don't quit. Keep trying. I agree.

1775
01:44:17,421 --> 01:44:21,920
You're not fucking funny it whatsoever.
But out of those, like you're,

1776
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:23,890
you're speaking to the
worst case scenarios.

1777
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:25,610
So if there's a hundred
people that take his course,

1778
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:28,970
there might be one or two that sneaks
through the fucking salmon ladder.

1779
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:33,230
They would actually, anyway,
they might, they might anyway.

1780
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,350
And they might in spite of, but he
might have introduced them to the game.

1781
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:38,300
He might've gotten them inspired.

1782
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,390
A lot of girls are in
porn cause they got raped.

1783
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:46,040
I see your point. When I was starting
out in comedy, there was a guy,

1784
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:50,360
I don't want to say his name because he's
a nice guy. He just sucks. And he uh, he,

1785
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:53,510
one time he was hosting an open mic night
and he came up to me and he was like,

1786
01:44:53,511 --> 01:44:57,050
listen, I'm going to tell you right
now, okay, you want to be a comic,

1787
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:00,930
you got to stop swearing. He goes,
you're always swearing. You swear.

1788
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:04,760
Well you don't have a punchline. You swear
to make it funnier. And I'm like, well,

1789
01:45:04,761 --> 01:45:08,750
you know, the guys who I liked were really
funny. Like Sam Kinison and dice clay,

1790
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:11,480
you're not die clay. Okay,
you're not dice clay.

1791
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,370
And he told me about this one joke he had.

1792
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:15,920
I can't say the joke because
then everybody in Boston
would know who the fuck

1793
01:45:15,921 --> 01:45:19,700
I'm talking about. And I don't
know guys, his life sucks.

1794
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:20,600
I don't want to shit on them.

1795
01:45:21,050 --> 01:45:26,050
But the idea was that he took this word
fuck out of one of his jokes and it made

1796
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:30,230
it, he had to focus more on his timing and
I don't always like, that's ridiculous.

1797
01:45:30,231 --> 01:45:32,060
You're joke sucks.
This is a fucking,

1798
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:35,150
you're telling me how to do you and
I'm even think you're good. You know,

1799
01:45:35,151 --> 01:45:37,040
it's like you fuck.
You know.

1800
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:41,600
It's like people will try to
get you to follow their pattern.

1801
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:44,630
You can't do that.
There's no way you can get,

1802
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,780
you can tell someone how to do comedy,
but,

1803
01:45:46,890 --> 01:45:48,130
well,
hang on then I'm going to,

1804
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,270
because we're talking
specifically about Kyle sees,

1805
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:54,290
I don't know anything about that deal.
I should just say this.

1806
01:45:54,300 --> 01:45:56,820
I know what I've seen the clips of this.

1807
01:45:56,821 --> 01:46:01,320
It's like Anthony Robbins
fucking Scientology.

1808
01:46:01,321 --> 01:46:06,120
Believe in yourself. Find your inner
voice. They don't, and that's the thing.

1809
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:10,920
Every fucking comedy. What's the
guy that got in my face at Montreal?

1810
01:46:10,921 --> 01:46:13,890
The fucking industry guys.
Step Up. Your stand up.

1811
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:18,510
The guy looks like he's wearing the
fake glasses. The nose, but he's not.

1812
01:46:18,511 --> 01:46:21,630
That's Jeff singer. I don't know
who that is. Jeff Singer. He's,

1813
01:46:21,631 --> 01:46:25,710
I guess some industry guy and he got
in my face cause I mentioned him in the

1814
01:46:25,711 --> 01:46:29,670
update going, I don't do what he does.
He's like, you got your face. Yeah,

1815
01:46:29,671 --> 01:46:34,530
he was saying that Kyle sees his shit.
You don't understand. I'm not like him.

1816
01:46:34,531 --> 01:46:37,050
Why would you put write that about me?
Yeah.

1817
01:46:37,051 --> 01:46:40,460
As I'm fucking awful night at
the fucking Delta borrower,

1818
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:43,740
whatever dealt in Montreal,
it's not the delta anymore.

1819
01:46:43,741 --> 01:46:48,030
They moved hotels but it's the same
scene drunk and the guys like fuck you.

1820
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:52,440
Like Hey, I don't agree
with point is Kyle's, Oh I,

1821
01:46:52,441 --> 01:46:55,350
we don't tell people how to write jokes.
You can't teach that.

1822
01:46:55,351 --> 01:46:59,190
But what we do is we motivate them and
make them believe and find their own

1823
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:04,080
voice. You're still full of shit. They
are full of Shit. They definitely,

1824
01:47:04,110 --> 01:47:07,010
and I want to address this because
one of the beefs that I've,

1825
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:12,020
a few beefs that I've gotten from it
is why did you attack him and not Louie

1826
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:17,520
Anderson? Why we just got a little
guy scared. Yeah. Scared. Well,

1827
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:21,840
that's the thing is, and I
sat there, why? First of all,

1828
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:27,060
as I was talking to Hannah, give my
manager and he said, no. He goes,

1829
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:28,380
well,
uh,

1830
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:33,210
Louie Anderson wouldn't be doing
this if it weren't for Kyle seat.

1831
01:47:36,690 --> 01:47:38,820
Kyle sees fucking hell.
Yeah.

1832
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:43,680
He got the guy on and Louie
Anderson is such such a feeble guy.

1833
01:47:43,681 --> 01:47:47,130
You don't ever look at him as
someone you have to take down.

1834
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:51,300
Kyle ceases the one
promoting this fucking hokey.

1835
01:47:51,301 --> 01:47:54,870
The secret I met Kyle cease to the Improv.
You seem like a nice guy.

1836
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:56,120
That's literally all I know about.

1837
01:47:56,140 --> 01:48:01,140
No fucking he'd send me
emails and he's fucking tears.

1838
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:05,550
You're one of my heroes. Like you're
not the same fucking washing on me.

1839
01:48:05,880 --> 01:48:08,430
I lost into your fucking podcast.
But Jimmy Dore,

1840
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:12,630
every comic that whose name came
up was one of your favorites. Oh,

1841
01:48:12,631 --> 01:48:15,870
it's one of those guys. Yeah, he's one of
those, you know, it's funny as hell. No,

1842
01:48:15,930 --> 01:48:18,390
look, I can't fault the guy
for not being snow. There's,

1843
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:22,530
and there's a lot of things he says
that I think you're a fucking fact.

1844
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:26,670
The majority of what he says.
I think is good advice.

1845
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:30,600
I don't think it's bad to get more people
interested in doing standup because I

1846
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:33,570
think just with sheer numbers, I mean
there's going to be a bunch that suck,

1847
01:48:33,571 --> 01:48:38,270
but there'll also be more, but they're
using it as a scan will be problem.

1848
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:40,650
Like I just started doing a see the point,

1849
01:48:40,651 --> 01:48:43,530
but I don't think you
need to be compensated.

1850
01:48:43,531 --> 01:48:46,230
If you're going to spend three fucking
days talking to some open makers and it's

1851
01:48:46,231 --> 01:48:50,070
going to have to be some, a long cash song
taller. Here's a, here's a crazy fucks.

1852
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:51,230
This is what new comedy,

1853
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:56,460
this is what it really solidified the
fact that this guy is a fucking okay

1854
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,980
Connie.

1855
01:48:56,980 --> 01:49:01,980
He emails me and he's breaking down how
he's losing money and he gives me actual

1856
01:49:02,701 --> 01:49:05,890
numbers where he says we averaged 30,
uh,

1857
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:09,060
30 people per class and if you know,

1858
01:49:09,061 --> 01:49:12,120
and then it's $400 times 30,

1859
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,460
that's $12,000 and he says,
and will,

1860
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:20,370
and most of that goes to
airfare, hotel, et cetera.

1861
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:25,260
Wait, hang on. You and
Louie Anderson teach class.

1862
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,920
You make $12,000 in a day
and you're losing money,

1863
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:35,520
you of all people should not
be teaching anything, right?

1864
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,780
How many hotel rooms do you
get for you and Louie Anderson?

1865
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:45,060
You're making $12,000 a day.

1866
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:48,430
What's the et Cetera?
Cause airfare.

1867
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:53,460
That's about 800 bucks for the two years
hotel at a nice place down 400 goddamn

1868
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,920
fascinating reality show.

1869
01:49:56,921 --> 01:50:00,100
Feel free to steal this idea because
I'm lazy and I won't produce it,

1870
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:05,010
but comedy camp.com traveling,
doing some sort of a like grizzly man.

1871
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:07,570
You ever watch grizzly man where
it's unintentionally funny?

1872
01:50:07,990 --> 01:50:10,540
The Guy Werner Herzog had to
know that guy was hilarious.

1873
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:12,490
He had hadn't know what he's putting
together. It's going to be hilarious.

1874
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,421
He couldn't admit it,

1875
01:50:13,421 --> 01:50:16,720
but he had it know there could
be one of the most beautiful,

1876
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:20,380
Beautiful Cohen brothers
ask reality shows ever.

1877
01:50:20,440 --> 01:50:23,890
Louie Anderson and Kyle sees on the
road teaching this funky comedy class

1878
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,490
meeting with these crazy open
miker is all over the country.

1879
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:31,610
It's crazy. Standup comedy is
actually kind of getting into a scam.

1880
01:50:31,611 --> 01:50:33,880
I don't know if if there's
no money into it or not.

1881
01:50:33,881 --> 01:50:37,470
Cause I've been doing it lately and
I'm watching these little open mic,

1882
01:50:37,471 --> 01:50:42,020
hers get attacked. But like sales,
like TV salesmen type ways like, hey,

1883
01:50:42,021 --> 01:50:45,780
here's the deal. So I run the show at
the comedy store, belly room, all right,

1884
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:50,000
you give me $100 I'll give you a 20
tickets to give to all your friends.

1885
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:52,900
Now you can charge your friends
these tickets, money or whatever you,

1886
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:53,780
so you're going to make money,

1887
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,780
but I'm going to be five
minutes and I'm watching this.

1888
01:50:56,781 --> 01:50:57,740
You know that's how they do.

1889
01:50:57,770 --> 01:51:01,220
That's how they pay fighters and like
low level organizations that give them

1890
01:51:01,221 --> 01:51:04,040
tickets. Right? Right. But,
but the problem is is that a,

1891
01:51:04,041 --> 01:51:07,370
the belly room is free to get in. So
these tickets make no sense at all. Right.

1892
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:09,620
You know, and so, and so this girl,

1893
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:12,110
she's like always framed the belly
room for the most part. But here's,

1894
01:51:12,111 --> 01:51:14,240
here's the thing. This girl's
only been doing comedy six months.

1895
01:51:14,241 --> 01:51:16,880
The guy that even came up to her and
said, hey, you had a great set tonight.

1896
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:20,390
I was watching this dude cause like my
other friend Jordan said the same thing

1897
01:51:20,391 --> 01:51:22,520
happen to him last time he
was just praying and he's,

1898
01:51:22,521 --> 01:51:23,750
he wasn't even watching her.

1899
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:27,500
He came up there and did this whole sales
pitch and like, like, like oh you know,

1900
01:51:27,501 --> 01:51:28,334
it's 20 tickets,

1901
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:30,850
stuff like that.
And I feel bad for that.

1902
01:51:30,851 --> 01:51:34,860
But I also feel like that's kind
of funny cause it's all so yeah,

1903
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:39,380
it's kind of the fucking ominously
I think less than zero, you know,

1904
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:40,300
con artistry.

1905
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:45,230
And that might be why I get upset at
something so fucking simple as a standup

1906
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:50,050
comedy class, which really has on the
fucking grand scale makes no difference.

1907
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:50,973
It's just,

1908
01:51:51,370 --> 01:51:56,370
but I think fraud is the most undervalued
art form con artistry is called,

1909
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:02,050
it's called con art for a reason.
It's fucking art. If it's done well,

1910
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:07,320
there's nothing more beautiful
than hearing about a very
inventive scam rift and

1911
01:52:07,901 --> 01:52:12,140
comedy preying on like these little
kids that are set in a comic.

1912
01:52:12,530 --> 01:52:13,450
But wait a minute man.

1913
01:52:13,451 --> 01:52:16,630
You were one of those at one point in
time and I was one of those at one point

1914
01:52:16,631 --> 01:52:17,890
in time when I was 21 years old.

1915
01:52:17,890 --> 01:52:21,120
You could have easily talked me into
doing some fucking comedy course. Right.

1916
01:52:21,130 --> 01:52:23,740
I would have saved up my money.
I don't take acting course.

1917
01:52:23,741 --> 01:52:27,340
I was completely ripped off when I
was 18 I had a bad acting teacher.

1918
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,710
That was an earn while you learn program,

1919
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,110
they're going to get you
gigs while they fucking,

1920
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:35,080
you paid them to go weekly but we'll,
we'll get you working.

1921
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:38,680
Get yet to casting agents. They
do that with models too, right?

1922
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:43,750
[inaudible] how is it classic took the
train to La as soon as I was 18 with 400

1923
01:52:43,751 --> 01:52:46,250
bucks in my pocket,
I get off the at union station

1924
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,610
and I'm going to be an actor. What? It
didn't work out when I was in Boston.

1925
01:52:49,611 --> 01:52:53,600
Every girl you had a model in photo number
one girls what used to go to modeling

1926
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,370
Casablanca.
Yeah.

1927
01:52:55,371 --> 01:52:58,490
And they would take the photo with the
girl that's standing like this and like

1928
01:52:58,610 --> 01:53:03,260
her hair blowing in the wind and the
poses. They would spend all this money.

1929
01:53:03,261 --> 01:53:07,190
It was basically a huge scam when they
would just get these girls to spend a

1930
01:53:07,191 --> 01:53:10,550
fuckload of money on getting their photos
taken and then they get their photos

1931
01:53:10,551 --> 01:53:13,380
taken with this guy's logo at the bottom
of it and they would send it out and

1932
01:53:13,381 --> 01:53:14,330
nothing would ever happen.

1933
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:16,910
But it was like these girls like
camp and doing some modeling.

1934
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:20,090
I mean slink out some new shots.

1935
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:26,550
It's a mildly, every fucking
God damn was models. Crazy.

1936
01:53:26,551 --> 01:53:29,370
Bitches aren't even that good.
Tell your friends,

1937
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:38,160
I can't even say early in
the night he was drunk.

1938
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:41,330
She was drunk and I was just trying to
avoid her. I was trying to avoid her.

1939
01:53:41,331 --> 01:53:43,160
I was just trying to avoid
her and she goes to me,

1940
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,110
you think you're off fear factor.

1941
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:51,940
He's young.

1942
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:55,870
My face with this fucking thing
in the fingers moving. He think

1943
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:03,470
like those girls get sloppy drunk
every weekend. Those are trends.

1944
01:54:03,500 --> 01:54:07,180
They know what the fuck they're
doing is fucking just milky,

1945
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:11,210
awful bleach in and

1946
01:54:13,010 --> 01:54:14,690
shaved pussies wiring,

1947
01:54:14,691 --> 01:54:18,410
cigarette breath and
fucking dirty ass holes.

1948
01:54:19,190 --> 01:54:24,190
Still Lou Fain titties black fucking
shearer socks and make your feet sweat and

1949
01:54:25,601 --> 01:54:26,780
it's smelling shit

1950
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:30,980
tube top and belly hair,

1951
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:40,280
blue eyeshadow thrown up in the Tori.

1952
01:54:40,460 --> 01:54:41,690
Don't leave.

1953
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,750
Don't leave

1954
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:55,700
you fucking as though I,
oh

1955
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:02,240
my God.
Can you imagine having a,

1956
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:07,630
if I ran into half the chicks I boned
as a teenager now cause they were pigs

1957
01:55:07,821 --> 01:55:12,110
then. Oh Man, I see him now at our age.

1958
01:55:12,700 --> 01:55:14,980
Oh I went and found my,

1959
01:55:15,250 --> 01:55:19,480
my original high school girlfriend on
Facebook and I opened up her thing and

1960
01:55:19,481 --> 01:55:22,990
said send her a message and I went like
that with my fingers and I hovered over

1961
01:55:22,991 --> 01:55:26,440
the keyboard and I wanted to apologize.
I want to apologize for being me.

1962
01:55:26,590 --> 01:55:31,240
I want to apologize for being 14 I
wanted to apologize for the whole fucking

1963
01:55:31,241 --> 01:55:34,420
thing. I mean here, but you know
this is, this is the first one.

1964
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:36,940
This is the first one. And I
looked at it and I'm like, okay,

1965
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:41,190
let's shut this thing off. Close the
window. Like what are we going to do?

1966
01:55:41,191 --> 01:55:42,210
I'm 43 years old.

1967
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:45,030
I'm going to apologize for being a
Douche bag when I was 16 you're a con.

1968
01:55:45,031 --> 01:55:48,180
Too stupid. It wasn't going to
be this. You got the fucking fat.

1969
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:52,950
Fuck you when you move to fucking
western Massachusetts. I went there once,

1970
01:55:52,951 --> 01:55:55,410
I drove an hour and a half. You didn't
even fuck me because you're mad at me.

1971
01:55:55,790 --> 01:56:00,420
Shit. I just had that show it did I tell
you what to do? This either fucking act,

1972
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:04,200
no, I'm done. I write it down. Somebody
wrote something down. I had this x

1973
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,290
chap me on Facebook and was like,
Hey,

1974
01:56:06,291 --> 01:56:09,920
I have something very important
to tell you like, and I'm
like, what's, what is it?

1975
01:56:09,921 --> 01:56:12,290
And I'm like, no, I need to talk to you
in person. I can't do this over chat.

1976
01:56:12,291 --> 01:56:15,380
And this is from like 12 years ago or
something like that. So I'm like thinking,

1977
01:56:15,381 --> 01:56:16,520
all right,
it's one of three things.

1978
01:56:16,521 --> 01:56:20,240
They either have a child or I
have aids or she found Jesus.

1979
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:22,400
It's like one of the three
things I'm going to wear face.

1980
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:24,500
I'm going to your Facebook.
And I'm like, all right,

1981
01:56:24,501 --> 01:56:27,110
these kids look kind of retarded.
It might be mine. I don't know.

1982
01:56:27,111 --> 01:56:29,390
They kind of look,
that kid looks a little Asian or whatever.

1983
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:31,220
So she calls me up and she goes,
Hey,

1984
01:56:31,221 --> 01:56:33,620
I just want you to know something
that you remember that abortion,

1985
01:56:33,621 --> 01:56:36,560
you paid for it and like, yeah, and
she goes, I just need money for heroin.

1986
01:56:36,561 --> 01:56:39,280
I started doing heroin after we broke
up and I really needed money, so I made,

1987
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:41,860
I said this whole thing
that I was pregnant and I,

1988
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:44,070
oh, I thought you said, you told me.

1989
01:56:44,071 --> 01:56:46,930
She said she was pregnant with another
guy and it wasn't actually, she said

1990
01:56:47,020 --> 01:56:49,240
she was pregnant with her
new heroin friend guy,

1991
01:56:49,241 --> 01:56:50,830
but they spent so much money on heroin,

1992
01:56:50,831 --> 01:56:54,400
they needed money and I gave her
like $500 it wasn't like regular like

1993
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:56,700
did you ever see the money back hunt?
No.

1994
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:02,550
High dollar seven 50 and suck my Dick
Dude. I said, dude, like interest.

1995
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:07,160
Yeah. You should at least get an
extra 250 bucks in a blow job. It was,

1996
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:11,960
it was crazy cause I sold my Carolyn.
Hey, and then she's off on her tits rot.

1997
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:16,650
That's why a little of my comic books,
I forgot Coles and shoot loads. Why?

1998
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:18,170
I sold my comic books.

1999
01:57:18,171 --> 01:57:21,200
I forgot I sold my whole comic book
collection to pay for this abortion. Okay,

2000
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:25,260
well now she's a fuck. She has ruined
your iron man collection. Spider.

2001
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:28,820
What was your favorite comment?
That one has that story. Yeah.

2002
01:57:28,821 --> 01:57:32,990
I sold my comic books paper and,
Oh boy. Yeah, that's your story.

2003
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:34,910
It wasn't even a boy.
So if it's for heroin,

2004
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:40,790
anyone who's dealing with anyone who needs
an abortion or heroin should not have

2005
01:57:40,791 --> 01:57:41,630
comic ducks.

2006
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:48,300
You shoot a minimal fucking survival
kit like les Stroud around Ranch House.

2007
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:53,390
You just shit to keep your water clean
and a knife to fend them off. Check this,

2008
01:57:53,391 --> 01:57:56,030
check this out.
As I was in play a del Rey fucking trade,

2009
01:57:56,031 --> 01:58:01,010
my baseball cards kept my
fucking girlfriend a new liver.

2010
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:05,980
I was in Playa del Rey and I was,
I was after the bar closed,

2011
01:58:05,981 --> 01:58:08,830
it was that that bar we were talking
about was like 30 people fit in this bar.

2012
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:10,480
And it's just like for locals only,
it's,

2013
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:13,660
the school board has been there since the
19 hundreds so anyways, after the bar,

2014
01:58:13,690 --> 01:58:14,500
we're hanging out in this way.

2015
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:19,100
Old Lady 110 years ago. No. So,

2016
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:21,580
so there's hundreds, 10
years ago, the old lady,

2017
01:58:21,581 --> 01:58:23,610
this old lady comes up to me and grabs me

2018
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:25,690
by the sweatshirt and she goes,
I see your necklace,

2019
01:58:25,691 --> 01:58:27,490
you wear that because it protects you.
And I'm like,

2020
01:58:27,491 --> 01:58:28,510
what the fuck you're talking about?

2021
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:30,450
Oh this is the story you were telling me.

2022
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,480
I would advise you before
you go into the story.

2023
01:58:32,490 --> 01:58:37,440
This is all led to not really say it.
I gotta tell Ya. I gotta tell you,

2024
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:40,950
this is a person who is in the public
guy who got a little fucked up but a

2025
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:42,400
little drunk and made some mistakes.

2026
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:46,300
And I'm just saying if you were in the
same situation and you did the same

2027
01:58:46,301 --> 01:58:49,290
situation to a person younger than never,

2028
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:52,560
grab a person and let them lead
you. You get, she was doing it.

2029
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,020
We all get fucked up and
we're not ourselves. Okay.

2030
01:58:56,021 --> 01:58:58,660
That's the reality of the situation.
The right mixture.

2031
01:58:58,661 --> 01:59:01,150
We'll a little bit of crystal math,
a little bit of Jack Daniels.

2032
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:03,990
You can make some mistakes. I want to
say it, but Nancy Cartwright tried to,

2033
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:06,160
oh,

2034
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:09,760
I don't know who that Nancy Cartwright's
the voice of Bart Simpson and she tried

2035
01:59:09,761 --> 01:59:13,390
to rape me. Oh, that sound
to tell that story. Hi folks.

2036
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:17,950
I try so hard to save his Karma.
I should just say this right now,

2037
01:59:17,951 --> 01:59:22,450
Brian, right now. Can you queue up prince?
I got a broken heart again. Cue this up.

2038
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:26,170
We have to talk. We have to talk.
Brian, Brian's in a situation.

2039
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:29,620
You could just look up prince. I
got a broken heart again. Okay.

2040
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:33,430
You got your phone on. Okay. Brian
is a great guy. He's, I know.

2041
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:37,360
He's a good friend. He's one of the
most interesting people I've ever met.

2042
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:41,350
In my life. I would tries to fuck him
though. So if someone pays his child,

2043
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:44,740
fuck you. It's a good story for
him. It's a good story for him,

2044
01:59:44,770 --> 01:59:46,560
but he's right now

2045
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:53,680
vulnerable place. Eat my shorts.
I would eat her short. Brian,

2046
01:59:53,681 --> 01:59:57,190
if Brian was on top of the world
like he was just a month ago,

2047
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:02,650
just a month, just a month
ago. Can we talk about how
on top of the world you are,

2048
02:00:02,830 --> 02:00:06,160
do you want me to use euphemisms? Let's
just say this. Okay. Let's just say this.

2049
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:11,680
Pretend. Let's just pretend that
a salmon's a song called again.

2050
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:14,830
Huh? What does the song prince
got? A broken heart again.

2051
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:17,170
Let's pretend that there's,
there's,

2052
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:19,690
there's a man and on the
one to 10 he's a three.

2053
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:23,340
I mean he said it's a fucking witty three.
He's an interesting three.

2054
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,660
Call me a three. I'm just
making up stories, dude.

2055
02:00:25,990 --> 02:00:29,170
I can't make it so close to you that
it's realistic. If I had a judge,

2056
02:00:29,171 --> 02:00:32,140
you honestly, I'd say if you lost
20 pounds, you'd be an eight.

2057
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:34,940
Right now you're probably a six and a
half percent. I remember. Is that on?

2058
02:00:34,970 --> 02:00:38,800
Is that honest? I was not
mad. Right. Fat The fucking,

2059
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:41,740
before I was nearly this fat,
Brian was a stud when he was,

2060
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:45,340
I was on the fucking man show is
what I was fighting Tonya Harding.

2061
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,810
And I remember fucking
him standing with jugging.

2062
02:00:48,840 --> 02:00:52,180
Kathy was one of the most beautiful
women in the world and he's like,

2063
02:00:52,181 --> 02:00:56,230
look at his fucking body. You're so
disgusting, Dude. Let me look at you.

2064
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:02,320
And that was what I was way less
disgusting. So back in the day. Yeah.

2065
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:06,970
Yeah. Well, so let's be realistic.
Okay, Brian, let me give you,

2066
02:01:06,971 --> 02:01:08,560
I'm going to give you a
rating of a six and a half,

2067
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:11,500
seven if you just continue on your
current path of losing weight. Okay.

2068
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:14,450
That's realistic. I don't think I'm
a more than an eight, right? I was,

2069
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:16,870
I was pretty much a nine
when I was on news radio,

2070
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:19,480
but I'm old and my Shit's falling apart.
Okay.

2071
02:01:19,481 --> 02:01:22,810
Let's be honest right now I think
on a more attractive than the news.

2072
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:26,430
Radio got a strong nine. Yeah, nine.

2073
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:31,390
So Brian was with a strong nine
[inaudible] you're fucking never agree.

2074
02:01:31,390 --> 02:01:33,730
On the chicks because the chicks,

2075
02:01:33,731 --> 02:01:38,200
you call it nine and he
showed me a picture and I go,
that's a fucking real doll.

2076
02:01:38,230 --> 02:01:42,470
That isn't even snotty.
You're looking for something different.

2077
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:43,610
We have different,

2078
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:47,720
we've always had different opinions on
what's fucking for sure. Yeah, for sure.

2079
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:49,970
We have, yeah. We've always
had like, fuck. Yeah,

2080
02:01:49,971 --> 02:01:52,430
some chicks that you would think of.
Wicked.

2081
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:55,310
Skanks I make a perfect
10 what do you like?

2082
02:01:55,330 --> 02:02:00,260
What you that girl can I like to, I like,
I like girls with unfortunate tattoos.

2083
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:05,730
There's girls that like just that
there's a porn look now there's not even,

2084
02:02:06,371 --> 02:02:10,090
there's, there's no difference. She did.
She was, she was in there like the fund,

2085
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:11,900
this girl,
this girl,

2086
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:15,230
this girl was some chick that
works at the local fucking,

2087
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:19,460
she works at the local car seat.
Fucking manufacturer, you know,

2088
02:02:19,461 --> 02:02:23,030
working in the book. She's an accountant
but she has big tits in this crazy ass.

2089
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:26,810
She has a fake vagina and somehow or
another you get together, you can buy it.

2090
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:29,960
That's what it means, right? It's a
product. It's a product, but you know,

2091
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:32,900
doesn't count with mom issues or HIV.
You get her alone.

2092
02:02:32,901 --> 02:02:34,960
Then the next thing you know,
you're a fucking, yeah, you're,

2093
02:02:34,980 --> 02:02:36,020
you're banging it out and you're like,

2094
02:02:36,021 --> 02:02:38,060
I can't even believe this
girl's let me fuck you. Well,

2095
02:02:38,061 --> 02:02:42,080
he had that situation for awhile,
back and forth, a little separation,

2096
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:44,300
little break up. It just wasn't
ready for that kind of frequency.

2097
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:48,560
The kid wasn't ready hit the songs.
Brian, I'm trying your, your Wifi sucks,

2098
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:51,710
does it? Yeah. Really. It
doesn't really work too much.

2099
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:56,770
Joe Hates it when you fucking talk
about his technical ineptitude gadgetry

2100
02:02:57,340 --> 02:03:01,820
thing. We need to put a block
by rob tod. You Mow your Wifi.

2101
02:03:01,940 --> 02:03:03,900
Joe is about five and a half.

2102
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:08,870
Oh,
don't you go there?

2103
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:14,000
You don't know Mark Merrin's
podcast has fucking Wifi out the

2104
02:03:18,170 --> 02:03:21,110
mark. Man. Just send me an email asking
me to do is pop. I probably will.

2105
02:03:21,111 --> 02:03:24,950
I just don't want to argue with them. I
like Mark Matt. I think he's a good dude,

2106
02:03:24,951 --> 02:03:28,340
but he says dumb shit. I don't wanna.
I don't want to get cocky with them.

2107
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:32,030
That's why not. That's what I want to
argue with anybody. I ain't got no time.

2108
02:03:32,031 --> 02:03:35,750
I know, but if you're not arguing,
it's a fucking low rated podcast.

2109
02:03:36,230 --> 02:03:40,290
I will listen to podcasts.
Are you doing Carlos men?

2110
02:03:40,291 --> 02:03:42,500
Sia on Mark Marin.

2111
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:47,010
I listened to Dane Cook on Mark Marin
and I didn't know you had done Dane Cook.

2112
02:03:47,011 --> 02:03:49,970
So I'll listen to that.
And I listened to the fucking,

2113
02:03:50,470 --> 02:03:54,560
what train do use name is
that had the Kyle cease on,

2114
02:03:54,650 --> 02:03:58,730
you're just looking for train wrecks.
Exactly. What do you want to fucking,

2115
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:00,530
I don't want to the lesson here.

2116
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:05,710
Well listen to fucking two guys who agree
breakdown like the Paul Provenza who I

2117
02:04:06,051 --> 02:04:09,220
love women. This is the best podcast
we've ever done. This is the best,

2118
02:04:09,230 --> 02:04:11,420
best podcast I've ever done.
And we,

2119
02:04:11,421 --> 02:04:14,540
you and I are almost completely in
agreement on everything except the, the,

2120
02:04:14,541 --> 02:04:18,920
the level of demonic aptitude Kyle sees
is has it is fucking show. That's it.

2121
02:04:19,190 --> 02:04:20,490
I know.
But I'm saying that's,

2122
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:24,890
that doesn't get fucking people I
don't go to listen to. That's okay.

2123
02:04:24,891 --> 02:04:28,250
You guys get along. That's
just you, your point of view.

2124
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:30,940
I understand what you're saying.
I understand that. I just don't,

2125
02:04:31,090 --> 02:04:34,730
my point of view is at this point
in time, I'm a, I'm a grown man.

2126
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:38,100
I don't want to play these stupid games.
I don't want to argue with anybody who

2127
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:42,000
just don't just stop, stop. I don't,
I don't want to hear it. I don't care.

2128
02:04:42,230 --> 02:04:42,561
And I can't,

2129
02:04:42,561 --> 02:04:47,561
I've thoroughly dissected my own personal
thoughts and I don't want to deal with

2130
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,100
the mess that's in your head.
Okay.

2131
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:53,670
I don't want to have to fucking sit
down and go, well, okay, let's back up.

2132
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:56,730
Where did you come to this perception
and how did this start out?

2133
02:04:56,731 --> 02:05:01,010
And maybe you didn't take into account
how I felt. I don't want to care.

2134
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:03,810
I've got no time. You know, he's
doing one of your bits therein.

2135
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:09,130
He did his show and um,

2136
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:14,460
he hadn't been seen on and he had this
like ramp up or he like gives his take on

2137
02:05:14,461 --> 02:05:19,260
it and he said the men Sia incident
was two bullies arguing over bullshit.

2138
02:05:19,470 --> 02:05:21,270
That's how he said it.
And I just said,

2139
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:23,880
done,
done.

2140
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:27,840
That's it. You just saved me weird
conversations for the rest of my life.

2141
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:30,590
Just don't like to talk to you anymore.
I don't have to talk to you tomorrow.

2142
02:05:30,810 --> 02:05:35,580
I can wish you well. I'm Karma free. I can
say good luck. Have Fun. Take care. Don

2143
02:05:37,110 --> 02:05:37,800
done.

2144
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:40,530
It's nice. It's nice to, there's
a lot of problems in this world.

2145
02:05:40,531 --> 02:05:42,750
You can't fix them all.
Sometimes it's good to Jess.

2146
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:46,510
Now let's go back to Brian.

2147
02:05:49,070 --> 02:05:53,890
Brian, his good friend I met
Brian Online is talented.

2148
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,820
He makes these incredible videos and I'm
like, what do you do man? He told me,

2149
02:05:57,821 --> 02:06:02,440
he goes, I, I worked for
gateway. I was like, dude,

2150
02:06:03,190 --> 02:06:06,310
you need to come work for me. I don't even
know what the fuck you're going to do,

2151
02:06:06,430 --> 02:06:09,100
but we're just gonna make some videos.
We're going to make shit happen.

2152
02:06:09,101 --> 02:06:11,800
We're going to have some fun. Just come
with me on the road. We'll films are shit,

2153
02:06:11,801 --> 02:06:15,670
man. Fuck that crazy job. That job
sucks. He's like, okay. Years ago, right?

2154
02:06:15,671 --> 02:06:20,290
So while ago, so he comes, he Compson
brands out there and new world, man,

2155
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:21,430
we're traveling but Kona,

2156
02:06:21,850 --> 02:06:26,850
fucking comedy clubs and going on
TV shows going all over the world.

2157
02:06:26,921 --> 02:06:30,040
We go on. Opie and Anthony were in New
York. Okay. We're all over the place.

2158
02:06:31,450 --> 02:06:32,560
Brian's from Columbus,
Ohio.

2159
02:06:32,561 --> 02:06:36,550
And this girl is from Venus perhaps.

2160
02:06:37,300 --> 02:06:41,760
Maybe. Perfect. Right. Perfect girl.
Your perfect girl. Yes sir. What,

2161
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:46,180
what the fuck would ever make you think
that you would be able to fuck her?

2162
02:06:46,181 --> 02:06:48,910
Right, right. In real life.
It's like how does this happen?

2163
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:52,910
How does anybody get the fuck doesn't
have a weak channel, strong eyebrows body.

2164
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:56,740
How does anybody get the fucker?
There's certain girls in this world,

2165
02:06:56,741 --> 02:07:00,100
like any girl that's over a nine
it's like really any guidance.

2166
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:01,510
Fucking I was like really?

2167
02:07:01,570 --> 02:07:05,170
Because every guy that's fucking at nine
it's fucked sixes and fives and can't

2168
02:07:05,171 --> 02:07:06,910
believe that anybody who
talks to him anymore.

2169
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:09,580
But as a whole fucking Bobby Barnett,

2170
02:07:09,860 --> 02:07:13,090
he never wrapped up cause you're outside
smoking all the Bobby find that tape.

2171
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:17,800
Yeah, go with bags. Like three, four
archives, genius. She finally found out,

2172
02:07:17,801 --> 02:07:22,300
someone in my fans from Sweden actually
tracked her down whether new fucking

2173
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:27,270
married name and she heard that bit and
is a born again Christian now and said

2174
02:07:27,271 --> 02:07:30,310
to very upset emails. So
that's it. Doug. Stan hope doc,

2175
02:07:30,311 --> 02:07:33,660
which by the way made the bid
20,000 times better. Yeah,

2176
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:36,820
it was beautiful and your
was just fucking spectacular.

2177
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:38,760
I honestly think that you
have to do that on stage.

2178
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:42,640
What I think you should do is play the
original recording on stage for people

2179
02:07:42,641 --> 02:07:46,330
who don't know, for the new fans. Let them
hear that and then tell the new store.

2180
02:07:46,590 --> 02:07:47,690
Just do.
Then you'd been on states.

2181
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:50,710
A fucking destroyer I think you should
close with that would be pretty fucking

2182
02:07:50,711 --> 02:07:54,190
lazy. I go, well, first you to this bit.

2183
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:59,440
I won't say that. You can say you
can say it. I don't mean that.

2184
02:07:59,441 --> 02:08:02,870
I mean I feel weird telling old
joke. Oh, I did too. I won't do it.

2185
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:08,410
More weird to go. I know I could
say this. Let me just hit play.

2186
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:12,190
I do old bits at during my question and
answer after I've done like an hour or

2187
02:08:12,191 --> 02:08:14,890
so. I always do a question to answer
because at this point in time,

2188
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:16,810
I mean I joke around about it onstage,

2189
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:19,930
but this is in order to keep a real
honest relationship with all these people

2190
02:08:19,931 --> 02:08:20,651
that come out to see me,

2191
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:23,520
I don't think I should be doing the one
that gets a talk. I always say that.

2192
02:08:23,521 --> 02:08:27,450
I would say this feels weird, like the
whole standup comedy, the the, the,

2193
02:08:27,451 --> 02:08:30,850
the whole art form is you get
onstage and there's a microphone.

2194
02:08:30,851 --> 02:08:33,400
There's a bunch of people that pay to
hear you talk and that's ridiculous.

2195
02:08:33,550 --> 02:08:36,520
You're going to be the only one who
talks for an hour to cocaine dream.

2196
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:37,090
It's crazy.

2197
02:08:37,090 --> 02:08:42,040
I get to fucking get to do the coke and
now it's my sentence for an hour and you

2198
02:08:42,041 --> 02:08:43,720
don't get a chance.
I always talk about it,

2199
02:08:43,721 --> 02:08:46,960
how I understand that this is a
ridiculous relationship and in order to

2200
02:08:46,961 --> 02:08:50,470
compensate for the fact that it's
ridiculous, I do the best I can.

2201
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:53,110
I write the most shit I do.
I explore the most ideas.

2202
02:08:53,111 --> 02:08:54,010
I tried to give you the most shit.

2203
02:08:54,011 --> 02:08:57,450
I got the most hyped up for the show
and I also do a question to answer why.

2204
02:08:57,451 --> 02:09:01,060
So she yell out anything you want, we'll
talk about anything you want. You know,

2205
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:04,900
and, and that's, that's like an
opportunity for people to, they can,

2206
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:08,800
they can yell shit out. They can talk
about anything they want. If I were,

2207
02:09:08,801 --> 02:09:12,910
if we were going to do, I'm sorry. That's
what I do. Old Bits. This is a, this,

2208
02:09:12,970 --> 02:09:17,500
that would be a perfect time
for all of us to fucking do.

2209
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:20,980
If I knew other comics would do this,

2210
02:09:21,190 --> 02:09:25,960
I would do a fucking Q and a at the end
of every show for wannabe standup comics.

2211
02:09:26,170 --> 02:09:28,660
So you can get advice for fucking free.

2212
02:09:28,990 --> 02:09:31,600
That's all you should ever
pay for comedy advice.

2213
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:33,070
That's not a bad idea everywhere.

2214
02:09:33,220 --> 02:09:36,310
But you know what you know and not
be a bad idea. If you said, you know,

2215
02:09:36,311 --> 02:09:37,750
he had people sign up for an advance.

2216
02:09:37,751 --> 02:09:40,660
They couldn't be just somebody who wanted
to photograph no photos, no autographs,

2217
02:09:40,770 --> 02:09:41,603
can't waste any time.

2218
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:46,680
But after every show there'll be one half
hour Q and a section session for want

2219
02:09:47,011 --> 02:09:48,090
to be stand up comedian.
So,

2220
02:09:48,150 --> 02:09:50,860
so you have to be honest about the fact
that you want to be a comedian and if

2221
02:09:50,861 --> 02:09:52,710
you are, you're allowed to
common. There's a Roman,

2222
02:09:52,711 --> 02:09:55,150
there's 100 of us and we're going to sit
there and I'll let you talk for half an

2223
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:57,460
hour. Right? That's a
great idea. You know what?

2224
02:09:57,490 --> 02:10:00,640
You fucking wait outside for
a half an hour after the show,

2225
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:04,390
like fight club and that'll get rid of
the Douche bags that are just drunk.

2226
02:10:04,391 --> 02:10:06,310
You want to fucking say something stupid?

2227
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:09,420
Wait out on the porch like flight club.

2228
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:13,120
While if you really want to fucking
be a stand up, we'll give you,

2229
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:15,700
that's how I avoid crazy people at my
shows when I take pictures with them

2230
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:19,270
afterwards I sit down for 10 minutes,
take a leak,

2231
02:10:19,630 --> 02:10:23,140
have a glass of water, just to let
everybody just really fucking frantic.

2232
02:10:23,141 --> 02:10:25,590
Just go about their way.
Right.

2233
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,980
Let's do fucking gyms all over
me with your douchey miss.
Yeah. You sell merge? No,

2234
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:34,070
I did a couple of times. I've sold
a DD hats fucking tradeoff. I can

2235
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:34,760
either sell,

2236
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:39,760
merge and have to fucking dive right
into this right from stage and that head

2237
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:45,110
full of, you know, and then right
to politician. Nice to meet you. Oh,

2238
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:47,570
I'd love to fuck you.
Take a picture with your wife.

2239
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:53,030
Right from fucking are you go.
All right. I cannot sell merge.

2240
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:56,390
First of all, merge sales. It's not
just the money that you're making,

2241
02:10:56,391 --> 02:10:58,750
it's the fact that you're getting
your product out there, right.

2242
02:10:58,790 --> 02:11:00,260
I'm not on fucking television.

2243
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:04,760
You're all people finding me because
someone sent him a link to a cleaner way

2244
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:09,050
off now. Okay. I disagree.
You're not off the grid. Okay.
You're on the Internet, man.

2245
02:11:09,051 --> 02:11:11,570
You're not an internet. I'm
saying this is, this is,

2246
02:11:11,590 --> 02:11:15,800
there's a website that I frequent all the
time called mixed martial arts.com and

2247
02:11:15,801 --> 02:11:18,380
uh, it's has nothing to do
with you. And there's a,

2248
02:11:18,381 --> 02:11:21,950
there's a section called the underground
where they talk about MMA fights,

2249
02:11:21,990 --> 02:11:24,950
but there's the other ground where they
talk about anything else and they always

2250
02:11:24,951 --> 02:11:29,480
have sections on comedians and
your name comes up all the time.

2251
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:34,760
And I understand that, but I'm saying that
you, you have to feed that sense. Yes.

2252
02:11:34,820 --> 02:11:38,450
Yes. I agree. At the same time,
a million people have said,

2253
02:11:38,720 --> 02:11:41,480
I never even heard of you.
Sorry. No offense man.

2254
02:11:41,810 --> 02:11:46,280
I never heard of you until my buddy
low your DVD. Yeah. So yeah, it's,

2255
02:11:46,281 --> 02:11:49,910
it's getting that out there. So that's
the other important thing about birch.

2256
02:11:49,970 --> 02:11:52,570
You don't, you don't give a fuck about
torrents or anything like that, do you?

2257
02:11:52,630 --> 02:11:53,421
Do you ever,
you don't an idea.

2258
02:11:53,421 --> 02:11:56,600
I don't give a fuck about that shit
when people have my shit on my phone.

2259
02:11:56,601 --> 02:12:00,200
Every camera. No, no, no. It is computers.

2260
02:12:00,201 --> 02:12:03,650
You don't know what a bit torn is where
you can download movies. Oh, stealing.

2261
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:06,980
Yeah, still. No, I'm all for stealing.
And this is what it's not stealing.

2262
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:07,521
Well listen,

2263
02:12:07,521 --> 02:12:11,420
listen to this skill from the fuse and
you'll agree with me and this is fucking

2264
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:12,290
very important.

2265
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:17,320
I encourage you fucking downloading and
sharing and burning files of all the

2266
02:12:18,111 --> 02:12:21,590
shit that I've released,
but don't come to the show.

2267
02:12:21,591 --> 02:12:25,850
And you decide when I'm releasing my new
CD on your fucking cell phone camera.

2268
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:29,930
I agree. That makes me, I
agree. It is annoying. However,

2269
02:12:29,931 --> 02:12:34,610
I also think that it looks as long as
everybody else can just deal with the real

2270
02:12:34,611 --> 02:12:37,330
hardcore fans of you're gonna go research
these videos can deal with the fact

2271
02:12:37,331 --> 02:12:40,910
that this is material that's in, it's in
development. You know it starts out here.

2272
02:12:40,911 --> 02:12:43,100
Maybe you want to watch them
develop and that's all cool too.

2273
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:46,520
But don't fucking go to shows and yell
out punchlines when you know what they

2274
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:46,881
are.

2275
02:12:46,881 --> 02:12:50,780
Cause he saw a clip on youtube and the
bid is only a month old and it's going

2276
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:53,060
through some metamorphosis.
Like don't be a Douche bag.

2277
02:12:53,180 --> 02:12:55,190
But as long as you're not a
Douche bag and you come to a show,

2278
02:12:55,191 --> 02:12:57,900
I don't mind if you, you
know, I don't mind all the,

2279
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:01,790
I had you down for a reason
cause I hate looking at myself.

2280
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:05,030
So when I see someone with
a million reasons, I agree.

2281
02:13:05,031 --> 02:13:08,940
I'm worried about how I look.
I've taken me totally.

2282
02:13:09,160 --> 02:13:13,190
I would take you out of your day if
you're fucking had seven 11 I just start

2283
02:13:13,191 --> 02:13:16,830
filming. You have no reason. Absolutely
agree. It's really distracting.

2284
02:13:16,840 --> 02:13:20,270
It was the Ice House in Pasadena
and I yelled at some lady,

2285
02:13:20,271 --> 02:13:23,540
but I wasn't really mad, but I was like,
he can't just fucking live your life.

2286
02:13:23,541 --> 02:13:26,600
Don't fucking live your life through a
fucking youtube clip. This is ridiculous.

2287
02:13:26,601 --> 02:13:28,220
Just just enjoy this moment.

2288
02:13:28,221 --> 02:13:31,200
You don't have to relive it or
live your three rows away from,

2289
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:34,920
I don't affect you enough that you can
remember the shit that I said then it's

2290
02:13:34,921 --> 02:13:35,790
not really worth it.

2291
02:13:35,791 --> 02:13:39,030
Just to enjoy the good feeling that you
had while you were there and come see me

2292
02:13:39,031 --> 02:13:43,080
again to see. I'll have to fucking
live through a Goddamn Lens. I've said,

2293
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:47,910
I've said the same thing I've, I've said
don't fill me in so many bucking ways.

2294
02:13:47,911 --> 02:13:51,640
Now you actually have bits on it, right?
Your bits of people filming? I've had,

2295
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:54,750
yeah.
I've had a number of bits.

2296
02:13:54,751 --> 02:13:59,751
I have more bits about about stop
filming me than overpopulation.

2297
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:03,330
Again, can't be honest.
I can't tell you stuff.

2298
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:06,090
I can't say that my
girlfriend's sister is. If I,

2299
02:14:06,091 --> 02:14:08,330
if my girlfriend's sister was a fat cunt,

2300
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:12,180
you couldn't do a bit about what does
she do is she was a big fat cut and did

2301
02:14:12,181 --> 02:14:14,540
something really awful and
I wanted to talk about it.

2302
02:14:14,541 --> 02:14:17,380
And you have can't talk about
my fucking nephews kind of

2303
02:14:18,940 --> 02:14:23,550
say no, no little loony violent. He,
he looks at the moon a lot. Nice.

2304
02:14:23,770 --> 02:14:28,650
I said,
but I could never do bits cause he,

2305
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:32,910
he's kind of an idiot savant.
He knows how to use computers.

2306
02:14:33,010 --> 02:14:36,600
Some people in my life that are hanging
onto a thread because I'm thinking about

2307
02:14:36,601 --> 02:14:37,530
throwing them down the river.

2308
02:14:37,980 --> 02:14:40,860
I'm talking about chucking them under
the bus and do it a fuck closing bid on

2309
02:14:40,861 --> 02:14:43,710
them. There's a few people in my life
where I think about how crazy they are.

2310
02:14:43,720 --> 02:14:46,540
I'm like, motherfucker, I just want to,
you're going to be my closing again.

2311
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:53,080
But you can't cause it fucking
hurts when it comes back. Yeah.

2312
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:56,970
You don't want them to be upset people,
you know, you can make fun of me all day,

2313
02:14:57,030 --> 02:15:01,050
but making fun of other people, man, for
people, making someone making fun of you.

2314
02:15:01,051 --> 02:15:02,300
You don't even know them for most people.

2315
02:15:02,301 --> 02:15:05,450
And it's like for us it's like you
just get like, don't Google your name.

2316
02:15:05,451 --> 02:15:08,490
Cause if you do some anonymous Douche
bags can be mad at you somewhere for sure.

2317
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,470
And I hate myself so much.

2318
02:15:10,500 --> 02:15:14,040
That's just a voice seconding
what I already thought.

2319
02:15:14,130 --> 02:15:16,890
This is what I find that I'm
sure you find the same way.

2320
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:19,650
Do you find yourself like hating yourself
the most when you have to edit your

2321
02:15:19,651 --> 02:15:22,680
shit when you have to like go like edit
a DVD or something like that and you

2322
02:15:22,681 --> 02:15:27,460
watch your bits over over January.
Oh you shut the fuck up. Yeah. No I,

2323
02:15:27,461 --> 02:15:30,830
I might, I can't stand a fucking
way. I look, people just sound,

2324
02:15:30,870 --> 02:15:34,540
we're egomaniacs are narcissists. It's
like when you, when you're editing your,

2325
02:15:34,570 --> 02:15:36,060
get to a certain point in your comedy,

2326
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:39,090
I think when you get to a certain point
where you really kind of appreciate what

2327
02:15:39,091 --> 02:15:42,210
this is all about and this is really not
all about all this personal intention

2328
02:15:42,211 --> 02:15:44,970
that's really not all about,
you know, people loving you.

2329
02:15:44,971 --> 02:15:48,990
It's really about like finding a way to
tune into all these crazy ideas so that

2330
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:52,410
other people get enjoyment out of it.
And when you hear yourself do it,

2331
02:15:52,411 --> 02:15:55,530
you hear yourself say it, it's you.
It's you saying it's you doing it.

2332
02:15:55,680 --> 02:16:00,010
You're judging yourself. You're
like, shut the fuck up. Yeah. No, I,

2333
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:05,460
I don't like doing comedy.
I really don't.

2334
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:10,360
And lots of really though you do though,
you say you don't, but you do. I know you,

2335
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:13,170
if I could bullshit,
you wouldn't do what you don't want to do.

2336
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:16,650
You can tell you like it.
There's moments you like you don't like,

2337
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:19,050
you might not like 40% of it.
Okay.

2338
02:16:19,540 --> 02:16:24,540
There's loads going on stage
crush. You love it. Yeah. No, no.

2339
02:16:24,541 --> 02:16:28,410
Come on. When you knock it out of the
park, when you really find a fucking,

2340
02:16:28,411 --> 02:16:32,800
but when I knocked out of that
really locks into people's
heads and they go, yes,

2341
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:38,020
fuck yeah. But I've, I like everything
that I've been passionate about.

2342
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:40,230
I've beaten into the ground, right? I've,

2343
02:16:40,231 --> 02:16:44,400
I can't fucking do another overpopulation.
I'll probably find a way to help you,

2344
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:47,650
can help you with all of these things.
I can help you with all these songs. No,

2345
02:16:47,651 --> 02:16:52,651
I do it out of the parts of me is when
I come up with something off the top of

2346
02:16:53,561 --> 02:16:57,790
my head when I actually riff and I get a
couple of fucking lines that's knock it,

2347
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:01,630
I can have a shitty show, but if I said
something that amused me like, Oh fuck,

2348
02:17:01,631 --> 02:17:03,550
that was fun. That's
funny. You just need them.

2349
02:17:03,551 --> 02:17:06,820
When I say write that down to
someone in the fucking audience,

2350
02:17:07,110 --> 02:17:10,240
that's when I'm knocking on
it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But
those moments are worth it.

2351
02:17:10,241 --> 02:17:14,320
All those moments are worth it all where
you are the fucking lightning rod and

2352
02:17:14,321 --> 02:17:17,890
the bolt hits you out of the heavens
and you get this thought when you're on

2353
02:17:17,891 --> 02:17:20,680
stage that you really never
went down that avenue before,

2354
02:17:20,681 --> 02:17:22,410
but all the sudden you'd
go there and the audit,

2355
02:17:22,411 --> 02:17:26,860
it just destroys your howling laughing
at the thought that you didn't even,

2356
02:17:26,861 --> 02:17:29,380
you don't even know where the fucking
came from. He could scarcely take photos.

2357
02:17:29,440 --> 02:17:31,630
I was just saying to someone that,

2358
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:36,160
the applause that you hear before
the show, when they announce you,

2359
02:17:36,180 --> 02:17:41,080
Doug's Stan hope and you hear that fucking
massive round of applause is nothing

2360
02:17:41,081 --> 02:17:46,081
but fucking terror of expectations
that I don't think I can meet.

2361
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:49,540
Yeah. I don't feel like that's
love and I worked hard for that.

2362
02:17:49,541 --> 02:17:52,410
I feel like they want more than I have to.

2363
02:17:52,490 --> 02:17:55,870
That's one of the problems that you had
with the Kyle sees comedy course and you

2364
02:17:55,871 --> 02:17:58,960
use a brilliant example where you're
talking about David Tell who's one of my

2365
02:17:58,961 --> 02:18:02,290
favorite comedians and your favorite
comedians and one of the most unique guys

2366
02:18:02,291 --> 02:18:05,410
in my opinion. They'd come along
lot a little records, his set,

2367
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:10,740
he still has a fucking mini recorder
and he listens to his sets after 20 some

2368
02:18:10,931 --> 02:18:12,910
years of comedy.
Yeah.

2369
02:18:12,911 --> 02:18:16,030
And he gets mad at himself and he doesn't
like his bed and he doesn't believe in

2370
02:18:16,031 --> 02:18:19,690
them and he gets upset and
he gets insecure. Meanwhile
he's brilliant, you know.

2371
02:18:19,691 --> 02:18:23,380
And that was the example that you use that
you don't always have to be confident.

2372
02:18:23,381 --> 02:18:24,214
That's not true.

2373
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:27,310
Like sometimes you can just do it and
be ashamed of everything you say and

2374
02:18:27,311 --> 02:18:31,690
ashamed of every laugh you get. It's
still, it's still formula man. Yeah.

2375
02:18:31,691 --> 02:18:35,950
A lot of guys are only successful
because they hate themselves so much.

2376
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:38,380
There's no formula for
anything than any of us do.

2377
02:18:38,740 --> 02:18:43,740
[inaudible] head Hedberg funny that as
soon as they became successful dive set

2378
02:18:44,620 --> 02:18:47,500
another fucking word. Yeah, a lot
of them. How about a lot of them?

2379
02:18:47,501 --> 02:18:49,500
How about a lot of them forgot
what it's all about. Right?

2380
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:52,000
In the reason why the forgot what it's
all about. It's cause he's fucking,

2381
02:18:52,001 --> 02:18:54,790
people are hungry at one point in
time they were that were really,

2382
02:18:54,791 --> 02:18:59,791
most comedy comes from a place of fear
and hate and it's just a matter of chips

2383
02:19:00,281 --> 02:19:02,110
come perspective.
In my opinion.

2384
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:07,240
Ma Hedberg Hedberg was at a pers perfect
example where you look at that guy on

2385
02:19:07,901 --> 02:19:11,920
paper, like the shit that he would say on
paper. Like the joke about doubletrees.

2386
02:19:11,950 --> 02:19:15,160
Yeah. You know, how did they, do they
have a meetings? How did they name that?

2387
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:19,870
Let's call it two trees. No, let's
call a double tree meeting adjourned.

2388
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:23,560
It's like she'd be funny.
Why is that funny?

2389
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:28,070
I mean while I'm alone in my car, laughing
my ass off and I hear it on Xm radio,

2390
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:32,300
there's certain guys that they just, they
find out. Joey Diaz. Perfect example.

2391
02:19:32,420 --> 02:19:35,450
You've said at best you said Joey Diaz
could read the phone book and there'd be

2392
02:19:35,451 --> 02:19:37,600
funnier than 90% of the
comments [inaudible] guys,

2393
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:39,840
you don't think you did Wayne that term?
No,

2394
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:42,230
I think that might not have yet is a term,
but I read shade.

2395
02:19:42,231 --> 02:19:45,640
Expression is I didn't want
to get, Oh, I'm setting forth.

2396
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:49,070
You said it best when you said
it and I heard I can't say it.

2397
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:53,390
Third hand you can say it second hand.
I can't say it. Third Day I had to take,

2398
02:19:53,750 --> 02:19:58,550
I got you and I have to go. Do I have
to do soon? Six, 10 let's find a closer,

2399
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:02,600
but let's talk. Let's talk about a
question. You know, here's a six pack.

2400
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:04,700
I think we drank a lot of beer.
We drink all of them.

2401
02:20:04,701 --> 02:20:09,500
I think I'm pretty fucked up
yours over there. By the way.

2402
02:20:09,501 --> 02:20:11,180
This is the only time I've ever been.
I need to,

2403
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:16,510
this is only a time drunk on a podcast
and on top of it stops you in the middle.

2404
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:22,270
Do two of these big ass bitches. Didn't
have anything to two here. You know,

2405
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:27,080
it's 6:00 PM. I've had,
oh, I had eggs, lies, lies,

2406
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:31,790
lies, had pancakes today. Headlines,
she and some Chinese. Chinky.

2407
02:20:32,450 --> 02:20:36,970
Um, so here's, here's, hey, Kyle sees
I didn't love it. Yeah, I don't shit.

2408
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:40,310
It's not, it's not personal. Listen,
you know, you could do better.

2409
02:20:40,460 --> 02:20:42,890
We know I can do better. You can
do better. We can all do better.

2410
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:45,080
Kyle sees you can do better.
Okay.

2411
02:20:45,530 --> 02:20:49,160
Maybe just cut down the hyperbole.
Yeah.

2412
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:53,570
Comedy master. What the fuck
dude? Master after three days,

2413
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:58,510
that's what they were getting on
him for. His podcast was a, uh,

2414
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:03,620
there's one clip of him. It's a
montage compilation reel for his class.

2415
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:08,690
He goes, do you want to make $1 million
in your first year of comedy? Oh No,

2416
02:21:08,691 --> 02:21:12,780
it doesn't say that. Calm seas.
Fuck you Kyle seats. Yeah,

2417
02:21:12,890 --> 02:21:17,780
that's ridiculous. Kyle sees that's
bullshit. I know you're a delicate flower.

2418
02:21:17,781 --> 02:21:22,400
And we all, are you going to be okay,
stop doing that. Just do comedy.

2419
02:21:23,330 --> 02:21:25,700
The last thing that I want to talk about,
and this is,

2420
02:21:25,730 --> 02:21:29,630
this is a sort of a
reoccurring theme and um, the,

2421
02:21:29,631 --> 02:21:33,170
I think one of the reasons why you don't
like comedy and one of the reasons why

2422
02:21:33,171 --> 02:21:36,440
Connolly bothers you is your
really fucking good at it.

2423
02:21:36,770 --> 02:21:40,670
And this is just my own theory. I think
when you get really good at anything,

2424
02:21:40,671 --> 02:21:42,680
you don't feel like you deserve
any of what you're doing.

2425
02:21:42,980 --> 02:21:46,340
And I think when you get to this point
where all these people are pointing at

2426
02:21:46,341 --> 02:21:49,740
you and go, oh, he's fucking awesome,
he's the shit and you're the fucking man,

2427
02:21:49,741 --> 02:21:52,910
and you get these Twitter messages
and you're like, ah, okay.

2428
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:57,890
It becomes creepy because you know
that to be really good at something,

2429
02:21:57,891 --> 02:22:02,300
to be, to tune into something like you do.
Like I'm a fucking comedy kind of sore,

2430
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:07,160
right? I've been doing standup
comedy for I guess 22 years,

2431
02:22:07,161 --> 02:22:08,000
22 years now.

2432
02:22:08,001 --> 02:22:10,790
I've been doing it and I've been
watching it for much longer than that.

2433
02:22:10,791 --> 02:22:15,710
And you're one of my favorites, so I
know that you, you're tuned into it.

2434
02:22:15,711 --> 02:22:16,790
I know you're tuned doing,
do it,

2435
02:22:17,090 --> 02:22:19,280
but when you're tuned into
it and onto the really,

2436
02:22:19,310 --> 02:22:22,820
in order to really get the energy,
the creativity,

2437
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:24,830
that in order to really
fucking tap into the Muse,

2438
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:26,460
you've got to think
you're a piece of shit.

2439
02:22:26,690 --> 02:22:29,430
You've got to think you're not worthy.
You got to think that it's all bullshit.

2440
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:32,730
You've got to think that we'll fucking
different. Who the fuck am I and what is,

2441
02:22:32,930 --> 02:22:35,850
you can never think you're the
shit when these guys get famous.

2442
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:37,650
That's what happens.
That's why they suck.

2443
02:22:37,830 --> 02:22:40,800
They get famous and everyone tells them
the sh they're the shit and they start

2444
02:22:40,801 --> 02:22:43,590
thinking they're special and they start
thinking they protected and they don't

2445
02:22:43,591 --> 02:22:47,100
want to dive into the fucking
sea of humanity in labs one.

2446
02:22:47,101 --> 02:22:51,180
It's not funny that true. That's true.
Yeah, that's true. Uh, but I, I have to,

2447
02:22:51,181 --> 02:22:56,181
I will enjoy it more when I can get back
to a place where I'm not worried about

2448
02:22:56,251 --> 02:22:59,380
living up to expectations.
Cause I used to fuck off, man.

2449
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:03,450
That's in your head dinner
like while I'm doing on stage,

2450
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,430
I'd fuck that Shit's in your head.

2451
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:09,450
I think you don't get past those ideas
if you just take care of your body a

2452
02:23:09,451 --> 02:23:10,140
little bit better.

2453
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:12,810
There's a lot of stress that comes
up to me when I don't exercise.

2454
02:23:13,020 --> 02:23:16,790
The only energy that's coming, the only
like feeling of expectation is all this.

2455
02:23:16,810 --> 02:23:19,200
There's the performance of
the show and the energy,

2456
02:23:19,220 --> 02:23:23,400
all these people and it's like there's
not enough other physical activity going

2457
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:28,401
on a lot to pitch me the Joe Rogan comedy
workout comedy bootcamp that you too

2458
02:23:30,211 --> 02:23:31,650
can be powerfully funding.

2459
02:23:31,790 --> 02:23:35,460
I'm flashlight of partially
sponsored by fish.

2460
02:23:35,461 --> 02:23:37,900
Died not be dicks. No, I mean I,

2461
02:23:37,901 --> 02:23:40,770
I mean it sounds very
cliche and hippie and yoga.

2462
02:23:41,300 --> 02:23:44,210
I really want to bring this
back to my girlfriend habits.

2463
02:23:44,700 --> 02:23:49,530
I brought you something baby.
It's realistic. It's modeled
after mine. Say No more.

2464
02:23:49,531 --> 02:23:52,740
It is your is yours.
I'm gonna fuck this vampire mouth.

2465
02:23:52,741 --> 02:23:56,460
But you can have this fake rubber Dick.
That's all you know.

2466
02:23:56,880 --> 02:24:00,270
Fucking love of fuckers. There's,
there's a balance to all of it.

2467
02:24:00,271 --> 02:24:04,470
And I think we both, we both
seek the balance in, in, in, in,

2468
02:24:04,471 --> 02:24:08,860
in as you're holding this a rubber
vagina that's on its period. No,

2469
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:10,860
cause I'll fuck with this shit
out of a girl in a period.

2470
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:15,390
It's like saying something, a rubber band
that as big as a house, it's like, yeah,

2471
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:19,680
it's realistic, but it's way too
big. Go ahead. Um, I think, um,

2472
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:22,660
I don't fucking say, all right,
let's not deconstruct cotton.

2473
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,510
Deconstructing comedy.
I'm,

2474
02:24:24,511 --> 02:24:29,511
I'm just trying to say that I think
this whole thing is we all do in comedy,

2475
02:24:29,791 --> 02:24:34,490
it's all about tuning into the idea
that's relevant to you. Tuning into the,

2476
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:37,140
whatever you're saying on stage that
hits you. And a lot of it doesn't.

2477
02:24:37,141 --> 02:24:39,690
And a lot of it makes them laugh and
it doesn't make you laugh and it's like

2478
02:24:39,691 --> 02:24:42,210
you're trying to find this fucking spot.
But it's all the same thing.

2479
02:24:42,211 --> 02:24:45,510
We're all just trying to like just go,
just get to the pure shit,

2480
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:48,900
tune into the pure shit, tuned
into the pure idea, you know?

2481
02:24:48,900 --> 02:24:50,070
And then there's always this bag,

2482
02:24:50,071 --> 02:24:52,050
big battle with yourself
when you're doing that,

2483
02:24:52,320 --> 02:24:55,290
you know there's a big self hate
thing and an insecurity thing.

2484
02:24:55,390 --> 02:24:57,660
And then when you all know
those people fucking love you,

2485
02:24:57,661 --> 02:25:00,060
but you're the same guy when
you were shitting your pants,

2486
02:25:00,061 --> 02:25:01,740
when you're in your car and Oh yeah,

2487
02:25:01,741 --> 02:25:05,130
I don't have like famous shoes
or anything like that. I just,

2488
02:25:05,220 --> 02:25:06,480
I didn't even famous shoes.

2489
02:25:06,820 --> 02:25:11,340
[inaudible] do is expectation that
his fame though, expectations.

2490
02:25:11,341 --> 02:25:14,610
A few whom are level,
it's not a matter of it doesn't.

2491
02:25:14,611 --> 02:25:17,310
Fame doesn't have to be worldwide.
Shit. Fame can be neighborhood.

2492
02:25:17,311 --> 02:25:20,840
Fame can fuck you up. You can think you're
some phone number that found runaways.

2493
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:24,160
Remember the hot whore I said
was waiting coke at the fucking

2494
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:28,300
show. I'm going to have to do
it now. Do it. Do what now?

2495
02:25:28,870 --> 02:25:30,820
The coke, the coke like, yeah.

2496
02:25:30,830 --> 02:25:35,320
It's like you gotta get Outta here
at six 15 I got rush hour tonight.

2497
02:25:35,321 --> 02:25:39,280
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're one of
the best comics work in the country today,

2498
02:25:39,520 --> 02:25:40,290
it sounds like

2499
02:25:40,290 --> 02:25:42,840
fucking Hollywood bullshit.
We're blowing smoke up each other's asses,

2500
02:25:42,841 --> 02:25:45,710
but I really do.
I'm glad we're friends and you,

2501
02:25:45,711 --> 02:25:49,470
you inspire me and I love talking to
Ya. And, um, I love what you're doing.

2502
02:25:49,530 --> 02:25:53,250
I love everything you're
doing. I have always, uh, I, I,

2503
02:25:53,850 --> 02:25:58,830
I mentioned you on the road.
All right, this is going
nowhere. Now. Every time I go,

2504
02:25:58,870 --> 02:26:02,610
if I have a talk about fucking
and anyone who has kids,

2505
02:26:02,611 --> 02:26:05,640
I don't have friends that have kids
because as soon as they have fucking kids,

2506
02:26:05,641 --> 02:26:10,140
I don't talk to him anymore. And I'll,
I'll always say, except for Joe Rogan,

2507
02:26:10,340 --> 02:26:12,750
he scares the fuck out of me.
I still talk to him.

2508
02:26:12,751 --> 02:26:16,890
He can have as many kids as he walks.
You'd be upset at me if I had kids,

2509
02:26:16,891 --> 02:26:17,600
but didn't

2510
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:20,750
if, uh, if it wasn't an intimidating
guy, is that what you're saying

2511
02:26:21,470 --> 02:26:25,240
about once people have kids, they tend
to drift in other directions anyway,

2512
02:26:25,241 --> 02:26:27,280
and I don't,
I was myself

2513
02:26:27,420 --> 02:26:30,270
before I had kids. I think a lot
of people are not themselves.

2514
02:26:30,300 --> 02:26:31,133
They don't understand.
Yeah.

2515
02:26:31,160 --> 02:26:33,800
Well, they want to incorporate
their kids into your,

2516
02:26:33,801 --> 02:26:38,230
and I fucking despise children.
The younger, the worst,

2517
02:26:38,260 --> 02:26:41,360
like babies. I was
fucking terrified. I go,

2518
02:26:41,570 --> 02:26:44,180
I said to Brian and then
this Brian, I like, fuck,

2519
02:26:44,181 --> 02:26:47,210
am I going to have to look at his baby
because I'm going to have to pretend like

2520
02:26:47,211 --> 02:26:50,720
if I, someone came to my house and
I go, these are my dogs and they go,

2521
02:26:50,721 --> 02:26:52,850
I fucking hate dogs.
That would bum me out.

2522
02:26:52,851 --> 02:26:56,210
So I'm going to have to be do the
right thing and look at his kid.

2523
02:26:56,211 --> 02:26:57,950
But you didn't fucking
make me look at the kid.

2524
02:26:57,951 --> 02:27:02,800
And I think kids are fucking fascinating,
man. Look not to me. I you say that.

2525
02:27:02,810 --> 02:27:06,230
I know you say that. Well, I mean some
things are, music doesn't fascinate me.

2526
02:27:06,231 --> 02:27:08,500
Kids don't fascinate me.
I look at other things.

2527
02:27:08,510 --> 02:27:11,660
Exactly the same position where you're at.
Dying people fascinate me.

2528
02:27:11,661 --> 02:27:14,360
I fucking love people dying.
The ideas.

2529
02:27:14,390 --> 02:27:18,500
Fascinating idea that there's two
people in the last three shows I've done

2530
02:27:18,590 --> 02:27:22,400
including last night I'm dying of cancer.
He came up like the end.

2531
02:27:22,401 --> 02:27:25,280
The guy was obviously
fucking dying of cancer.

2532
02:27:26,570 --> 02:27:30,530
Great Way to end the show. Some mother
Fucker, but it's not a bad way to end.

2533
02:27:30,710 --> 02:27:31,491
That's a fucking,

2534
02:27:31,491 --> 02:27:36,440
that's exactly the only thing I love about
comedy and the Fan Base I've created,

2535
02:27:36,441 --> 02:27:39,410
the audience that I have is,
that's not rare.

2536
02:27:39,650 --> 02:27:44,650
My shows attract people that are
that fucking out on the fringes or,

2537
02:27:45,401 --> 02:27:50,040
or in the darkest places of
life that come to see me good.

2538
02:27:50,041 --> 02:27:54,200
Not just, but not just there's,
I know a lot of, so, yeah.
No, but I'm saying smart.

2539
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:57,170
We love your shit. I do agree
though that you're, you're,

2540
02:27:57,171 --> 02:28:02,040
you are so honest and so out there and
so, you know, you're, you're, you're,

2541
02:28:02,041 --> 02:28:03,510
you're tapping into it to the point where,

2542
02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:05,880
I don't know,
I'm not on message board,

2543
02:28:05,881 --> 02:28:09,480
but this is fucking such a
suck each other off fest.

2544
02:28:10,270 --> 02:28:12,510
There's going to be three
pages of your message board.

2545
02:28:12,660 --> 02:28:15,450
Why don't you suck each
other's Dicks and board. Yeah.

2546
02:28:15,451 --> 02:28:18,480
You fucking love each other.
Not huggers. Fucking of course.

2547
02:28:18,481 --> 02:28:22,010
Make me hard is in the fucking
background to that. This

2548
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:26,300
is an interesting conversation
backslash none. Hungary. All right.
