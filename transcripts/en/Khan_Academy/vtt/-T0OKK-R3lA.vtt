00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:02.305
Voiceover:So we've plotted two

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:03.881
complex numbers right over here

00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.609
on this argand diagram.

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.234
And what I want to think about is

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:09.810
what if we defined a
third complex number, C,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.468
as being equal to the complex number, A,

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:16.262
minus the complex number, B.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:18.103
What is C going to look like

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:19.982
if we were to write it as just a

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:22.366
sum of its real and imaginary parts

00:00:22.366 --> 00:00:23.734
and what would it look like

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.764
on this argand diagram?

00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:27.860
So let's just first think about this.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.525
So C is...

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:31.084
Let me do that yellow color.

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:34.157
C is equal to A,

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:41.949
which is the same thing as
six plus two i, minus B.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.094
And what is B?

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.885
B is two minus i.

00:00:46.885 --> 00:00:48.622
So when we're subtracting anything,

00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:51.574
we can distribute this negative sign.

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:53.469
And so this would be the same thing...

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.325
This would be equivalant
to six plus two i,

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:03.702
minus two, and then
distributing the negative

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.109
on a negative i, that's
going to be a positive i.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.317
Plus i, just like that.

00:01:08.317 --> 00:01:13.293
And now this is going to be equal to...

00:01:13.293 --> 00:01:15.498
I'll do it right over here.

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:17.389
This is going to be equal to...

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:21.104
We can add the real parts right over here.

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:23.206
We have six minus two.

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:24.966
And so that's going to be four.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:31.621
And then we can add the two i to the i.

00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.382
Which is going to be three i's.

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:35.893
Plus four, plus three i.

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:38.679
And that is the complex number C.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.423
Let's see why that actually makes sense

00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:44.678
when we visualize A and B as vectors.

00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:46.319
So this is B.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.216
When we do A minus B,

00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:51.070
that's essentially the same thing as

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.375
A plus negative B.

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:58.991
So what's negative B going to be equal to?

00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.377
Negative B is going to be equal to

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:03.985
negative two plus i.

00:02:03.985 --> 00:02:07.457
I just multiplied all the
terms by negative one.

00:02:07.457 --> 00:02:08.450
So what does that look like?

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.546
Let's see, negative two plus i

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:13.795
gets us right over there.

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:17.924
And we see we've essentially just flipped

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:19.932
this vector over the origin.

00:02:19.932 --> 00:02:23.445
So this right over here is negative B.

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.404
That is negative B.

00:02:25.404 --> 00:02:26.403
And we've already seen,

00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:27.244
if you're adding two things,

00:02:27.244 --> 00:02:29.188
we're going to add A to negative B.

00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:32.460
So we've plotted A so that
its tail's at the origin

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.243
and its head is right over here.

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:38.499
And then we can take
the tail of negative B,

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.148
put it right over here

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:42.211
and then if we just shift it over,

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:47.101
it goes two to the left and one up,

00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:49.468
it gets to that point right over here.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:51.412
It gets to this point right over there.

00:02:51.412 --> 00:02:56.140
This vector is another way to visualize

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.347
negative B as a vector.

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:01.948
And so where our new head is,

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.627
once we've put the tail
of negative B here,

00:03:03.627 --> 00:03:05.596
where our new head is going to be

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:09.277
the head of our vector C.

00:03:09.277 --> 00:03:15.631
So C is going to be this
vector right over here.

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:17.953
C can be visualized as this
vector right over here.

00:03:17.953 --> 00:03:21.096
And we see that is one, two, three, four,

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:25.217
that is four plus one, two, three i.

00:03:25.217 --> 00:03:27.601
We see that right over there.

00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:28.809
So on one level,

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:30.713
it's kind of straight forward,

00:03:30.713 --> 00:03:32.832
manipulating expressions
and just recognizing

00:03:32.832 --> 00:03:33.736
that you can only add the

00:03:33.736 --> 00:03:35.880
imaginary parts to the imaginary parts

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.824
and the real parts to the real parts.

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:40.049
And if you want to visualize
it on an argand diagram,

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.296
it really is analogous
to subtracting B from A

00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:48.815
is equivalent to adding
the negative of B to A.
