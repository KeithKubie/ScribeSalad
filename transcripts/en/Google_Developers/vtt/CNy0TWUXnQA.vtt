00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.260
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.670
I'm Louis Gray from GDL, joined
today with two great

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.460
guests from the Google
Chrome team to talk

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.670
about Chrome Academy.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.090
It's a brand new event coming
to Google this year.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.690
We're here based in
Mountain View.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.350
So I want to just start it off
by introducing Peter Lubbers

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.500
and Allison Roarty.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.570
Thanks for joining me.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.060
ALLISON ROARTY: Thank you.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.690
LOUIS GRAY: Now Chrome Academy
is, as I mentioned, new.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.425
It's the first time we've
ever done this.

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:27.290
And it's really taken all of
your time the last week, few

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:28.300
weeks past.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.460
Maybe you can give our viewers
on the live stream an

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.370
understanding of what Chrome
Academy is all about.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.250
ALLISON ROARTY: Absolutely.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.510
So Chrome Academy is a week-long
development program

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.890
for university students
who are rising

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.510
sophomores and juniors.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.740
And we're bringing them here to
Google for a week to teach

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.270
them about building web-packaged
Chrome apps.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.990
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.030
PETER LUBBERS: Well, of
course, we're super

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.790
excited about it.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.230
It's been a lot of fun
already this week.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.810
But we also want to show you a
little bit of the reactions

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.840
from the students themselves.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.320
And we created a little
video for them.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.570
LOUIS GRAY: Cool.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.290
JOHN MOORE: I was looking for
internships for this summer

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.350
around spring break of this
year, and I saw that Google

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.340
had a number of programs that
students, rising sophomores

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.510
and juniors, could
be involved in.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.690
I saw Chrome Academy, and it
really caught my attention.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.480
CATHERINE MULLINGS: I did a
summer program last summer

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.560
called Google Computer Science
Summer Institute.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.770
And there they really introduce
students to HTML,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.990
JavaScript, App Engine, and
all these resources.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.080
And just being there for three
weeks, I really enjoyed the

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.250
culture that everyone brought.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.940
Everyone was so excited to
build new technologies.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.030
And so I just thought I should
be at Google again.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.220
CALVIN CHAN: I believe it all
started with one of the career

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.420
fairs at UCLA.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.680
I heard about it, and I went
there to check out a few of

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.180
the companies that were trying
to entice students to apply

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.900
for opportunities.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.960
And I saw the Google booth and
talked to one the recruiters.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.940
He introduced me to several of
the Google programs, and I was

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.970
specially interested in Chrome
Academy because I started

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.550
developing websites during
high school.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.980
And it's definitely something
that I'm very interested in.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.110
JONATHAN POON: I'll just
go ahead and apply.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.470
And then luckily, I got in.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.960
So I was really excited to
be part of this program.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.875
CARA KESSLER: I would say that
my favorite part of the Chrome

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:29.972
Academy experience so far has
been the instructors that I've

00:07:29.972 --> 00:07:31.460
met and that I've gotten
to speak with

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.350
on a personal level.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.310
Before we came to Chrome
Academy, we were encouraged to

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.730
brush up on our skills
a little online.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.730
So I did the Chrome
DevTools school.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.870
And when I clicked on the
introduction video, there was

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.510
Paul Irish explaining how great
Chrome DevTools are.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.170
And then three days later, I'm
at Google, and there's live

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.320
Paul Irish.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.390
CALVIN CHAN: I think one of
the coolest things about

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.590
Chrome Academy is that I
personally am interested in

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.360
the type of courses that
are being offered here.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.810
JONATHAN POON: I think it's
mainly just all the people

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:00.790
that I've met.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.880
They were all very passionate
about what they're doing,

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.250
especially about web
development.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.760
JOHN MOORE: Out of everything,
I like the people that I've

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.360
met more than anything else.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.395
CATHERINE MULLINGS: I guess it's
the professors that we

00:08:13.395 --> 00:08:16.670
bring in and all these big gods
in the industry, and how

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.490
they have all these resources
that are coming together, just

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.740
putting everything and making
all these connections, and

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.810
just feeling the creativity
that comes with that.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.780
It's just really exciting.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.930
CALVIN CHAN: One of the first
things we discussed as a team

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.320
is what technologies we
wanted to use and

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:34.730
incorporate in our app.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.559
And we all decided that we
wanted to use stuff that we

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.010
learned here at Chrome
Academy.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.220
JOHN MOORE: One idea that we had
was to kind of have some

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:48.670
sort of interactive whiteboard
service that could serve as a

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.180
learning platform.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.180
CARA KESSLER: And we're
implementing WebSockets, so

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.190
all of our information
is live.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.480
And when you take a picture,
you click upload on your

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.620
phone, and it's live on the
computer screen waiting for

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.530
you when you get back.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.000
JONATHAN POON: In our projects,
we use several HTML5

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.290
technologies, such as
WebSockets, that allow us to

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.630
have real-time notifications
between all the users of the

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.500
application.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.790
And also, we use getUserMedia
and also for geolocation, so

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.080
users can easily take pictures
and upload them to the server

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.060
and also know exactly where
they took the pictures.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.840
CALVIN CHAN: So we've
implemented some aspects of

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.090
web components and shadow DOMs
using the new Polymer

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.830
technology by Google.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.900
CARA KESSLER: So this has
definitely been an

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.330
unforgettable week.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.350
There are a lot of things I want
to bring back with me.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.290
I took a course in web
development at school this

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.920
year, and I did learn a lot of
cool stuff, but nothing as

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.740
exciting and cutting edge
and new as the stuff

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.880
I've learned here.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.450
JOHN MOORE: I'd have to say that
it's one thing, I think,

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.830
to read about Google and its
company culture and its

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:54.870
company's mission online or to
hear about it third-hand,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.390
friend of a friend.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.150
It's a completely different
experience to have come here

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:04.150
and seen it first person to,
have experienced it, to have

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:08.090
eaten the food, taken the tours,
talked with the people.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.090
I mean, it was just crazy.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.400
I remember the other day, I
think it was yesterday, one of

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.660
the groups was working with
Google Maps on their project.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.910
And they had a question.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.740
And I think it might have been
you, you said, oh, well if you

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.530
have a question, we'll just go
get someone from the Google

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.730
Maps development team to come
answer your question.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.870
And I was like, wow,
no big deal, right?

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.050
Google Maps development team.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.050
CARA KESSLER: I learned HTML5
with the guy who wrote the

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.440
book on HTML5.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.360
CALVIN CHAN: One of the most
inspiring talks we've had this

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.080
week was from Colt about
performance.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.880
And that really hit me because
on campus, I'm part of online

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.980
journalism.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.610
And we focus a lot
on delivering

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.890
content that's reliable.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:52.020
And when he talked about the
fact that users usually leave

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.370
a page after three seconds,
that really hit me.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.960
Like, we can definitely increase
our traffic to the

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.010
"Daily Bruin," which is the
student journalism at UCLA.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.740
We can increase traffic to the
website just by increasing our

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.910
performance and decreasing
our load times.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.200
So I will definitely take what I
learned in that talk back to

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.630
campus and try and improve
what we do there.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.140
JONATHAN POON: What I would tell
someone who's thinking of

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.660
applying is, just do it.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.130
It's a one in a lifetime
experience, and it's awesome.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.760
JOHN MOORE: So if you're
considering applying to Chrome

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.330
Academy, I would encourage you
to, as cliche as it sounds, go

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.050
ahead and submit your
application.

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.900
Because I think that Google sees
potential in everyone.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.340
CARA KESSLER: I would say
definitely apply.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.740
Don't worry about this only
being a week and it taking

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.160
away from your job opportunities
for the rest of

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.060
the summer because
this is Google.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.530
And I have a job waiting for me
back home, but I'm taking a

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.220
week off because this is
a once in a lifetime

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.460
opportunity.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.270
And you will learn more here
than you will possibly in a

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.250
semester at your university.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.130
And just go for it, and you'll
be happy in the end.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:11.710
LOUIS GRAY: That was
an excellent video.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:13.920
It's really good to hear
directly from the students who

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.560
have done the work at Code
Academy and hear from them

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.600
themselves.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.290
So I appreciate you taking the
time to have their input right

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:19.850
into the show.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.040
So thank you very
much for that.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.930
ALLISON ROARTY: Definitely.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.540
LOUIS GRAY: So when I take a
look at Chrome Academy, how

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:25.740
did you come up with
this idea?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.830
This is the first time, so there
had to have been an aha

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.240
moment to really get
this started.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.910
ALLISON ROARTY: Yeah.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.810
Well, essentially, there's a lot
of really exciting things

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.850
happening in the Chrome world
right now, and here at Google,

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.140
we are really passionate about
developing students and

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.170
exposing them to new cutting
edge web technologies.

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.220
And we figured that Chrome
Academy would be a really

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.230
great way to do that.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.160
LOUIS GRAY: And what are they
learning about this week?

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.340
Is it open standards?

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.530
Is it the web as a platform?

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.500
There's really so many different
things we can talk

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.380
about with Chrome that we've
talked about on GDL.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:55.870
PETER LUBBERS: Right.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.260
Exactly.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.160
LOUIS GRAY: So what's
going on?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.580
They've got like three
days, right?

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.780
PETER LUBBERS: No, it's actually
the whole week.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.550
So the students came
on Sunday night.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.450
They were flown in from all over
the United States, from,

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.080
like we said before, the rising
sophomores and juniors,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.640
from colleges everywhere.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.770
And so they came in, did some
fun activities, and they were

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.430
shown the campus and the
Google store and lots

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.550
of other fun stuff.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.480
And then on Monday, we started
the actual program.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.710
And so the program is actually
made up of sort of three

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.630
different components.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.090
The first one would be actually
learning some of the

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.780
new technologies.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:36.750
So we're exposing them to things
like the latest web

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:42.940
technologies, latest HTML5,
Polymer, shadow DOM, some of

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.070
the new languages like Dart
and lots of other exciting

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.250
technology.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.330
Paul Irish was doing
a demonstration of

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.340
the developer tools.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.240
But really, the latest and
greatest that people might

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.910
have seen at I/O, but
that's about it.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.210
LOUIS GRAY: Now I know it's
been a few years since I

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.320
graduated college.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.670
But I don't remember shadow
DOM or any of these things

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.300
being part of the
CS curriculum.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:04.730
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.690
LOUIS GRAY: How would you say
that Chrome Academy introduces

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.070
new concepts to the students?

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:10.190
Are these things that
they're learning in

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:11.720
universities already?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.410
What's being taught and what's
not being taught that we're

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.780
kind of filling the gap on?

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.680
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, and I
think that's part of the

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.920
program that is the mission
behind the program, is really

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.000
to introduce them to the things
that we would like them

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.840
to already know that
they're just not

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840
getting yet in college.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.560
I mean, these things are so new,
to give a little bit of

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.110
credit to the universities, they
could not possibly have

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.410
curriculum on it because
it just doesn't exist.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.610
But here, we can iterate on
that curriculum very fast.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.200
And we've just built a two-hour
code lab on using web

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.660
components in Polymer that
literally was done for the

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.430
very first time by the
students here.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.280
So it's pretty exciting.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.130
They really get to hear from
the people developing the

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.280
specifications, the people that
are writing the code, and

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.230
the things that are just
barely checked in.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.740
So it couldn't possibly
be in any other sort

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:00.795
of curriculum yet.

00:15:00.795 --> 00:15:01.470
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.830
Some of the newness, I think
it actually presents a real

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:05.040
opportunity.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.020
When you write for the web,
you have that kind of open

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.730
standard where you know you
can write it once, and it

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.120
really runs on any platform.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.330
And in the last few decades,
you've seen this transition

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.300
away from software-based
platforms, where you write

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.020
once, and it works on a specific
operating system.

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.715
Are students really grokking
that idea and that idea of

00:15:21.715 --> 00:15:24.410
that portability, and seeing
the opportunity there?

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.360
PETER LUBBERS: I think
more and more.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.650
One of the interesting things
that I've found is in the

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:31.110
past, I've done a lot of
training in HTML5.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:36.040
And we would refer to how it was
bad in the past and then

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.460
give an example of, well, how
the HTML5 technologies would

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.500
make it better.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.290
But what's interesting with
these students, they've never

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.020
really seen those old,
bad ways of doing.

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.050
So they're actually starting
out fresh.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.300
And it's great to start with
some of the newer technologies

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.950
that are abstracting a lot
of these problems.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.490
And basically, it's a much
better experience when you

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.450
don't have to think of all
the things in the past.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.320
LOUIS GRAY: It's kind of like
you say, the best way to stop

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.970
a bad habit is to never get
it in the first place.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.210
PETER LUBBERS: Exactly.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.790
LOUIS GRAY: And so they're
starting exceptionally clean.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.750
It's a very interesting
concept.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.260
PETER LUBBERS: And I think
actually even better here

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.420
than, let's say, starting the
bad habits back with a

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.015
two-year-old curriculum.

00:16:16.015 --> 00:16:16.905
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:16:16.905 --> 00:16:19.430
Now, the Chrome Academy
students themselves.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.850
Is this for engineers only?

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.960
Is it for sophomores
and juniors only?

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.680
What's the criteria to get in?

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.830
How did we find these people
in the first place?

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.010
ALLISON ROARTY: So right now,
it is only for rising

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:32.210
sophomores and juniors.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:32.830
PETER LUBBERS: In college.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:33.260
ALLISON ROARTY: In
college, yes.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.200
And we generally target students
who are computer

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.110
science majors.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:38.920
But for Chrome Academy in
particular, we look for

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.780
students that were strong in
HTML and JavaScript and CSS.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:46.050
So really, anyone who has those
skills, regardless of

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.630
their major, could apply and be

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.180
considered for this program.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:52.030
LOUIS GRAY: The Google hiring
process for full-time jobs has

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.890
traditionally been exceptionally
challenging.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.740
We get written up on
it all the time.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.830
And we know that's a great way
and a great threshold to get

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.220
exceptional people to
join the company.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.440
What kind of recruiting process
and what kind of

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.420
application process do the
students have to do?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.380
Did they have to write code in
advance or say that they've

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.810
learned specific skills?

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.319
ALLISON ROARTY: For Chrome
Academy, we ask for their

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.349
resume and transcript.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.560
So we're interested in what
college courses they've taken

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.339
already and how they've
been doing there.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:20.194
We did ask them three essay
questions, short essays.

00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:22.327
PETER LUBBERS: That
was my idea.

00:17:22.327 --> 00:17:25.349
ALLISON ROARTY: And we also ask
for a link to GitHub or

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.319
wherever they're housing any
work so that we can look at

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.770
work that they've
already done.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:30.400
LOUIS GRAY: And I assume a lot
of the students probably don't

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.830
want to leave Google now
that they're here.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.730
PETER LUBBERS: That's true.

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.880
LOUIS GRAY: And so how have
we thought about that?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.790
How do you get these sophomore
and junior students who need

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.790
to go back and complete
their degree?

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.880
Is this something where they
have a fast track into a

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.260
Google internship program?

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.990
What's the end goal there?

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.740
ALLISON ROARTY: Yeah,
definitely.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.200
And that's what we've
incorporated career

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.170
development components to Chrome
Academy as well, so the

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.430
students have career panels
where we brought in not only

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.810
junior and senior Googlers but
interns as well, who they had

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.090
the opportunity to then ask
them questions about the

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.100
interview process, what's an
internship like, what do you

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.410
wish you knew when you
were in my position.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.540
We also are doing mock interview
sessions with them

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.400
so that they can go through an
actual real Google technical

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.640
interview and get a sneak peek
into what that's like, what we

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.830
look for, so that they
have a better

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.910
idea for how to prepare.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.810
And we're hoping that all 29
students will apply for an

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.560
internship with Google
this fall.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.880
That's definitely our goal.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.940
LOUIS GRAY: The internship's
coming up a lot this summer

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.131
for some reason.

00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:31.890
But I'm hoping we're
able to get back to

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:32.680
how it really works.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.520
ALLISON ROARTY: The real
internship, yes.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.050
LOUIS GRAY: See the movie.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:35.900
It's fun.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.250
But there are some
differences, as I

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.060
always like to say.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.523
PETER LUBBERS: We
do have pudding.

00:18:39.523 --> 00:18:40.706
ALLISON ROARTY: That
might be the only

00:18:40.706 --> 00:18:41.548
thing that is the same.

00:18:41.548 --> 00:18:43.340
LOUIS GRAY: And the
food is free.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.480
But there's other development
programs for students beyond

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:46.940
Chrome Academy.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.375
Can you explain what
those are?

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:48.810
ALLISON ROARTY: Sure.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.730
PETER LUBBERS: Yeah, there's one
that's pretty exciting for

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.320
high school students.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.560
For seniors in high school,
there is the Computer Science

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.990
Summer institute, CSSI.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.800
So that's a great way.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.275
And in fact, a lot
of the students--

00:19:00.275 --> 00:19:02.270
I'm not sure of the
exact breakdown--

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.620
that are in Chrome Academy
were previously in CSSI.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.370
So it's a great track.

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:12.560
That's a three week program
where, again, they get flown

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.410
to Google and have the whole
Google experience, but also

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.610
very code-heavy.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.440
And one thing I didn't mention
earlier was we're not just

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.540
lecturing them on
technologies.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.600
That would be boring.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.080
I mean, it would be exciting,
but hours

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.710
and hours of lecture.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.970
It's--

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.682
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, you've
got to spice it

00:19:30.682 --> 00:19:31.700
up with some variety.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.360
PETER LUBBERS: So we've
actually, right from the

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.490
start, divided them
up in teams.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.090
And they were free to pick
whatever project they wanted

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:40.660
to work on.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.760
But they have to--

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.400
and this is by tomorrow, by
the end of the week--

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.790
come up with a complete
web application.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.930
So they're building that.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.060
And so the first couple days
were pretty lecture-rich, so

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.420
they got see, oh, these
are great frameworks.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.450
I can use them.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.470
These are technologies
I want to use.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.610
They made up their mind, and now
they're building, and now

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.200
it's much more code-heavy.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.260
So we're bringing in experts
to help them when they have

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.110
questions about various parts
of their project.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.580
But tomorrow, it'll be
judging the projects.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.130
And, of course, the winners
can get some prizes.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.070
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, how do
you decide who wins?

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.020
I don't want to give
it away if they

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:18.080
haven't finished their--

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:18.180
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.880
PETER LUBBERS: Oh
no, they know.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.450
ALLISON ROARTY: They know
what we're looking for.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:20.940
PETER LUBBERS: It's a rubric.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.330
LOUIS GRAY: Is it just avoidance
of crash or number

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.680
of installs?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.150
PETER LUBBERS: Well, that's
a baseline, yeah.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:31.220
So there are five categories:
look and feel, creativity, how

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.160
useful it is, how
mobile-friendly it is.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.240
Of course, that's one
of our key things.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.220
So all of these categories, you
can get four points, and

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.130
the winner will be scoring
across the board.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.600
And they're already building
some incredible applications.

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.190
One of them is using WebSockets
and canvas to build

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.890
a whiteboarding solution
for in the class.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:57.385
So that could enhance, for
example, a Udacity course that

00:20:57.385 --> 00:21:02.500
they might be taking, or an
in-class lesson that they're

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.445
doing, where they can
collaborate with their teacher

00:21:05.445 --> 00:21:08.530
or other kids out of--

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.900
WebRTC is used in another one.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.400
Another one's doing a great
scavenger hunt game.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.030
And from what I've seen so far,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.520
I've been super impressed.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.630
LOUIS GRAY: You're not tipping
your hand on your

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:18.430
favorites, are you?

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:19.680
PETER LUBBERS: No, no, no.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.780
It's wide open.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.770
ALLISON ROARTY: And with all of
our programs, just like at

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.680
Google, we're launch
and iterate.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.350
We're very focused
on building.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.630
And we want our programs
to be the same way.

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.150
So these programs are in
no way theoretical.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.410
Like Peter said, we're
not just lecturing.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.470
We're not just telling them
about these technologies.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.640
We're challenging them to build
something in a week with

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.070
a technology that they've
never seen before.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.380
And that's what we
do across all of

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.190
our development programs.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.940
PETER LUBBERS: And the resources
that are available--

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.930
this was also mentioned by one
of the kids in the video--

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.230
there's when that
had a question

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.010
about Google+ Sign-In.

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.510
They wanted to add
it to their page.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.140
We literally just walked
upstairs, grabbed someone--

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.370
here, come and help.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.090
And Chris Cartland came out
and instantly helped them.

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.910
Then he got on the bus
and went home.

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:08.690
LOUIS GRAY: That's one
exceptional thing I enjoy,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.670
especially being at Google
on Developer Relations.

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.520
We have the access to people
on every single team.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.192
And so if you want to reach
somebody from Google+, you

00:22:15.192 --> 00:22:15.940
know who they are.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.495
You know how to reach them
from Chrome and Android.

00:22:17.495 --> 00:22:20.240
And it's a really exceptional
network within what we call a

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.990
medium-sized company
here at Google.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:25.140
And I've already seen a lot of
people really interested in

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.740
the next Chrome Academy.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.370
Like, when is the next
one happening?

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:31.110
Maybe there's already
ideas for changes,

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.780
how to make it better.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.650
Is it going to be bigger?

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.380
Zach from Sacramento was
asking about the

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.240
dates for next year.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.030
Maybe we can tell him.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:39.980
ALLISON ROARTY: We don't
have the dates for

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.390
next year quite yet.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.580
I would say for anyone who's
interested, check the Google

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.680
Students site,
google.com/students.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.010
And that information should
be available around

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:52.490
the end of the year.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:53.760
LOUIS GRAY: And one
more question came

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.160
through Google Moderator.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.790
What about the seniors?

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.600
Why sophomores and juniors?

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.830
PETER LUBBERS: Well, we
want the seniors to

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.580
already be our interns.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.010
LOUIS GRAY: So they should
already be here.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.350
PETER LUBBERS: They should be
there in another capacity.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.950
LOUIS GRAY: But where can
people find out more

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:12.970
information about Chrome
Academy online?

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.420
PETER LUBBERS: So that's
on your students site.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:14.640
ALLISON ROARTY: Yep.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.770
So google.com/students has more
information about Chrome

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.060
Academy, Android camp, Computer
Science Summer

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.000
institute, and the rest of our
fabulous internship and

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.960
development program
opportunities.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.260
PETER LUBBERS: And for people
that are listening and

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:30.100
watching that want to get
it, that are interested,

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.100
obviously, one of the things,
the application wasn't just

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:36.755
your resume.

00:23:36.755 --> 00:23:40.790
It was also an essay about
why you want to come.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:45.120
Also, links to your GitHub
repository, if you have one.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.680
And those things tend to
weigh pretty heavy.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.310
There's also a letter
of recommendation.

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.455
So already, if you're thinking
about it, try to have some of

00:23:53.455 --> 00:23:56.550
those things in mind that you
can work towards it, not at

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.340
the last minute have to
pull that together.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.820
And start doing some of
our online course.

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.610
So, of course, we're
on GDL right now.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.070
But this is also where you would
come to find information

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.290
about all of the stuff we're
doing in Chrome, Chrome

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.590
packaged app series and mobile
and we've got the break point

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.960
with Paul Irish and Addy Osmani
talking about all of

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.730
the great things you can do.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.440
So get familiar with the
technology I would say this is

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.580
very important.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.850
And we definitely look at people
that have not just an

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.930
interest, but have actually
experimented with it.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.750
LOUIS GRAY: When you talk about
the resources there, one

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.970
thing that really comes to
mind, besides all of the

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.780
Google Developers Live videos
we're doing, but also things

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:38.290
like web platform docs,
the Udacity courses.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.660
I think one thing that's
interesting about Google, it's

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.580
about finding the information
and making it available and

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:44.560
accessible.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.180
And you look at exactly what
we're doing here with Chrome

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.070
Academy, that you can come in
fully loaded, knowing all

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.760
about each one of these
standards, knowing about how

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.350
they interact with the web
platform and how to make your

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.940
own custom applications.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.410
So I want to say thank you very
much, Allison and Peter,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.120
for taking the time not only
to put together Chrome

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.350
Academy, but to take the
exceptional time to join us

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.220
here on Google Developers
Live.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.610
For those of you joining us on
the stream, you can find all

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.580
this information at
developers.google.com/live.

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.250
And if you like what you see,
subscribe to Google Developers

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.710
on YouTube, and we'll see you
next time here in the studio.
