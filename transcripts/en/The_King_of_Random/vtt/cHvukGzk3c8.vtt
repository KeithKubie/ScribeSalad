00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Did it go out? I feel like it just went out.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.960
there it is (X2)

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.420
Whats up guys!

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.900
I'm back out here again with my good friend,

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.820
Matt pat from game theory. yep!

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.540
Wet Wild and ready to science!

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.689
we are down here with an experiment requested by TripleTrouble who wants to know what if you mix thermite with water and try to

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.440
Light it off. Great question it also is a question that I was looking to answer, how could Mario throw fireballs,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.280
Underwater for a scientific thing I've been wondering about for a while, so today

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.839
We're killing two birds with one stone to make this happen

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.359
I went on Amazon or some of these colored tennis balls

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.419
And the idea is we're going to mix up a fresh batch of thermite use an improvised funnel to fill these balls up light them

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.890
Off with a sparkler and run a number of tests and hopefully not get arrested on a public beach along the way.

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:42.750
Tell us again Matt,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.520
What is your interested in actually seeing a thermite ball burn underwater? when it comes to video games,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.060
Mario's fireball ability and how we want to fire balls underwater is probably one of videogames' weirdest

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.180
Scientific myths right because fire and water in real life just don't mix. So is there a way

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.309
Today that we can prove that you can light a fire under water.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.340
And this is really interesting thought because we know that the thermite itself burns around 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.439
Water seems to extinguish every fire that we put into it, right?

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.329
So what happens when the two extremes mix and furthermore if you wet thermite in Advance?

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.569
Can you even get it to let off at all what I'm wondering here?

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.699
Matt is once we've packed the thermite into a tennis ball

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.500
It's going to be confined does that mean it's going to just burn normally or do you think it's going to explode?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.439
I think it's going to burn normally that's my prediction, but there's only one way to find out. I think so.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.809
So let's go mix up a batch of thermite pour these things in and throw in some sparklers getting ready to let up. create some

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.780
Underwater Fireballs. Mario eat Your heart out.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:57.480
*Epic Chemical Mixing MONTAGE!!!*

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.900
So just a quick update here guys,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.500
We've finished mixing up three parts of rust powder with one part of aluminum powder to create our thermite.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.579
I'm thinking we've got three different experiments here

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.419
We've got the one where we just fill it up with thermite and light it off to see how it reacts when it's dry

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.919
The second experiment we're going to Soak it to see how it reacts when it's wet yep, and for our grand finale

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.930
We're going to fill one of these things up light it on fire

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.180
And then drop it into a fish tank full of water to see how this stuff reacts completely submerged.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.780
Hopefully thus creating our underwater fireball. let's put it to test and see if we can make it work.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.720
I'm a scale of danger from one to ten, what would you put this at? I'm going to put this up there to solid ten. wow!

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.610
This is dangerous that is that is some quality youtube science thing going on!

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.300
That's why we're doing on a public beach with lifeguard supervision.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.960
*Ball cutting for thermite*

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.140
Hoo, resilient.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.620
*pop*

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.060
Yeah, there we go. That's a satisfying pop.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.300
*showcasing ball*

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.940
Cool

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.500
*Cutting cup for funnel*

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.300
Got it! there's our improvised funnel for the win.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.280
*Stuffing cup top into ball for funnel mechanics*

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.880
Oh that's cute that looks pretty cute

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.760
(his name is steve.)

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.080
Look at that good job, Matt. You know what it looks like as an improvised Badminton birdie. Woo!

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.540
Oh, we got a built-in scoop. Woow.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.260
Now, we just take it in I'm thinking. yeah.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.299
Okay, that's delicious. Yeah, that's going to be super safe. There's quite a bit in there

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.879
It's almost almost filled to the top. that is loaded up there. There we go. There's one ball. Set that down

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.879
We may as well pack the other ones while we're here.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.709
Matt Pat is a natural thermite grenade maker.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.828
Let's let's not spread the word about that one too widely Jeff we don't want to get put on any watch lists.

00:03:40.828 --> 00:03:42.060
*laughter*

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.040
*balls with fireworks in the thermite for ignition*

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.390
All right here. We go guys experiment number one. This is our dry thermite

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.859
We're putting this to the test just to see how it reacts in an environment that we understand right?

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.030
It's kind of the control of this experiment. So we know that this is going to light up,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.560
We just want to see how big is. There it goes, run away.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.800
*Running from the dangerous grenade ball of thermite*

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.220
*waiting*

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:13.160
*Thermite ignites, causing it to become a fountain of fire*

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.300
Little bit of smoke, right?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.980
*Tons of black smoke*

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.600
There we go. I was wondering if it actually pick up.

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.579
*buries ball with sand for maximum effect of extinguishing effect*

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.569
Now you're just going to bury that with sand to get rid of the smoke. come check this out.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.060
So just throwing in a little bit of sand there to kind of help cool it down,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.360
but if we dig that back out, we're going to find,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.820
A hot pile of Molten iron. Oh and apparently a part of a quesadilla. look at that right there.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.700
Incredible this is what's left of our tennis ball.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.719
That's our tennis ball in that molten iron? That right there has molten iron in itt

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.160
Wow, it's covered in slag and the Molten iron is like buried on the inside like a gem.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.940
Incredible so let's talk about what just happened there Matpat. Please do!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.420
So at first I didn't think that Sparkler was going to light it off.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.400
It went below the line of the tennis ball, and it seemed to fizzle out yeah, and just when all hope was lost...

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.000
SPEW!!

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.720
Right it will erupted back up and just for a brief moment in time would say about one or two seconds

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.240
it was spraying almost like a fireworks spray a fireworks fountain,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.880
Of sparks about five or six thousand degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.960
in your direction in my direction right in my general Direction.

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:29.069
Now that was incredible because it looks the tennis ball itself is pretty much disintegrated. if you feel that even five minutes later

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.979
You can see this is quite warm. wow it is Super hot.

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.139
It's got an interesting texture to it. A lot of its burned away.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.939
And you could see the tennis ball burning into a billow of black smoke. Yeah, you can even smell it.

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.909
You can still smell the like burning rubber yeah, yeah.

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.409
So to put out the fire the only thing we can do really is pour sand on top that extinguish the fire.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.380
But you can see when we dug this back up we had a glowing piece of iron.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.600
Sitting on top of our pile of sand which even right now is extremely extremely hot yeah.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.549
You can you could actually hear the like sand popping off of it. So yeah digging down here a little bit more,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.630
I don't know. What if this is from us, but there's another piece right there.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.070
another piece right there.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:12.089
This sand right here feels incredibly hot. at least some parts. Yeah. I feel like oh roll right down here

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:14.060
I felt it right here. It's like you hit hot pop.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.900
Yeah, where there's little little layers of heat yeah, and you can smell that as I dig into the sand.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.530
Whooo yeah you can.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:28.899
So we are love the smell of thermite in the afternoon. We are cleaning the beaches leave the beach How you found it.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.610
Only mild people leave it. Don't leave your thermite behind yeah geez guys come on.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.610
This is the remnants of our Mara

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.269
Fireball in open air. right so I think the next thing is to light it off and submerge it in water

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.700
And see what kind of a difference that makes.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.630
Let's do that next.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.700
See if I was a koopa, I would totally be afraid of that. I'm not a Koopa,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.760
I'm a human. I'm totally afraid of that, so.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.620
legitimate weapon option good job Mario good job! *thumbs up*

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.440
*submerges ball trying to get the thermite wet*

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.060
I say that's pretty wet. Oh yeah.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.390
That's as wet as it gets. Right just like wet sand.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.119
Actually, it's kind of resilient like it's not really soaking in a whole lot.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.859
Scoop that let it sit in there a little bit longer, okay?

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.940
So here you go guys experiment number two will wet thermite light off

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.419
We soak this in an aquarium full of water until it's about as thoroughly

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.409
Constituted with water as they can get it almost looks like a red mud at this point

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:32.820
So we're sticking our sparkler set it down the sand light it and run away.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.400
Run away as best as we can yes.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:48.500
*Running in the background but camera stays close for a good look*

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:55.200
Nothing. It looks like that just went out. Yeah just went out. I didn't see anything nothing. I mean that's kind of what I expected.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.539
It would have to dry out the water first and the amount of energy it takes to actually

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.920
Vaporize the water it is a lot more than one of these sparklers can deliver. exactly. so theoretically

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.580
Like in order to light off wet thermite you'd have to

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.900
Dry it out with heat which in turn just defeats the purpose

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.599
Right because that was the beginning of then it's no longer wet. Yeah, and then it's no longer

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.230
Wet thermite which was what we were setting out to prove. that's right. All right guys

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.909
This is the big kahuna of the grand finale. We have this tennis ball that we're going to light it is dry

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:27.980
So we know that it's going to go off right and just does it start sparking. I'm going to drop that down into our

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.639
Do I really want to drop it or should I suspend it for some kind of string?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.150
I think you could suspend it from a string body like you're literally

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.269
Holding a bowl of thermite in your hand as it's about to go off.

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.200
Although although the purpose of experiments to see if Wets thermite will burn

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:47.240
And so once we know that it's burning if we drop it and it continues to burn it'll prove that point.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.860
I mean, I'll prove the point but that says nothing about the safety and security of your hand, right.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.329
Yeah, well I am willing to put my hands on the line for you today. We're going to take this ball

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.280
We're going to light it off until we see Sparks starting to fly

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.160
I'm going to drop it in the aquarium, and we will observe whether or not it continues to burn. *Matt Patt really thinks he's nuts at this point*

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.420
I mean while you're testing it in the process if you do it that way you are testing whether or not like a mario type figure could

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.770
throw a ball like this.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:10.770
and this is

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:17.449
Important information to know this is let's put it to the test these are the most important questions that video gamers since the 80s needed

00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:20.980
To know whoo, all right get pumped you're a braver man than I.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:33.800
*Experiment with the ball getting submerged underwater while it's lit*

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.560
Moment of truth!

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.560
*more waiting*

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.380
*flinches*

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.500
Is the thermite-

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.000
Wait for it.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.740
It's getting close.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.600
Did it go out?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.980
I feel like it just went out.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.140
Becarefu- There it is X2!

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:56.440
*shocked squel*

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.340
Oh my god... Whoa!

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:07.200
Look at that. Wow wow careful careful where you kneel down careful?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400
Ho ho ho. (Santa?)

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:10.240
That was amazing!

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.420
Oh, my goodness guys. Did you just literally witness what happened there?

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.350
I stood like I thought it had gone out me too, and then as soon as you like turn

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:24.300
It towards you it just lights up. I thought it starts sparking that's when I know the thermite was going in full force

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.159
Yeah, dropped it into the water and it did not go out. No it did not go in fact

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.980
I almost think it like the reaction

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.000
Accelerated. you can see that burning underwater as dirty as this water is you could see it burning.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.490
Yeah

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.980
Absolutely, and then the tennis ball floated to the top and continued to burn where I quickly try to submerge it with a stick.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.730
Right yeah the ball. I think the ball itself was one of the things I wasn't expecting

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.259
I thought loaded with that mixture of metallic powders that it would definitely sink to the bottom.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:57.270
yeah, but no it kept it afloat the entire time so you just had this like bubbling burning mass of thermite at the surface of

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.739
The water. underwater, right I've got one more should we light that off just for fun. I think so!

00:11:01.739 --> 00:11:02.350
Of course! :D

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.380
It's action time yeah here comes the calm before the storm right there it is

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.140
OH!

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.600
There we go, whoo

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.589
So what we've learned for this experiment is that wet thermite itself will not ignite

00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:29.989
It actually takes a substantial amount of heat to vaporize the water before it will light off, but once it actually is lit

00:11:29.989 --> 00:11:30.600
*dab*

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.649
It's very very difficult to extinguish. it will not go out

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.769
Even under water, it will continue to burn. so when the fireball travel as far as we see Mario's throw them under water no probably

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:41.769
not but for Short-range combat,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:48.660
Underwater thermite fireball definitely a viable option. but you saw it here on the beaches of California,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.020
Underwater thermite fireballs

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.040
absolutely a

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.250
Scientific fact and of course a huge shout-out to TripleTrouble for leaving this suggestion in the comments below and go ahead and check

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.840
Your YouTube inbox because we are sending you 25 bucks!

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.940
CHACHIIIING!

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:07.900
But remember that's just a theory. a random theory. thanks for watching.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.680
There's the b-roll action for you.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.060
Oh look at this!

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.400
We got our balls back.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.180
Whoo!

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:23.000
Geez and there's actually iron inside look at this. Oh wow it's also worth noting the aquarium is actually cracked is it yeah, oh

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:28.489
No way the heat from the burning thermite actually cracked the aquarium..

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.339
Hey guys one more thing. Let's go ahead and show our friend

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:36.439
Matt pat some love by clicking this little button down in the right hand corner. that will subscribe you to game theorists where we just

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.560
posted a new video on

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:42.289
Pokemon fire swirled in real life so go check out their video leave a comment that you came from the king of random,

00:12:42.329 --> 00:12:44.329
I'll see you there.
