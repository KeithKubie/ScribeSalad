00:00:04.735 --> 00:00:07.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: Today I'm
having coffee with Adam Dawes

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.000
to talk about user identity
on the Google platform

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.569
and what's new in our
Sign In with Google APIs.

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.110
Tell us what is it that you do
and what are you working with.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.276
ADAM DAWES: I lead Google's
Federated Identity team.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:21.260
And what I do is I try to build
seamless experiences for users

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.260
off of Google.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.840
So going to any
third-party app, users

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.480
that have a Google
account, but also

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.170
just to really help
developers in the ecosystem

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.159
build extremely simple
identity experiences.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.880
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now starting
with Google Play Services 8.3,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.920
I can really see how
you've simplified the API.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.916
Can you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:40.290
ADAM DAWES: Google
Sign In, we've

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.010
gone through and
kind of basically

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.610
redone the whole API, the
whole service from top

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.060
to bottom over the last year.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.870
Some of the things that we've
really focused on is trying

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.960
to decouple from
the Google+ Sign In,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.620
that launch from
a few years ago,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.440
and to make it radically simpler
for both users and developers

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.520
as they build their
sign in experiences.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: Users had
a lot of interim screens

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.323
that they had to go through
to be able to sign in.

00:01:04.323 --> 00:01:05.880
And now that's been
cut drastically.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.330
ADAM DAWES: Yeah, I think
the landscape's changed a lot

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.580
over the last couple of years.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.370
And users are a
lot more sensitive

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.590
to privacy and the
information that they give.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.830
So we're trying to
lead towards a model

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.340
where the user just gives
the bare bones information

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.930
to the app and has a super low
friction experience signing

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.095
into to the app.

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.940
And so we've recentered
Google Sign In around that.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.212
Can I show you what
we're talking about here?

00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:30.170
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.940
ADAM DAWES: So let me show
you the Runkeeper app here

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.050
that has implemented the
latest Google Sign In API.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.020
So the experience now,
once the user taps that,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.260
they get this new UI,
which includes what

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.280
we call account chips here.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.380
Now before, with the Google+
sign in, they got this really

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.350
big consent screen with
tons of words on it,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.740
lots of cognitive overload.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.656
It had switches and
controls about which circles

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:57.780
they wanted to share with--

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.071
LAURENCE MORONEY: I love the
phrase cognitive overload.

00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:02.810
ADAM DAWES: Yes, it was
complicated for the end user.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.220
So what we have here
with the account

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.449
chips is what we call a "what
you see is what you give"

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.310
consent flow.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.960
So all the user needs to
do is tap on the profile

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.947
that they want to log
in as, and they're done.

00:02:15.947 --> 00:02:17.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
those are the profiles

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.280
that are already on the phone?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.321
ADAM DAWES: That's right.

00:02:20.321 --> 00:02:23.460
The user signs into the phone
with their Google account.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.600
And then that provides
which accounts

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.844
they can log into on the app.

00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:29.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Good thing you've made

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.850
it so much easier for users.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.730
How about developers?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.360
I know there's
new APIs out there

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.310
and they're supposed to make it
easier and that kind of stuff.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.875
So how does a
developer get started

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:39.540
and how does a developer take
advantage of all of this?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.910
ADAM DAWES: We've totally
transformed the APIs from top

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.490
to bottom.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.460
And we've centered them
around OpenID Connect.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.164
So this is the new
authentication standard.

00:02:49.164 --> 00:02:50.580
It came out a
couple of years ago.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.810
And it's really
where the industry

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.430
is moving to have a very common
language for doing identity

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.270
from one IDP to another.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.890
And so every app doesn't
have to reinvent, oh, I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.030
have to talk to this IDP
this way, this IDP that way.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.072
It's all just consistent.

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:07.363
LAURENCE MORONEY: And needing
all that interoperability

00:03:07.363 --> 00:03:09.290
can lead to potential
security holes, right?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.240
ADAM DAWES: Exactly-- exactly.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.040
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So that consistency

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.880
makes you more secure.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.963
ADAM DAWES: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:12.963 --> 00:03:14.840
But the real innovation
behind OpenID Connect

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.910
is this thing called
the identity token.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.820
It's a blob of JSON
that is signed.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.650
So when you go through
that experience

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.300
and you tap on the
account you want

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.260
to log in as, that signal
goes back to Google.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.010
And then Google sends out an
identity token back to the app.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.860
And that identity
token, this blob of JSON

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.490
basically has the user's
email address, their name,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.220
a couple of other--
their Google ID,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.800
their Google identifier,
not user facing,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.000
but is a unique
identifier for that user.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: Because they
can change their email address

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.580
but keep the same identities.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.413
ADAM DAWES: Exactly.

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:54.050
So that will tie them together
with that carbon life form

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.777
as it goes through those
different manifestations.

00:03:56.777 --> 00:03:58.110
And then it's stamped by Google.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.180
It's signed by Google.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.280
And so that's super important
because then the app

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.450
knows for sure that that
Google user was really

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.190
there on that device.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.720
And the ID tokens
are super portable.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.870
So the app itself can pull out
all the information of the user

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.800
and personalize the app
and show the profile photo

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.410
and the user's name in the app.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.320
And then it can send that
ID token back to its server.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.970
And it can do that
with its API calls,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.210
which you outlined really
well in your blog post.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.060
LAURENCE MORONEY: Thank you.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.559
ADAM DAWES: Then
on the server side,

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.110
it can verify that,
again, Google signed this,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.440
and that that Google user was
really there on that device.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.099
And so it makes security a
lot simpler for developers.

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.390
And again, they don't have
to reinvent the wheel again.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
it's really important

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.640
that it's effectively the
same API infrastructure

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.560
on both the mobile
device and on the server,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.590
using the same thing.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.370
Because the more
things that you use,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.620
the greater the potential
attacks are for this, right?

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.630
And having this
consistency is really cool.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.463
ADAM DAWES: Exactly.

00:04:54.463 --> 00:04:59.230
So we've rebuilt the client
SDKs around OpenID Connect.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.870
And it's super
simple to pull out

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.100
that ID to hook in so you
can send it to your server,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.030
or you can just talk to the
SDKs to get out the JSON

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.950
so you can personalize
your app right then

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.430
and there in context.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.330
And just a much simpler
experience, not, again,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.340
tied in with all of the
social stuff as much.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.970
So if all you want
to do with sign in

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.040
is just sign the
user in, then we've

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.066
made that path much
more straightforward

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:25.900
for the developer.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: One question--
change of course for a second--

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.430
but one question
we've heard a lot

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.590
and we've seen on Stack Overflow
is with iOS and the problems

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.810
with using this technology,
using Google Sign In technology

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.440
with iOS.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.300
But that's a thing
of the past now.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.380
ADAM DAWES: Yes, very thankfully
that is a thing of the past.

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.600
So some apps had
had some trouble

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.870
with Apple, apps that had been
using Google Sign In, Apple

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.840
didn't like the fact
that we were popping out

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.780
to Safari to do
the sign in event,

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.160
which we feel very strongly
about from a security

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.744
perspective because that's where
the user actually understands

00:05:59.744 --> 00:06:01.410
where they're putting
their credentials,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.460
because they can see in the URL
that they're going to Google.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.980
But it seems like
they agreed that that

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.740
was an important thing for
the user to be able to do.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.790
So they invented Safari
View Controller in iOS 9.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.410
And so iOS 9 has much better
navigation characteristics.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.460
It is much more in line
with the application.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.310
It just comes in on the side.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.120
And the user can't get lost.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.240
The user can't go elsewhere.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.040
Once they have a
web browser open,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.370
it's much more tied to the app.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.210
But it has all the
benefits of Safari

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.720
where the user sign in
state, if they've already

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.780
logged into safari, you
actually get a true single sign

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.480
in experience.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.580
If that user's already
logged into Google,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.721
then all it is is a single
tap, just like I showed you,

00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.720
where the user doesn't
have to sign in to Google

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.580
all over again.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: A great hidden
benefit to all this of course

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.915
is that you don't have to build
all the security infrastructure

00:06:57.915 --> 00:07:00.900
yourself and manage and maintain
security infrastructure, given

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.555
the environment that
we live in today.

00:07:02.555 --> 00:07:04.930
But if I'm a developer and I
want to get started on this,

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.056
where should I get started?

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:07.304
What's the best site to go to?

00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:08.620
Other than my blogs, of course.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.330
ADAM DAWES: Well, that is
a great place to start.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.030
But you want to go to
developers.google.com/identity.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.630
And that outlines how you
do Google Sign In and Smart

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.380
Lock for Passwords, as well as
Google Identity Toolkit, which

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.000
all this auth stuff is still
probably more complicated

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.140
and requires more time than
many developers want to spend.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.205
And so Google Identity
Toolkit is like your log

00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:33.500
in system in a box.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.708
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:35.640
It's your best friend.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.390
ADAM DAWES: Right.
