00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.620
Scientists have figured out how to edit DNA
with a light switch.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.311
That’s a switch activated by light, not
the literal switch like on your wall.

00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:10.190
We haven’t figured that out yet…

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.170
Probably.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.429
Hi everyone, Julian for DNews.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:24.239
Way way back in the year 2012, scientists
started using a gene editing tool called CRISPR/Cas9.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.029
The system worked by harnessing a protein
that bacteria use to protect themselves against

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.029
viruses.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.190
Yes, bacteria can get viruses, it’s a tough
world on the cellular level.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.110
Anyway, this defense worked by intercepting
the virus’ DNA with Cas9, a nuclease, or

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.700
protein that can cut DNA.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.890
The Cas9 is guided by a strand of RNA that
matches some sequence on the virus DNA.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.050
Once it locks on to that section of DNA, Cas9
chops it like Gordon Ramsay.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.210
Probably makes the virus cry too.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.930
I think you see where this is going; if we
just rejigger the guide RNA, we can edit the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.700
DNA of anything: crops, animals… people.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.860
And that’s exactly what we set to doing.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.659
CRISPR is simple and ingenious, plus it can
edit several genes at once.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.289
It can edit the DNA of cultured cells or a
fertilized egg, meaning entire animals can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:10.289
be altered.

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.650
Because of this, the CRISPR technique has
found widespread use in the short time since

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.650
its invention.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.670
By the end of 2014 600 research papers had
been published mentioning CRISPR.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.490
Private companies are looking to treat cystic
fibrosis and sickle cell anemia by changing

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.310
just one base pair in the DNA of cells in
patients’ bone marrow.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.729
And this is where the ethical issue comes
in.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.969
Is it safe and is it ethical to edit the germline
of a human being?

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.680
After all if you edit the DNA of a person
before they’re born, you’re not just editing

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.070
that person but all their offspring.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.170
What if a mutation given to them for short-term
benefit turns out to have unforeseen consequences

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.220
in the long run?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.429
And is it crossing a line to edit an embryo's
DNA to change how that person might look or

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.789
think before they have a say in the matter?

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.469
The ethical questions are tough and it’s
up to us as a society to figure out what we

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.119
think is right or wrong.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.909
Personally I think so long as we don’t end
up with splicers or Indominus rexes, we’re

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
mostly good.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.409
But the safety issues are a matter of science,
and we’re making progress there.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.890
One problem a recent study using CRISPR revealed
is the nuclease may not be accurate enough.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.750
The study published in Protein and Cell used
CRISPR to modify genes in human embryos that

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.280
would cause a blood disorder.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.640
The embryos wouldn’t make it to term anyway
because they were fertilized with two sperm

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.140
each, but still an unacceptably low number
of them survived and carried on the new genes.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.250
If we’re going to use this technique on
future people, that number has to be near

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.480
100%.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.010
Part of the problem was it appears the Cas9
was off target and modified some genes it

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.010
wasn’t supposed to.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.650
You’ll recognize this as the beginning of
every zombie movie ever.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.340
But this problem may have just been solved
by Alexander Deiters from the University of

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.340
Pittsburgh.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.830
Deiters and colleagues have created a Cas9
with an amino acid swapped out for a light-activated

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.830
analog.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.160
This means the Cas9 isn’t fully shaped until
a light is shined on it.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.400
Once it’s in the right place you hit it
with a spotlight, it changes shape, allowing

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.840
it to do its job and boom: high precision
gene editing is now possible.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.590
The long-term effects and ethical issues remain
to be resolved but one hurdle to making the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.810
technique safer has just been cleared.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.520
We may be new to the DNA editing game but
that little double helix has been splicing

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.080
and dicing for millennia.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.460
Julia explains how virus DNA is part of you
here.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:27.370
What are your thoughts on editing human embryos
and DNA?

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.880
Is everything on the table or is it totally
off limits?

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.590
How do you define the gray area in between?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.140
