00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:11.826
&gt;&gt;Marc Benioff: It is my
greatest pleasure to be able

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:16.616
to bring this program to you today,
and I hope that the experience

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:23.056
that you have with George Lucas and
Bob Thurman in conversation will be

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.686
as transformation for
you in your lives

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:29.906
and in your organizations
as it has been for me.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:33.886
These are truly two of the great
people we have in the world.

00:00:34.196 --> 00:00:38.406
So please welcome George
Lucas and Robert Thurman.

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:47.266
&gt;&gt;Audience: [applause]

00:00:47.766 --> 00:00:49.656
&gt;&gt;George: I didn't
enjoy school very much.

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:52.876
Occasionally I would come up with
a teacher who would inspire me,

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:57.916
but as I got older and I began
to work with computer technology

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.946
and telling stories
through film I began

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:04.326
to wonder why couldn't we
use these new technologies

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:06.856
to help improve the
educational process?

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:11.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since 1991 the George
Lucas Educational Foundation has

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:14.686
chronicled what works
in public education.

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:16.446
&gt;&gt;Noel: Imagine education
at its best,

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:20.086
and imagine bringing the resources
of George Lucas to document it.

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: We offer
our award-winning media

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:26.916
on several platforms including
documentary films, Edutopia magazine,

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:31.926
and our website edutopia.org
showcasing ideal learning

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:34.536
environments, providing
concrete examples

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:37.596
of how technology is
creating new opportunities

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:39.056
for teaching and learning.

00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:41.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So you want to
put your GPSs up this way.

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:44.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: We focus on
five key topic areas.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:46.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What you need to
do is you rescale it so that-

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:49.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Project
learning: students engage

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.736
in rigorous real-world projects
to learn core subject matter

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.536
and achieve deeper understanding.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:02:00.126
Cooperative learning: students
learn to collaborate, communicate,

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:02.546
and resolve conflicts
by working together.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:04.756
&gt;&gt;Student: This represents
the scales of the alligator.

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Integrated studies:

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.836
isolated individual
subjects are presented

00:02:09.836 --> 00:02:13.196
in an interdisciplinary fashion
that reflects modern knowledge

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:14.956
and how students learn best.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:16.686
&gt;&gt;Student: Nothing can stop us.

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:18.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Comprehensive assessment.

00:02:19.036 --> 00:02:19.906
&gt;&gt;Student: Transportation--

00:02:20.986 --> 00:02:23.586
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Assessments measure
the full range of student ability

00:02:23.586 --> 00:02:27.616
through multiple measures including
portfolios, performances, and tests.

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:29.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Writing, you're
making steady progress.

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:33.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teachers: teachers
provide the human touch,

00:02:33.026 --> 00:02:35.386
the most valuable element
in education

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:38.076
by nurturing the students'
interests and confidence.

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:39.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Look how smart you are.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: All of our media
comes together at edutopia.org,

00:02:43.176 --> 00:02:47.816
a deep archive of constantly
updated information available free

00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:51.036
on demand to a worldwide audience.

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:54.226
We offer everything from
classroom tips for teachers,

00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:57.006
to tools for district-wide change.

00:02:57.416 --> 00:02:59.066
And we invite users to join

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:01.736
in the discussion offering
their own suggestions

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:04.336
and insights for improving education.

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:07.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Doctor, I was just
curious how would this surgery differ

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.326
if somebody already
had a bypass surgery?

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:10.206
&gt;&gt;Doctor: Good question.

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:12.646
Fundamentally it's
the same operation.

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:14.906
&gt;&gt;George: The Educational Foundation
has really become dedicated

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.666
to taking all the best
ideas that are out there

00:03:17.666 --> 00:03:19.956
that people are actually
experimenting with in the real world

00:03:20.346 --> 00:03:24.166
and disseminating that information
to anybody who wants it or needs it.

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:27.036
&gt;&gt;Ryan: Edutopia has been a
resource that I've grasped

00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:30.766
onto as an administrator and somebody
who truly believes in the power

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:32.946
of integrating technology
in the classroom.

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:36.356
The video clips in particular
on the website connected

00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:39.756
to the stories offer
a powerful message.

00:03:39.756 --> 00:03:41.046
&gt;&gt;Students: [speaking Japanese]

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:45.976
&gt;&gt;Marco: It shows you examples
of how it's working in places

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:49.266
where people thought they
wouldn't work or schools

00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:50.666
that have challenges like mine.

00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:54.506
They go out and discover the gold and
they share it with everybody else.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:56.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Beautiful and we're
going to bring it right over here.

00:03:57.026 --> 00:03:59.046
&gt;&gt;Student: Are we going
to have enough room

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:01.426
for the whole webpage
just from that one line?

00:04:02.056 --> 00:04:02.996
&gt;&gt;George: I strongly believe

00:04:03.116 --> 00:04:05.906
that education is the
single most important job

00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:07.816
that the human race has.

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:11.256
I'm very excited that we have
been able to find a little spot

00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:14.886
in the educational community where we
can help give people the tools they

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:16.406
need to go into their own community

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:23.496
and improve their own educational
systems in their own way.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:27.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Experience
edutopia at www.edutopia.org.

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:30.256
&gt;&gt;Robert: That's great, George.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:32.326
Well it's really great
of you to come,

00:04:32.326 --> 00:04:34.906
George and to share your
passion with people.

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:36.706
&gt;&gt;George: Well it's great to be here.

00:04:36.956 --> 00:04:40.816
&gt;&gt;Robert: That's good and thanks
to Mark and to the community

00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:45.026
of the wonderful community
of Salesforce.com.

00:04:45.026 --> 00:04:48.396
And maybe we should start
with your own story, George.

00:04:48.586 --> 00:04:51.696
Like let us know a little like
how did you get to this passion?

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:55.976
You're the movie-maker, Star
Wars, the whole thing, Yoda.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:00.416
Did Yoda tell you to
get into education?

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:02.356
&gt;&gt;Audience: [laughs]

00:05:02.356 --> 00:05:04.726
&gt;&gt;George: [laughs] Well, when
I started out in the school K

00:05:04.726 --> 00:05:07.016
through 12 I didn't
do very well at all.

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:09.006
I just didn't fit in.

00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:11.616
I guess I was too much
of a daydreamer.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:18.266
I really wasn't a big fan of math
and science and all of the curriculum

00:05:18.826 --> 00:05:21.906
that they put inside the box
and I lived outside the box

00:05:21.906 --> 00:05:23.516
and so I didn't really
have a good time.

00:05:23.996 --> 00:05:29.296
It wasn't really until I
hit college that I began

00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:32.626
to enjoy the educational process
because I had more control

00:05:32.626 --> 00:05:33.416
over what I was learning.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:34.336
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:36.626
&gt;&gt;George: And I am very
interested in social science.

00:05:37.076 --> 00:05:40.886
And I was a history
major in high school

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:44.686
but I became an anthropology major
in junior college where I started

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:49.466
and suddenly it was a lot of fun
and I was doing much better at it.

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:53.496
And I realized that learning
is a fun thing to do.

00:05:53.496 --> 00:05:54.386
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:05:54.386 --> 00:05:55.426
&gt;&gt;George: Especially
if you're interested.

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:55.976
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:05:55.976 --> 00:05:58.896
&gt;&gt;George: And that
was the primary thing.

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:00.976
So I went to film school.

00:06:00.976 --> 00:06:02.006
I discovered film school.

00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:03.676
I had no interest in
film before I got there.

00:06:03.676 --> 00:06:06.726
I thought I was interested in art
and I wanted to be an illustrator,

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.766
and a friend of mine said "Well they
have a photography school at U.S.C."

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:12.876
but I discovered it wasn't
a photography school.

00:06:12.876 --> 00:06:14.276
It was actually a cinema
photography school.

00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:17.136
And it wasn't even a cinematography
school, it was a cinema school

00:06:17.696 --> 00:06:20.096
and they teach you to make movies
and I said "This is insane.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:22.746
You mean you go to university
to learn how to make movies?"

00:06:23.436 --> 00:06:29.256
And but I went there, my first
semester I fell in love with it,

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:33.026
realized I was very good at
it and it became a passion.

00:06:33.256 --> 00:06:37.716
I was very fortunate because your
passion, finding your passion

00:06:37.716 --> 00:06:41.486
of what you want to do in life is
the single most difficult thing you

00:06:41.486 --> 00:06:41.796
can do.

00:06:42.456 --> 00:06:42.576
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:06:42.576 --> 00:06:44.546
&gt;&gt;George: And if you can find
it, if you can find it early,

00:06:44.656 --> 00:06:47.946
it's just a fantastic
advantage over everything

00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:51.796
because then no matter what
happens, you're going to be happy.

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:52.206
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:06:52.356 --> 00:06:57.676
&gt;&gt;George: And so later
on I was, you know,

00:06:57.676 --> 00:07:01.366
we were sort of on the
leading edge of using computers

00:07:01.366 --> 00:07:05.066
to develop special effects
and things in the movies,

00:07:05.406 --> 00:07:08.276
and I was a storyteller
and I said "What

00:07:08.276 --> 00:07:10.756
if I just combine these
two things and built a sort

00:07:10.756 --> 00:07:14.536
of a learning machine,
a multi-media project?"

00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:15.286
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:17.736
&gt;&gt;George: And I think this
would be a great way to learn.

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:19.856
It would be much more
interesting, much more engaging.

00:07:21.396 --> 00:07:23.936
Started that which basically was
the beginning of the foundation,

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.836
and talked to a lot of educators.

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:32.226
We bring educators in for a day
twice a week in all different fields,

00:07:32.266 --> 00:07:34.696
all different areas, experts
for years we did this.

00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:38.876
And they kept saying "Look, don't
build a model of multimedia.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:44.796
Don't show how mu-- what we need is
to be able to tell the story of how

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:47.576
to integrate technology into schools.

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:49.156
We go to conferences.

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:50.116
We only get an hour.

00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:52.156
It takes us a whole
hour to explain it.

00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.516
If you could tell the
story, you could do it in 10

00:07:54.516 --> 00:07:57.156
or 15 minutes using
visuals and movies."

00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:57.616
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:07:57.616 --> 00:07:59.976
&gt;&gt;George: "And then we can spend the
rest of the time answering questions

00:07:59.976 --> 00:08:00.896
and being very effective."

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:02.266
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:05.546
&gt;&gt;George: And what needs
to be told is the story

00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:08.026
of what education should be.

00:08:08.026 --> 00:08:08.336
&gt;&gt;Robert: Mm-hm.

00:08:09.436 --> 00:08:13.266
&gt;&gt;George: It seemed like a very
modest thing and not very glamorous

00:08:14.176 --> 00:08:16.376
but these people were
so passionate about it

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:18.806
that I picked it up and took it on.

00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:21.386
It's been quite a while
now about 12 years.

00:08:21.386 --> 00:08:21.976
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:08:21.976 --> 00:08:23.046
&gt;&gt;George: That we've been doing this.

00:08:23.046 --> 00:08:23.176
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:25.886
&gt;&gt;George: And what we do
is take the best practices-

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.306
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:30.926
&gt;&gt;George: Of what education
will look like using technology-

00:08:31.386 --> 00:08:31.786
&gt;&gt;Robert: Mm-hm.

00:08:32.096 --> 00:08:35.356
&gt;&gt;George: Using video, using
the Internet, using computers

00:08:35.526 --> 00:08:37.276
and multimedia in the classroom

00:08:37.836 --> 00:08:40.216
and what it does is it opens
a whole different paradigm

00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:41.326
of the way we learn.

00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:43.646
We've been saying for
ever since I've been born-

00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:44.106
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:08:44.216 --> 00:08:45.546
&gt;&gt;George: We've got
to change education.

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:46.366
We got to make it work.

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:47.066
It's got to be better.

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:47.856
It's not working.

00:08:47.856 --> 00:08:48.496
What can we do?

00:08:49.186 --> 00:08:50.816
And let's throw more money at it.

00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:51.456
Let's do this.

00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:56.626
But the great thing is
technology, the digital age-

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:56.936
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.966
&gt;&gt;George: The computer,
is going to do that.

00:08:59.326 --> 00:08:59.486
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:08:59.486 --> 00:09:02.526
&gt;&gt;George: It cannot stay
like you were 200 years ago.

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:04.266
It just isn't going to work.

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:05.076
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:09:05.076 --> 00:09:06.686
&gt;&gt;George: So what I've
dedicated myself

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:09.066
to doing is saying okay
you got your computers.

00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:10.066
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:11.666
&gt;&gt;George: But don't put
them in a little classroom

00:09:11.866 --> 00:09:15.216
and teach people Word Perfect
two days a week as an elective.

00:09:15.216 --> 00:09:15.516
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:09:15.606 --> 00:09:17.106
&gt;&gt;George: Because the kids
already know that anyway.

00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:20.666
Take the computers and use
them as a tool like a pencil

00:09:21.606 --> 00:09:23.076
to help the educational process.

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:23.226
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:25.886
&gt;&gt;George: To help the learning
process for the students and out

00:09:25.886 --> 00:09:30.236
of that we realized that it
facilitates age-old techniques

00:09:30.236 --> 00:09:37.076
of learning which is cooperative
learning, interactive working.

00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:38.116
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:09:38.116 --> 00:09:41.456
&gt;&gt;George: It's project-based
learning is the cobbler.

00:09:41.736 --> 00:09:41.956
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:47.876
&gt;&gt;George: Interactive
cooperative learning is Aristotle.

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:48.996
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right, right, right.

00:09:48.996 --> 00:09:50.096
&gt;&gt;George: He never taught anything.

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:54.546
He never said "Well the way you do
it is you do this and this and this."

00:09:54.546 --> 00:09:57.166
He always said "Well
how would you do it?

00:09:57.166 --> 00:09:57.816
Here's a problem.

00:09:57.816 --> 00:09:59.656
What do you think about that?"

00:09:59.656 --> 00:09:59.846
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:09:59.846 --> 00:10:01.396
&gt;&gt;George: And then he would either-

00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:02.686
&gt;&gt;Robert: It's a dialogue
with people.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:03.366
&gt;&gt;George: It was a dialogue.

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:05.616
It was a thing where the
students did the learning

00:10:05.616 --> 00:10:07.256
and the teacher was
there to facilitate.

00:10:07.286 --> 00:10:07.376
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:09.336
&gt;&gt;George: And to say "Well
have you thought of this?"

00:10:09.606 --> 00:10:09.736
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:09.736 --> 00:10:12.096
&gt;&gt;George: Lots of great theory
but there's a big hole right here.

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:12.656
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:12.656 --> 00:10:13.836
&gt;&gt;George: Think about that.

00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:14.036
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:14.036 --> 00:10:15.886
&gt;&gt;George: That is the
way education should be.

00:10:16.306 --> 00:10:16.456
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:19.036
&gt;&gt;George: And it's worked for
thousands and thousands of years

00:10:19.856 --> 00:10:22.766
and that's the way
young children learn.

00:10:23.246 --> 00:10:24.686
They learn out of curiosity.

00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:28.906
Kids only have one job in their life,

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:31.746
and that is to grow
up and be an adult.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:32.346
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:32.346 --> 00:10:33.416
&gt;&gt;George: That's all they want.

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:38.006
And so you give them any kind
of adult work, they'll do it

00:10:38.006 --> 00:10:39.486
and they'll be very excited about it.

00:10:39.486 --> 00:10:39.576
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:10:39.576 --> 00:10:44.166
&gt;&gt;George: So instead of saying "Learn
math", you say "Here I want you

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:47.946
to build an airplane but it
has to be a real airplane.

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:49.426
We're going to simulate
it here on the computer."

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:50.016
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.436
&gt;&gt;George: "But you have
to learn all the science.

00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:53.626
You have to learn all the math, you
have to learn all the stuff in order

00:10:53.626 --> 00:10:54.656
to get to build this airplane."

00:10:54.936 --> 00:10:55.476
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right, right.

00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:59.246
&gt;&gt;George: So they learn it
because they need it as a tool

00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:00.926
and they know why they're
learning it.

00:11:01.336 --> 00:11:03.276
That suddenly engages them in a way

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:05.976
and they are learning
to do something.

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:06.506
&gt;&gt;Robert: Mm-hm.

00:11:06.746 --> 00:11:09.856
&gt;&gt;George: Because our
philosophy is you teach kids how

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:10.976
to find information.

00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:15.276
You teach them how to assess that
information and see how true it is,

00:11:15.896 --> 00:11:18.426
and then you use it
in a creative endeavor

00:11:18.426 --> 00:11:19.846
to build something, to do something.

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:24.176
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right, like I was just
thinking like in geography class,

00:11:24.176 --> 00:11:28.546
right, Google Earth get that
available to kids on their hands.

00:11:28.546 --> 00:11:31.936
You know teachers giving a lecture
and they can zoom in on Saskatchewan.

00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:32.826
You mentioned earlier-

00:11:33.176 --> 00:11:33.466
&gt;&gt;George: Right.

00:11:33.466 --> 00:11:35.546
&gt;&gt;Robert: Sometime to find
out where Saskatchewan was

00:11:35.546 --> 00:11:36.096
when you were little.

00:11:36.906 --> 00:11:40.236
&gt;&gt;George: Well we've- what we've done
is say we have narrowed our programs

00:11:40.236 --> 00:11:41.926
into just informing people.

00:11:42.136 --> 00:11:42.406
&gt;&gt;Robert: Yes.

00:11:42.406 --> 00:11:43.666
&gt;&gt;George: We gather the information.

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:46.586
We say "Google Earth,
look on edutopia.

00:11:46.586 --> 00:11:49.336
You'll see one of the
tools you have available

00:11:49.386 --> 00:11:51.036
to you is Google Earth
if you do geography."

00:11:51.356 --> 00:11:51.566
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:11:51.566 --> 00:11:55.066
&gt;&gt;George: But it shows you all the
things that are available to you.

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:55.736
&gt;&gt;Robert: Mm-hm.

00:11:56.076 --> 00:11:56.946
&gt;&gt;George: But it also shows-

00:11:56.946 --> 00:11:58.976
&gt;&gt;Robert: You have that on the
website, teachers can use that.

00:11:58.976 --> 00:12:03.956
&gt;&gt;George: Yeah, and it shows you
then how to organize a classroom-

00:12:04.206 --> 00:12:04.976
&gt;&gt;Robert: Uh-huh.

00:12:05.036 --> 00:12:11.676
&gt;&gt;George: Around these ideas using
the technology: cameras, computers,

00:12:11.746 --> 00:12:14.866
the Internet, to enhance
the learning experience.

00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:15.706
&gt;&gt;Robert: Mm-hm.

00:12:16.216 --> 00:12:18.636
&gt;&gt;George: And you can do it,
there's a zillion different ways.

00:12:18.686 --> 00:12:20.546
We show the ones that are
actually being used now.

00:12:20.886 --> 00:12:21.156
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.

00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:23.986
&gt;&gt;George: All this is very,
very, new and all we're trying

00:12:23.986 --> 00:12:28.976
to do is make it more available,
the information more available.

00:12:29.196 --> 00:12:29.546
&gt;&gt;Robert: Right.
