GINGER THOMPSON: Hi, everybody.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.010
Thank you for your patience
with us as we get started.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.160
My name is Ginger Thompson.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.300
I'm with Lewa Wildlife
Conservancy here in the US,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.230
and I'm the executive director.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.379
I'm here with my
colleagues Geoffrey Chege,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.380
who's our chief conservation
officer, who flew in from Kenya

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.550
a couple of days ago,
and John Battelle, who's

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.370
on our US board
and actually about

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.980
to become vice president
of our US board.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.950
We're here to talk to you today
about Lewa Wildlife Conservancy

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.790
and really a much bigger
movement that we're the engine

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.600
room for in Northern
Kenya in an effort

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.390
to take a very
large area of land

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.490
and put it into
conservation management,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.250
conservation that's
actually community centric.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.970
So we are a community
conservation organization.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.720
We're going to play a video
for you so you get a sense

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.060
and a feel of the place itself.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.530
But following our
conversation today,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.410
there are a few
things that we think

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.580
it's important to step away
with from our tech talk here.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.010
The first is that Lewa is
a small but very prominent

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.390
organization in the
conservation field,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.230
in community conservation, and
particularly in East Africa.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.560
We've become a model for a lot
of other public and private

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.700
organizations attempting
to preserve wildlife

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.280
by working with
communities to do so.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.330
It's got a big vision.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.760
It's got a great team.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.670
And we've had financial
efficacy for many, many years.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.390
So there's lots to
be said about Lewa,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.500
and you'll hear more about us.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
We have an enormous
opportunity today

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.760
to do something that really
hasn't been done anywhere,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.740
which is to create a massive
wildlife area in Africa that

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.210
can sustain all the iconic
species that we've talked

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.240
about over years in Africa,
but also sustain livelihoods

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.980
of people who are pastoralists
who have worked and lived

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.790
with animals, this wildlife,
for generations and millennia,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.880
really.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.110
And that opportunity is unique
to this area of Northern Kenya.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.250
Finally, we have a very
critical issue going on,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.500
which I'm sure you've all read
much about, which is poaching.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.370
Poaching has reduced the
numbers of elephants, and rhino,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.160
and big cats, and wild
dogs extraordinarily

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.940
in the past 10 to 15 years.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.670
The demand for ivory, the
demand for rhino horn,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.580
the demand for pelts, the
demand for all sorts of organs

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.620
has grown so dramatically.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.240
And it's really been taken
up by criminal gangs that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.620
are using international
ports to move goods to raise

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.770
lots of money for
terrorist activities,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.330
et cetera, et cetera.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.550
That single issue
of poaching has

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.320
reduced populations
of elephant and rhino

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.020
from the millions
down to the thousands.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.710
So we need help in
keeping this all growing

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.780
and restoring wildlife to this
wonderful area of Northern

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.640
Kenya.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.190
And that's what we're
here to talk to you about.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.980
Community and conservation
are symbiotic.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.940
You can't conserve
wildlife areas

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.880
without the people
involved in doing so.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.260
It's a human issue.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.840
It's not a wildlife issue.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.060
It's not a habitat issue.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.190
It's a human issue,
conservation.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.450
So the great lessons
and the billions

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.480
of dollars that were spent in
conservation over the last 50

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.700
to 75 years here and
elsewhere in the world

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.880
is that those dollars
were ill spent

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.630
because they didn't
incorporate people in the mix.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.780
And Lewa has really
led the charge

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.520
on community conservation.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.650
We started a surrogate group
called The Northern Rangelands

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.100
Trust in 2004.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.170
We now have 11,000 square
miles of land in conservation

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.250
management, and we're
hoping to go much further.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.470
We are a 62,000-acre
conservancy, so we're a place.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.730
But we're also a much
larger organization.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.770
We're the anchor for
this massive movement

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.870
in Northern Kenya.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.060
Wildlife and community
go hand in hand.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.550
These are stats on poaching.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.250
And Community
Conservation is the name

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.690
of the game, Community
Center Conservation.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.600
I'm going to show a short video
of Lewa to give you the feel

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.280
right now.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.340
NARRATOR: In June of 2013,
Lewa Wildlife Conservancy

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.095
was inscribed as an extension of
the Mount Kenya World Heritage

00:05:06.095 --> 00:05:09.020
Site, a testament to
the years of dedication

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.680
in creating this unique
catalyst and model

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.255
for community-based
conservation.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.990
IAN CRAIG: Lewa has a spirit.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.890
People work here 24 hours.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.680
They go the extra mile.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.190
And it has a heart and a soul.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.765
ANNA MERZ: I think this place
has got its [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:27.765 --> 00:05:32.615
Certainly I feel it and love it.

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.400
NARRATOR: The success of the
Lewa Wildlife Conservancy

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.750
is unquestionable.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.830
You only have to look at
the thriving populations

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.460
of wildlife, particularly of
two notable highly endangered

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.676
species, and the harmony with
the surrounding communities

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:46.050
to know that this
is a model that

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.830
works-- a catalyst
for conservation

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.410
across this region of northern
Kenya and potentially way,

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.702
way beyond.

00:05:53.702 --> 00:05:56.160
JOHN KINOTI: People who didn't
have water, they have water.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.740
Women who didn't
have businesses have

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.090
businesses because we've
been able to involve them.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.140
It becomes like my
gasoline to move on.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.320
I can actually carry on.

00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:45.640
NARRATOR: In East Africa,
where wildlife numbers

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.420
have been declining
for many years,

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.586
now here is an established
and proven model

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:50.835
which is reversing this trend.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.920
MIKE WATSON: Lewa really is the
story about one amazing woman,

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.620
Anna Merz, and an
endangered species,

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.580
and the vision of
one man, Ian Craig.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.620
NARRATOR: In 1970, there were
20,000 black rhinos in Kenya.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.690
Through poaching, this
figure had plummeted by 98%

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.010
to only 280 individuals
in just 12 years.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.110
Kenya is an exception
within East Africa

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.550
in its acceptance of
private-sector partnerships

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.090
and conservation.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.790
With this freedom,
Lewa has spawned

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.260
a new concept in
conservation-- that

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.660
of a private, public, and
community-based partnership.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.980
Of the over 600
black rhino in Kenya,

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.180
a figure currently
rising at around 8%

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.190
annually, 45% have found them
private sanctuaries very much

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.444
modeled on Lewa.

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:44.560
A large part of the
success is thanks

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.880
to the extensive security
setup on the conservancy.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.100
MIKE WATSON: In the Lewa
Security Department,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.890
we have well over 150 people, 30
armed Kenya police reservists.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.030
They are armed by
government, and they

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.560
are employed and managed by us.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.900
NARRATOR: Lewa has also
been leading the way

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.680
in developing methods of
moving large numbers, sometimes

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.340
hundreds of animals from
one location to another,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.710
working regularly with the
government-run Kenya Wildlife

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:22.100
Service in joint operations.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.020
With this expertise
and the reservoir

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.330
of wildlife within
Lewa, the Conservancy

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.400
has huge potential to act as
a supply and source of animals

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.735
for new community conservancies.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.799
The Kenya Wildlife
Service provide

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.150
Lewa with a highly-skilled vet.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.190
His salary is
covered by Lewa, who

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.540
also provide logistical
support and assistance.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.040
This enables him to
spread his expertise,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.080
providing timely and
effective wildlife

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.450
veterinary intervention
right across the region.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.650
It is this kind of
cooperation that

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.340
builds on the close alliance
and symbiotic relationship

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.517
between Lewa and the
people who reside just

00:09:06.517 --> 00:09:08.100
beyond the borders
of the conservancy.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:18.230
Lewa's vision extends
well beyond the horizon,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.720
recognizing that the
welfare of local communities

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.250
is integral to the welfare
of the ecosystems on which

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.120
so much depends.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.670
EDWARD NDERITU:
Through health care,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.770
through education, through
employment and security

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.950
to the people who live just the
other side of the fence line.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.300
These communities act as
a first line of defense.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.030
And we will receive
information from them

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.160
long before any poacher
or potential poacher

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.810
get foot into Lewa.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.060
JOHN KINOTI: The Lewa
Community Government Program

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.730
entails dealing with the
communities around us in Lewa.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.405
We are trying to
positively influence

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:56.050
the community towards
wildlife conservation,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.610
because we believe the
success of conservation work

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.500
can only be possible if the
communities can believe in it.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.600
FAITH RIUNGA: Lewa
Wildlife Conservancy now

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.020
is working with 15 schools.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.740
All these schools are
government schools.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.200
The Lewa [INAUDIBLE]
Education Program

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.480
is going to be governed
by stakeholders.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.590
We will include the government.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.020
We will include KWS.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.670
We will include Lewa and
NRT, and also representatives

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.840
from the community so that
the approach is holistic

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.770
and the needs are coming
from the community.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:27.270
We are happy that
this is happening,

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.680
because out of this
successful program

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.390
we have had here, then we shall
be able to do it elsewhere

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.246
where it is needed.

00:10:35.246 --> 00:10:37.830
NARRATOR: Lewa has become
a catalyst for conservation

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.260
in the region, and the
model many conservancies

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.520
strive to emulate-- a model
for monitoring and protecting

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.970
endangered species and managing
habitat to maximize diversity.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.560
It has become a
model for ensuring

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.250
that conservation benefits
local communities,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.970
a model for sustainable
conservation and research,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.990
and a model through investment
in self-generating revenue

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.880
streams for securing that
conservation and perpetuity.

00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:24.340
IAN CRAIG: We've
got a foundation

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:28.275
to move proactive,
community-based conversation

00:11:28.275 --> 00:11:31.365
across a massive landscape
of Northern Kenya.

00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:33.504
And it wouldn't without Lewa.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:07.860
GINGER THOMPSON: The video gives
you the sense of the place that

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.510
some of you here have visited,
but most of you probably

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:12.150
haven't.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:18.100
It's a small piece of land
in this vast landscape.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.820
And so much potential.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.320
We're the gateway to
this northern area,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.110
and we're also the engine room
for the actual conservation

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.620
work, for the community
development work,

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.340
for building buildings
that need building,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.500
for fencing where
there's fencing needed

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:40.150
for all sorts of
road building, lots

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.240
and lots of different things
that Lewa actually provides

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.820
the manpower, the skill set, the
talent for in Northern Kenya.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:56.290
I'm going to stop and let
you know that we have a goal

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.780
to take 11,000 square
miles-- about the size

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.600
of Massachusetts--
and grow it to 35,000

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.580
square miles of open
range land for wildlife

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.480
and for the pastoralist
people who live with it.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.560
And that's a great, big,
huge, enormous goal, but one

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.320
that we actually
see in our sights.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.830
We see it happening
in the next 10 years.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.760
And that 35,000 square
miles, roughly the size

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.900
of the state of Indiana.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.430
So it's a pretty big area.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:32.250
With the right help and with
all of you, we can get there.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.800
I'm just going to say one or
two words about these guys.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.150
Chege has earned his stripes
as our conservation head.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:46.770
He was rolled over or rolled
on upon by a 1.5-ton rhino.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.600
So we all come by our
stripes in different ways,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.110
but he has a pretty unique one.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.760
And John has really
been involved

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.570
in a lot of the community
development work

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.770
on Lewa-- bringing solar to
schools, to health clinics.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:06.020
He's really single handedly
moved us into a new energy era.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.240
And granted, it may be a
first step for all of you,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.150
but it was a huge step for
this area of Northern Kenya.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.020
So we're going to
let them carry on.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.670
Thank you.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.630
And by the way, I want say
thank you to Katherine, too,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.510
for organizing us here.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:24.290
She is also a member
of our board now,

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:25.884
and we're so
delighted to have her.

00:14:25.884 --> 00:14:27.050
And thank you to all of you.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.720
JOHN BATTELLE: I get to
talk about why it matters.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.820
Why should we care?

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.395
Because I come to the
same place you guys do.

00:14:39.395 --> 00:14:40.270
This is our backyard.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.580
It's halfway around
the world, and we're

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.160
going, why does it matter.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.780
Why do I care what
happens over there?

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.170
And there's a couple
components that

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:48.336
are really, really critical.

00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:50.690
The fact that you're sitting
here is a first step.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.940
But on a broad, global
scale, this really

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.370
comes down to
challenges that are

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.510
going to happen with
biodiversity and challenges

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.760
with resources.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.230
The reality is we don't
have enough on the planet.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.930
And we need to link
the understanding

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.820
behind biodiversity and wildlife
to the benefit of all of us.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.580
For now, the easiest one
that we can talk about

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.860
is the reality around terrorism.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.810
If we're not defending
against poaching,

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.480
if we're not out
there protecting

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.220
wildlife and diversity
biodiversity, the activity

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.000
and the civil unrest that occurs
from that affects all of us

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.390
here no matter where it's
happening around the world.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.610
We're talking about
North Kenya, bordered

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.137
by Somali and Ethiopia,
and the reality

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:32.220
is that it's a front line
of where we can actually

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.490
make a difference.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.380
The beauty is that the
people in Kenya, specifically

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.317
North Kenya, would
want nothing more

00:15:38.317 --> 00:15:40.650
than to be able to live the
way that they currently live

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.850
and have a better life.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.840
And we have the tools, or
the beginning of the tools,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.770
to make that impact.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.920
And you guys can be
a huge part of that.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.610
So that's why we should care.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.250
The reality is that
premature extinction

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.410
is going on around us.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.380
The baseline that has been
measured way back when,

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.200
they measured what
the plant normally

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.960
would handle in
terms of extinction.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.420
In 2005, we were-- I'm going
to flip my slide here--

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.654
we were 1,000 times the level
of natural premature extinction.

00:16:08.654 --> 00:16:10.237
By the end of the
century, they expect

00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:13.450
it to be 10,000
times that level.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.370
And the fact is that
when the planet is

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.990
going through this exercise of
trying to adjust to what humans

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:21.290
are doing, it can't keep up.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.440
50% of the population
on this planet

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.720
get its livelihood from
biodiversity and natural

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.790
resources.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.640
And if those aren't
there, their livelihoods

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.770
go away-- their
ability to eat, ability

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.980
to find jobs,
ability to survive.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.860
And that turns back
into the first slide,

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.680
which is about this challenge
of why we should care.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.380
We look at premature
extinction, which

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.500
is happening at a much more
rapid rate, caused by us.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.670
We have the loss
of biodiversity,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.050
the loss of livelihood,
food, water resources.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.690
And in the end, it affects
everyone on this planet.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.110
So we need to make this jump
to understanding this bigger

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.610
picture.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.276
And I know you guys
are capable of that.

00:16:56.276 --> 00:16:57.320
You guys do it every day.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.560
You're looking way out there.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.330
What we want to talk
to you today about

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.964
is how we take that
vision and your skills

00:17:02.964 --> 00:17:04.380
and figure out how
we can actually

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.910
map better picture specifically
right now in North Kenya.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.410
Chege.

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.970
GEOFFERY CHEGE:
Thank you very much.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.550
And thank you, Ginger, for such
positive compliments regarding

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.410
being rolled over by a rhino.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.130
It doesn't happen every day.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.300
But the moment as it comes to
Lewa, take it as a challenge

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.750
and you move on.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.740
And I thank god that I'm
standing right in front of you

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.450
today to talk about
my experience.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:38.260
But that aside, we
believe that technology

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.625
has got a significant role
to support conservation,

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:44.700
to support protection,
and to support

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.450
the security of wildlife
and people in Kenya

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.100
and all over the world.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.030
And as we try to
understand nature,

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.260
as we try to make the
linkage between the wildlife

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.940
and community development,
we have quite a number

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.710
of technological advancements
that we have implemented

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.940
on the ground in an
attempt to secure

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.310
the land both for
wildlife and for people.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.170
Part of the technology
that we're talking about

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.950
include fixing of
GPS tracking devices

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.200
on wildlife, on
elephants, on rhinos,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.130
so that we know exactly where
they are on a real-time basis.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:29.390
We are more into
fixing of camera traps.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:34.120
Ginger mentioned about Lewa been
small, being completely fenced,

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.270
but we have quite a number
of gaps that allow wildlife

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.412
to come in and go out.

00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:41.370
So we have fixed quite
a number camera traps so

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.950
that we can understand the
dynamics of the movement one

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.590
wildlife outside and
then when they come back.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:51.610
We are very much into digital
radio communication, which

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.670
is very important in
this era of poaching,

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.060
in this era of terrorism, in
this era of insecurity issues

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.991
that John has just alluded to.

00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:03.240
Digital communication that
we are using at the moment,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.640
they are secure,
they are encrypted,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.580
and there is no
way that anyone is

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.740
going to hack into them unless
you've been given access to it.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.600
We are starting to get much more
into ID-based identification,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.350
individual wildlife
identification software,

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.460
so that we can track individual
animals on a daily basis,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.270
on a monthly basis,
annual basis,

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:29.240
and then we can recreate their
life history tables, their life

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.200
history strategies as we
move forward, we move on.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.890
All of these are an
attempt to secure

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:40.470
space for wildlife
and also people.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.480
Everything that we are doing,
we are not doing on our own.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.130
We are unto partnerships
with very many people.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.170
We believe that
scale is critical,

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.690
and that's why we have
partnered with other people

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.720
in the region, including
a group like you,

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.430
including people
like you, because we

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:59.970
believe in tapping the
right kind of expertise.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.070
And that's one of the
reasons why we are here.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.900
We are into collaboration
and partnership

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.620
with Save The Elephants,
of which some of you

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.850
may be aware about that
particular organization.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.830
We're in partnership with the
Zoological Society of London.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.530
We are in partnership with
the Kenya Wildlife Studies,

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.010
with the Custodians of Wildlife.

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.030
In Kenya, we are in
partnership with Sarfaricom,

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.510
who are the biggest
mobile telephony provider

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:30.360
in the country, WildlifeDirect,
and several zoos

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.345
and many other conservation
organizations in all

00:20:33.345 --> 00:20:35.036
over the world.

00:20:35.036 --> 00:20:36.620
JOHN BATTELLE:
What's coming next?

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.810
This is actually a
pretty easy step for us.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.757
If you look at what
we've done in the past,

00:20:42.757 --> 00:20:44.840
a few years ago, if we
could get a solar panel up,

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.340
we were really kicking butt.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.860
But the reality is
that the ability

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:52.760
to do that is pretty simple
now in terms of solar, wind,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.132
LED lighting, all that
kind of technology.

00:20:55.132 --> 00:20:56.840
There actually is
infrastructure in place

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.310
that's usable and functions
pretty well within East Africa,

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.649
specifically in Kenya.

00:21:01.649 --> 00:21:03.940
So those resources are things
that we don't necessarily

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.040
focus on.

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.160
Cellular technology,
a huge shift for us

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.415
which really affects you
guys from our standpoint

00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:11.160
and why we can use
you even more today

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.050
than we could five years ago.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.430
Originally, and
even today, we're

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.630
really still in the voice
communication world.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.570
We're just moving
into the data world.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.180
But the ability from
a cellular tower

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.660
perspective to
get communications

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.140
over large regions,
that's happening.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.450
So we're now looking at
first-generation apps,

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.080
first-generation baking
tools, those kind of things.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.770
And those are where
we are at today.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.420
We're looking at
that high-level,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.020
granulizing those down into
the next generation of things.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.090
So we're leveraging
smart spatial monitoring

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.260
for conservation.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.414
We're looking at things
for security like drones.

00:21:43.414 --> 00:21:44.830
Everybody is talking
about drones.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.820
We are looking at
forward-looking infrared.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.620
We're looking at better ways to
use existing technology that's

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.506
cheaper and faster and so forth.

00:21:52.506 --> 00:21:54.130
But that's not the
leap we need to make

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:59.120
if we're going to take over
and try to develop 35,000

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.420
square miles of land
for conservation.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.790
We have to really take a leap.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.310
But today we're in this
phase of really starting

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:08.410
to bring technology to bear
on a lot of the core things

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.870
that we're doing today.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.580
GEOFFERY CHEGE: I think I
would like to dive into some

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.750
of the challenges
that we're facing

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:19.500
in Kenya at the moment and
indeed the entire North Kenya

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.680
landscape.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.630
And one of the most
critical points

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.380
is the issue about insecurity.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.860
My colleague Ginger
alluded about poaching.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:32.280
We need to secure the landscape
for the benefit of wildlife

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.600
and people.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.000
Without security, then
there's nothing far.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.270
We will not move far.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:42.290
We need to reduce the
international demand

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.540
for wildlife products.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.240
That is something that
we have got to do.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.380
It is all linked to terrorism.

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.235
It is affecting us.

00:22:51.235 --> 00:22:52.110
It is a global issue.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.950
And we've got to
fight it as a team.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.650
We need to ensure that we engage
the right kind of community

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.440
partnership.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.050
We need to bring on
board the communities

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.740
so that we can secure
their livelihood,

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.360
we can secure their health
care, we can secure their water

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.010
needs, we can secure
their educational needs,

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.260
and everything.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.645
The other major
challenge that we

00:23:11.645 --> 00:23:15.770
are facing in the country at the
moment is population explosion.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.600
In 2012, the
population of Kenya was

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.310
approximated to be
about 44 million.

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.050
By 2050, it is
projected that it is

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.600
going to be about 94 million.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.800
And that is a
significant growth.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.420
What does it bring on board?

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.770
One is that there is going
to be massive pressure

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.030
on the resources.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.210
That is going to lead
to habitat degradation.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.140
It is going to lead
to habitat loss.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.100
It is going to lead to
isolation of landscapes

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.000
that were initially
interconnected

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.010
for the benefit of wildlife.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.524
I'm not forgetting the increment
in the human wildlife conflict.

00:23:50.524 --> 00:23:52.690
The other challenge that
we are facing at the moment

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:58.320
is that it's only about 40%
of the country's wildlife

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.637
that is within the
formally protected areas.

00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:02.470
It could be government,
it could be private,

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.790
it could be community.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:11.450
But 60% of Kenya's
wildlife lives

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.020
in areas that are not
formally protected.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.860
And this is where now you've
got the greatest opportunity

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.110
in terms of jumping in and
ensuring that that place is

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:25.640
secure for the benefit of
not just wildlife but people.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.070
My colleague Ginger
alluded about Lewa

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.860
being a kind of place in scale.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.860
I just want to give you
a context of what you're

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.650
talking about in relation to
the entire of Northern Kenya.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.620
Lewa is just this tiny
piece that is over here,

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.260
62,000 acres of land.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.240
And what you're
seeing farther north

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.120
in terms of all of these
yellows is a significant matrix

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.780
of community
conservation areas that

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.450
have established under the
umbrella of the Northern

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:57.800
Rangelands Trust.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.290
On our south, we've got the
government-owned North Kenya

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:05.880
forest and national park.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.080
So the current area that has
been protected at the moment

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.170
is just about
11,000 square miles.

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.890
And you would like to increase
that one to scale it up

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.590
about 5,000 square miles.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.030
We've got great
opportunities that I've just

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.510
presented along the
way, and especially

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:25.360
in the last few years.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.810
One of them is about
the new wildlife act.

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:35.360
Our president just signed
the new wildlife act in 2013.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.050
Part of that act is it is
galvanizing conservation

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.670
as an alternative
for more land use.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.580
It is galvanizing the
establishment of conservancies

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.960
as an alternative for land use.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.660
It could be community.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.350
It could be private owned.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.880
Last year, we got in to the new
constitution in the country.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.710
It is devolving
functions that initially

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.800
used to be vested in
the state government.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.934
So things to do with
management of some

00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:06.350
of the natural
resources have been

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.950
invested in the
county government

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.490
or the regional government.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.460
And they're making
significant contributions

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.280
so that they can secure those
landscapes and wildlife so

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.700
that they can benefit
their particular region.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.740
And number three is that all
of these landscapes, the yellow

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.160
polygons over here,
they are all managed

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.470
under the umbrella of
a Northern Rangelands

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.050
Trust, which is formed in 2004.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.480
It was born out of Lewa.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.420
So opportunities are there.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.770
[INAUDIBLE] is growing.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.450
And we need to
partner with everyone

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:44.470
and bring everyone on board so
that we can move and scale up.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.960
GINGER THOMPSON: I think
it's important to note

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.800
that those yellow areas
are all community owned.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.070
So they were community
ranches that very likely would

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.410
have been split up into
individual small farms

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.040
or shambas.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.980
And because of this
conservation act,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.080
it's formally recognized
as a legal structure

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.070
for tax purposes for all
purposes in Kenya now.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.630
So those group ranches have
become conservation areas

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.120
and won't be broken up.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.287
And that's really important.

00:27:14.287 --> 00:27:15.745
JOHN BATTELLE: But
they were really

00:27:15.745 --> 00:27:17.465
becoming that well
before the act.

00:27:17.465 --> 00:27:20.790
The act picked up on a lot of
the trends that were happening.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.020
In working with
pastoral communities,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.750
we looked at how do we protect
wildlife and give you income

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.549
without you breaking apart
the potential for wildlife.

00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:31.090
And this is where a lot of these
have been developing out of.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.980
This is way before the act.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.960
And now the act gives us
leverage to do it even grander

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.046
as well as give legitimacy
to the exercises

00:27:38.046 --> 00:27:39.920
that we're trying to
accomplish to the north.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.170
GEOFFERY CHEGE: Thank you
very much, John and Ginger.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:46.190
I think it's very critical,
because there are tools-- where

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.240
it was being crafted, it
was very consultative.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.370
So what is happening in Northern
Kenya informed the new act.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:28:00.370
In terms of why we need to
forecast on Kenya's vast lands,

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:05.500
Kenya's wilderness, one critical
point is that Kenya is vast.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.540
It has got some very vast, open
landscapes, which presents us

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.280
with some perfect
opportunity in terms

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.010
of conserving the
wildlife that is there

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:19.380
and ensuring the livelihoods
of the people who

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.950
live amidst to the wildlife
that is integrated within.

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.390
Why is that possible?

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:27.720
Because Kenya has got some
of these few landscapes

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:33.630
where wildlife and people
do live side to side.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.630
Going back to the 1960s the
1970s, what used to happen

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:41.460
is that we used to have
abundant wildlife densities.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.480
These used to be a
lot in Northern Kenya.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.720
But in the late
1970s, they were all

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.130
decimated because of
quite a number of factors,

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.320
of which poaching was
one of them to supply

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.870
the legal markets.

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.550
We had bush meat poaching.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:59.080
We had incremented a
population of people.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.600
And all that has been
bringing significant pressure

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.280
on the resources.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.730
But now with an evolved
government, with a new wildlife

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.160
act, with Lewa being on board,
with all the other partners who

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.640
are on board, we've got
a perfect opportunity

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.330
of recreating buck
what used to be there.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:25.000
So our vision as of now is
that it is very possible

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.464
to use technology so that
we can secure the landscapes

00:29:29.464 --> 00:29:30.630
for the benefit of wildlife.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.300
And we make that particular
wildlife continue

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.455
being abundant and
actually flourish.

00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:39.400
JOHN BATTELLE: You can
leave that slide up

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.660
for a second, Ginger.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.130
Because there's two points
that I want to say about that.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.330
What we're talking
about is how do

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.900
we empower communities
that are there

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.940
to be able to survive the way
that they choose to survive

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.340
within their own communities.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:57.340
And the way to do
that is holistically.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.860
It's a way to
integrate how they live

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.690
with advancements
in technologies

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.270
and bettering their ability to
drive income from how they live

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:08.050
amongst the land and
amongst the wildlife.

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.614
How do we mitigate
challenges with wildlife

00:30:10.614 --> 00:30:12.780
so that they need the
wildlife and want the wildlife

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.381
to be there?

00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:14.880
Because that also
brings them income

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.454
through eco lodging and all
kinds of other components,

00:30:17.454 --> 00:30:19.620
which we'll get you some
examples of in a little bit

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.036
about some of
things we're working

00:30:21.036 --> 00:30:22.800
on which can explain
a little better.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.370
But our vision
that we're looking

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.930
at in the future-- you want
to move up on the slide--

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.880
the vision that
we're looking at is

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.050
what we're calling a
technological organism.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.950
The way that I look at that is
that it's like a human body.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:38.220
We have a heart.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.480
We have a liver.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.430
We have a kidney.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:41.100
We have lungs.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.433
We have all these things that
can function independently

00:30:43.433 --> 00:30:46.440
of each other and have
very specific tasks.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.190
But they do not
function and can't

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.340
survive unless the whole is
functioning and surviving.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.660
So they need to work
together in order to do that.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.150
And this is about working
with multiple communities

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:01.420
across a large area to create
a functioning organism that

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.410
can function and work
together on multiple levels

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.220
so that everyone can
succeed-- not only wildlife,

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.440
but also community.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.850
And that's we're talking
about trying to create.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.490
That's a vision that we
need to come up with.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:12.448
GINGER THOMPSON: Sorry.

00:31:12.448 --> 00:31:17.100
We really believe it's
possible to connect people

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:22.260
in different places so that
if I have my cattle over here

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.350
and there's a pride of
lion coming through,

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.380
somebody can warn me
that the lion are there

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.450
and I won't put my cattle in
a nighttime boma or protected

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:32.880
area near where the
lion are coming.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.490
I can move them a little
bit further afield

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:38.040
and herd them to a
different location,

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.480
and therefore I won't
lose my livestock

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.244
when the lions come through.

00:31:43.244 --> 00:31:45.410
JOHN BATTELLE: The point
is, what we're evolving is,

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:48.000
we need to develop a very
sophisticated management

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.280
platform that can be dynamic
and changing, that can handle

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.120
the amount of data and
the amount of points

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.786
that we would want
to be able to handle,

00:31:57.786 --> 00:31:59.860
and be able to
recognize spatially

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.140
the differences between them.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.306
And I'm not talking about
smart technology everybody

00:32:03.306 --> 00:32:05.920
is talking about today, which
is really about a single focus

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.220
conservation approach and
solving a specific problem

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.205
spatially for rangers
in a conservancy.

00:32:12.205 --> 00:32:14.380
There's a lot of great
technology coming out.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:15.890
What I'm talking
about is spatially

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:17.890
looking across
multiple communities

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.770
doing different activities.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:21.150
One might be a farmer.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.450
One community might
be pastoralists.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.990
Another one might
be herding goats.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.190
Another one might actually be
developing some other thing.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:33.040
We need to be able to see across
35,000 square miles with all

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.550
these different conservation
managers, with all

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.500
the different elders, with
all the different conflicting

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.350
issues that go on and be able to
support those organizations as

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.227
though it's living.

00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:44.310
And to do that, we need a
management platform that

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.460
can support that,
and we need tools

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.740
that can adapt to each
individual component

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.390
and work interconnectedly
together so that we

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.480
can look at it on a much bigger
scale and be able to say that.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.560
We need really strong
push-pull technologies,

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.810
like Ginger was talking about.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:00.860
We need be able to alert
particular areas that hey,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.400
there's a lion in your area,
so don't put your cattle there

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:03.900
today.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.579
Because if a lion kills
the cattle, guess what,

00:33:06.579 --> 00:33:07.870
they're going to kill the lion.

00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:09.540
But the lion
actually brings them

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.100
other income and other
biodiversity, which they need.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.540
But it's hard to
necessarily get that across.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.860
So we need to be able to
look at a much bigger scale.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.520
We need to be able to look at
one community over here who's

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.200
making beads for income and
connect it to a community that

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.170
could be 100 miles
away making necklaces

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.650
that needs beads instead of
them buying beads from China.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.880
We need to be able to see
things completely different

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.004
than we can see them today.

00:33:34.004 --> 00:33:36.490
Because today, while we're
getting more granular,

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.570
we're still singularly
silo focused.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.280
Because we can't see
across those problems yet.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:44.750
So this is where
your ability to help

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:48.565
us look at this in a different
can be really valuable to us.

00:33:48.565 --> 00:33:51.080
GINGER THOMPSON: We have
a whole lot of examples,

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.760
but we also have a little
bit of a time crunch.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.540
So we're going to
go very quickly

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.150
through a couple of examples
of work that we're doing,

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.500
and you can get a sense
of how things can change.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.170
It's going to be very quick.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:07.709
And then we're going to
open it up for questions.

00:34:07.709 --> 00:34:09.610
GEOFFERY CHEGE: We've
mentioned that Lea

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.659
has been an anchor,
the heartbeat of what

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.590
goes on in Northern Kenya.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.610
And we have perfected
some of the systems

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.750
that we are taking place.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:22.210
One of them is about
trans-location or different

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.659
wildlife species, regardless of
whether it is just one animal

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:28.469
or they are hundreds.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:31.620
This particular one was
trans-location of rhinos

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:35.070
from Lewa to a
contiguous neighbor.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.274
And we have planning that
we are going to take more

00:34:37.274 --> 00:34:38.940
into one of the
community conservancies.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:44.159
And this is a first of its kind
in terms of community, private,

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.370
and then government partnership.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.989
The other one is about
the connecting ecosystems

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.429
that were initially isolated
from each other because

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:54.900
of human development.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.670
This one is depicting
an ecosystem

00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:59.520
that is farther north.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:03.610
They are depicting
Mount Kenya above us.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.070
And then we have got
the sky blue outline,

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.820
that is over here.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.070
That is Lewa.

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:13.590
And we have got significant
human development

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.450
that is over here.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.840
And what has happened is that
these two ecosystems have

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.850
been split, or they
had become isolated

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:21.330
because of development.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:23.460
But what happened
in 2009 and 2010

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.540
is that Lewa and other
like-minded partners

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:30.170
came together and they created
a 16-kilometer long wall

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.430
of corridor fully
fenced on both sides.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.590
And that is funneling
wildlife, especially elephants,

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.840
from the high altitude
areas of Mount Kenya

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:42.100
to the low-line areas of Lewa.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.990
I'm trying to depict movement
pathways of two animals.

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:49.810
The red tracks are
the movement patterns

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.900
of one particular animal that
we had nicknamed the mountain

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.600
bull.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.040
And you can see the way he used
to smash the fences over here

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.460
on his way to mountain
and then on his way back.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.190
But the establishment
of the corridor, you

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:06.610
can see that most of them
have actually been funneled.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.560
So what does that lead us to?

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.638
Inter-mitigation of
human-elephant conflict.

00:36:13.638 --> 00:36:15.920
JOHN BATTELLE: The thing
about the other slide

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.360
that's really,
really critical is

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.300
that the partnerships
between the farms,

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.640
the communities, the
conservancies, the government,

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.580
to actually get commitment to
build a 16-kilometer corridor

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:34.130
connecting 2,500 elephants
on Mount Kenya to 10,000

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:38.270
to the north to give them a
safe route had never been done.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.540
And it really is a
spectacular achievement

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.630
to actually see that succeed.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.180
And we know that
we can actually do

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.140
more corridors and
other areas to continue

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.360
to expand the interconnectedness
of these wide open spaces.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.925
GINGER THOMPSON: A lot of people
believed it wouldn't happen,

00:36:52.925 --> 00:36:54.800
that the elephants
wouldn't use the corridor.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:59.840
But within the first 24 hours,
Tony, the yellow elephant

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.800
that we saw on the
map, went through.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.950
So all the others followed.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.265
It was a great experiment.

00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:09.680
JOHN BATTELLE: It was
really spectacular.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.390
It was was amazing to see that.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.740
Grassland management
ties into the vision

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.450
of what we're talking
about on a larger

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.300
scale, about 35,000
square miles.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.390
If you look to the
right, you will

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:26.170
see grasslands that
have been overgrazed,

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.050
which is why there are
no wildlife for quite

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.710
awhile in North Kenya.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.190
Overgrazing or pastoral
communities-- we've got cows,

00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:35.360
we want them to have the grass.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.680
Tribal conflict-- you've
got better grass than I do.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.550
We're going at it.

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.130
So that's what you
see on the right.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.120
What you see is through
the use of science

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.590
and other things, the
redevelopment of grasslands,

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:49.090
amazingly, cattle is the
way to redevelop grasslands.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.790
So by using cattle correctly
and by education and training,

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.970
we can use cattle
to actually rebuild

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.690
the grass, which makes the cows
fatter, which makes everybody

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.439
happier, which takes
more money to market,

00:37:59.439 --> 00:38:01.200
which makes communities happier.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.760
So grassland management
is an incredible tool

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.880
to help all these
pastoral communities.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.060
When the grasslands are
improved, wildlife comes back.

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.450
Because wildlife knows
where the good grasses are.

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:15.360
So now we have to
work on how do we

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.360
mitigate the challenges between
the grassland and the wildlife

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.945
for cattle and so forth.

00:38:20.945 --> 00:38:22.320
There's been a
lot of great stuff

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.480
that we're working on with
lion predation and so forth

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.770
to actually educate how to
protect cattle from wildlife.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:31.716
These are low technology
things that we've been doing,

00:38:31.716 --> 00:38:33.090
and they've been
very successful.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.270
But now we're looking at
it on a much bigger scale,

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.390
so we have to start getting
a lot more creative in how

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.860
we help these
communities do that.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.560
GINGER THOMPSON:
Anybody here have

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.020
a question they want to ask?

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.480
AUDIENCE: How did you
get that first corridor

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.480
in that three-way partnership
between the government

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.985
and private?

00:38:49.985 --> 00:38:56.620
GEOFFERY CHEGE: In terms of
how we got the corridor moving,

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:00.610
we had a government entity
that owned Mount Kenya.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.540
And from there the
private organization

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.420
that is Lewa on the lower side.

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.960
And then from the in-between,
we had the private farms

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.440
that used to be or experience
significant human-elephant

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.360
conflict.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.150
So we had three
willing partners who

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.574
came together around
the table and realized

00:39:20.574 --> 00:39:22.240
that there was a
problem here, and there

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.430
was a need to
solve this problem.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:26.880
So how do you go about it?

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.310
The private owners
of their farms

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:31.740
said that we are going to
donate this piece of land,

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.323
because they are pro
conservationists.

00:39:33.323 --> 00:39:35.910
They donated this piece
of land so that you guys,

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.760
you can create the corridor.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:42.180
So farming also decided
the corridor was fenced.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.400
We had a major
underpass that was

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.125
dug into one of
the major highways.

00:39:47.125 --> 00:39:49.500
In one of the slides, you may
have seen we had elephants.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.430
We also had
[INAUDIBLE], and that

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.010
is an underpass that is
functioning very well.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.640
So it was about
willing partners who

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:02.020
came on board, realized
that there was a problem,

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.802
and then they put their minds
together to solve the problem.

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:07.260
GINGER THOMPSON: There's a lot
of generosity involved, too,

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.490
on the landowners' part.

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:12.150
They contribute the
land to it, farmers did.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.320
And obviously there
were individuals.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.900
In fact, there's one
lady who contributed

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.750
most of the actual cash
who is right from here,

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:23.100
from Palo Alto, and
heard about this

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.800
and thought that was something
she wanted to support.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.580
So it's very local.

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.180
Let's see. "Are there plans
to share these learnings

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.950
and strategies with other
wildlife organizations?"

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:37.630
It just disappeared again.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:38.640
Sorry.

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.040
"Namely, tiger
conservancies in India."

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:46.360
Lewa hosts groups from
all over the world on Lewa

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.090
to be a demonstration site for
how you can manage wildlife

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:58.290
in contiguous areas or in
sparsely-connected areas.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:02.600
So we've had people-- huge
groups from China, in fact.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.210
There is a conservancy
now in Southern China

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:07.300
that has been modeled on Lewa.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:11.240
There are conservancy
groups all over Africa

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.980
that come and visit and spend
two or three weeks at a time

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.490
training with our
people, including Chege.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.450
We haven't done a
lot of publishing

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.760
in terms of written work,
but we plan to do a lot more.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.630
Our research team was
expanded quite dramatically

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.300
in the past 14 months.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.614
Chege can talk more
about that if you

00:41:35.614 --> 00:41:36.780
want to ask questions after.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.780
But absolutely.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:38.770
We host people.

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:40.410
We want to share
this information.

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:42.880
And we'll be publishing
quite a few reports

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.190
in the next year or two.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.650
"What technological
hindrances exist

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.570
and how can we, Google, help?"

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.340
JOHN BATTELLE: That
is a great question.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.780
And the answer is
the biggest challenge

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.160
we face right now
is understanding

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.720
how to tackle on
such a large scale

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.730
the management of
all the things we

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:08.820
will need to be able to monitor.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.310
We're not even equipped to
understand that problem.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:14.760
We're not equipped to
understand all the tools

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.340
that we would need to
have within those devices,

00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:19.040
within the baskets,
to be able to look

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.100
at how to solve this
problem versus this problem.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.990
So I think my answer is that I
don't have a clear picture yet.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.722
I just know what I
need to be able to do,

00:42:27.722 --> 00:42:29.430
what we need to be
able to do, what we're

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.367
looking at in terms
of this problem.

00:42:31.367 --> 00:42:33.450
Because this is going to
scale with or without us.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.110
But technology is going
to make it successful.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.900
It can't be
successful without it.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.210
But we need to be able to
link all of these variables

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.700
and components together
through technology.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.556
And I have no clue
how to actually do it.

00:42:45.556 --> 00:42:46.930
That's what we
need you guys for.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:47.355
GINGER THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:42:47.355 --> 00:42:48.870
That's where we need your help.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.810
Also, energy is a
big piece of this.

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.730
Because we obviously need power
to make this happen and make

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.370
this a reality, and this
is a very rural area.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.690
There isn't much power up there.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.230
Some power coming in through
some projects I think you guys

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.979
are involved with.

00:43:02.979 --> 00:43:06.450
But to distribute that at
a very grassroots level

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.710
is really, really important.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:12.660
The mobile access has
actually stepped up.

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.620
Safaricom is making
an inroad into really

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.180
increasing mobile access.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.237
But energy is a big one.

00:43:20.237 --> 00:43:21.820
AUDIENCE: In terms
of the communities,

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:23.444
you talked about both
building schools,

00:43:23.444 --> 00:43:26.710
bringing water, things like
that, and also creating revenue

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:28.110
streams-- this
was in the video--

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.797
so that the conservation effort
continues in the long term.

00:43:30.797 --> 00:43:33.130
Can you talk about that and
how the efforts you're doing

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:34.690
are bringing money
to the communities

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.878
or what's paying for
the schools, all that?

00:43:38.878 --> 00:43:41.490
JOHN BATTELLE: From a
technology standpoint,

00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:46.860
there's a lot going on from
education, family planning,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.710
really, really critical
components that

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:51.810
come through the process of
using technology-- education,

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:55.250
lights, laptops, education
centers, and so forth.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.940
What we have found
is there are so

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.204
many little examples of this.

00:43:58.204 --> 00:43:59.870
On the biggest scale,
obviously everyone

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.937
has always talked
about ecotourism.

00:44:01.937 --> 00:44:03.520
You bring wildlife,
you build a lodge,

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.220
that's an incredible thing.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.400
That's a simple one in
terms of understanding.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.300
In terms of pastoral
communities,

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.670
you have obviously cattle
and those kind of components

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.220
that are really,
really critical.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.720
There are a lot of
programs going on

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.610
about how to grow your own food,
how to manage your own food.

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:22.490
We usually tie that into
the school components.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:25.290
GINGER THOMPSON: We have
farms at all of the schools.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.540
Not all of them have them yet.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.230
But we actually
now run 19 schools,

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.250
and there are farms on I think
about 15 of the 19 schools,

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:35.200
and they're actually
community managed.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.610
So the produce that comes
from the school farm

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:40.660
not only feeds the
kids lunch, but also

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.400
actually is sold by
community members.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.220
So it becomes a source
of income for them.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.580
So that's a piece.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.100
We have a microcredit program.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.920
And women have started, I
think, over 1,000 businesses

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.780
now in Northern Kenya that
are active and thriving,

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.770
and all kinds of businesses.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:01.510
You can explore your
imagination and probably come up

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:02.704
with what they're doing.

00:45:02.704 --> 00:45:04.120
They're doing all
kinds of things.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:04.920
JOHN BATTELLE: They
have grandmothers

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.730
doing sewing projects for
the schools for uniforms

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:08.730
and so forth.

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.680
So it's all very interconnected.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.570
If one community is doing
sewing of, say, uniforms,

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:16.155
that can go across all
these different communities.

00:45:16.155 --> 00:45:19.330
GEOFFERY CHEGE: We also gave
got up to 10 water projects

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.180
whereby water has been
harnessed for agriculture,

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.020
that kind of farm produce.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.380
It goes toward sustaining
the family needs.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.660
And then from there, the
excess is sold to the market

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.120
and brings more
cash to the family.

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.260
GINGER THOMPSON: And we're doing
things like biomass stoves.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:42.210
We have biomass stoves in
one community as a test.

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.770
And what it's doing is
basically freeing up at the time

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:50.090
that women were spending walking
into the forest cutting limbs

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.220
off trees, which we didn't
want to have happen,

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.280
and then walking back.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.220
That was an eight-hour process.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.640
Now the women are
cooking at home.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:02.160
They manage those bio gas
stoves in about an hour a day,

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.900
and they suddenly have
seven hours of free time

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.660
and they're starting businesses.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.895
So each piece, each cog in the
wheel makes a big difference.

00:46:10.895 --> 00:46:12.810
JOHN BATTELLE:
It's very holistic.

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.700
You can't look at
individual problems.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.212
You have to look across.

00:46:16.212 --> 00:46:17.670
You're going to
affect this region.

00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:21.490
You have to look across the
impact across multiple things.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.072
You want kids to go to school.

00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:25.530
When I started, I was like,
I'm putting power into schools.

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.780
I think this is a great thing.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.080
I'm putting power into clinics.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.551
Well, if I can't feed
the child one meal a day,

00:46:30.551 --> 00:46:32.050
they're not going
to come to school.

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:33.430
And if I can't afford
a book, they're

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.340
not going to come to school.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.650
If I can't afford teachers,
I need teacher housing.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:39.420
So power, which is a
world that I came from,

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.020
a little bit on the
technology side,

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.729
I looked at like I'm
doing a great thing.

00:46:42.729 --> 00:46:44.394
And then as you get
into it, you realize

00:46:44.394 --> 00:46:46.120
that there's so many
lower elements that

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.750
have to be solved in
conjunction with that problem.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.495
So it becomes pretty
powerful to engage

00:46:53.495 --> 00:46:55.120
on the ground over
there, because there

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.520
are so many different levels.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.380
And the thing is, this is
what makes Lewa the anchor

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:00.880
and the gateway to
the North for me.

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.150
When I started looking at
where I can have impact,

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:08.380
Lewa as an institution,
as a conservancy,

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.440
has logistical capabilities,
they have access on the ground,

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.520
they have skills,
and they have people.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.067
So when you bring an
idea to the ground,

00:47:16.067 --> 00:47:18.400
there's no better place to
develop it, test it, and move

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.744
it out than Lewa.

00:47:19.744 --> 00:47:21.535
And that is why you
see those conservancies

00:47:21.535 --> 00:47:23.927
to the north developing--
because they know

00:47:23.927 --> 00:47:25.510
at the end of the
day they've got Lewa

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:28.055
as an anchor to support
those organizations.

00:47:28.055 --> 00:47:29.600
GINGER THOMPSON:
"How can technology

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.700
help with education?"

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.670
We have this program
where we are currently

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.760
supporting the education
of about 5,500 kids

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.380
in an area around Lewa.

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.390
We also have a
scholarship program

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.350
that gets kids out
to secondary schools.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:49.120
And one, we'd like to grow that.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.260
And that actually is
something that we're

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:53.650
going to implement
across Northern Kenya

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:56.440
to get kids from
primary school up

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.390
into secondary schools, which
is a big leap financially

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:00.510
for the families.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.630
Primary school is free in
Kenya, but secondary school

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.730
is a year's salary for somebody.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:11.740
So if we can get more kids
into secondary school-- and one

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.420
of the ways we're thinking
of doing this is literally

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.980
by starting almost like a KiVa
program that would support

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:21.260
individual students as
they go through school.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.920
So we call it a bursary program.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.980
We have 300 kids
in it right now.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.770
And individuals like
each of us are all

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.417
supporting kids in the
schools right now who

00:48:32.417 --> 00:48:34.000
are going to boarding
school, and some

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.670
are going to
university, and we've

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.730
had graduates from medical
school this summer.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.500
It was very exciting.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.780
We want to do a lot more of
that across a greater geography.

00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:47.950
We don't have the systems in
place to really manage this.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.200
So we need help with that,
and technology could really

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:50.817
be helpful.

00:48:50.817 --> 00:48:53.400
JOHN BATTELLE: We keep talking
about technology on the ground.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.941
But the other
component of technology

00:48:54.941 --> 00:48:58.160
that we haven't talked about
is connecting corporations,

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.510
donors, and other
organizations to the efforts

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.240
that are on the ground.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.789
Traditionally today, when a
donor looks at something--

00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:05.830
I want to build a school.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:07.314
I want to put my name on that.

00:49:07.314 --> 00:49:08.230
And we build a school.

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.271
Even if we don't need it,
we will build a school.

00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:12.120
Because somebody is
going to give us money.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.110
The reality is that our
ability through technology

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:18.240
to better connect where the
dollars need to go and better

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.500
connect the donor to seeing the
work being done on the ground

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.814
is a really important
next up for us so

00:49:23.814 --> 00:49:24.980
that we can more granualize.

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.370
I want you to come to me and
say, I want to build a school,

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:30.340
and I want to be able
to say within Lewa,

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.284
a school is great, but here's
five things in education

00:49:33.284 --> 00:49:34.700
that are more
important, and I can

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.851
keep you aware of
all these things.

00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:39.350
Because as donors, we're still
locked into brick and mortar.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:42.050
We're like, I want to see
something physically made

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.050
that I know is there.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.630
And with technology,
we can probably

00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:46.489
break that barrier
down much better

00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:48.280
and be able to show
the impact that they're

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.140
giving on a much
more granular level.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.040
And we haven't actually
begun to do that yet.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:52.980
GINGER THOMPSON: Yeah.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.310
And that's where things
like power comes in.

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:58.130
If we can get power up to some
of these remote communities,

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:01.900
we can get kids on some
kind of device and learning.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:04.845
And we had one child who
we were able to furnish

00:50:04.845 --> 00:50:07.730
his house with a solar light.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:11.370
And as a result, he was able
to do his homework at home,

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:14.020
and he ended up getting
into Nairobi University,

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:18.040
and he's now doing really
well in a Ph.D. program.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.620
This was a few years ago.

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.470
It was tough to get
him enough power

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:24.200
to do his homework at night so
he could qualify in the state

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:26.830
exams to get into university.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:27.800
But it is happening.

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.500
And these are small
steps we're making.

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.190
With support, we
can go the distance.

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.170
We really can.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:36.020
And I think what
John was saying is

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:40.810
Lewa is really well positioned
where financial efficacy is

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.570
top notch.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.120
It's why Sabrina, my colleague
who's in the back there,

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.340
and I really got involved.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.339
Because we saw what was
going on and we thought,

00:50:48.339 --> 00:50:51.520
wow, this is an
amazing organization.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:56.060
The investment here, the very
small amount of investment--

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:58.830
we run this whole thing on
$3 and 1/2 million a year.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:00.970
It's really extraordinary.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:03.120
That includes four
health clinics

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.830
that serve 60,000 people,
these schools that

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:09.620
are serving 5,500 kids, the
microcredit, all this stuff.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:14.310
It's an amazing anchor
for what can happen.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.830
And we're well poised.

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:17.280
We're well managed.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:20.810
It's very well organized to
really go a big distance.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:24.440
And we need lots of help
to do that, to scale it.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.140
OK.

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.580
Well, thank you all so much.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:31.895
Thanks Chege, and thank you
John and Gina and Sabrina,

00:51:31.895 --> 00:51:32.920
who came with us today.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.470
We really appreciate everybody.

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:36.320
And Catherine.
