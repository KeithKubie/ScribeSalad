[busy street sounds]

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.633
[rhythmic music playing]

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.700
AMAN SETHI: Everyone buys
water from the water mafia--

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.233
the rich, the poor,
the middle class.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.900
That's because Delhi
and its surroundings

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.633
have about 24 million people.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.133
And anywhere between
30% to 40% don't

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.500
have access to municipal water.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.567
And as the black market water
trade became more organized,

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:33.300
the trucks got
bigger, the people who

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.567
were controlling it got richer.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.233
Now the water mafia
behaves in a way

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.266
that this water
will last forever,

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:43.633
but as temperatures
continue to rise,

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.266
the mafia is finally
going to run out of water.

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.667
And that's when we're really
going to have a problem.

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:54.867
AARON WOLF
(VOICEOVER): The status

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:58.400
of the world's fresh water
supply today is a crisis as

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.567
big as anything out there.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:03.000
[people arguing in non-english]

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.200
Less than 1% of
the world's water

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400
is accessible for human use.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.166
Populations are going up.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.400
As economies grow and
countries develop,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.967
they use more and more water.

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:15.467
And we're polluting
what is, making

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.567
it less and less accessible.

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:21.266
[PEOPLE ARGUING LOUDLY IN NON
ENGLISH]

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.667
MARCUS KING (VOICEOVER):
Water scarcity is with us here

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:25.400
and now.

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:32.266
Warmer temperatures,
less predictable rains

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.834
will all combine to make
societies a little less stable.

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:39.934
AARON WOLF: People
generally have three sets

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:41.667
of responses to water scarcity.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:45.266
They can adapt if they have
the resources, they can move,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:47.633
or they can suffer and die.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:50.033
And if they're
moving, this becomes

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.367
a security concern worldwide.
