00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.880
Is talking like this bad for my voice?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.649
Or job prospects? or Life in general?

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:15.030
What is UP with Vocal Fry?

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.961
Vocal fry is the lowest of the four registers
of the human voice.

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:23.449
Our voice is made by air passing through a
set of soft flaps in our voicebox; or larynx.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.269
As we breathe, air moves past these flaps
and they can vibrate from 100 to 1000 times

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.269
a second.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:36.270
Like a brass instrument's mouthpiece, vocal
chords alone create a buzzing sound, but if

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:44.620
you put a resonator above it, like a horn,
you can affect a sound! [[play]] As we learn

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.239
to control the vibration, we use the throat,
mouth, and nasal cavity as our resonator.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.350
Our vocal chords can make four registers:
the lowest is fry, then modal, falsetto, and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.500
whistle on the top.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.719
Most people will speak and sing in the modal
range, and if you listen, you can tell when

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.280
people switch registers especially as they’re
singing.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.640
As you speak, the chords are vibrating smoothly,
but fry slams them shut, allowing only bubbles

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.590
of air to break through -- which is why it
sounds like popping.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.910
In 2012, the Journal of Voice released a study
exploring how young women aged 18-25 were

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.880
speaking in the lowest register, for some
reason!

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.740
Essentially, while talking would slip into
the vocal fry register -- again, something

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.049
rarely done in recent generational memory.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.049
Why?

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.049
NO IDEA.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.049
Seriously, no one knows.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.790
But it's definitely new.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.070
In 1972, a study in the Journal of Speech
and Hearing Disorders explored judgements

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.650
of voice quality in both men and women and
found 5 to 10 percent of people had quote

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.909
"some type of… pathology that produced a
deviant voice quality."

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.689
Speaking outside the modal range is considered
a deviance, so from this result we know people

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.520
were definitely using it in the late-20th
century.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.080
In the 90s, men and women who were in their
40s used it during a study for the Acoustical

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.880
Society of America.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.140
And today, in an disappointingly tiny study
from Long Island University, found two-thirds

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.130
of women used the fry.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.860
In the past both men and women have used deep
voices to convey authority of gravitas, and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.040
looking at the CEOs of 800 public companies,
scientists found deeper voices made more money.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.690
In fact, according to their study, as pitch
of the voice decreased, the CEO’s salary

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.550
increased and deeper voices infer longer tenure
too.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.360
Plus, a 2013 PLOS ONE study found women associate
sexual attractiveness with deeper, breathier

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.760
male voices but men, on the other hand, looked
for higher pitched voices in their heteronormative

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.230
mates -- and their result?

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.280
It's all about body size.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.680
Deeper voices meant larger bodies which then
equated to more power.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.300
Regardless, this affectation or tic, is gaining
popularity, especially with women, though

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.129
I really want to stress the point that men
do it too -- women are just getting crap for

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.129
it.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.310
Researchers can only guess why it's gaining
popularity in women, though there are hypotheses.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.302
Perhaps, the use of the vocal fry is to mimic
that "power" or "male attractiveness?"

00:03:03.302 --> 00:03:07.550
Or, just as likely, it's something completely
different!

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.060
We know we're doing it more, and we know that
some people don't like that.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.830
A 2014 PlosONE study found people over 40
think females using vocal fry sound like they

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.799
"lack authority" but those UNDER 40 don't
care one bit.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.400
So, know your audience, but speak like you
want!

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400
In the end, it's not physically harmful according
to vocal coach Ken Taylor, and as long as

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.051
you're not using it constantly or yelling
while doing vocal fry, you shouldn't see any

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:32.900
long-term issues.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.569
Noam Chomsky's voice has vocal fry, and so
does the former head of the New York Times

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.510
Jill Abramson it all the time, I don't see
anyone giving him crap about it.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.069
You do you girls and guys.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.629
Do you speak with vocal fry?

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.299
If you weren't sure before, you'll probably
hear it all the time now.

00:03:46.299 --> 00:04:10.409
What do you think of it?
