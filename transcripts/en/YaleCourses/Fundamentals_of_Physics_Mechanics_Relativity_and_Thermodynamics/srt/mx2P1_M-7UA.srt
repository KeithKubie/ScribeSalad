1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,660
So this is a new topic called the
physics of dynamics of rigid bodies,

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,360
so did did body is something
that will not bend,

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,480
will not change its shape
when you apply forces to it,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,490
and one example could be a
dime or coin or neither stick.

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,540
Of course, nobody's absolutely
rigid. You can always bend anything,

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,190
but we'll take the approximation
that we have in our hands,

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,040
a completely rigid body.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,270
The technical definition of a rigid body
is that if you pick a couple of points,

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,560
the distance between them does not
change during the motion of the body.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,490
So the dynamics of rigid bodies in
three dimensions is fairly complicated

11
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,150
because what I want you to
imagine now is not a point mass,

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,880
but some object with
some shape like this guy,

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,490
take this and throw it up in the air.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,850
You can see it does
something fairly complicated.

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,513
In fact,

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,530
we can characterize what it
does using two expressions.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,410
I think you can guess what they are.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,340
One is if this had been a
point mass than the point mass,

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,590
we'll just go back and
forth that up and down.

20
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,900
It will do what's called translations.
It will go from a place to another place,

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,840
maybe on a straight line, maybe on a
curve, but as it goes, the point masters,

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,740
no further information. We got to tell
me where it is and how fast it's moving.

23
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,530
That's the whole story.
But if you have a body like this,

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,090
it's not enough to tell me where it is
because if I throw this up in the air,

25
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,450
you can imagine that asset
travels along some parabolic path.

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,670
One instant it is,

27
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,210
it may look like this next instant
it isn't may look like this.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,520
So we say that it is
translating and rotating.

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,810
It's a non obvious theorem that anything
the body does from one instance to the

30
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:08,700
next instant can be achieved by first
translating it than doing a slight,

31
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,870
slight rotation to bring it to the
configuration you want. In other words,

32
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:17,871
you can go from here to here by a
translation followed way rotation.

33
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,900
Now translation is what we've been
studying all the time because four point

34
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:28,320
particles, there is no
notion of retention. I take
a point mass and rotated.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,040
You don't even know. It's rotating
data's no internal variables.

36
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,830
So that was the problem we've
been focusing on, but not,

37
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:39,480
we're going to enlarge over to study
two objects which have a size and which

38
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,330
have a shape.
That's what we are to have an orientation.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,260
It's not enough to say the football
is here, who ball could be here,

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,470
but as long pointy and could
be up to Donner site to site.

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,350
So what we want to do is to
break the problem into two parts.

42
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,480
We want to focus on a body which
only rotating but not translating.

43
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Once we sharpened our skills,

44
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,770
we will then put back the
ability of the body to translate.

45
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,390
So they're going to focus initially
on a body that cannot translate.

46
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:17,830
So what that means is you take the
body and you grabbed one point in it,

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,510
then you can ask what can it do?
If I grabbed one point and well,

48
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,190
any motion it does,
we'd be set at that point is not moving.

49
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,430
Now in three dimensions.

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,520
If you take a football and at
certain point is held fixed,

51
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:35,140
it can generate in many ways.

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,030
But at any instant you can show what it
would be doing is to be doing a rotation

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,600
out on an access passing through the point
where you're grabbing it because the,

54
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,630
if it rotates through an access points
on the axis don't move and the point

55
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:54,400
where to grabbing it better lie on that
axis. Now that's also pretty complicated.

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,260
You can see why I gave you a little
precautionary thing because it's hard to

57
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:04,060
visualize these things. So again, I want
to take the simplest possible problem,

58
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,590
then make it more and more complex.

59
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,850
Now you might say the simplest thing
you've been doing all semester long is to

60
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:14,770
take things in one dimension,
but that turns out to be too low.

61
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,170
If you've got any one dimension and
you've got a rigid body by a bit,

62
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,380
rigid body means not only extended
but actually rigid. For example,

63
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:27,670
if you take a cat or a snake,
a snake,

64
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:31,240
you can grab at one point or the snake
is not simply doing rotations around the

65
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:33,040
one point right?
Trying to bite you,

66
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,920
trying to move around because
steak is not a rigid body.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,140
That's Nate could be rigid body living,
snake, definitely not ready to buy it.

68
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,120
Now you got to remember that I've given
you a break by studying rigid bodies,

69
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,340
but real bodies,
uh,

70
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,730
can actually not only
wobble and twist and turn,

71
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,190
they can also vibrate and they
can move their arms around.

72
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,050
That's much more difficult.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,310
So we won't go there and we will
try to take the simplest rigid body.

74
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,560
But I said if I take a
rigid body in one dimension,

75
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,570
it cannot rotate at all because there's
not room in one dimension to rotate.

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,340
It can only go back and forth.

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,030
So to show you that as
some new possibility,

78
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:15,010
I have to go at least two dimensions.

79
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:18,490
Here's one example where
one dimension is not enough.

80
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,720
So I'm going to imagine rigid bodies
which are living in the plane of the

81
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,554
blackboard.

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,730
Now one way to do that is to take a
piece of battle, just cut out a shape

83
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,030
that's a rigid body.

84
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,740
Now of course this has a slight thickness
because anything you make of matter

85
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:40,630
and has some thickness
at please one atom thick.

86
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,490
But imagine that thickness is negligible.

87
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,370
So it's like a piece of metal
piece of foil or something,

88
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:48,370
but it's rigid and this is the rigid body.
We are going to study.

89
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,050
This rigid body can move in the
plane of the blackboard and rotate,

90
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,670
but we're going to grab it at one point.

91
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,160
So let's pick some point here.

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,550
If I grabbed it at that point and I
asked you what can this fellow do you

93
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,130
imagine skewer didn't get through
the blackboard. You say, okay,

94
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:08,000
do whatever you want.

95
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,690
You realize that all it can do is to
rotate around an axis penetrating that

96
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:14,864
point.

97
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,520
So let's say a Tig weld the zero,

98
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,100
the body look like this a little later,
it's going to look rotated.

99
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,720
I have to tell you what it
is doing at a given instance.

100
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,510
I have to tell you how each audience,

101
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,800
so what we do for that is we draw
through the point of rotation.

102
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,630
Some line you can pick any line you like,

103
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,020
pick a line like that and we'd say what
angle that line makes with the standard

104
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,730
Joyson direction.
Usually the x axis

105
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,360
fake give you a data. I think you have
to think about it and you have to agree.

106
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,550
I've told you where the bodies, you
can reconstruct everything, right?

107
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,260
Because that point is nailed. It
cannot move. You take the body,

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,440
you're trying to buy an angle data.
In other words, here is a question.

109
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,850
Suppose you're not in this room.

110
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,440
You go to another room and I want to
tell you what did they did body is doing?

111
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,510
What information do I have to communicate
to you without seeing the picture I

112
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,170
claim if I tell you how the
line was drawn in the body,

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,020
which is something you do
once and for all ruled line,

114
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,050
then I say the rural line makes
an angle data with the exact axis.

115
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,920
I believe you can imagine in another room
what his body is doing and that's the

116
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:35,090
meaning of saying I've given
complete information. Of course,

117
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:38,450
that's not a complete
dynamical information because
it also depends on how fast

118
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,293
is rotating,

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,560
but to simply say the analog of where the
body is in one dimension is this angle

120
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,100
data.
So what we're going to set up,

121
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,430
you will find is an analogy between
one dimensional translation and two

122
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:59,000
dimensional rotations.
You'll find the analogy is very helpful.

123
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,950
So I'm going to use the piece of the
blackboard where I'll keep drawing that

124
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,784
analogy.

125
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,330
I do this because the number
of things you have to remember,

126
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:13,700
it would be reduced if you map this
problem mathematically to the problem with

127
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,290
translation. One dimension, in
other words, in one dimension,
when a body is moving,

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,590
x tells you where did this right?
I give you a number three,

129
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:27,591
a Pi or minus 14 you know where it is for
this rigid body living in the plane of

130
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:31,160
the blackboard is angled.
Data tells you

131
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,680
what the body's doing. So even
though the body is in two dimensions,

132
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,430
you need this one angle data to
tell you what is orientations.

133
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,480
You don't need two numbers.

134
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:44,060
A single number tells you
what the digit bodies doing,

135
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,860
so a little later it could be
rotated by an angle. Delta data.

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,710
That's the analog of seeing it
move from x to x Plus Delta X.

137
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,210
First thing you've got to do is how
do you want to measure data for x?

138
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:04,200
We know we have agreed we're
going to measured in meters data.

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,460
The standard preference for people at
elementary stages system measured in

140
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:13,410
degrees. You measured in degrees and when
the body complete one full revolution,

141
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,860
you like to say, let's turn by
an angle of three 60 degrees.

142
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,750
Now that is not the preferred
way to measure angles.

143
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:25,020
In more advanced dynamics,
we're going to use something else.

144
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,060
You can imagine what it is.

145
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,240
You know what I'm driving at in
nobody know where I'm going. Radium.

146
00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:33,270
So I'm going towards radiants
and you can ask yourself,

147
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:37,800
why would anybody think of a radiant?
What's wrong with three 60 degrees?

148
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,960
I mean all the textbooks, I mean
all the novels say, you know,

149
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:45,060
I was going down the wrong
path than I did a one 80 right?

150
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,290
So everyone knows.

151
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Like I saw a book by a violinist who said
I was going down all the wrong things.

152
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:57,741
Then I did a three 60 so you
realize that three 60 years,

153
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,200
not really weird way to reform your life,

154
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,970
but I'm on the physicist.

155
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:07,971
It struck a chord in physics or three
60 is really not a trivial thing to do.

156
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,830
It turns out the particles in the world
that divided into Bose arms and fermions

157
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,190
and half of the particles or bosons and
roughly half affirming of electron is a

158
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,024
fermion.

159
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,090
The light quantum boys on and set for
trial for all the guys who are photons are

160
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:27,570
bosons. If you turn them by three 60
they come back to what they are doing.

161
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,070
Electronic turns out when you turn it
by three 60 all the numbers going into

162
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:38,940
minus those numbers and only when you
turned by seven 20 you come back to

163
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,590
technically what you're doing.

164
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,960
So it's quite possible this
person had in mind the behavior.

165
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,060
Maybe she was from [inaudible]
but that's what it said.

166
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,850
I did a three 60 but I've
got the three 60 many times.

167
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:54,660
So if you use it you better back it up
with the kind of information that gave.

168
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:58,470
Otherwise you just off by a factor of two.
Anyway,

169
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,730
ThreeSixty is very nice.

170
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:03,270
I think the Babylonians like three 60 for
lot of reasons is divisible by a whole

171
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:06,690
bunch of numbers that are easy to
partition into smaller and smaller pieces.

172
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,030
I believe in some engineering circles,
a circle is 400 something else,

173
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:14,940
some other engineering degrees.
So you can decide what a circle is,

174
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,090
but we like a radiant.
So let's ask,

175
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:21,090
why do we like it radio for that purpose.

176
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,900
I want you to take a point here at a
distance r from the center and let it move

177
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,010
to a new location with
an angle Delta Theta.

178
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,820
You agree that if the
rigid body is rotating,

179
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:41,270
this guy will be traversing a circle of
radius art because it's a rigid body.

180
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:44,880
It cannot change the
distance from this point.

181
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,790
So we'll be going around in a circle and
I'm asking you how big is that segment

182
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:56,080
that are clanked delta that it
has traveled when it was rotated?

183
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,190
Ben Angle Delta data.

184
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,210
So one way to calculate that is to
say, look, if I did a full circle,

185
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,140
I would have done to pay our

186
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,330
artists the distance of this point.

187
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,340
In that I did body from the
center [inaudible] listen
to two Pi r but I've Gone

188
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,210
Delta Theta.

189
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,850
So the fraction of the circle I have
covered you still today over three 60

190
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,050
if data is measured in degrees,
so let me indicate that in this fashion

191
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,150
so we can write this ass Pi over one 80

192
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,130
Delta Theta
claims are

193
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,750
if you measured data and degrees,

194
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,350
this is what you have to do to convert
an angular Trevor's to an actual distance

195
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,100
along the kind into the circle,
the linear distance you travel,

196
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,030
it's connected with the angle by which
you rotate by the distance r from the

197
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:05,200
center. And this number
here. So people say, look,

198
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,800
why don't we make life easy
by calling data at times,

199
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,570
Pi would one 80 as a new angle.

200
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,380
Let's call it Delta Theta fines are

201
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,210
so Delta Theta without any little zero
on top of it stands for radiants from no

202
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,650
one and related to favor,

203
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,810
he thought the deltas data itself is
data in degrees times Pi over one 80

204
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,620
then the advantages, the distance
you travel, linear distance,

205
00:13:43,621 --> 00:13:45,990
you travel better.
Simple relations.

206
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,100
The angle you travel by the
arm length are from the center

207
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,120
so you don't have to carry this
one 80 and pie and everything.

208
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,870
You can write the simple design
but now when you do this,

209
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,930
you are measuring it in radio. So you've
got to have an idea. How big is it radio?

210
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,380
Well a full circle.
If you go full circle,

211
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,870
the distance you travel should be to PR.

212
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,870
So full circle we'll be
Delta Theta equals two Pi.

213
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,350
So your circle is worth two Pi Radians
to pious like six so one radians roughly

214
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,260
one six to three 60 which is 60 degrees.

215
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,560
The real answer is close
to 58 something degrees.

216
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,840
It looks like an odd thing to pick.

217
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,850
It's odd only if you start
with three 60 degrees,

218
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:31,000
but if you met people
from an alien culture,

219
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
he's just got to go to the
supermarket around. Did these people,

220
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,110
those people may not be
using three 60 at all.

221
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,060
Three 60 is a human artifact.

222
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,870
Nothing special about three 60 that's
independent of our own cultural biases.

223
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,220
Baby connected.

224
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,770
How many fingers we have to maybe
connect to how long a year is and so on.

225
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,140
There's nothing natural about the
number two 62 Pi. On the other hand,

226
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:57,050
I believe would be discovered
Baney advanced civilization.

227
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,230
If you haven't figured out Pie,
you're not advanced civilization.

228
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:01,520
If you haven't figured out too,

229
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:06,521
you're way behind them so you're not too
and you know pie and that's what other

230
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,890
cultures in other planets and
galaxies would it be using.

231
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
That's the unit we like to use.

232
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:16,520
You'll find over and over people
using units which are natural to us,

233
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,820
but later on if you want to communicate
with people in another planet,

234
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,240
you will have to use different links.
For example,

235
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,300
the height of a human are the
length of Napoleon's army.

236
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,270
They're not very good units. If you don't
have an airport in, in your background,

237
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,680
you don't know what you're talking about,

238
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,000
but if you mentioned distances in how
big it is in terms of an hydrogen atom,

239
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,040
hydrogen atoms all over the universe,
that's the natural length scale to use.

240
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,140
This is a very popular issue.

241
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,410
In the old days when they sent off a
rocket or the buried something underground

242
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,010
for aliens to find out,
you want to show how tall we are.

243
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
No use giving the answered in
meters or feet or anything,

244
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,340
but if we can somehow relate your
size the size of a hydrogen atom,

245
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,080
then that number will make sense to people
in all civilizations because hydrogen

246
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:04,070
atoms conveniently are manufactured and
scattered all over the universe and they

247
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:09,050
have the same size. Okay. Anyway,
that's a long thing about ratings.

248
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,610
That's why we like to use radios.

249
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,590
You have to know a few popular angles
and radiant measure because I'll be using

250
00:16:15,591 --> 00:16:20,591
only radiants most of the time you got
to know a circle is two pi by user,

251
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,930
half a circle and Pi over
two is quarter circle,

252
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,830
so when you turn by 90 degrees is Pi over
two is that something you should know

253
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,860
once you write it this way, let's get
another result. That's very useful.

254
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Take the distance of travels along the
tangents by the time over which it does

255
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:40,904
that

256
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,380
this,

257
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,190
it's the actual pageant,

258
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:52,060
some speed or the magnitude of the
velocity in the tangential direction.

259
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,320
I think you all agree with that.

260
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,550
That's what you and I would mean by
speed if other instant this piece of the

261
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:01,840
sample just broke and flew off,
it'll keep flying. Would that speed

262
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,373
this thing?

263
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,800
We have a symbol for it. Omega three and
Omega is called the angular velocity.

264
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:12,960
Okay,

265
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,660
and is measured in Radians per second

266
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,070
so you cannot, you can calculate and
good velocity for various things.

267
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,720
For example, what's the angular velocity
of the moon as it goes around the earth?

268
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,900
Well, angular velocity will be one
revolution every 28 days, right?

269
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:39,901
One Revolution is two Pi Radians at 28
days you do 28 times 24 times 3,600 if

270
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,260
that many radians per second,

271
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,770
oh that's a chain saw blade and the chain
size spinning at some number of Rpm,

272
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,700
maybe 3000 rpm.
You can take revolutions per minute.

273
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:56,400
Two revolutions per second.
What you've got to remember,

274
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,770
every revolution is two Pi Radians.

275
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,630
So the angle of velocity off of blade,

276
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,030
that spinning with
frequency F is two Pi f.

277
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,800
You understand that f is the
number of complete revolutions?

278
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,500
It does definitely pick a point on it.

279
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,770
It does at travelers of 2.5 radians.

280
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:22,980
So the dictionary has
got a second member here,

281
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,010
which is the velocity,
which is DXDT.

282
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,800
There's no the place, the angular
velocity, which is de, De, de, De, de.

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,500
This is an analogy by the way,

284
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,700
this is to help you say omega is like
what velocity used to be in the old days

285
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,550
when things are moving back and forth,
but no, they're going round and round.

286
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:47,380
But even here,
there's the notion of velocity,

287
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,860
what is not in meters per second
as measured in Radians per second.

288
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:54,490
Now here is something that you guys
got to keep very clear in your head.

289
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:56,710
I can only mention it to you
but I cannot do it for you.

290
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,970
This Omega is an analogous
thing to ordinary velocity,

291
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:05,140
but that is also an actual velocity here.
The good old velocity,

292
00:19:05,141 --> 00:19:09,040
that's the tangential velocity of points
with that part of a rotating the dead

293
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:13,630
body. That is not part of my dictionary,
but it's a very useful result to know.

294
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,820
The tangential velocity is the angle
of velocity times the distance of that

295
00:19:18,821 --> 00:19:21,220
point from the center of the rotation.

296
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,560
So the rigid body as a whole has a single,
I ain't got a velocity.

297
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,290
That's what it means to be redone.
The whole thing is rotating.

298
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,610
You cannot say the angle of velocity
so and so here and so and so there.

299
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:36,700
It's the property of the entire
body for the linear velocity.

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not the same everywhere points and
yet here in the same time go that far

301
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:46,840
and points and yet he hadn't the same
time go that far for the linear velocity

302
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:49,740
increases from the center of the time.

303
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:54,010
The angular velocity is constant and
it's a rigid body cannot have to angular

304
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:58,230
velocities. It's going to have only
one angle over the last year. Okay.

305
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,000
Then what we do is we say,
okay,

306
00:20:00,001 --> 00:20:03,930
let's take a problem with the
angular velocity is itself changing.

307
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,600
Fine.
That's the analog of saying,

308
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,400
let us have an agent of change of velocity
and here we have a quantity called

309
00:20:12,401 --> 00:20:13,234
Alpha,

310
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,410
which is the rate of change of I ain't
going to velocity or the second rate of

311
00:20:17,411 --> 00:20:20,950
change of the angle,
and that's been noted by Alpha.

312
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,790
So if you took a team,

313
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,930
if you took one of these rotating circular
saws and it was spinning at a certain

314
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:34,070
speed and due to friction, let
us see the slowing down. I'd,

315
00:20:34,071 --> 00:20:35,870
when you turn on the motor speeding up,

316
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:40,310
suppose he just turned on the saw
motor and it's speeding up in the,

317
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,210
in his rotation.

318
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,820
You've got to be very clear
that the acceleration of
that of parts, this is the,

319
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,170
this is the saw blade. Okay. This I'm
trying to draw for you. One of these uh,

320
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,990
saw blades and it's spinning. If you
pick up points they on the circumference,

321
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,820
you remember long back we learned even
if it's going at a constant speed,

322
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,230
constant angular speed,

323
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:10,050
it has a tangential velocity which is
Omega Times are and because of that it'll

324
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,630
have an acceleration towards the center
centripetal acceleration which is v

325
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,590
squared over r and you can
write it as Omega squared,

326
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:20,700
r squared over r Omega squared off.

327
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,410
That's one acceleration. It has. Even
if we're spinning at a steady rate,

328
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,730
but I'm saying it can also have a
tangential acceleration if on top of

329
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:34,240
everything else the angular
speed itself is changing.

330
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,540
Let's take our time digesting that.
This is not too hard,

331
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,770
but I want you guys to understand
if it's spinning at a steady omega,

332
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,930
we have learned anything going in.

333
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,070
A circle has an old fashioned linear
acceleration toward the center,

334
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,630
which is v squared over R,

335
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,710
but we have realized V in the Tangential
Directions Omega are so if you put that

336
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:57,700
in,
do you want,

337
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,540
you can call it be tangential that
gives me Omega squared r that just the v

338
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:06,541
squared over r but if you put the brakes
on this by speeding up or slowing down,

339
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:10,050
it'll have an addition,
an acceleration in this FedEx,

340
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,200
so an acceleration of a point on the
edge at anywhere else can have two

341
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,034
components.

342
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,250
The tangent should want it to be that
only if you speed up or slow down the

343
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,750
rotating disk, but the radio one will
always be there as long as it's rotating.

344
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,061
Okay.

345
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:32,061
Once you've got this dictionary new
can have a whole bunch of analogous

346
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,350
quantities.
What example,

347
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,070
if you focus on problems
where the body is,

348
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,250
has a constant angular acceleration alpha,

349
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,790
what can you say where you can already
say that data would be the theta?

350
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:52,070
Not less initial angle of velocity
plus one half hour 50 square.

351
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,640
This is because data is behaving just like
x. If x had a constant acceleration, a,

352
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,970
we all knew x was equal to the starting
x plus initial velocity times time plus

353
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,300
one half 80 square.
Similarly,

354
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,250
the angle by which it rotates
will be the initial angle,

355
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,230
initial angle of velocity time
plus something involving p square.

356
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,670
This is only if alpha is a constant.
This lake,

357
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:24,130
I hope you guys know this is true.
Only if ace account.

358
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,520
All right, now I'm going to
pursue the analogy and ask

359
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,260
what is the kinetic energy offered?
We did body

360
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,050
winter's rotate.
Yes.

361
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,390
Yeah.
Acceleration with Alpha here.

362
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,590
Um, right next to the salt lake. Oh, here.

363
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,390
Uh Oh. Up this one. Yeah.

364
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,940
I'm saying if you have a rotating disk,
take any point on rotating disk.

365
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,150
Even if the disc is going at
constant angular velocity,

366
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:12,200
it has a tangential velocity and the
direction of the velocity is constantly

367
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,570
changing.
This is the oldest thing we learned,

368
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:19,340
so it has an acceleration
towards the center that is
not an angular acceleration.

369
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,030
It's just a standard acceleration
toward the center of anything going in a

370
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:26,660
circle that's always going to be there,
but on top of it,

371
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,600
if you speed up or slow down
the rotation rate of the disk,

372
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,130
you'll also have a tangential
acceleration, which is alpha times the

373
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,610
are
not clear yet.

374
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,510
That's the acceleration
lay people would know.

375
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,560
If you're on a rotating platform and
somebody sped up the rotation rate,

376
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,770
you will notice you're going faster.
That's the acceleration,

377
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,790
the tangential direction,

378
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,880
the acceleration towards the
center is a more sophisticated one.

379
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:59,280
We have learned and it's due to the
fact that velocity is a vector and auto

380
00:24:59,281 --> 00:25:02,300
scaler, so the direction is
changing. There's an acceleration.

381
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,480
We associated with that and it as
real as any other acceleration.

382
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,070
It needs a force to make it happen.
Maybe the better way to ask you is this.

383
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,440
Suppose this little Spec here is you,

384
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,060
okay,

385
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,060
you happen to be stuck on a rotating
chainsaw blade and you're clinging to it

386
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:23,930
for dear life.

387
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,130
What force do you have to apply
to stay on for the rotating blade?

388
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,290
This may not happen to you and me,
but you know, fuel, organized crime.

389
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,750
This is not a very unusual situation.
Uh,

390
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,890
you can find yourself intermingled with
all kinds of machinery and you want to

391
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:43,640
know what do I do to stay on?
Well, Newton tells you the answer.

392
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,170
You wouldn't say this. If you want to
be on this rotating chainsaw blade,

393
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,260
your acceleration toward the
center has to be paid for.

394
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,470
And if the blade is speaking of speed,
that's gotta be paid for two.

395
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,090
That's the net acceleration.

396
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,900
That time is your mass will be the
force that has to be applied to you.

397
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,720
So you will cling on to it with that
force and that force will be applied in

398
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:08,660
turn by the third law,
by the disk on you.

399
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,060
For example. Suppose it's a top
view of a rotating platform.

400
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,870
You're just standing there and the
platform is rotating. You can ask,

401
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,990
what force does it,
what frictional force does it need?

402
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,450
Do I need to stay on the platform?
Well,

403
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,000
you need the force to provide you
with a man. And I'm telling you,

404
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,960
you're a has two parts. Even if the merry
go down the spinning at a steady rate,

405
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,310
you will need to have a friction force
director towards the center to bend you

406
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:39,050
into a circle and if on top of it the
merry go round starts increasing its speed

407
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:43,160
or decreasing its speed, you'll also
needed tangential component of force.

408
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,240
Probably the tangential acceleration.
Okay.

409
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,270
Now this is kinematics off rotation
at constant angular acceleration.

410
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,270
It's identical to this one mathematically
because mathematically if you know

411
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,250
lead to data,
d d squared is alpha.

412
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,720
The answer is just like d two
x over d squared equals ae.

413
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,070
You changed the symbols.
You get the same answer.

414
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,330
You can imagine a variety of
problems I don't feel like doing.

415
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,820
I think you guys can easily do that.
I'd rather focus on more difficult ones.

416
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,683
But example,

417
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,960
a chain saw blade spinning at 3,600
RPM is decelerated or some rate alpha.

418
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,690
How long does it take to come to the rest?

419
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,060
Well for that you will like
the second formula or Megan,

420
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,590
he comes Omega Zero Plus Alpha t.

421
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,160
That's the analog of v Equals v zero
plus 80 and you start with some Omega,

422
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,350
not you put on the brakes.
Alpha will be some negative number.

423
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,740
You see at what time does Omega goes
to zero. That's when it'll stop.

424
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,650
Now that result,
which I will use today,

425
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:51,651
in fact it's the following or mega square
is Omegas zero square plus two alpha

426
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,640
it a minus state or not.

427
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,960
That's the analog of B
squared Equals v Zero Square.

428
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,160
Let's do a x minus x.
Now

429
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,170
this is if the body has an acceleration
alpha, then it's going to speak up speed.

430
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:15,171
Of course in the final speed square is
related initial angle of velocity squared

431
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,540
plus two times the acceleration
times the angle rotated.

432
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,660
So this is the analogy, so we don't
have to reinvent all of these things.

433
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,350
They just come from the fact that things
which are mathematically the same have

434
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:30,990
the same mathematical results
will be the same equation.

435
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:34,590
They were the same results.
All right,

436
00:28:34,591 --> 00:28:37,690
now let's find the Kennedy
Energy author. Rigid body, it's,

437
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,780
it's got mass and if we're spinning all
the little atoms making up the body are

438
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:43,614
moving.

439
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,220
They got their own one half MV squared
and we wanted to ask what does the total

440
00:28:47,221 --> 00:28:52,020
one, half MV squared, some Dover,
all the particles for that purpose.

441
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,440
It's convenient to take the
following simple. A rigid body

442
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,450
were taken into the body by taking
[inaudible] and one at that.

443
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:06,451
This is auto one connected to some
central hub with the massless rod and you

444
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:12,150
take another mass and
you'd take a third mass.

445
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,820
This is m two senators,
an art to this AME three at a distance,

446
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:18,990
r three and so on.

447
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,830
You can make a rigid body by
modeling it in a simple fashion.

448
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,380
If you are a little more abstract,

449
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,200
you can take a continuous rigid
body and do the same thing,

450
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:32,320
but let's start with the simple thing.
Here's the rigid body,

451
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:37,350
three rigid rods with mass as m one m
two and three and it's nailed here and

452
00:29:38,171 --> 00:29:43,030
that is a skewer going through the board
and things can only rotate around that.

453
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:45,941
By the way,

454
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:50,941
I should tell you the convention for Omega
in one dimensional motion velocity is

455
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:51,910
positive.

456
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,530
You're moving to the right and negative
here and moving to the left with angular

457
00:29:56,531 --> 00:30:00,700
velocity, we got to have a convention
on what's positive and what's negative.

458
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,570
This thing with the spinning can only
spend clockwise or counterclockwise.

459
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,320
It turns out to be that Omega is
positive for counterclockwise.

460
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,750
That just happens to be the kind
of mentioned people use. In fact,

461
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:20,200
you notice the way I drew the rigid
body when I did Delta Theta had rotating

462
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,100
counterclockwise.

463
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,350
That's the preferred direction for
measuring the angle theta from the x axis.

464
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,580
Okay?
Now let's take this rigid body.

465
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,660
It is rotating with a
common angular velocity.

466
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:37,000
I hope you all understand that
the meaning of being graded,

467
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,190
everybody's got the same
angle of Velocity Omega,

468
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,940
so what's the kinetic
energy of this object

469
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:49,670
is the kinetic energy of each
mass summed over all the masses.

470
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,330
I M I v I square.
Now,

471
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:55,890
what's the velocity of each object?

472
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,090
If you dig this body and one it's the
last day is necessarily perpendicular to

473
00:31:02,851 --> 00:31:07,140
the line. Joining it to the point of
rotation. This one is moving this way.

474
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,510
It cannot move in the line joining it
because if it is, it's not a rigid body,

475
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,890
rigid body. All distances are maintained
so you don't come near the center,

476
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,860
you don't go far from the center, so all
you can do is rotate around the center.

477
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,880
So the velocity of this Guy v one is equal
to Omega Times are one the last year.

478
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,540
This Guy v two it's the same
Omega Times are too so on.

479
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,590
So you can then add it all
up and what do you get?

480
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,680
You get one half some overt I
m I r I square omega squared

481
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:49,880
and you have to do the summation
over all the bodies. In my example,

482
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,540
summation goes from one to three. You may
have one to infinity. I want a million.

483
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,820
It doesn't matter.
That's the kinetic energy.

484
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,750
You guys follow this.
This is not a new candidate energy.

485
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,700
This is what we know to be kinetic energy.

486
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,960
Just one half MV where for every
piece that makes up the rigid body for

487
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:07,621
convenience,

488
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:10,830
I've taken that he did body to be
made up of a discrete set of masses,

489
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,180
but Navea notice as you go from one to
three m one and m two and m three at

490
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,270
three different numbers.

491
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,990
We don't know what the masses are are
when an art to an r three or three

492
00:32:21,991 --> 00:32:22,824
different numbers.

493
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:25,470
We don't know how each one could be at
a different business from the origin,

494
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,330
but the Omega doesn't have a subscript
I that nothing called Omega for this one

495
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:31,230
and we'll make up for that one.

496
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:35,340
There's only one Omega for everything
so you can pull it out of the sun and

497
00:32:35,341 --> 00:32:36,174
write it this way.

498
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,410
Okay.

499
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,730
Then the answer we write
as identical to one half,

500
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,700
I let me a square

501
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,110
and be given this ina I is
called the moment of an issue.

502
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,953
Yeah,

503
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,650
so continuing with the analogy,
this board is going to be as fun analogy.

504
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,470
We used to have k equal
to one half MV squared,

505
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,720
yet we are going to have k equal
to one half I omega squared

506
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,490
and I is called the moment of an issue.

507
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,930
So the moment of inertia is determined
not only by the masses that make up the

508
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,760
body,
but how far they are from the center.

509
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,170
If all the massive just fell on top of
the center of the body would have no

510
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:40,640
moment of inertia, it'll weigh the same
moment of inertia would vanish. Likewise,

511
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:45,530
if the massive spread out
[inaudible] she is more. For example,

512
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:49,460
if I'm standing around here and you
come along and decide to spin me,

513
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,750
I'm standing like this, we try to
spin me for sticking my hand sewed.

514
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,770
My moment of inertia has changed because
some of my mass now is further away

515
00:33:57,771 --> 00:33:59,060
from the axis of rotation.

516
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,970
So one metal finish year depends
on the arrangement of the masses.

517
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
We're taking a rigid body,

518
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:11,180
not like ice dancers who do this with
talking about a rigid body. Therefore,

519
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,680
men of inertia is constant.

520
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,143
Okay?

521
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,750
But it requires a calculation
to find the moment of inertia.

522
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,630
And here's another important thing.

523
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,910
If I decide to rotate the body about
a new location, say around this point,

524
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,830
want me to finish, it will change because
all the distances are really changed.

525
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,450
The moment of finesse. Yet if
someone says, here are the masses,

526
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,270
here's where they are, please find me.
The moment I finish it, you will say,

527
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:40,140
I cannot do it.

528
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,340
You want to say I cannot do
it till you tell me the point.

529
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,780
Our own which you plan to rotate the body.
Unless that is given.

530
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,270
I cannot tell you what
the moment of inertia is.

531
00:34:51,271 --> 00:34:54,240
That for the moment of
Venetia is with respect to

532
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,893
a point.

533
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,260
There's nothing called the
mass with respect to the point,

534
00:35:01,261 --> 00:35:04,650
the massive just the mass Mormon
definition. It depends on the point.

535
00:35:04,651 --> 00:35:06,480
I don't know which your computing,
the moment of a nation,

536
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,900
it's a video is also worth knowing that
if the body is being rotated about mass

537
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:15,010
m three than empty doesn't
contribute to momentum.

538
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:19,340
Financial aid's out anything sitting on
the axis doesn't contribute things for

539
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,490
the further away, contribute more in
proportion to their mass and proportion.

540
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,320
The square of the distance from the axis.

541
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,550
So this is my dictionary here.

542
00:35:29,551 --> 00:35:31,950
So who is playing the role of mass?

543
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,680
Mass is played very moment of inertia.

544
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:40,260
It's got units of kilogram meters square
and no one has given a name for that.

545
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,870
What example? Newton Times meter
is called a Jew. You can ask.

546
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,590
No, this is kilograms times, meters
square. Maybe it's named after somebody.

547
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,380
So far it's not be named after anybody
or did they just call Newton meters

548
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:55,214
square?

549
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,140
So this is going to be
the analog off mass,

550
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,850
you know world of rotations.

551
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,680
You remember in the world of rotation
we defined something called momentum is

552
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:11,790
mass times velocity.
Here they're going to set up a call,

553
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:14,990
something called angular.
Momentum is going to be I times omega.

554
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,540
This I is called the angular momentum.

555
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,410
One extremely important point that
you guys should notice is that all the

556
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:36,830
concepts I'm using like mass and energy,

557
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,580
they are the same old concepts
that we learned earlier on.

558
00:36:40,581 --> 00:36:44,420
The fact that it's rotating body
doesn't change anything. Okay?

559
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,160
Kennedy again are they
still means the same.

560
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:50,630
This k though it looks so different is
in fact the one happened B squared of

561
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
every part of the body. Some
dough with the bodies. All right,

562
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:58,280
so this l is called angular. Momentum
will take a while to get used to this,

563
00:36:58,281 --> 00:37:02,270
but right now it's the product of the
moment of inertia. Angular velocity,

564
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:08,450
so now we are looking for the most
important equation in mechanics,

565
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,580
which is f equals m a

566
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,910
that's going to be equal
to some mystery object.

567
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,020
Now you should be able to guess what
goes on the right hand side. Okay?

568
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:22,850
You should know by now by analogy.

569
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:29,020
It can be written as d l d t v like
rate of change of momentum or it can be

570
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,220
written as i-times alpha.
It doesn't matter.

571
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,280
I hope you understand that
if a take rate of change,

572
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:38,120
the momentum you want to get mad because
when you take the bit of it to Amazon

573
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,120
are changing.
Likewise here,

574
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:46,450
if you take the l d t I is not changing
Omegas changing to give you what do you

575
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:47,960
make a DDS?
Alf,

576
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,010
I is not changing because as the body
rotates of coarse particles in the body

577
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:52,844
and moving around,

578
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,240
but that at a distance from the
point of rotation is not changing.

579
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:00,230
Even though the bodies and
moving to new locations,

580
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,080
the odd squared is the same
because they're just rotating.

581
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,580
That's why the in the
time that it would do,

582
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,910
you don't have to take the time that
it would do at the moment of inertia,

583
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,310
but we don't know who's going to
play the role on the left hand side.

584
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,740
Okay, so we had to go to find that are
going to find out the analog of that.

585
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,110
So I'm going to tell you there
are many ways to find this out.

586
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,890
It's a lot more subtle than generally
appreciate it on what the correct lies.

587
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,630
You can hit the last stated quite often,

588
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,850
but some of the reasonings behind it are.

589
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,570
So let me tell you one
way to get to the law.

590
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,730
I hope you know what I'm looking at.

591
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,020
I'm trying to find out what is the entity
that is responsible for the rate of

592
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:52,021
change of angular momentum or what's
the analog of the lefthand side for m a,

593
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,490
I know the right hand side is I am for
by analogy who is on the left hand side.

594
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:58,781
First of all,

595
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:01,990
it's pretty clear that if you want the
angular momentum of the body to change,

596
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,100
Omega has to change.

597
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,120
You can see if something is
spinning around at some fixed Omega,

598
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,940
you want to change it, you've got
to push up Buhler, do something.

599
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,620
So obviously going to play a force,

600
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,860
but the thing that comes to the left
hand side is not simply the force but

601
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:18,910
something else and we'll find out what
the something is and that's done by the

602
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:20,050
following device.

603
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,750
I'm going to use the good old work energy
theorem that says when force acts on

604
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:28,210
the body,
the work that it does,

605
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,073
okay,

606
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:35,490
which is the force times the distance
it travels is equal to the change in the

607
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:38,344
kinetic energy.

608
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,060
That is the standard work
in a DTM that we establish.

609
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,400
So if you took a rigid body like this
and let's apply it to the rigid body,

610
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,790
I'm just going to take a simple case
of rigid body with this two masses,

611
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,830
m two and m one it doesn't matter.

612
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,250
I apply a force now f perpendicular to
the body at the distance r from the point

613
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:09,754
of rotation

614
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:18,490
and let it turn the body during that time.
Uh,

615
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:23,130
let's say the body moves
when I'm on Delta data,

616
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,490
maybe I should draw you a better
picture for this because this is very,

617
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,324
very important.

618
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,850
So he had us the body,

619
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:37,470
I just took a simplest one with
two masses and one and two.

620
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,430
I'm just going to push it here and I
decided to push it in this direction and

621
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,750
it's half the distance r
from the point of rotation

622
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,370
and let it turn by a small
angle and come to this position.

623
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,270
This angle is delta data.

624
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,330
What does the work done by this force?

625
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,723
Okay,

626
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,280
I am going to write it down, but I want
you to think about it work that way.

627
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:12,460
The force is the force multiplier for
the distance over which it has moved.

628
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:17,320
And basically I'm asking you what does
that distance it has moved and if you

629
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:19,420
remember anything at all
from what I did earlier,

630
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,640
it's approximately this arc length, which
we have seen is our times delta theta.

631
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,983
In

632
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,480
other words, if you applied for SAF
and you rotate the body bay data,

633
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,800
the distance you actually
move is our Delta Theta.

634
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,570
So this is force times distance.

635
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,840
No, that's got to be equal.
The change in Kennedy Energy,

636
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,160
it's gotta be equal attendant.
Kinetic energy, kinetic energy.

637
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:57,161
I remind you is one half I will make a
square that for the change in Kennedy

638
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,850
Energy is going to be one half I femmes
Omega squared minus the initial Omega

639
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,490
Square.
By the way,

640
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,430
these are two very
enabling instance in time.

641
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,140
If the neighboring instance in time,
during that brief period,

642
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,600
we may take the body to
have a constant acceleration

643
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:25,640
that for Alpha is constant.
So this are this formula.

644
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,410
You can also calculate when alphas
constant period in a real body,

645
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:32,510
when there's rotating
alphanine not be constant,

646
00:42:32,511 --> 00:42:36,020
but for the small enough interval,
as small as you wish,

647
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,880
we may have played the formula that works
when Alpha is a constant. In that case,

648
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,240
you would write it as one half times
to Alpha Times rotation angles,

649
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,760
right? Look at this formula here.
I'm referring to this rezone.

650
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,100
We'll make a final square minus Omega
initiative squared is two times Alpha

651
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,150
Times the change in angle.

652
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,270
So I want you to then
equate this work done,

653
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:09,590
this change in Kennedy Energy. I want
you to equate this guy, this guy,

654
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:14,620
and we get our great results that
f times R is equal to I find Alpha

655
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,530
I alpha is m a that's what I'm
looking for. So this Fella here,

656
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,490
Fr is the analog of force
and it's called the torque.

657
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,420
It's very important to notice that the
torque due to this force is the value of

658
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:43,850
the force times the distance
from the point of rotation

659
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,500
and it's only the external
force that I'm talking about.

660
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,290
They're also internal forces in Iraq.

661
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,100
Every part of the art is being dragged
along the way. Another part of the Rod.

662
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,150
But uh, that analysis in
terms of forces can be done,

663
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:00,800
but it's very tricky and complicated.

664
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,320
It's much easier to look at the energy
where the energy changes only due to

665
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:09,350
external forces. If you only look
at forces, you've got to be careful.

666
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,080
This pivot point is also
playing a force on the right,

667
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,960
but it's not moving
and not doing any work.

668
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:19,310
So the only external force is the one
I'm applying and Andrew's responsible for

669
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:23,060
the change of the Kennedy energy that
our other forces inside the rock.

670
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,610
In other words,
this mass is going to pick up speed.

671
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:27,800
Not because I'm directly pushing it.

672
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:31,070
I'm probably pushing this part of the rod
and that's putting the part next to it

673
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,840
and the propagates and the
finally pushes this one.

674
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,800
So I'm not directly applying
the force lot of this mass.

675
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:40,890
I'm saying whatever has happening
internally, I don't care.

676
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,000
The external force times distance is a
chain of the kinetic energy of an object.

677
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,893
Yes.

678
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,473
Good.

679
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,700
No,
I said this quantity,

680
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,820
the chains and Kennedy.

681
00:45:01,821 --> 00:45:05,690
Kennedy is the final candidate going
to do one half Iomega square minus the

682
00:45:05,691 --> 00:45:09,810
initial candidate energy
with final initial refer to
when the rod was there and

683
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:11,810
the and the Rod.
I rotated by a small amount.

684
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,460
Right? Okay. All right.

685
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:22,420
[inaudible]

686
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:25,840
here. No, I use this equation, the chain,

687
00:45:25,841 --> 00:45:30,760
the Omega squared at the end minus the
Omega squared at the beginning is two

688
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:34,750
times the acceleration in
angular acceleration times data,

689
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:38,020
minor state or not is the change
in data over that time. Right?

690
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,473
In other words,

691
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:46,560
that formula can be used for even
finite PDFs of time provided Alpha is

692
00:45:47,141 --> 00:45:50,590
constant. We're applying it
for a tiny period of time,

693
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,780
small enough for us to believe that the
acceleration during that tiny period is

694
00:45:54,781 --> 00:45:59,530
some number alpha. So this Omega squared
men who make an r squared, is it really?

695
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:04,360
If you want a change in Omega squared
and that's proportional to Alpha Times of

696
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,194
change in angle.

697
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,550
So Alpha is not a constant ow fucking
Vaidy from incident to incident.

698
00:46:09,551 --> 00:46:11,900
But at that one instance,
depending on the forces,

699
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:15,580
that will be some Alpha and this
thing called park. Is it times alpha?

700
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:17,621
Now,

701
00:46:17,621 --> 00:46:21,700
I think it's very clear that if I had
several forces acting on the body than the

702
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:22,534
torque will be.

703
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,260
F I R I and that's just one
final caveat to this thing.

704
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:32,200
One final qualification,
which is that in practice,

705
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:37,180
the forces that I used to rotate the
body may not always be perpendicular.

706
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:43,180
You can apply a force in some
other directions like that.

707
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:53,100
Now you got to realize that park is the
ability to change the rotation state of

708
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:57,620
a body and what video is realizing is
that it depends on the force you apply and

709
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,140
depends on how far away the
forces from the point of rotation.

710
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,540
So if you have a door, you're trying
to open a door, here's the door,

711
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:11,910
you enter the hinges and you want to
open this door by applying a force.

712
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:17,400
The question is where do you put the door?
Not Okay.

713
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:22,350
You suddenly invented the door,
you thought about hinges,

714
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,690
but you haven't quite figured
out where to put the door,

715
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,890
not you got to ask yourself,
well, I have complete freedom.

716
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,500
It'll look nice,
but put it there right next to the hinges.

717
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Then you realize that there are parts of
the universe like more on land where if

718
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:41,500
you go all the hinges, all the door
knobs that here and they're saying,

719
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:45,010
you know we are applying a lot of force,
we're not getting anywhere. What's wrong?

720
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,960
Well, what we are realizing
is that various forces,

721
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,850
everything in linear motion forced to
not everything in rotational motion.

722
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,100
You want to get your money's worth.

723
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:59,350
You got to take the door knob as far
as you can and put it near the end.

724
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:04,390
Okay. Then you figured that out. Then
you come along and you say, okay,

725
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:06,670
I put the door knobs at the
right place to open the door.

726
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:11,920
Then you are playing enormous force
this way and again frustrated again,

727
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:13,810
you're getting no results.
He said,

728
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:18,250
I'm going as far as they can from the
hinge and and it dawns on you that if you

729
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:19,660
really want to get something going,

730
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,400
you should really take the line of
separation between where it's rotating and

731
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,130
where you're applying the force
and a force perpendicular to

732
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,560
any part parallel to it. It's not doing
anything unless you try to rip it off.

733
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,410
The hinges, you don't
want to do that. So here,

734
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:41,070
this force has got a useless part and
the guard or useful part and the useful

735
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:42,670
part,
they useless part,

736
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:46,090
which is trying to pull the rod off
the hinges is going to be balanced by a

737
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,880
force from the hinges because they're
artists that really draw is not going to

738
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:49,714
move,

739
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,620
but the one perpendicular to the rod can
in fact turn the rod without affecting

740
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:56,530
the rigidity.
So we need an extra factor here,

741
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:01,090
which is sine theta I but Taita
is defined as the follows.

742
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,010
If you are at a point our eye and
you are play force F that way,

743
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,780
Theta is the angle between the line
joining the point of application of the

744
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:14,080
force and the direction of the force.

745
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,320
You are here and you're separated by
this vector and there's the angle between

746
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:25,300
the separation vector and the force
that angle theta can vary from force to

747
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:28,410
force.
For this force F I angle could be data I,

748
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,350
that's the final formula for the torque.
Okay,

749
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,240
so we have built up all the pieces
and this is the final answer.

750
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,360
This is the definition of Torque and
with this torque we can now complete the

751
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:46,890
dictionary and say what we want in
the left hand side is the torque with

752
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,470
metronic is defined as f. I. R.

753
00:49:50,471 --> 00:49:55,330
I signed data I
f signed data.

754
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:59,670
It's just a component of the force
perpendicular to the separation are.

755
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:01,270
That's what Fci data does.

756
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:04,300
I hope you can see that you've
got a force acting this way,

757
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:08,770
f course sine theta as this part, which
is no good and that scientists that part,

758
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,150
which is good photo rotations.
Also

759
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:16,330
if you want in terms of work done,

760
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,680
you want the force times
the distance traveled.

761
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:22,780
Distance traveled is
only in this direction.

762
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:27,590
There is no distance traveled
in this direction, so the
distance traveled, yes, f.

763
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:27,891
Dot.

764
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:32,600
Product with the bad action in which you
move and that applies only to the force

765
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,900
pat perpendicular to the separation
knocked to the part that is parallel.

766
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:37,971
Anyway,

767
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:42,971
I hope you understand intuitively why
this is the guy that's responsible for

768
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:48,440
rotating objects. Do you want to
rotate something? I don't. Some axes.

769
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,150
You've got a certain amount of force.

770
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,800
You're best off applying the force as far
as you can from the point of rotation.

771
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,440
In other words, suppose we want
to rearrange the stable here,

772
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:01,160
keeping this and fixed but want
to turn it so it's this way.

773
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,110
Then I'm saying I think we all know
we want to start pushing here also.

774
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,420
We don't want that play
force this way or that way.

775
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,220
We want to play force perpendicular.

776
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,140
If for some reason we get tied to a rope
and can only pull in that direction,

777
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,890
then the component of the force,
this ways to be discounted, no use.

778
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:23,030
This is the part that does the training
and that's why that's the part that also

779
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:26,210
does the work.
Any forest perpendicular,

780
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,850
the motion is not going to do any
work is the fourth protection.

781
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,100
Any force [inaudible] nickel, that
displacement is not going to do any work.

782
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,790
This rigid body can only
be later in that position.

783
00:51:37,791 --> 00:51:41,030
So that displacement is in a tangential
direction and only the force in a

784
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:44,630
tangential direction contributes to the
work. And in my work energy argument,

785
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:45,763
that's what comes in.

786
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,800
This is the reason why you come
up with this definition of torque.

787
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,820
Okay, so we've got, uh,
most of the pieces for this,

788
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,160
I will write one more thing by analogy.

789
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,980
The work done by a force that
displaces a body for animal dx is this,

790
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,880
the work done by a torque
will be towel times.

791
00:52:07,881 --> 00:52:12,830
I think you can guess what I want to
put there by Ams d theta or Delta data.

792
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,630
When a torque rotates a body,
but angle Delta Theta,

793
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,980
then the work done is
tout times delta data.

794
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,320
You can see that even here

795
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,170
you can write the word down as
F Times r team, Delta Theta.

796
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:35,380
But that is the torque.
That's the Delta t.

797
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,120
So it's very useful to know. So if you
guys are going to reason by analogy,

798
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,760
I would ask you to know the counterparts

799
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,760
only then you can do the problems.

800
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:51,190
So let's take a,
let's get used to this formula here.

801
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:54,340
Delta W, Star, Delta Theta
show you one example.

802
00:52:55,630 --> 00:53:00,080
Suppose I have a rod hanging
from the ceiling. Well,

803
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:05,450
let's saves massless and there is a mass
Emma at the bottom and it's got some

804
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:08,650
length l.
It's a pendulum.

805
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,230
I'm going to take this pendulum and
I'm going to bring it to this position

806
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,370
by an angle data, not just
the unfortunately paid
or not here at Stanford.

807
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:25,060
The final angle,
I want to know how much work I do.

808
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,990
That's what we're going to calculate,
so be it takes that intermediate position.

809
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,400
When we add here,
what does the force acting on this guy?

810
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:39,060
This rod is massless the forest on this.
This AMG.

811
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,073
Okay.

812
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,420
If that angle is data,
you can see that bangle is the same paper,

813
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:53,970
empty core sine theta acts this way
and MD signed data acts that way.

814
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,880
The whole the pendulum from
falling when the angel is data,

815
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:08,330
I have to apply a tangential force
in this direction of size Mt.

816
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,870
St Theater.
I hope you guys can see that

817
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,400
the empty coal sine data is going to
be provided by the Rod because rod is a

818
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,330
rigid body. It won't let the mass move
in this direction. It'll provide water,

819
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,450
would force it takes to keep the mass
moving radially in the tangential

820
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:27,480
direction to keep it from
sliding back to where it began.

821
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,190
I have to apply force mg sine data,

822
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:35,060
so the torque that apply
is mg sine theta times l,

823
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,020
so I did all that by taking the force,

824
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:46,210
finding the component of
the forest perpendicular to
the thing and balancing it

825
00:54:46,211 --> 00:54:50,290
with the countervailing force. You can
equally say the park that I have to apply,

826
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:54,190
it's really mg,
which is the force odd,

827
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,010
which happens to be l here and
sine of the angle between them.

828
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,410
No matter how you write it,
that's the torque.

829
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,800
Let's find the work done by that torque.

830
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,400
When I rotated from the starting
angle to some final angle,

831
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,420
that'll be m g l signed data,

832
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,470
deep data from zero to
some final angle data, not,

833
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,740
I'm just saying the word done stout
dealt at data summed over all the angles

834
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:21,670
that means integrate.

835
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:27,930
So you've got to go back to your calculus
thing and you got to remember that the

836
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,620
integral of scientists minus goes signed
data and you want to start from theta

837
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:36,130
equals zero that they take to
some final angle to it or not.

838
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:41,430
And if you crank it out you will find
there's AMG l times one minus go sign in

839
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:47,050
theater. So that's the work done to
take a pendulum which is horizontal,

840
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,660
which is vertical and turn
it into an angle. Taylor. Now

841
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,710
I'm going to do a cross check on this to
tell you that it works out from another

842
00:55:58,711 --> 00:56:03,630
point of view. This mass was down
here. No, it's claimed that there.

843
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,940
So you can ask what
happened to the work I did.

844
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,860
Going back to work entity Theorem,
let's take this mass here.

845
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,340
Forces are acting on it.
One was the rod,

846
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,720
but the force of the artist
always perpendicular to the
motion of this Bob here.

847
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,540
So it couldn't do any work.
They only work was done by me.

848
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,080
What happened to the work did work I did
has to be changing the total energy of

849
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:28,534
the body,

850
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:33,160
but the Bob was not moving before and
it's not moving after because I give just

851
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,920
the right force to cancel gravity.
I didn't give it any speed.

852
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:40,510
So it must be that the potential energy
of this Bob and his here should explain

853
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:44,950
the work I did. That's exactly
what it is because let me rewrite.

854
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:49,170
This is AMG
minus MGL.

855
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,560
Let me see a plus

856
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,150
MTL co signed data.

857
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:02,750
Okay,

858
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,990
well maybe we can see that. Uh, it is mg,

859
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:12,960
sorry plus MGL
this one.

860
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,900
Well I think it's best to write it as
l minus Elko scientist and you guys can

861
00:57:18,901 --> 00:57:22,620
see what's going on Ellis.
This distance here. Elko,

862
00:57:22,621 --> 00:57:26,820
sine theta is that distance in l minus
Elko send data is the increase in the

863
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:27,810
height of this Bob.

864
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:33,590
This height here is in fact l minus Elko
scientists because of that is l that is

865
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:39,570
data.
This is Elko signed data to that point.

866
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:45,110
So this is just mg times the height
and that's where your work went.

867
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,780
So what's the point of this exercise?

868
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:52,710
This exercise is to get you used to
the notion of calculating work done,

869
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,340
not as forced time distance,
but a star times angle.

870
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:00,900
And here's the problem where the torque
itself is changing with the angle.

871
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,480
The torque is of cell function of data.

872
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:06,360
So you have to do an integral
and that's how you get work.

873
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:11,630
Okay,

874
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:16,130
so now we've got all
the machinery we need,

875
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:25,290
got all the machinery we need to do
kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies in

876
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:29,620
this analogy. So let me summarize
what it is. Got a rigid body.

877
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,910
He's got a moment of inertia.
It's got an angular velocity.

878
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,750
The product of the two is called the
angular momentum l. And to change it,

879
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,920
you gotta play a Torque.
The find the Torque Pine,

880
00:58:41,921 --> 00:58:46,570
all the external forces acting on the
body multiplay each force by the distance

881
00:58:46,571 --> 00:58:50,650
from the point of rotation
or the component of each
force perpendicular to the

882
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,100
line of separation times
that distance and separation.

883
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:59,170
That's the Fr scientists ETA and added up.
Again,

884
00:58:59,171 --> 00:59:02,290
when you do the torques
you've got to give it a sign.

885
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,350
If at tar trends to rotate
a body counterclockwise,

886
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,930
we will take it as positive and if the
tart tends rotator body clockwise we'll

887
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:11,764
take it as negative.

888
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:16,480
So it's possible that in a given body
that could be torques trying to move it in

889
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:20,830
different directions.
So for example in the simplest rigid body

890
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,140
made up say two masses,

891
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,260
you could be pushing this way
and I could be pushing that way.

892
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:32,430
You're all trying to rotate them in
opposite directions. The park you apply,

893
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:34,280
it would be your fourth time.
That distance,

894
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,970
this is called positive because you're
going counterclockwise torque that I'm

895
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:42,200
applying will be my fourth time to smaller
distance and there'll be considered

896
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:44,600
negative because it's clockwise
and you will add them up.

897
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,040
You'll get a net torque.

898
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:51,650
That net torque will cause an
acceleration of this dumbbell like object.

899
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,200
What acceleration will it cause?

900
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,200
It'll be my force times,
my distance scientist.

901
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:03,170
I have habits we want minus your force
times the distance over which you're

902
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:07,850
doing it times a moment to finish up
the moment of furniture for the simple

903
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:12,851
problem is m one or one square
plus m two r two squared.

904
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:19,150
If this is m one and this is our one and
this is m two and that distance is art

905
01:00:20,831 --> 01:00:21,664
too.

906
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,840
So this is the simplest problem you
could do in rigid body dynamics.

907
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:27,950
Take a couple of forces,

908
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:31,280
workout the torques divided by a
moment of inertia and get the angular

909
01:00:31,281 --> 01:00:35,960
acceleration. If the Torque is a
constant, it's hard to maintain that.

910
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,630
What do I have to do to
keep the torque constant?

911
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:44,120
I got to start running around with this
acid rotates and you could imagine doing

912
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:49,040
that. Then the target will be constantly,
Alpha will be constant alpha constantly.

913
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:52,130
It's like a constant and you can do the
whole bunch of problems you guys did

914
01:00:52,131 --> 01:00:56,810
before. Okay? Now that is one

915
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,480
technical obstacle you've got overcome
if you want to do rigid body dynamics.

916
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:05,450
And that is to know how to compute
the moment of inertia for all kinds of

917
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:08,870
objects.
If I give you 37 masses,

918
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,570
eat with the distance r
from the point of rotation,

919
01:01:11,571 --> 01:01:14,840
it's a trivial thing to Mr
squared for each one and add it.

920
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,240
But here's the kind of
objects you may be given.

921
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:20,840
Not a discreet set of masters
but a continuous blood.

922
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:26,030
Just like in the case of center of mass,
when he had a bunch of masters,

923
01:01:26,031 --> 01:01:29,270
you took em one x one plus m two x
two plus m three x three and so on.

924
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:32,210
But if you had a rod, which is
continuous, you have to do an integral.

925
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,230
So you will have to do an integral here.
All right,

926
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:40,460
so let's take certain rigid bodies and
tried to find that moment of inertia,

927
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,610
which are rigid bodies
which are continuous.

928
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:48,170
So here is a ring of
radius r and mass amp.

929
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:52,040
It's not a disc in spite
of what it looks like,

930
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,070
it is a ring and I want to find her.
It's moment of inertia.

931
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,900
You have to think about what you will do.

932
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:05,090
So you think for a second and I'll
tell you the way I will do that is to

933
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:10,750
partition it into tiny pieces into which
is small enough for me to consider a

934
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:11,954
point.

935
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:17,930
This tiny piece has a Mass Delta
am I and I goes from one, two,

936
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:21,120
three, four to whatever 10
million they go around the circle.

937
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,730
Want me to finish? Yeah. Would be,

938
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,300
I use Delta Mia to tell you it's
a tiny mass for this section,

939
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,300
but what is the r square?

940
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,060
If I plan it to rotate it around that
point plan to rotate around that point,

941
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,590
it is the same artist squared for
everybody so you can pull it out of the

942
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:43,050
summation and he'd just get Mr Square.

943
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:50,650
So this is a bit easy problem.
This as easy as this problem.

944
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:55,060
Then you clearly had only one mass and
all of it was that distance r from the

945
01:02:55,061 --> 01:02:58,090
point of rotation is Mr squared
here you got the mass spread out.

946
01:02:58,540 --> 01:02:59,373
Luckily spit it out,

947
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:02,650
spit it out in such a way that every
part of it is the same distance out from

948
01:03:02,651 --> 01:03:05,350
the center.
So it's very easy to do the summation,

949
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,270
pull out the arch where do the sum
over mass and get the total Max.

950
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,870
Then we are going to do
any question about this.

951
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,960
Everything's going to be built on
understanding this. So for the ring,

952
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:20,140
this is the moment of
inertia with just Mr Square,

953
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:25,840
but now I want to do the following.
I want to take a disc now.

954
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,290
Yeah,

955
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,250
of radius R

956
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:37,420
I got her to the summer but Mr
squares for every mass in the problem.

957
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,270
So he here's where do you have
to organize your thinking?

958
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,660
I'm plan to do the moment of furniture
through the center. First of all,

959
01:03:43,661 --> 01:03:46,930
if he didn't tell you all my to finish
it through where you cannot even start,

960
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:51,070
I tell you I want it through the
center that wanted through the center.

961
01:03:51,071 --> 01:03:56,071
We have the ability then to think of
this as made up of a whole bunch of

962
01:03:56,771 --> 01:03:58,540
concentric rings,

963
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,010
each one at radius r and a thickness.
Dr

964
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,790
If it can find the moment of an
issue of this tiny shaded region.

965
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:10,440
I some over all this certain,

966
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:14,130
all the little washers that
annual assist and you like that.

967
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:15,930
I have to fill up the whole disk.

968
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:22,260
What's the moment of inertia
of this Angeles? Well,

969
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:27,261
I already told you if the analyst has
a mass m Mr squared is the moment of

970
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:29,260
Finnish. Yeah. Of the analysts,

971
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:32,280
but so the question is what does
the mass of the shaded region,

972
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:40,100
clearly the r squared to use is
the audit which it is sitting,

973
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:45,030
but what's the mass I should
use for the mass I should use?

974
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,360
I argue that if the total mass is that
that time is Pi r square is the mass per

975
01:04:52,441 --> 01:04:56,580
unit area than I need the
area of this shaded region.

976
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:02,720
That's the tricky part. If
you've got that. Yes. Right.

977
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,550
So let's ask why it's two Pi r d.
R.

978
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:11,700
If you take this analyst and you take a
pair of scissors and you cut it out and

979
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:16,230
you open it out,
he's going to look like a long rectangle.

980
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:21,030
It's thickness will be the
R is length will be to PR.

981
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:25,950
So two Pi r d r is the,

982
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,633
yeah,

983
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,990
that's as contribution.

984
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:35,980
Here's the Dr and have you got
to add it up over everything?

985
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,620
Adding it up is what we
do by doing the integral.

986
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,670
I don't want to do this integral,
you guys can.

987
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,680
We can at least guess
what's going to happen.

988
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:47,200
There's going to be no pie in the answer.
Why is gone.

989
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,560
We've got our r squared is r cubed r to
the fourth of our four and that will,

990
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:57,250
if you combine it with that you
get this Mr squared over two.

991
01:05:58,970 --> 01:06:01,810
So more matter of finesse you
often discuss Mr squared over two.

992
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:09,420
That's because if I came and told
you woman definitely supports,

993
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:14,250
they made a calculation mistake
somewhere and I said is Mr Square?

994
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,210
We'll you know I'm wrong and why would
he argue that cannot be the right answer.

995
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,350
Yes.
Well it's like the brain but the radius.

996
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:30,290
Smaller group, right? In other words,

997
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,010
this answers correct answer
is if it does Mr Square,

998
01:06:33,011 --> 01:06:35,770
it means the entire mass is
that the designs are square,

999
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:39,230
but we know some of the masters a
lot closer to the center. In fact,

1000
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,630
some of fitness right at the center,

1001
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,280
so you cannot get the same capital r
squared as a contribution from all the

1002
01:06:45,281 --> 01:06:48,460
pieces. Some will be at zero distance.
I will be at the full distance.

1003
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:50,620
So whenever at the moment
of inertia for disk,

1004
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,170
it's gotta look like Mr
Squared Times a number,

1005
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:56,560
which is definitely less than one.
Turns out to be half.

1006
01:06:56,561 --> 01:06:59,920
If you've got a third or a fourth,
you will know it's obviously wrong.

1007
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:03,280
But if I got one in front or where
civic art two times Mr Square,

1008
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,810
then you know I made a mistake.
Okay.

1009
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:10,860
Now the last of the objects I
want to look at today is a rod.

1010
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:12,903
I want to take

1011
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:27,300
this actually the example
that's done quite often,

1012
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:32,140
but that's the first example.
But I will do it now. So here,

1013
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:37,020
this
eight Rod.

1014
01:07:38,550 --> 01:07:40,380
Okay,
that's length l

1015
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:46,020
mass m and I say,
what's the moment of inertia?

1016
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:52,590
You know what you could do?
What's the first question you will ask?

1017
01:07:52,591 --> 01:07:54,360
When I say,
what's the moment of an issue?

1018
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:01,170
I don't work point right till I tell you
that you cannot begin. So I will say,

1019
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:02,610
let's find a moment of inertia.

1020
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,830
I the sense of what you
should imagine in that case,

1021
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:09,120
you stick a nail through here and the
guy who rotates like that on a big circle

1022
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:13,170
with that as the center, if you
start the nail through the mid point,

1023
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:14,940
it's a different story.
The answer's different.

1024
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:20,150
So here what I do is I take a distance ex,

1025
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,840
I take a sliver of thickness dx.

1026
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,650
That's sliver the small enough for me to
consider it as a point mass. Therefore,

1027
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,720
the moment of an issue of that tiny
portion will look like the square of the

1028
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:39,710
distance times the mass of the tiny
portion mass. The tiny portion,

1029
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,930
it looks like this.

1030
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:57,650
Let me see. Ah, that's the mass.
But unit length, that's the length.

1031
01:08:57,651 --> 01:09:02,090
That's the mass of the object. Then I
have to do the integral from zero to l.

1032
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:10,560
Well x squared will give me x cubed over
three that'll give me an l square over

1033
01:09:11,711 --> 01:09:12,544
three.

1034
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:19,570
That's the moment to finish you off the
ride. Again, it looks like ml square.

1035
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,430
It's got to have a number in front of it.

1036
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:24,820
That's less than one because
if you're mentioning from here,

1037
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:29,380
the furthest you can be is l a
lot of the guys had a lot closer,

1038
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:32,830
so the weighted average of the square of
the distance cannot be all in squared.

1039
01:09:32,831 --> 01:09:34,420
It's gotta be something
less than elsewhere.

1040
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:38,230
The fact that it's one third is of
course what you do all the work for.

1041
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,633
Pardon me?

1042
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:48,450
You forgot the l here.
Also,

1043
01:09:48,451 --> 01:09:52,320
the dimension for moment of inertia
should be in the end mass times length

1044
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:53,154
square.

1045
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,040
You're not happy with that.
You agree? Okay, look,

1046
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:04,670
sometimes I do get these things wrong,

1047
01:10:04,671 --> 01:10:07,040
so you should always try
to keep an eye on this.

1048
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,820
The last thing I want
to do is to find the,

1049
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,593
okay,

1050
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,990
but when I say last thing I want to do,
I don't mean I'm reluctant to do it.

1051
01:10:17,991 --> 01:10:20,240
I'm just saying I'm
near the end of the day.

1052
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:25,220
The final thing that I will now calculate
is the moment of inertia around the

1053
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,700
center.
Let's see what's going to happen.

1054
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:34,090
It's the same integral x
where the x over l m over l,

1055
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:41,230
but the range of integration for x will
love go from minus l over to the plus l

1056
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:43,374
or two.

1057
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:56,260
Then I simplify my life by writing it
as two m over l times x squared DX from

1058
01:10:58,311 --> 01:11:02,390
zero to l over to, this is something
I encourage you to do all the time.

1059
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:05,450
If an integral isn't
even function at Beck's,

1060
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:08,270
namely negative x contributes
as much as positive x,

1061
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,230
then you can take half the reason of
integration and double the answer.

1062
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,650
You can do it only if it's an
even function. So excellent. Yes.

1063
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:26,070
Oh, I'm sorry. You're absolutely right.
The way to do that would be here.

1064
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:31,320
So you keep trying. You will catch
me. That's right. That's correct.

1065
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:35,850
Okay,
so let's do this now to m over l.

1066
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:40,710
Okay. Uh, now I'm really
anxious because this l l cube,

1067
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,360
it's the x cubed over three.

1068
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,960
But the thing that's
been cubed as l over too

1069
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:50,400
and that's giving me ml square over 12

1070
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,200
so the moment of inertia is not a
fixed number. It got a lot smaller.

1071
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:04,200
When I took it around the center of mass,
when I took it around the left edge,

1072
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:06,490
I got ml squared over three
I went to the midpoint,

1073
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,560
I got ml square or well I think it's
pretty clear that in going from here I

1074
01:12:10,561 --> 01:12:13,350
reduced the answer. You might
say, why not keep going?

1075
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:15,360
Maybe we'll get even smaller.

1076
01:12:15,361 --> 01:12:19,470
That's where your common sense should
tell you that if you got some answer from

1077
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:20,190
there,

1078
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:23,790
you're going to get the same answers
from here and you hit the best possible

1079
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:25,020
moment of inertia.
You can.

1080
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,010
You should be able to do argue
intuitively and if you do the calculation,

1081
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:32,820
it will come out to be the same.
Now the thing to check,

1082
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,320
if you do this,

1083
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,700
the moment of financial are on one end
is the moment of inertia around the

1084
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:42,990
center,
less the mass times l over to square.

1085
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,930
This is something you can actually verify.

1086
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,440
Just take the numbers I gave you and you
will find that this answer plus m times

1087
01:12:52,981 --> 01:12:57,981
l over to square will be equal to that
answer and this happens to be very

1088
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:02,800
general theater and I'll talk about next
time if you know the moment I finish

1089
01:13:02,801 --> 01:13:06,000
here through the center of mass,
you're done.

1090
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:09,030
Because if I want the moment of
inertia through any other point,

1091
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,860
I take the moment of inertia through the
center of mass and add to it the total

1092
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:17,610
mass of the object and the square of the
distance by which you made me move my

1093
01:13:17,611 --> 01:13:20,350
access,
which here happens to be l over too.

1094
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:25,050
I haven't of course proved this. I don't
want to give you anything without proof.

1095
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:29,520
We can actually in our class actually
satisfy ourself to this is true.

1096
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:33,270
Not only is it true for a rod,
it's even true for a disc.

1097
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,690
It's true for any object in two dimensions
that if you've got the moment of

1098
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:41,490
inertia of this creature through the
center of mass and you wanted through that

1099
01:13:41,491 --> 01:13:46,200
point, just take the answer to center
of mass and add to it AMD square.

1100
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:48,900
Where is that?
This that'll be proven next time.
