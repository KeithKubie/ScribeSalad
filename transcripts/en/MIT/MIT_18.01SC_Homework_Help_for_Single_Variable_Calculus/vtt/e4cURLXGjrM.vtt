00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:07.360
Hi.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.030
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.945
In lecture, you've been learning
about computing-- rather,

00:00:11.945 --> 00:00:15.600
not computing, but
determining whether series

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.470
converge or diverge, and
different tests for that.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.470
In particular, you've
learned the integral test.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.270
So here are a couple of series
that you haven't seen before.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.550
The sum from n equals
2 to infinity-- 2,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.530
just so I don't have
any funny business here

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.320
of dividing by 0-- of 1
over n times log of n.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.670
And a second series,
sum from n equals 2

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.970
to infinity of 1 over n times
log of n quantity squared.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.360
So the question is, do these
series converge or diverge?

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.570
So why you pause the
video, take some time

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.329
to work on this
question, come back,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.620
and we can work on it together.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.550
Welcome back.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.197
Before you left, I
gave you a little hint

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:01.780
that these might be
questions that are

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.430
amenable to the integral test.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.452
One thing we can do--
you know, if you,

00:01:06.452 --> 00:01:09.830
if I hadn't given you that hint,
how could you figure this out?

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.910
Well, you can look
at these integrands.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.190
And they don't really
look a lot like anything

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.800
you've seen before.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.260
But the associated
functions, right--

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:28.240
so this is the associated
function, 1 over x log x.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.740
This continuous
function is a function

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.220
that we have-- you know, it
looks sort of like some things

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.920
that we've integrated before.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.814
So that's one hint
for the integral test.

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:39.230
Another hint for
the integral test

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.280
is, you just don't know
very many tests right now.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.780
So it's kind of a small
selection of options.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.850
Another thing is
that, you know, it's

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.520
not going to be a nice series.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.700
It's not going to have
a nice numerical value.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.890
This log n thing
is behaving badly.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.060
You're not going to be able to
compute values, exact values,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.120
of the partial sums, any
nicer than they looked just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.200
by writing down that sum.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.700
So OK.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.559
So after we've got the
idea of the integrals--

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.600
that's how we get the idea
for the integral test.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.840
Now that we've got the
idea for the integral test,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.550
what do we do?

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.140
Well, we know that this
series converges if and only

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.280
if the associated
definite integral,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.120
the associated improper
definite integral converges.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.820
So let's do the first one first.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.960
What's the integral
associated with it?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.100
Well, we take the
integrand, and, you know,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.730
we-- frequently, we replace the
variable n with the variable x,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.230
although that doesn't
really matter.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.370
And so what we do, is we look at
the integral of this integrand

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.330
over the same region.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.850
So in this case,
from 2 to infinity.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.710
And so what we know is
that this sum converges if

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.160
and only if this integral does.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.350
So then, the reason this
is a nice thing to do,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.040
is that often
there are integrals

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.830
that are easy to compute,
while the associated series

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.850
are hard to compute.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.700
So in this case,
this is an integral

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.370
that we have tools to
know, to compute with.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.980
And in particular,
the tool that we have,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.310
is that there's a simple
little substitution that

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.460
will work on this series.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.870
So that's the substitution,
u equals log x.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.430
So we make the substitution
u equals ln of x.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.180
Then du is equal to
1 over x times dx.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.950
So this is the integral of--
so 1 over x dx, that's du.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.787
And so it's 1 over u du.

00:03:38.787 --> 00:03:40.370
This is a definite
integral, so I also

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.760
need to change my bounds.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.029
So when x is 2, u is ln of
2, although the lower bound

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.570
doesn't really matter very much
when we do the integral test,

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.980
because you know, if you
change it a little bit, that's

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.680
not going to change
the, you know--

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.810
as long as you don't
move it across a place

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.870
where the function explodes,
all the interesting stuff

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.480
is whether the function is
big as it goes to infinity.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.290
So if you move a little
round at the bottom,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.420
you'll change its
numerical value,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.760
but you won't change whether
it converges or diverges.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.590
But in any case, ln of 2.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.530
And then when x
goes to infinity,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.663
ln of x goes to infinity,
so the upper bound is also u

00:04:18.663 --> 00:04:19.329
equals infinity.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.180
And now this is
an easy integral.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.820
This is just ln of
u between-- well,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.100
ln 2, which again, really
doesn't matter, and infinity.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.970
And we see that at
the upper bound,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.560
we get ln of infinity,
which is infinity.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.750
So this thing is infinity.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.930
So our original series diverges.

00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:46.770
OK.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.850
So we've applied the
integral test here,

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.810
and we've found that
our series diverges.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.770
What about this second one?

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.800
Well, here, we can again
apply the integral test,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.110
the similar-looking integrand.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.350
And in fact, so we
get-- so the integral

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.470
that we want to look at
is the integral from 2

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.120
to infinity of 1 over x
times log of x squared dx.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.680
And the same substitution
is going to work here.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.250
So we're going to use the
substitution u equals ln x,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.810
du equals 1 over x times dx.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.790
And the bounds are going to
be the same. ln 2 to infinity.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.290
OK.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.289
But what happens when we
make this substitution?

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.280
Well, the 1 over x
dx is still the du.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.190
But then here, this time, we
have 1 over u squared, right?

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.220
Because we've got an ln of
x squared, and u is ln x.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.940
So OK.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.560
So we get 1 over u squared.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.700
So again, this is
easy to integrate.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.580
So this is 1 over u squared,
so that's going to be minus 1

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:57.150
over u when we integrate it
between ln 2 and infinity.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.650
OK.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.560
So we take the two values here,
as u goes to infinity, minus 1

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.470
over u goes to 0.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.390
So this is 0 minus, and now with
the lower bound, it's minus 1

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:14.420
over ln 2, and
this is just ln 2.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.870
So this integral converges to
a nice finite value, ln of 2,

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.720
so that means the sum
converges as well.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.220
All right?

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.180
And in fact, if you go back
and look at the lecture video,

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.990
you'll see that you
can actually bound

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.160
the value of the sum in
terms of this value, ln of 2,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.530
the value of the integral, and
the first terms of the sum.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.452
I realized that I should
have said one thing

00:06:36.452 --> 00:06:38.160
at the beginning,
which is that we didn't

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.070
check that the hypotheses of the
integral test are valid here.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.080
So remember that the
integral test only

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.870
applies if this
function that you use

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.550
is a decreasing
positive function

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.070
on the interval in question.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.174
And I didn't actually
check those conditions.

00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:55.840
They're easy to see
in this case, right?

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.480
Because for n bigger than 2,
n is positive and increasing,

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.060
and log n is positive and
increasing, so the product is

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.370
positive and increasing, so
the 1 over it is positive

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.310
and decreasing.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.390
So it's easy to
check, in this case,

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.180
that the conditions of
the integral test apply.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.717
In the-- when you're doing
this out in the real world,

00:07:15.717 --> 00:07:17.550
if you ever want to
apply the integral test,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.320
that's something you should
check yourself before you

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.362
go and apply it to anything.

00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:24.070
Make sure that you
really have a function

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.820
to which it does apply.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.040
But then, once you have
a function to which it

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.780
does apply, especially if
it's a nice, easy-to-integrate

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.060
function like this, you
can easily apply it.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.060
And in this case, we
applied it both directions.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.555
We saw an integral where
the integral diverges,

00:07:37.555 --> 00:07:39.430
and an integral where
the integral converges.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.860
And so the corresponding sums,
the first one will diverge

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.440
and the second
one will converge.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.834
I'll end there.
