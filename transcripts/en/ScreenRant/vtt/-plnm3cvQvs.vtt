00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.380
We all know that mistakes happen.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.720
But when hundreds of millions of dollars are
on the line, you would think that people would

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.840
pay even closer attention to detail.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.980
In the world of movie-making, the opposite
is true.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.500
The bigger the movie… the bigger the mistakes.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.520
They’re not all bad, and plenty of them
can be downright hilarious.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.730
Either way, fans won’t want to miss a single
one of them.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.380
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Biggest Editing
Mistakes in Movies.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.380
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.710
With the amount of practical effects and stunt
work in George Miller’s insane story of

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.390
car carnage, a few visible safety harnesses
or wires wouldn’t be surprising.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.040
After all, the actors can’t really take
the risks of their characters.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.120
But one major mistake has nothing to do with
the ambitious action of the movie.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.219
When Immortan Joe and his War Boys are blocked
in a desert canyon, an aerial shot shows his

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.650
entire war party stuck in one spot.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.900
But pay close attention to the side of the
screen, and you’ll catch the entire crew

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.750
taking in the sights, clearly assuming the
pounding war drums will keep the audience

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.750
distracted.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.070
The Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.869
In the second team-up of Marvel’s biggest
heroes, a pair of superpowered siblings give

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.760
the heroes a run for their money.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.090
But when Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch join
the good side before the movie’s final battle,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.700
they put their talents to good use, helping
evacuate an entire city.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.440
The speedster tries to alert the police, but
finds out that gunfire is all that will get

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.740
their attention.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.250
Bursting in and out got a laugh from audiences,
but his speed isn’t a special effect.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.610
The actors did their best to hold still, but
their jerking movements show the footage was

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.260
simply sped up and slowed down.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.610
Once you spot it, you might wonder how you
ever missed it.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030
Jurassic World

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.610
In the world of film, nothing says “death”
like watching a heart rate monitor flatline.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.680
In Jurassic World, a team of dinosaur containment
soldiers prove that point when tackling the

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.100
movie’s biggest, deadliest creature, and
dropping one after the other.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.920
But the effects team clearly assumed people
wouldn’t be looking too closely at the hearts

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.229
still beating – not only do the heart rates
stay steady as the squad is being slaughtered,

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.560
but the EKG patterns themselves are flawed.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.950
They made sure to keep every heart from beating
at the same time, but in a dozen soldiers,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.490
even TWO having identical patterns is impossible,
let alone every one of them.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.830
The movie isn’t the first to cheat with
an EKG, and it definitely won’t be the last.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.090
Marvel’s team of space outlaws are some
truly colorful characters.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.120
None is stranger than Drax, the green-skinned,
tattooed alien who audiences are told can’t

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.670
understand metaphors.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.090
The idea of Drax being completely literal
is played for a few jokes, but the character

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.840
explicitly drops the idea for one line.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.190
Before the attack on Ronan’s forces, Drax
lets a fellow warrior know what he thinks

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.320
of their fighting abilities.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.209
That’s not just a metaphor, but a particularly
vivid one, at that.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.599
American Sniper

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.900
Nobody would have guessed that Clint Eastwood’s
story of a real American soldier would bring

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.540
in over a half a billion dollars at the global
box office.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.150
If they did, then the filmmakers may have
spent a bit more money bringing the main character’s

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.150
child to life.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.580
When two real-life babies were unable to shoot
their scene, the crew apparently decided a

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.340
doll was good enough.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.370
Some CG was used to animate the baby’s hand,
but once star Bradley Cooper took it in his

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.470
arms, the act completely dropped.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.349
Instead of changing the scene or cutting around
it, one of the fakest babies to every appear

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.560
in a blockbuster movie took center stage.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560
Frozen

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.239
If there’s one thing you can say about Disney
and Pixar, it’s that they’ve truly risen

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.720
to their very own level of animated moviemaking.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.730
It’s that fact that makes any mistake that
slips into a modern Disney movie even more

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.090
shocking – and Frozen was no exception.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.739
When the movie’s villain has been dealt
with, and every cast member is getting their

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.080
happy ending, Anna and Kristoff share their
first kiss, as he literally sweeps her off

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.080
her feet.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.120
With the story wrapping up, the animators
either missed the fact that Kristoff’s thumb

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.420
glitches into Anna’s body, or decided it
was too small to ever be noticed.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.330
They may be right, but it’s moments like
these that remind movie fans that even the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.520
experts aren’t always perfect.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.120
Steve Rogers took it hard when he learned
that his former best friend had been turned

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.239
into the brainwashed assassin known as The
Winter Soldier.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.849
But Cap should probably have been tipped off
when the story of Bucky’s disappearance

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.730
– and even his life – didn’t quite add
up.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.689
According to the museum display for the fallen
soldier, Bucky was “born in 1916” – but

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.600
the same plaque also claims he was born in
1917 at the bottom, and died in 1944, when

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.270
he fell to his presumed death in The First
Avenger.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.870
So, he died in 1944 then.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.139
Except that was on the same day that Arnim
Zola was captured, which, according to the

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.180
Dr.’s artifical likeness, was another year
later.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:43.020
It’s hard to even guess where the mistakes
actually started.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.380
Furious 7

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.380
It took seven movies for the Fast &amp; Furious
series to answer the question: who is man

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.470
enough to bring down Jason Statham?

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.100
Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson pulled it off,
with the villain being put away in a solitary

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.880
cell for years to come.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.020
The good news, though, is he won’t be alone.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.470
When the supercop Hobbs finally locks him
up, audiences are supposed to be looking at

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.470
the hero’s grin.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.750
They’re not supposed to notice the cameraman
standing in front of Statham, clearly visible

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.100
in the window’s reflection, blocking the
actor’s orange jumpsuit.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.100
Then reflected again, outside of the cell.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.910
Maybe that’s why Statham seemed so angry?

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.570
Transformers: Age of Extinction

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.850
Audiences may never be able to guess just
how much of what they see on screen was actually

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.650
filmed, and how much was added later using
computers.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.000
Luckily, director Michael Bay doesn’t always
make it hard to tell.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.460
In the fourth Transformers movie, an elite
team of Autobot-hunters works alongside the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.930
villain to kill any and all Transformers.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.070
Viewers might wonder why some of the video
screens being monitored by the team leader

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.080
are just green squares.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.170
It’s a trick used to capture the screens
on set, with video feeds or monitors to be

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.170
added in later.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:51.110
Apparently, the effects team decided they
only had a few ideas for interesting footage,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.520
and left the rest of the screens blank.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.370
The giant robots might have taken up most
of their time.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.240
X-Men: Days of Future Past

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:03.639
In a movie packed with fan-favorite X-Men,
it wasn’t easy for Quicksilver to stand

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:04.639
out.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.640
But using his super speed to take down a room
full of Pentagon security won over skeptics,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.889
after he’d already shown he was the only
mutant capable of breaking Magneto out of

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:12.889
prison.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.570
Unfortunately, those paying close attention
spotted some strange mistakes.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.900
When Quicksilver actually runs Magneto out
of containment, he moves so fast, the guards

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.650
storming the cell are sent flying.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.229
But once the pair make it to the elevator,
the guards are missing from the hallway behind.

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.030
And even harder to miss is the black and white
striped paint job that’s replaced the clean

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.060
white walls he entered through.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.690
A change in location is obviously to blame,
but there had to have been a subtler solution.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.910
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.300
