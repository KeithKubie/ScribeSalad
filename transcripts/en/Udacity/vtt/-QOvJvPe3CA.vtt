00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.780
So we know we can identify a ratio
by seeing if it's comparing

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.610
two quantities that have the same units,
comparing dentist to dentists or

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.570
graduates to graduates, but
which quantity comes first?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.940
To answer this question,
I like to think to myself,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.495
how could I phrase this
as a out of b something.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:19.330
And let me explain what I mean,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.050
when we had the statement, three out
of five dentists recommend Toothtaste,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.190
the tasty toothpaste, our ratio was
three out of five, three over five.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.924
In this case three dentist was my a and
five dentists was my b.

00:00:31.924 --> 00:00:35.660
Or we could think it as three
was my a and five was my b, but

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.870
when we had the statement out of 500
grads, 200 got jobs in business.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.335
Well, I could not say 500 out of
200 grads got jobs in business,

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.405
that's wrong.

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:49.685
So I could not write 500 out of 200 or
5 out of 2.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.953
However, I could have rephrased this as,

00:00:51.953 --> 00:00:54.790
200 out of 500 grads
got jobs in business.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.101
And now 200 is my a, 500 is my b and

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:04.215
my ratio is 200 out of 500 or
2 out of 5.

00:01:04.215 --> 00:01:08.821
So it looks like once I can
phrase something as a out of b,

00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:12.055
then I can say that
the ratio is a over b.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:13.540
Let's do a little bit of practice.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.800
So for the following ratios, select
which quantity goes in the numerator.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.780
Three out of four students are girls.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.190
For every 17 cars on the road,
2 are unregistered.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.740
And for every 90 babies,
32 will live to be 100.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.010
For each of these three statements,
select the appropriate button for

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.440
the quantity that belongs
in the numerator.
