00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.470
We're asked to solve 2x
squared plus 5 is equal to 6x.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.260
And so we have a
quadratic equation here.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.716
But just to put it into a form
that we're more familiar with,

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:12.340
let's try to put it
into standard form.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.173
And standard form, of
course, is the form ax

00:00:14.173 --> 00:00:19.400
squared plus bx plus
c is equal to 0.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.000
And to do that, we essentially
have to take the 6x

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.829
and get rid of it from
the right hand side.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.620
So we just have a 0 on
the right hand side.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.010
And to do that, let's
just subtract 6x

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.380
from both sides
of this equation.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.850
And so our left
hand side becomes

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.540
2x squared minus 6x plus
5 is equal to-- and then

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.090
on our right hand side, these
two characters cancel out,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.150
and we just are left with 0.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.710
And there's many
ways to solve this.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.930
We could try to factor it.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.304
And if I was trying
to factor it,

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:49.720
I would divide both sides by 2.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.201
If I divide both sides by 2, I
would get integer coefficients

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:54.742
on the x squared in
the x term, but I

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.330
would get 5/2 for the constant.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.540
So it's not one of these
easy things to factor.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.720
We could complete
the square, or we

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.970
could apply the quadratic
formula, which is really

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.960
just a formula derived
from completing the square.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.990
So let's do that
in this scenario.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.480
And the quadratic
formula tells us

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.190
that if we have something
in standard form like this,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.950
that the roots of it are
going to be negative b

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.030
plus or minus-- so that
gives us two roots right

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.800
over there-- plus or minus
square root of b squared

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.910
minus 4ac over 2a.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.140
So let's apply that
to this situation.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.710
Negative b-- this
right here is b.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.760
So negative b is
negative negative 6.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.010
So that's going
to be positive 6,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.900
plus or minus the square
root of b squared.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:47.990
Negative 6 squared is 36, minus
4 times a-- which is 2-- times

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.300
2 times c, which is 5.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.740
Times 5.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.330
All of that over
2 times a. a is 2.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.570
So 2 times 2 is 4.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.260
So this is going to be
equal to 6 plus or minus

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.050
the square root of 36-- so
let me just figure this out.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.580
36 minus-- so this
is 4 times 2 times 5.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.270
This is 40 over here.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.950
So 36 minus 40.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.390
And you already
might be wondering

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.910
what's going to happen here.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.390
All of that over 4.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.750
Or this is equal
to 6 plus or minus

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.930
the square root of negative 4.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.140
36 minus 40 is
negative 4 over 4.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.540
And you might say,
hey, wait Sal.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.140
Negative 4, if I
take a square root,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.020
I'm going to get an
imaginary number.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.330
And you would be right.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.670
The only two roots of this
quadratic equation right

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.830
here are going to turn
out to be complex,

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.456
because when we
evaluate this, we're

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:42.830
going to get an
imaginary number.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.246
So we're essentially going to
get two complex numbers when

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:48.620
we take the positive and
negative version of this root.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.880
So let's do that.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.110
So the square root
of negative 4,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.055
that is the same thing as 2i.

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:57.220
And we know that's
the same thing as 2i,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.110
or if you want to
think of it this way.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.290
Square root of negative
4 is the same thing

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.220
as the square root of negative
1 times the square root of 4,

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.970
which is the same.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.430
I could even do it
one step-- that's

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.360
the same thing as
negative 1 times 4

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.901
under the radical, which is the
same thing as the square root

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.430
of negative 1 times
the square root of 4.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.250
And the principal square
root of negative 1

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.470
is i times the principal
square root of 4 is 2.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.370
So this is 2i, or i times 2.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.485
So this right over
here is going to be 2i.

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:35.390
So we are left with x is equal
to 6 plus or minus 2i over 4.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.300
And if we were to
simplify it, we

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.290
could divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.310
And so that would be the
same thing as 3 plus or minus

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.310
i over 2.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.500
Or if you want to write them as
two distinct complex numbers,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.530
you could write this as 3 plus
i over 2, or 3/2 plus 1/2i.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.610
That's if I take the positive
version of the i there.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.480
Or we could view this
as 3/2 minus 1/2i.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.590
This and these two guys
right here are equivalent.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.360
Those are the two roots.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.899
Now what I want to do is
a verify that these work.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.519
Verify these two roots.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.640
So this one I can rewrite
as 3 plus i over 2.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.490
These are equivalent.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.320
All I did-- you can
see that this is just

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.270
dividing both of these by 2.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.294
Or if you were to essentially
factor out the 1/2,

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:34.085
you could go either
way on this expression.

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:38.982
And this one over here is
going to be 3 minus i over 2.

00:04:38.982 --> 00:04:40.440
Or you could go
directly from this.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.030
This is 3 plus or
minus i over 2.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.670
So 3 plus i over 2.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.260
Or 3 minus i over 2.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.690
This and this or this
and this, or this.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.690
These are all equal
representations

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.870
of both of the roots.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.610
But let's see if they work.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.745
So I'm first going to try this
character right over here.

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:58.870
It's going to get a little
bit hairy, because we're

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.370
going to have to square
it and all the rest.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.730
But let's see if we can do it.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.396
So what we want to
do is we want to take

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:06.010
2 times this quantity squared.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.196
So 2 times 3 plus i
over 2 squared plus 5.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:14.570
And we want to
verify that that's

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.480
the same thing as 6
times this quantity, as 6

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.400
times 3 plus i over 2.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.840
So what is 3 plus i squared?

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.800
So this is 2 times--
let me just square this.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.080
So 3 plus i, that's going
to be 3 squared, which

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.930
is 9, plus 2 times the
product of three and i.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.915
So 3 times i is
3i, times 2 is 6i.

00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:40.727
So plus 6i.

00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:42.310
And if that doesn't
make sense to you,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.351
I encourage you to kind
of multiply it out either

00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:46.910
with the distributive
property or FOIL it out,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.040
and you'll get the middle term.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.751
You'll get 3i twice.

00:05:50.751 --> 00:05:52.000
When you add them, you get 6i.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.520
I And then plus i squared,
and i squared is negative 1.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.565
Minus 1.

00:05:57.565 --> 00:06:02.492
All of that over 4, plus
5, is equal to-- well,

00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.700
if you divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.010
you get a 3 here and
you get a 1 here.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.330
And 3 distributed on 3 plus
i is equal to 9 plus 3i.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.080
And what we have over here,
we can simplify it just

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.550
to save some screen real estate.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.740
9 minus 1 is 8.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.490
So if I get rid of this,
this is just 8 plus 6i.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.670
We can divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.570
right here by 2.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:37.400
So the numerator would become 4
plus 3i, if we divided it by 2,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.800
and the denominator here
is just going to be 2.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.380
This 2 and this 2 are
going to cancel out.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.140
So on the left hand side, we're
left with 4 plus 3i plus 5.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.320
And this needs to be
equal to 9 plus 3i.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.650
Well, you can see we have a 3i
on both sides of this equation.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.880
And we have a 4 plus 5,
which is exactly equal to 9.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.460
So this solution, 3 plus
i, definitely works.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.572
Now let's try 3 minus i.

00:07:06.572 --> 00:07:08.780
So once again, just looking
at the original equation,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.310
2x squared plus
5 is equal to 6x.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.100
Let me write it down over here.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.020
Let me rewrite the
original equation.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.380
We have 2x squared
plus 5 is equal to 6x.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.690
And now we're going to try this
root, verify that it works.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:30.050
So we have 2 times
3 minus i over 2

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.320
squared plus 5 needs to be
equal to 6 times this business.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.306
6 times 3 minus i over 2.

00:07:40.306 --> 00:07:41.430
Once again, a little hairy.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.055
But as long as we do everything,
we put our head down and focus

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:46.280
on it, we should be able
to get the right result.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.940
So 3 minus i squared.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.270
3 minus i times 3
minus i, which is--

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.130
and you could get
practice taking squares

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.030
of two termed expressions,
or complex numbers

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.480
in this case
actually-- it's going

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:03.290
to be 9, that's 3 squared,
and then 3 times negative i

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:04.390
is negative 3i.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.370
And then you're going
to have two of those.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.850
So negative 6i.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.420
So negative i squared
is also negative 1.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.480
That's negative 1 times
negative 1 times i times i.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.120
So that's also negative 1.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.130
Negative i squared is
also equal to negative 1.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.187
Negative i is also
another square root.

00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:26.770
Not the principal
square root, but one

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.410
of the square roots
of negative 1.

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.505
So now we're going
to have a plus 1,

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:34.630
because-- oh, sorry, we're
going to have a minus 1.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:39.350
Because this is negative i
squared, which is negative 1.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.570
And all of that over 4.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.390
All of that over--
that's 2 squared is 4.

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:49.570
Times 2 over here,
plus 5, needs to be

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.799
equal to-- well, before
I even multiply it out,

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:54.090
we could divide the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.230
So 6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.820
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.930
So 3 times 3 is 9.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.120
3 times negative
i is negative 3i.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.090
And if we simplify it a
little bit more, 9 minus 1

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.590
is going to be--
I'll do this in blue.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.210
9 minus 1 is going to be 8.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.780
We have 8 minus 6i.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.320
And then if we divide
8 minus 6i by 2 and 4

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.950
by 2, in the numerator, we're
going to get 4 minus 3i.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:29.770
And in the denominator over
here, we're going to get a 2.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.790
We divided the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.942
Then we have a 2 out here.

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:36.400
And we have a 2 in
the denominator.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.247
Those two characters
will cancel out.

00:09:38.247 --> 00:09:39.830
And so this expression
right over here

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.660
cancels or simplifies
to 4 minus 3i.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.620
Then we have a plus 5 needs
to be equal to 9 minus 3i.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.870
I We have a negative
3i on the left,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.510
a negative 3i on the right.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.416
We have a 4 plus 5.

00:09:54.416 --> 00:09:55.290
We could evaluate it.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.070
This left hand
side is 9 minus 3i,

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.380
which is the exact same
complex number as we have

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.960
on the right hand
side, 9 minus 3i.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.690
So it also checks out.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.900
It is also a root.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.390
So we verified that both
of these complex roots,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.131
satisfy this quadratic equation.
