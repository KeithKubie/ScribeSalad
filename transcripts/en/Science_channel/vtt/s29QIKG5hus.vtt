WHILE GREEK HERO ODYSSEUS
WAS FIGHTING THE TROJAN WARS,

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:11.968
PENELOPE WAS LEFT TO FEND OFF
A BUNCH OF UNWANTED ADMIRERS.

00:00:11.968 --> 00:00:14.767
SHE PROMISED TO MARRY
WHICHEVER MAN

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.567
COULD FIRE AN ARROW
THROUGH 12 AX HEADS,

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.367
CONFIDENT THAT THE SHOT
WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:21.968
BUT ODYSSEUS RETURNED

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:26.934
AND, IN DISGUISE,
TOOK THE SHOT AND NAILED IT.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.868
IF THE MYTHBUSTERS CAN SOMEHOW
REPEAT THAT SUCCESS,

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:33.834
IT WOULD PROVE BEYOND DOUBT

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.734
THAT AN ARROW FLIES
STRAIGHT AND TRUE.

HERE WE HAVE OUR 12 AXES

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:40.400
WITH THE TARGETS OF
3 INCHES IN DIAMETER,

INSPIRED BY ODYSSEUS'
ARCHERY TRICK SHOT,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.968
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE BYRON
TAKE THIS SHOT

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:47.100
AND SEE IF HE CAN GET THROUGH
ALL 12 WITH HIS LONGBOW.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.234
THEY SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
SO GOOD LUCK, BRO.

00:00:50.234 --> 00:00:52.300
Narrator:
IT'S A DAUNTING PROSPECT.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.467
EVEN BYRON HAS HIS DOUBTS.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.434
NOW, I KNOW SHOOTING THROUGH
A 3-INCH RING

00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:58.567
SHOULDN'T BE A VERY HARD SHOT,
AND IT'S NOT.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.734
SHOOTING THROUGH THREE OR FOUR
OF THEM, NOT A HARD SHOT.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:02.234
SHOOTING THROUGH 12 OF THEM?

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:05.400
IT'S A VERY HARD SHOT, DOING IT
WITH A TRADITIONAL BOW.

CALLING THIS A HARD SHOT

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.167
IS A MASSIVE UNDERSTATEMENT,

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.734

FULL OF ARROWS,

-AW!

SMOOTHLY SHOOTS THE ARROWS

SPELLS DISASTER
