00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:07.632
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please.

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:09.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.800
Which.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.280
Before I say any more,
we can flip the switch

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.880
to give you a little teaser of
what this amazing show is all

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.030
about, in case you
haven't seen it before.

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:59.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.040
That gives me goosebumps just
to see that teaser video.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.350
Cavalia was the first show
that was produced and toured

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.220
the world.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.900
Over four million
people have seen it.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.360
The images that
you are just seeing

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.880
are from Odysseo, the
second production,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.790
which, as we'll hear,
is quite different

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.990
from the original production.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.120
So to maybe kick
it off, Normand,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.110
where did this idea
of Cavalia come from?

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.130
How do you take it from
your imagination to reality?

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.640
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah,
well, where it's coming from,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.522
I was one of the co-founders
of Cirque du Soleil.

00:03:40.522 --> 00:03:42.230
And when I moved out
of Cirque du Soleil,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.210
I wanted to do
something different.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.870
And so I created a show--
I'm from Montreal, Canada,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.800
the French part of Canada.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.260
And I created a show that
requires a few horses as extra

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.480
over there in Canada.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.750
And there was an outside
show in the summer and so on.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.760
It was not a horse show.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.110
It was not a show about horses.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.050
It was a show about
French Canadian tales.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.640
And there was a
lot of performers,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.700
120 performers on stage.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.740
And at one point, when the
horses were coming on stage,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.170
not doing a lot, just
riding across the stage,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.620
people were looking at the
horse, not the performers.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.320
So that attracted my attention.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.520
I said, that's very interesting.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.386
So my director at that time--
I did not direct that show.

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:28.260
The director at the time
came to me and said,

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.320
we've got to get
rid of this horse.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.920
He's stealing focus.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.170
Of course, this is where the
first bell rang in my head.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.140
I said, if he's
stealing focus, it's

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.305
because-- in French,
we say "une bete de

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:45.340
scene," "a beast of stage."

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.010
The translation is
not totally good,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.010
but you might get
the principle of it.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.300
So when we say an
actor is stealing focus

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.360
from the other actor, we
call him a bete de scene.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.480
He's a beast on stage.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.480
So I said, we should
get more horses instead

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.190
of getting rid of the horses.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.370
So I started to buy horses,
because in Canada obviously,

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.550
probably because of the weather
we don't have a lot of horses.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.660
And it's getting very
cold during the winter

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.570
so we have to have it inside.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.080
You cannot leave
the horse outside.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.530
So we didn't have any
performing horses.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.890
So I had to buy horses to
add more horses to the show.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.330
And this is where the
idea started to grow up.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.930
And when I got myself the
proud owner of 12 horses,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.340
I said, well, maybe I should
do a little more than just one

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.290
horse one show
during the summer.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.830
And this is where I
started to have the idea,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.180
so maybe we can do something
artistic with the horse.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.310
So how?

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.280
And this is where I
get very excited, is

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.170
how I can, like we
did with Cirque,

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.180
reinvent something or invent
something that doesn't exist.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.760
And this is where
I got very excited.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.790
Of course, my basic was, can
we have animals in the show,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.070
having animals that
could be happy, which

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.870
was a big concern for myself.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.540
And because I
didn't know horses,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.465
obviously, I had
to explore a lot.

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:14.620
It took me a long time.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.370
Took me almost 10
years from the idea

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.430
to the first show of Cavalia.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.450
And I just wanted to
make sure that if I

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.510
bring a horse to a show,
they would be a happy horse.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.710
And that was the entire
challenge of creating Cavalia,

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.060
and that's why Cavalia
became so popular.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.530
Because when you get to
see Cavalia, of course

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:36.520
there is horses.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.630
Of course there
is acrobat music,

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.840
special effects,
lighting, but most likely,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.700
you see happy horses.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.730
And you see a real bond between
the trainer and the horse,

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.930
and the artist and the horse.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.930
And that is the
signature we had.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.400
So after I created Cavalia--
that's a long answer-- after we

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.520
created Cavalia
in 2003, I thought

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.480
I did not push enough the
integration of the performing

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.980
arts into the horse world.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.870
So I just wanted to create
something bigger, and also

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.010
as a touring show.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.540
I created Odysseo in
2011, and this is the one

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.660
that is now here in San Jose.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.320
But you don't need to be a
horse person to enjoy the show,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.600
because there's a lot, a
lot of special effects.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.930
It's a huge production.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.000
It's one of a kind.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.790
And obviously, I don't think,
as a touring show again,

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:39.130
it's comparable to any of
the best permanent shows

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.910
that you can witness
in Las Vegas,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.240
because of the quality
of the production.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.280
I just wanted to push
what could be achieved

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.890
on a tour production-wise.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.660
So the lights are very modern.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.230
The projection, we have
3D image projection.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.650
We have a screen that is about
three times an IMAX theater

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:02.460
screen.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.370
And it supports what I
call the first and only

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.620
6D show in the world.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:15.140
I know I'm at Google here, so
I better be careful what I say.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.290
But why is it 6D?

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.630
I wanted to explain
that, if I may.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.770
Because the stage is very deep,
and we use the stage as layers.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.240
So the first image you
have when you see the show,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.890
you see a forest.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.700
And then the forest disappears,
and then you see a mountain.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.890
It's a real mountain.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.020
Peaks are about 33 feet high.

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:43.169
And behind the mountain, you
have that gigantic screen.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.430
And in between the
screen and the mountain,

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.630
you can see horses appearing.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.850
And you feel like
you're watching

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.210
one of the most beautiful
Hollywood movies,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.780
but you're there, alive.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.560
And the projections
are so great.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.610
They are HD projections,
3D, but very big.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.040
So you feel the deepness
in the production.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.330
So that's why I say it.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:09.950
You have the 3D live
in front, and then you

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:12.310
have the 3D projection
in the back.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.030
So three plus three?

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.050
Here, you are 6D.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.690
Yes, I have the first
6D show in the world!

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: If anyone's
here from virtual reality,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.480
maybe be taking some notes.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.860
So on that subject of
technology, out of that vision,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.650
what is the hardest to actually
stage in a live setting?

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.930
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Well,
when you do a big production,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:46.920
a big show, whatever
type of show,

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.280
you run most likely
a show with a clock.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.270
And then you have a
timecode, and a timecode

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.770
to run the music.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.900
And then you know the
length of the show.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.660
Cavalia, both
Cavalia and Odysseo,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.770
we never know how long
it's going to last,

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.940
because we are with animals.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:08.360
And the animals, pretty much for
half of the show, they're free.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.800
When I say free, it's they have
no bit, no saddle, no ropes.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.210
They just can go wherever,
and the stage is huge.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.240
The stage is about twice
a hockey rink stage.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.180
So it's huge.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.290
So if a horse decides
to go, he goes.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.130
And if he decides not to
come, he doesn't come.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.420
And if he decides not
to leave the stage,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.670
he doesn't leave the stage.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:34.200
So all the cues are
managed manually.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.170
We have a stage manager
that has thousands of cues.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.240
But in addition,
she has to watch.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.830
We also have the live musicians.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.750
They have to watch.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.830
Because if the horse doesn't
do what we wish he will do,

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.670
which happens often, and
that's the moment I prefer,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.990
because they express themselves.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.760
And then have to have a
show that is flexible.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.480
And even with this
show supported

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.440
by a lot of technology--
I was talking

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:07.030
about the images, and the
lights, and everything,

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.510
and the special effects,
whatever you bring there,

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:13.610
need to be called one by
one by humans, because we

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.395
have to follow the horse.

00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:18.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't
think I've ever heard

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.617
of a show that has no end.

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:21.950
NORMAND LATOURELLE: That's true.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.100
After every show, I look.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.090
I'm not there at every show, but
the stage manager makes a stage

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.380
report, and the show
varies from 5 to 10

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.260
to 15 minutes at every show.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.790
There's a lot of improvisation.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.570
And coming back to
what I was saying,

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.130
my goal was to
have happy horses.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:46.230
So first people can say
a horse is an animal.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.420
It shouldn't be on stage.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.867
But what I learned
through my search--

00:11:50.867 --> 00:11:52.700
because I didn't know
anything about horses.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.200
I just repeat that
because it's very true.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.480
I could barely see a difference
between a cow and a horse

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.550
20 years ago, to
tell you the truth.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.120
I'm a guy from the
city, you know?

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.080
I'm not a guy from the country.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.075
Yeah, you go in front of a
field, you look at a horse,

00:12:08.075 --> 00:12:10.200
you look at a cow and say,
oh, they're two animals.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.770
They're very happy.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.570
But when you go closer,
and when you start to look,

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.080
they are domesticated animals.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.830
If it wouldn't be for human
intervention in the horse

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.810
world, they wouldn't
exist anymore,

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.620
because they were
surrounded by predators.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.420
And so the horse, the
breeds we have today,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.720
are man-made, like dogs.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.870
You know, all the dogs,
there's no wolves in our house.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:47.070
The horse is the same thing.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.150
And all the horses, all the
breeds have a speciality.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.980
They have a purpose.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.280
So if you start to
describe, like here we

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.340
have a lot of the
American quarter horse,

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.800
they're made for cutting
and for going to the field

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.070
and bringing the cattle.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.180
Yeah, cattle horses.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.610
And then you have the horse
that does jumpiing competitions.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.780
And that's what
they do-- they jump.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.970
But those horses, they have
a different conformation

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.140
than the quarter horse.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.740
And then we have a lot of what
we call the Spanish horses,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:29.800
or the Iberian horses, which
are made by the Spanish

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.120
or the Lipizzaner is
the same from Russia.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.190
Or you have the same
from the Lusitanos,

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.790
which are from Portugal.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.200
They were made for war.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:47.240
And also the Spanish made
them to pull carriages,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.370
but an aristocratic carriage.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.880
Am I OK with the English?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.920
And then so you
see those what we

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.500
call the Spanish horses,
very elegant horses

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.000
walking like this.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.460
So all the horses have
been created by men

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.380
for those specific purposes.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.700
What is fantastic about
Odysseo and Cavalia

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.490
and what is fantastic
about how stupid

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:14.620
I was to think that I
brought to the horse world

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.060
different types of horses
doing different types of stuff

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.100
and I put them all in one show.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:24.690
Where, if you go to a horse
competition or a horse

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.990
show, all day long, if you
see a jumping competition,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.040
all day long, you'll see horses
jumping, after one, two, three,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.450
four, five, you'll
say, OK what else?

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.710
I was not there for
doing a horse show.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.810
I was there for doing
performing arts with horses.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.966
So I do have horses that
jump, horses that dance.

00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:48.340
We do have horses
that do what we

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.690
call "at liberty," where they
just play with their trainer.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.430
And it created a world apart.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:57.730
That's what is Odysseo
and through Cavalia also.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.740
We definitely created something
that didn't exist before.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: And when you
see it, it is so spectacular.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:10.640
And you see these horses doing
their performance seamlessly.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.930
But I'm sure there
are some breeds

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.110
or some horses
with personalities,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.570
or they have their own quirks.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.530
Are there some that are harder
to train, easier to train?

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.660
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah, I
mean, they're like humans.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.720
Or they are like anyone
living on this planet.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.645
They don't learn at the
same speed between them.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.850
They don't behave the same way.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.800
And sometimes, we
could have horses

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.720
that we could buy
very expensively.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.400
We train them.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.770
We bring them to the tour.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.340
And after a couple
of months, we say,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.370
this is not his cup of tea.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.820
And we just remove him.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:53.320
Because these horses,
you always have

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:59.460
to look at a horse or any animal
the way they behave in nature

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.080
to see if they are
comfortable or not.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.490
And horses are surrounded
in nature by predators.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.640
We are a predator for the horse.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.750
So he can get very scared.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.300
But the moment you
give him comfort,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.060
if you don't hit him,
if you don't beat him,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.220
if he don't push him too
hard, if you tell him slowly,

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.470
or if you follow the way he
is to learn what he has to do,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.690
he'll be more than pleased.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.170
He will give you 10 times more.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.990
But some horses come.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.370
They achieve that.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.870
They're good.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.360
They're ready to go in the show.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.780
And they arrive in front of
2,000 people and they say, oh.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.410
Why am I here?

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:42.550
And that happened.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.020
And after a month
or two, if we feel

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.720
that the horse is just
scared and gets very nervous,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.930
we just remove him.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:51.800
We just say, OK,
this is not his.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.770
And other horses,
it's very fantastic,

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.250
because they don't
behave the same if they

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.010
are in public or not in public.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.550
They are really stars.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.770
They wait for the applause.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.079
And if they have no
applause, this is boring.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:07.940
I am telling you.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.970
It might sound silly,
but this is how they are.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.390
They have emotion.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.130
The horses we have like what
they do, and they live--

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.190
and it's very important.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:21.480
They live in herds.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.909
And when you visit
the stable, they

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:25.500
are always in the same position.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.480
They always have
the same neighbor.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.420
So they're very social animals.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.210
And when they come
on stage, we make

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.590
them feel that the stage
is not the place to work.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.170
It's a place to play.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.750
Horses, they like two things
in life-- they like to eat

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.000
and they like to play.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.620
And so if you give them
food and then you bring them

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.580
to a playground as
huge as our stage,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.280
the horse can be very happy.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:55.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: That sounds like
a pretty nice life for a horse.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.071
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah.

00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:59.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: How is it that
you rotate horses on and off,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.310
the ones who have proven
themselves at least?

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.690
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Well, in Odysseo, we

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.550
have almost 70 horses touring.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.030
And in Cavalia,
we have 40 horses.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.260
And the company owns about
200 of them in total.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:19.400
So we have a farm in Canada,
and we just supply horses.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.380
And some horses,
most of the horse

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.540
will not stay longer than
four years or five years.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.500
Not because they're tired,
they just get bored.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:33.140
And we want to give them
some pasture at one point.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.220
They like to eat greens.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.030
And when you're on tour,
they have paddocks outside.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.010
Even in downtown San
Jose, they have paddocks.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.990
But it's not the most
comfortable paddock.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:46.970
They look at the greens
and there's only sand.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.270
So it's good for them.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:51.230
It's good for their
[? mental ?] to go to pasture.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.890
So after four years,
if they're young horses

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.600
and happy performers, we
remove them for two years

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.620
and bring them back.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:00.110
And we have a team,
a complete team

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:03.120
that is taking care of
the renewal of the horse

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.310
but also the people.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.960
Because sometimes,
we hired acrobats

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.070
who knew nothing about horses,
because we have a cast of 45.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:14.680
Half of them are acrobat
bases and the other half

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:19.200
are horse riders,
trainers based.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.270
So we have to teach
the horse riders

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.090
how to become acrobats and
the opposite way around.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.520
Some of the acrobats have to
learn how to be with horses.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:36.630
And we like to have
multi-skilled humans,

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:40.480
but we also like to have
multi-skilled horses, which

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.100
is very unique in our world.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.000
Because everyone who has a
horse knows that the horse

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.985
will ride a certain way.

00:19:49.985 --> 00:19:52.920
If he's riding English saddle,
he's riding English saddle.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.270
If he's riding Western
saddle, it's Western saddle.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.500
If you have a jumping horse,
that's all he does-- he jumps.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.210
But our horses, we
try to bring them

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.520
to three different disciplines,
which makes them even more

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.520
happy, because every time
they come in the show,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.145
they don't know what
we're going to do.

00:20:11.145 --> 00:20:14.170
So it's just bringing their
mind to something different.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.610
I compare often horses to
kids, three year old kids.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.950
More or less two and a
half, three years old.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.000
So especially boys,
they're very unpredictable.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.040
I say that because
I had two boys.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.760
So they're very unpredictable.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.400
And the horses are
the same thing.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.660
But if you bring
something to them

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:37.190
that lit and makes them
want to play and be happy,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:42.110
you have your best
friend in the world.

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: What is a day
in the life of these horses?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.950
NORMAND LATOURELLE: They have
six meals a day, mostly hay.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.235
We like to give them hay during
the entire day, because it

00:20:58.235 --> 00:20:59.530
keeps them occupied.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.480
Again, you just have
to reproduce what they

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.090
are in the field or in nature.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.020
So we're trying always to-- if
you see a horse in the field,

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.230
you rarely see a horse head up.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.460
Always down, looking for
little bits and bites of grass.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.060
So we feed them six times a day.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.110
And that starts very
early in the morning.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.300
Because horses,
they do sleep down,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.800
for the ones who don't know.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.950
They do sleep down, but never
more than 40, 45 minutes,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.010
and then they go up.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.210
And it's also very
interesting to watch them,

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.590
because when one goes
down, the next one

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.710
stays up, because
he's checking to make

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:38.710
sure everything is fine.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:40.690
And then when this
one will go up,

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.150
this one will go down for
40 minutes, but not longer

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:45.520
than 40 minutes, because
they need to eat.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.070
Because they eat grass.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.340
It's like us if we eat
only salad all day long.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.350
I promise you, you will eat
at least 10 meals a day.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.100
And the horse is the same thing,
because they eat only grass.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.230
And then riders arrive.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.990
So they get groomed
and all that.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.760
And then the riders
arrive, or the trainer

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.560
arrives at about
10:00 in the morning.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.540
And the horses rotate.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.710
They go outside every
day for one hour.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:19.860
And then they do 40 minutes of
just warming up, just walking

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.390
or running.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.910
Mostly free.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.130
And later during the day,
they do probably half an hour

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.700
of real training, what they
are best at, or their skills.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.160
And before the show, they get
20 minutes of warm-up again,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.410
and then they do the show.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.886
Average of stay for a
horse on stage, the average

00:22:40.886 --> 00:22:43.240
is about 10 minutes.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.060
Some people ask me if
horses are intelligent.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.310
Obviously, compared
to humans, based

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.570
on the number of hours
they work during the day,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:53.100
they're very intelligent.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.010
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
can appreciate that.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.760
Absolutely.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.110
So when the riders are
working with them, or maybe

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.970
not even necessarily riders,
but especially the liberty

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.370
portions, where the
horses are free, just

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:16.484
following their person, how do
you train a horse to do that?

00:23:16.484 --> 00:23:18.400
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Most
of the regular people

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.960
who are not working
in the horse world,

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.310
like you have horses,
I know you have horses,

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.550
but you have to work.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.990
And you have to sleep.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.240
And then you spend maybe
three or four hours

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.420
with your horse a week.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:41.560
Our trainers spend 10 hours
a day with their horses.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.380
And we have the luxury of time.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.840
So that's why we don't
push them for training.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.930
We just wait for
them to be ready.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.930
We're slowly training them.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.930
And then you start to
create a real bond.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:58.250
And there's one part
in the show that you

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:00.570
have about 40 horses free.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.800
And you have eight
people just leading them.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.040
And this is the
most amazing part,

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.380
because it's like a ballet.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.330
It's hard to explain.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.290
And they have no ropes, nothing.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.340
And the horses just
follow their trainer.

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.590
They follow the trainer
because they like the trainer.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:21.770
It's their friend, and this
is why that's happening.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.890
And people from the
horse world look at this

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.490
and say how the hell
have you done that?

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.370
It is difficult to
do it with one horse.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.620
To get followed by a horse,
if you walk in the field

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.740
or in the paddock, to make sure
that the horse is following

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:38.000
you, it's an achievement.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.770
So we have 40 of them
following eight people, which

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.500
is absolutely spectacular.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.500
And it's very beautiful.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.860
And this is where you can
notice that the horses are

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.790
happy to do it.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.330
Because they just follow.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.723
They're their friends.

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:53.722
FEMALE SPEAKER: Are there
little bits of carrots

00:24:53.722 --> 00:24:54.874
in their pocket?

00:24:54.874 --> 00:24:56.290
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Good question.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.790
The answer is, no.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:02.960
We do give carrots,
but after they

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.910
have done what they had to do.

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.660
Otherwise, the horse
will just ask for it,

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.650
which will not be funny.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:16.380
And also, if you give too much
carrot to the horses that work

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.930
or is that work-- we call it "at
work"-- when he comes on stage,

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:24.732
he will just have his
mind set for carrots.

00:25:24.732 --> 00:25:29.350
For us to reward a
horse with carrots,

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.520
we just thank him
at the end and he

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.720
knows we're happy with
what he has achieved.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.620
So he's not there asking, but
we do have a lot of carrots

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:43.360
backstage in the stable.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.450
I don't know how much
we spend in carrots,

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.760
but it's a big budget.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
can believe that.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.650
So the horses are unpredictable,
although they're trained.

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.860
The audience, I would think,
is even more unpredictable.

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:05.617
How do you deal
with anything that

00:26:05.617 --> 00:26:07.450
comes up with the
audience or something that

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:08.469
is out of your control?

00:26:08.469 --> 00:26:10.010
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Well, we give not

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:14.450
carrots but we give
popcorn to the audience.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.130
Better control.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:26.140
Since we are doing Odysseo,
since the first show--

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.310
that was five years ago.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:31.580
We're about to be five
years old in October--

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.400
I don't know how many thousands
of performances we've done,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.410
but I have not seen one show
where the audience doesn't

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.130
stand up at the end of the show.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.130
And this is a gift
for a creator to see

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:48.880
at the end of every performance
2,000 people or whatever there

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.680
is, because there's 2,000
seats whatever there is,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.570
in the audience standing
up and applauding.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:57.470
And I see people
crying and how they're

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.390
laughing and being happy.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.840
So that's why I do that.

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.950
I'm just trying to bring
a little bit of happiness

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.110
on this earth.

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:11.150
And you can see people
have enjoyed this show.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.720
And I can say after touring
it for so many years,

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.510
I can say-- this might
sound pretentious,

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.000
but that's probably
one of the best

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.141
shows that exist on the planet.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.780
You have to experience it.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.500
Because people will say,
oh, it's a horse show.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.790
I'm not a horse person.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:31.740
It doesn't matter.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.120
It's just a feel-good show.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:40.080
It's a good show that
will elevate your spirit.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.405
FEMALE SPEAKER: It made
me happy-- very happy.

00:27:43.405 --> 00:27:44.447
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Good.

00:27:44.447 --> 00:27:47.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does anyone have
any questions in the audience

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.910
they want to ask?

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.070
AUDIENCE: Which is the
favorite breed of horses?

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.830
Because I noticed some
Arabians out there,

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:57.374
which I happen to have one.

00:27:57.374 --> 00:28:02.044
So which is the favorite,
smartest, easiest to teach?

00:28:02.044 --> 00:28:03.710
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
You know, it depends

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:04.990
on what you ask them to do.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.060
For the Arabians, we
have a lot of Arabians

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.540
because we do what
we call liberty.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.400
And there are very playful.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.670
That's why we like them.

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.370
And also, they like
to stay in herds

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:17.870
more than the other horses.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:23.300
They are very inclined
to be part of a group.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.300
So when we do
liberty, at one point,

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.930
there's about 12 horses coming.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.570
it depends on the
show, from 8 to 12.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:37.140
But they all behave together,
and they all act together,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.360
and they're totally free.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.670
And there's one girl.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.820
Her name is Elise Verdoncq.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.800
She's the main trainer
for those horses.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.166
And also, I think
they're very elegant.

00:28:48.166 --> 00:28:49.540
And the Arabian,
for the ones who

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.000
don't know, when they
start to be happy,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.050
it's a little bit like
the dogs with the tails,

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:56.380
but the tail goes up.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.970
And it's very nice.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:01.080
They're very beautiful, very
elegant, and light horses.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.310
So they can just
achieve, like, a waltz.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.540
I see it like a waltz.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:08.050
So that's why we have
a lot of Arabians.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.380
But that having been
said, are they easier

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.450
to train than other horses?

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.270
I don't think so.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:15.480
I think the easiest
horses to train,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.060
obviously, are the
American quarter

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.780
horses, because they are cold.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.240
We call it "cold-blood."

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.570
They're a little bit colder and
really nothing affects them.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:30.150
And you can see why
the cowboys used

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:34.870
to shoot guns over
a quarter horse,

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:37.940
because he's just
like, yeah, OK.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.560
Something is going on.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.090
Where, if you do that with
an Arabian, I'm telling you,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.010
he's away as far as he could.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.890
So that's why.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.890
So the Arabians like
to have movement,

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:57.740
and that's why we have a
lot for this liberty part.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.220
AUDIENCE: What's the ideal age
that you'll introduce horses

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:00.910
to the program?

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.243
Will you take two, three
year-olds that are newly broke?

00:30:03.243 --> 00:30:04.680
Will you take a
16 year-old horse

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.679
that's been doing something
else his whole life?

00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:09.335
What do you tend to aim for
with the age of your horses?

00:30:09.335 --> 00:30:11.210
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Yeah, very good question.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.720
First, we don't breed horses.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:18.090
We buy horses that are
already fully-- conformated?

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.770
Con-- con-- con-- what?

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.810
AUDIENCE: Conformed.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:22.200
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Conformed.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:22.700
I'm sorry.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.750
Looking for the word.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.660
Fully conformed
so we know what we

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.890
buy, so we know how he
looks, how he'll behave.

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:35.380
So usually, we rarely buy
horses under three years old.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.880
Most likely, we like to
buy them at four or five,

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.370
but with the minimum of being
what you call in English

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:42.960
"broken."

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.490
I don't like this word,
but that's the word we use.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:50.690
So minimally ridden
but not too much.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.750
Because if you take
a horse that has

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.110
been trained by
somebody too difficult,

00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:59.360
then you have a difficult horse.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.660
So that's why we try to buy
them around four or five.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.410
We will sometimes
find an exception

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:12.920
of a six, seven years old horse,
but we don't keep them on tour.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.620
There's no horses
over-- right now,

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.040
I think the oldest is
16 or 17 years old.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.165
And we still have some
horses that were there

00:31:20.165 --> 00:31:23.720
in Cavalia, actually, in 2003.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.710
One of the first horses I
bought is a quarter horse.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.840
His name is Choice,
and he's at the farm.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.350
And when they used to
go there more often,

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:33.960
a couple years ago, I
used to do hamburgers.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.720
And he was coming
next to me, because he

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.910
was free on the farm.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.730
So he was helping
me with hamburgers.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:45.840
But no, these horses can live.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.845
When they leave the tour, it's
not because they are finished.

00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:51.150
It's just because it's
time for them to leave.

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:56.350
After 16, 17 years old, we find
them either an adoption place,

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.624
or we bring them to our farm.

00:31:58.624 --> 00:32:00.290
AUDIENCE: I think
over the past 30 years

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.880
or so the Quebecois circus,
from Cirque du Soleil to Cavalia

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.820
to Odysseo, has really
reshaped that whole genre.

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.410
Why do you think that is?

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:13.690
What have you seen change
from the early days to now?

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.420
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah, this
is a very difficult question

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:17.330
to answer.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.760
How you define-- how
come-- and it's true.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.860
When you travel around the world
and you see the entertainment,

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.090
live entertainment
world, you see

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.750
a lot of people from
Quebec, like my province,

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.370
like from Montreal and Quebec.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.030
Why is that?

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.564
I cannot the answer.

00:32:32.564 --> 00:32:33.980
Maybe it's something
in the water.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.590
I don't know what it is,
to tell you the truth.

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:44.980
That having been
said, we are a mix

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:49.720
of-- I consider myself a mix
of American and European.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.950
And that's probably that we get
the influence of both worlds.

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:57.300
And because we're a very
small, tiny French community--

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.400
we're only three million
people over that ocean

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.600
of English speakers--
we probably

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.630
have developed some skills of
fighting and trying to express

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:11.360
ourselves differently.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.560
That's maybe one of the reasons.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.410
And I was there for the
beginning of Cirque.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:23.890
And after Cirque, as you know
now, I've started Cavalia.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:28.590
And I think behind
me and other people

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.970
is the idea of to trying to
do something new, different,

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.020
and push the limits.

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.140
That's probably what it is.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:38.260
That's what it is
for me, actually.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.310
AUDIENCE: When you're
doing live performances,

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:43.310
is there a guideline
or rule of thumb,

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.100
particularly during
the liberty portions,

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.320
where if one of the
horses is not cooperating,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.560
someone will remove the
horse from the stage?

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.200
Or will you always
just keep going

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.909
and trying to bring the horse
back into the performance?

00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:59.450
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Most of the time,

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.300
we try to bring them
back to the performance.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.350
It did that happen.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.220
It did happen.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.550
It could happen that
if a horse really

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.429
started to be-- because we
have a lot of stallions.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:15.409
We have only male horses, and
we have a lot of stallions.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:19.350
So if a stallion starts to
behave very badly, which

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:24.150
could happen, at the
time, we will take a rope,

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:26.860
bring him out.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.139
But that happens very rarely.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.179
Most of the time, we
let them, what I call,

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:34.090
express themselves.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:38.670
And after a while,
because I've seen horses

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:43.350
running for three minutes, and
running and kicking and having

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.139
fun.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.679
So the rule is, let him.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.560
If he's not dangerous for
the horses, let him do it.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.639
And after two or three
minutes, he's just--

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.070
[PANTING]

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.340
OK, what do I do now?

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.739
And then he's coming back.

00:34:56.739 --> 00:34:58.780
This is nature.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.260
This is so easy.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.630
You just have to read it.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.240
And it's also very interesting,
because I repeat that

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.390
to whoever is next to horses,
probably because I'm not

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.860
next to horses I can say it.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.770
I say to the people, the
horses never makes mistakes.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:15.620
It's the human who
makes mistakes.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.320
It's just changing
the perspective.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.030
You ask something to the horse.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.170
If he doesn't do it, it's
because you didn't ask right,

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:28.600
or you didn't take the time
to let him answer right.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.490
And that's the
philosophy behind it.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.350
But it's easy to say for me.

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.300
But for the trainers,
some of the girls

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.880
are five feet four
inches next to a horse

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.420
that is twice her size.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.950
I can see sometimes, OK,
that's a nice philosophy

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.670
but it's a big animal.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.420
It's a question of balance.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.050
I think it's always--
that's in life.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:57.450
Everything in life for me,
it's a question of balance.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:58.300
It's the same thing.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.410
Next to an animal, even
more, next to any animal,

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:02.670
it's a question of balance.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.290
If you want to dominate too
much, he won't like you.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.780
If you want to be his
friend, he will like you.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.470
FEMALE SPEAKER: What
was your childhood like?

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.820
How did your parents
influence you?

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.160
And if your mother
was here, what would

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.379
she say was the first sign that
you would be who you are today?

00:36:20.379 --> 00:36:22.420
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Oh,
that's a moving question,

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:26.970
because my mother just passed
away about eight months ago.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:30.630
And my mother, even if I was
doing very stupid and crazy

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.970
things when I was young,
which my father didn't like,

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.670
but my mother
always supported me.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:44.430
And probably my mother
gave me the courage,

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:48.800
as far as my idea,
of bringing me to.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.680
Because I'm one of the rare
guys who has the two votes.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.820
I'm producing the show.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.680
So financially, I'm
involved, and I'm creating

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.840
the show, which is very rare.

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.450
Usually, you see
someone who'll create

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:07.075
and you find someone who brings
the money in and produces.

00:37:07.075 --> 00:37:07.700
I have the two.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:13.080
The reason why I'm
like that, probably

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.780
is because nobody at first when
I started to talk about, I'm

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:19.910
going to do a great show with
horses, they were looking at me

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.860
like-- and if you
go to a producer

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.800
or whoever has
money to tell him,

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.010
I'm going to do a
great show with horses,

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.160
it's going to be very modern.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.810
And 10 years ago,
people just don't come.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:39.260
So I said, OK, I'm going
to support my idea.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.980
The reality is the producer
suffers more than the creator

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.060
because I'm spending
so much money.

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.140
But I am just pushing my
idea as far as I could.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:52.850
And that's probably
from my mother.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:59.760
And because it's become very
personal, also in my family,

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:02.180
my oldest brother is disabled.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:07.740
And I've been very
supportive of him.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:14.500
Even today, he's
66 67 right now.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:17.410
Very supportive of
him, but I always

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.130
felt I was very blessed
compared to him.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.610
And I always felt,
even when I was young,

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:24.340
I had to do twice
more because he

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.710
couldn't do what he deserved.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:30.640
And I just always
pushed the limit.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.020
It's probably the
combination of two.

00:38:36.151 --> 00:38:40.390
I like to say I was
born on a sidewalk.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:44.380
I passed my young
age in an alley.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.920
And I became a
teenager in the street.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.370
That's probably how
to resume my life.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:55.240
And then when I grew up, I
just traveled around the world.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.038
That's who I am.

00:38:57.038 --> 00:38:58.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I noticed
in the teaser clip,

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.436
there was a pool of water.

00:39:02.436 --> 00:39:04.560
And some of the horses were
going through the water

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.850
and the acrobats were
jumping through the water.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:08.700
Do you actually have
a pool on stage?

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.380
And does that
introduce other kinds

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.422
of difficulties or challenges?

00:39:13.422 --> 00:39:15.800
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Definitely,
a lot of challenges.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.390
We fill the stage.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.980
Again, the stage is about
the size of a hockey rink.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.640
We filled it in about
one minute, 30 seconds

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.960
with 40,000 gallons of water.

00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.030
Again, this is a touring show.

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:37.140
It's very complicated, because
we change location everywhere

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:37.850
we go.

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:39.402
So it has to be totally level.

00:39:39.402 --> 00:39:40.860
Because if it's
not level, you know

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:42.720
what happens with the water.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.200
So it's very challenging.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.990
And it's one of the most
technically challenging parts

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.020
of the show.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:56.500
But I thought I wanted--
Odysseo is-- let's say the word.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.470
It's an odyssey,
where men and horses

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.850
go to discover the most
beautiful landscape

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.660
in the world.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.540
So they're just
traveling together.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.200
That's why I call it odyssey.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.662
And in the end, "eau" is
because of the water coming.

00:40:11.662 --> 00:40:16.820
And I think you cannot-- and
the stage reveals a lot about

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.630
nature.

00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:20.260
So you cannot reveal about
nature without talking about

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.810
the water, which is
the source of life,

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.280
which is also
where animals meet.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:31.380
If you go to anywhere, the
animals, every kind of animal,

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.420
meet, including humans,
around a source of water.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.710
And I could not
do a show talking

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.320
about the relationship
of men and horses

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.020
and traveling throughout the
world without having water,

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.690
even if it's very challenging.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.780
Because this show, again,
you have to see it,

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.420
but it's the biggest
touring show in the world.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.040
We have about 120 semi
trailers when we move.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.220
If you compare to the biggest
rock 'n' roll tour, the Rolling

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:02.713
Stones or U2, they have only 65.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.640
I mean, it's a big tour.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.340
And the big tent
is one of a kind,

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:17.140
because I didn't want to
have the feeling of a circus.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:21.690
I'm not a circus guy,
where you see the ring

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.430
and everything goes around.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.510
I didn't want that.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:29.910
So we really created a space
that is like a real auditorium.

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:33.310
And people are sitting in the
auditorium, like here, facing

00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:36.740
the stage, but the
stage is very, very big.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.520
And there's no obstruction.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:41.382
Most of the tents you see in
the world, even the Cirque du

00:41:41.382 --> 00:41:46.170
Soleil tents, the big one, you
see a mast next to the stage.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:50.770
When you get to see Odysseo,
you see no obstruction.

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.740
There's no mast.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.520
Everything is
supported by-- if you

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.850
pass nearby the tent over
there, you see three arches.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:03.340
We support 80 tons of equipment
there but with these arches.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:08.750
So if you're into engineering,
just go and watch carefully.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:10.560
It's a marvel of engineering.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.500
This is just an amazing
engineering piece.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.140
Because when you tour, rock
'n' roll tour in an arena,

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:23.970
usually the maximum weight they
put to the ceiling is 50 tons.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:25.520
And we have 80.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.570
One of the most important
elements of the show

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.490
is a merry-go-round that
appears from the ceiling.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:33.050
Again, you're under a tent.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.070
You're not in a
permanent theater.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:41.430
And the merry-go-round is
very big, weighs 18 tons.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.887
And we do an
acrobatic act on it.

00:42:44.887 --> 00:42:46.470
And this part, I
mean, you've seen it.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:51.630
It's just magical and
brings you to a dream world.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:57.530
Again, this is because I pushed
the idea and made it happen.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.280
That's the thing-- you just have
an idea and you make it happen.

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:04.210
So whatever it costs, is it
possible or not, let's do it.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:09.251
And that's what is defining,
pretty much, Odysseo.

00:43:09.251 --> 00:43:10.750
AUDIENCE: You have
dozens of horses.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.115
Do you ever acquire horses
as your show is traveling?

00:43:14.115 --> 00:43:15.740
Because, I mean,
you're in places where

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.439
there's horse communities or?

00:43:18.439 --> 00:43:19.480
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah.

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.190
Yeah, we do, actually.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.960
Yeah, we do.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.470
We have horses--
yesterday, I was

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.000
talking to one of
the grooms, and we

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.130
have one horse from
Australia, because Cavalia

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.340
went to Australia.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:33.330
And after a while, we
brought the horse back

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.210
to North America.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:37.190
And he's now touring
with Odysseo.

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:41.010
And we have horses from Arizona,
because we were in Arizona.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.800
We have horses from California.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.970
And we always look
for good horses.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.820
And they are everywhere.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.860
There's no specific place
where we buy horses.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:56.020
But of course we have
a lot of-- again,

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.590
I just might repeat here, but
we have a lot of Spanish horses.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:03.180
So these ones, of course,
we go to buy them in Spain.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.994
But other than that, we buy
through the course of the tour.

00:44:05.994 --> 00:44:07.910
AUDIENCE: All right, two
more quick questions.

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.963
Which market have you
made the most money in

00:44:10.963 --> 00:44:14.310
or is most popular, where
you have the most response?

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.740
And have you ever thought
of having a permanent show,

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:18.390
like a permanent building?

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.960
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:26.940
Well, there's a big difference
between Cavalia and Odysseo.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.030
Cavalia made money.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.927
Odysseo is spending money.

00:44:32.927 --> 00:44:34.510
That's why it's worth
it for you to go

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:39.240
see how do you spend money.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.070
With no joking, California is
a very good, very good market.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.230
We were in San
Francisco not long ago.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.820
We did fantastic.

00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:51.160
We just arrived a couple
months ago from Irvine.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.490
We're returning to Irvine.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.790
So California is a great market.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:45:00.880
Also, in terms of economies,
which is very important, when

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.950
you are into entertainment, live
entertainment in California,

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:08.250
you don't pay tax, which
I mean, on the ticket.

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:13.080
If you go back where I
live, you pay 15% of tax.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.869
So it does make
a big difference.

00:45:14.869 --> 00:45:16.910
AUDIENCE: It's the only
thing we're not taxed on.

00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:17.680
NORMAND LATOURELLE: I'm sorry?

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.304
AUDIENCE: It's the one thing in
California you're not taxed on!

00:45:20.304 --> 00:45:21.972
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Well, yeah, exactly.

00:45:21.972 --> 00:45:23.180
I mean, you have other taxes.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.555
I don't say you
don't have taxes.

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.560
I just say, we're not
taxed, because we're

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.260
live entertainment, which is
fantastic, which is fantastic.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.900
So in terms of business,
doing business in California

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.820
is very good for us.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.240
Where we stayed the longest?

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.000
Actually, we return many
times so it's hard to say.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.670
But Cavalia, the first
show is now in China.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:48.630
It has been performing in
Beijing for six months,

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.960
and we are still extending.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:56.750
So this is a revelation, because
we don't know-- we didn't know.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.430
And there's no horses in China.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.650
There's very, very little.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:03.670
There's a lot of horses in
their culture, a lot of horses

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.590
in their mythology.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:09.220
But the reality is there's
not that many horses in China.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:13.230
Very little unless
you go far north.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.710
So that having been said,
the first show for whoever

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:18.590
has seen it, the
first show there's

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:23.600
two small horses that
open the first act.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:27.190
And here we see horses.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.190
We applaud, and it's the
beginning of the show.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.350
Over there, they're like kids.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.910
I'm talking about the audience.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:36.960
You hear "woooo!" every show.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.877
It's surprising, because
they don't see live horses.

00:46:41.877 --> 00:46:43.210
You're in the middle of Beijing.

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:46.370
I don't know if any of
you have been to Beijing,

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:49.050
but it's a monstrous city.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:52.030
I mean, San Francisco
and Los Angeles

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:56.436
are very small
compared to Beijing.

00:46:56.436 --> 00:46:59.190
So that's where we
spend a lot of time.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:03.210
And of course,
Montreal, my hometown,

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:07.140
I mean, when we go
there, we're big stars.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.740
At least one city we're a big
star in the world, my own city!

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.920
We do very good
business in Canada too.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.680
AUDIENCE: My question is,
can you comment a little bit

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.540
on the logistics?

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.130
You have 120 trailers
that are going around?

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.230
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah,
semi-trailers for Odysseo.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.900
AUDIENCE: I'm just
trying to imagine

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:24.780
all the people that you need.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.459
You have 45 performers,
I think you mentioned.

00:47:27.459 --> 00:47:29.750
You've got people that have
to take care of the horses.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:32.370
You need people to set up
the tents, the lighting,

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.139
the orchestra, the
musicians, all that.

00:47:34.139 --> 00:47:35.680
How many people are
touring with you?

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.410
And how do you handle
all these logistics?

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:38.451
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Yeah.

00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:43.630
We have 120-- I was going
to say 120 semi-trailers.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:44.350
That's true.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:49.690
But 120 permanent staff
touring with us full time.

00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.140
We run the show at
about 200 people.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.520
So the 80 people every
day are local people.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.140
When we set up, when we
move, because we move

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.940
this big tour in about 17 days,
from the last show in a city

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.710
to the first show in the next
city, and then we are about 200

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.780
per day, about 200 to 250
people per day to help

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:16.150
to set up and dismantle.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:20.080
The logistics, I guess
we get used to it.

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:23.300
We have fantastic people
taking care of all the details.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.940
There's a lot to be done.

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.560
There's a lot to achieve.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.720
I guess it's a little
bit like the army.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.840
When it's time to move,
you just back your truck

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:35.130
and you just move and
set up in the next city.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.240
And it's also
personal logistics.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.080
Because everyone
lives in an apartment.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.080
But you know what it is.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.300
When you tour, you
start with one luggage,

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.620
and then you have two,
three, four, five.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.010
There's a rider who
left us yesterday

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:53.410
after five years of touring.

00:48:53.410 --> 00:48:54.717
She went back home.

00:48:54.717 --> 00:48:56.800
And she said, I don't know
how I'm going to do it.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.370
I have seven luggage.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.560
And I said, oh, I don't
think Air Canada will

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.680
accept seven luggage from you.

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.790
But the reality is, we
have to have a container,

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:11.150
and we call it an extra
luggage container.

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:15.400
And it's all part of what we do.

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.710
And it's mainly because we have
very good people who do it.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:23.090
AUDIENCE: There are many really
magical parts of your show.

00:49:23.090 --> 00:49:27.370
One of the parts that was most
astounding, as someone who's

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.720
ridden horses, was
there's a trick rider who

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.530
goes under the belly of the
horse and back up to the top

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.170
while the horse is galloping.

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.730
Can you tell me
a little bit more

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:40.990
about how long they've
trained for that?

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.740
I've never seen anything
like that before.

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:44.560
That was just amazing.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.950
Or where that trick came from?

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:48.900
NORMAND LATOURELLE:
Well, this number,

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.420
we call it Cossack riding.

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:55.710
And it's from the
far part of Russia.

00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:59.610
They've started this type
of riding over there.

00:49:59.610 --> 00:50:04.630
And there are very few
guys who are doing it,

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.520
but the reality, if
you look carefully,

00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:10.940
the horse that does it is
very tall, and this guy

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.600
has enough space to move.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:15.960
But you have to
establish a real trust,

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.590
because nobody is
riding the horse.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.400
He's just going full
speed and around.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.840
You don't want to
stop, or him to stop.

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:26.050
You don't want him to slow down.

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:30.730
So they get to train him, and
finally he goes under the belly

00:50:30.730 --> 00:50:34.180
and comes back after every show.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.235
And it's very
spectacular, very scary.

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.600
My hands get wet every
time I see him doing it.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.480
Will I do it?

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.680
No.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.790
But he's an athlete and that's
what he does for a living,

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:52.380
believe it or not.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.310
But it's very impressive.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:58.850
And the show brings you to
a lot of action sometimes.

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.030
And sometimes, it's
very smooth, beautiful.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:08.850
And this show brings
you to a lot of-- it's

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.090
just a feel-good show.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.660
After the show, I say, wow.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:13.620
I've seen something different.

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.410
I've seen something that
animals [? live ?] well.

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:19.370
They seem happy.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:23.490
And it's just a
beautiful show, I think.

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:26.420
And you just said it,
but I like to repeat it.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:30.090
Because there's nothing
harsh in this show.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.780
There's nothing that
you can say, "ohhh."

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.260
It's just beautiful.

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:36.730
That's the idea behind it.

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:39.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for being here today.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:39.870
NORMAND LATOURELLE: Thank you.

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:40.810
Thank you very much.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:44.358
