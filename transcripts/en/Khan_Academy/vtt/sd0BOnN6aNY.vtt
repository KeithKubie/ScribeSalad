00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:01.940
In this video we're
going to try to learn

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.660
a little bit about reflection.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.940
Or I guess you could say we are
going to reflect on reflection.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.000
I think most of us have
a sense of what this is,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.080
but we'll try to get a little
bit more exact about it.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.520
So there are actually
two types of reflection,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.400
and everything that reflects
is doing one or the other,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.840
or something in between.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.790
So we have two types.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.889
Let me draw them.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.180
So the first type, and this
is kind of what we normally

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.525
associate with reflection
is specular reflection.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.500
And in specular
reflection, let's say

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.727
that this is the
top of a mirror.

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:41.060
This is the surface of a mirror.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.840
If I have a light
ray coming in-- So

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.050
let me draw a light
ray coming in.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.860
And just to get the
terminology right,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.077
this light ray coming in,
this ray, is the incident ray.

00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:52.660
And it's the incident
ray because it's

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.650
the ray as it approaches
the reflective surface.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.240
Let me write that down.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.430
That right there is
the incident ray.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.130
It'll approach the surface.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.910
And you can almost imagine
that it bounces off

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.740
at essentially the same angle,
but in the other direction.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.610
So then it'll hit the surface,
and then it'll bounce off,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.830
and it'll go just like that.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.800
And then we would call
this the reflected ray,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.250
after it is kind of
bounced off of the surface.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.080
Reflected ray.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.640
And you may have
already noticed this

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.796
if you've played around a lot
with mirrors you would see--

00:01:33.796 --> 00:01:35.420
and we're going to
look at some images.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.670
So you can think about
it a little better.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.890
Next time you're in
front of the bathroom

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.760
mirror you can think
about this, and think

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.630
about the angle of incidence
and the angle of reflection.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.840
But they're actually equal.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.550
So let me define
them right here.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.890
So if I were to just
drop a straight line

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.560
that is at a 90
degree, or that is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.080
perpendicular to the
surface of the actual mirror

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.780
right over here, we would
define this, right here,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690
as the angle of incidence.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.590
I'll just use theta.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.250
That's just a fancy letter to
show that the angle at which

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.340
we're coming in, the
angle between this ray

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.009
and the vertical right there,
that's the angle of incidence.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.790
And then the angle
between that vertical

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.440
and the blue ray
right there, we call

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.480
that the angle of reflection.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.279
And it's just a property
of especially mirrors when

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:23.695
you're having
specular reflection.

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.710
And you can see
this for yourself

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.950
at all the regular mirrors
that you might experience

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.230
is that the angle
of incidence is

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.390
equal to the angle
of reflection.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.140
And actually we could
see that in a couple

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.280
of images over here.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.280
So let me show you some
images of specular reflection,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.030
just to make it clear here.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.686
So you have some light from
the sun hitting this mountain.

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:51.685
And we're going to talk
about diffuse reflection

00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:53.559
in a little bit, and
that's what's happening.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.860
It's being reflected diffusely.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.640
That's why we don't see the
actual image of the sun here.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.522
We just see the white.

00:02:59.522 --> 00:03:01.730
But then those white light
rays, and they're actually

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.370
being scattered in every
direction, some of them

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.700
are hitting the water.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.840
I'm going to try to match
up parts of the mountain.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.423
So you have this
part of the mountain.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:11.930
Let me do this in
a better color.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.030
You have this part of
the mountain up here,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.950
and the part of the
reflection right over there.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.790
So what's happening
right here is

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.710
light is coming from that
part of the mountain,

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.040
hitting this part of the
surface of the water.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.960
Let me see if I can
draw this better.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.380
It's hitting this part of
the surface of the water,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.870
and then it's getting
reflected, specular reflection,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.384
to our eyes.

00:03:33.384 --> 00:03:35.050
And it's actually
coming straight at us,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.620
but I'll draw it
at a slight angle.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.187
And then it's just coming
straight to our eyes like this.

00:03:42.187 --> 00:03:44.020
If our eye was-- Let's
say our eye was here.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.860
It's actually coming straight
out at us so I actually

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.120
should just draw
a vertical line,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.676
but hopefully this
makes it clear.

00:03:50.676 --> 00:03:52.550
And what we just said,
the angle of incidence

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.050
is equal to the
angle of reflection,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.880
so if you were to
draw a vertical,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.540
and it might not be that obvious
here, but this angle right

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.010
over here-- Let me draw
this a little darker color.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.000
This angle right over
here, that's the angle--

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.490
Let me do that in a light color.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.680
This right here is
the incident angle.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.090
We drew a vertical.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.840
And the angle at
which the light ray

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.910
is approaching the
surface of the water,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.160
right before it bounces,
that's the incident angle

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.060
relative to vertical.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.029
And then this angle
right here-- and I

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.890
know it's hard-- it doesn't
look like they're the same

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.410
but that's just because
of the perspective

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.500
that we're dealing with.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.400
This is the angle of reflection.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.360
And they're actually
going to be equal.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.984
And you could also
make a similar case.

00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:35.370
And sometimes my brain has
easier thinking about this.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.000
If this angle is
equal to that angle--

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.370
and this is what's defined
to be the angle of incidence

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.630
and the angle of
reflection-- we also

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.230
know that this
angle, right here,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.319
is going to be equal to
that angle right there.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.360
And my brain sometimes
thinks that because that's

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.760
kind of the angle between the
ray and the actual surface,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.709
but they're really
the same notions.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.250
And obviously it's
a different angle,

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.541
but if this is equal to that
then this is equal to that

00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:58.330
because these two are
going to add to 90,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.880
these two are
going to add to 90.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.740
So another way you
could view it is-- So

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.830
if we look at the
surface of the water.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.360
Let me draw a line along
the surface of the water.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.270
Another way to think about it
is that this angle, this angle

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.240
right over here, is going
to be the same as this angle

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.330
right over there.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.390
And you can also see it in this
reflection right over here.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.450
So the light from the sun is
going directly to the water

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.880
here, and then getting reflected
at that point on the surface

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.770
of the water, and then
coming over to our eyes.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.710
And so we could either
say that this angle is

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.480
equal to this angle, so the
angle between the incident ray

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.280
and the surface of the
water is equal to the angle

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.730
of the reflected ray and
the surface of the water,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.350
or we could draw a
perpendicular right over here--

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.867
I'm not doing that too well-- we
can draw a perpendicular right

00:05:48.867 --> 00:05:50.450
over here to the
surface of the water,

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.180
and say that the incident
angle, the angle of incidence

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.440
right there between the
ray and that perpendicular,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.355
is going to be the same
as the reflected angle.

00:05:58.355 --> 00:05:59.980
And it's hard to see
there, once again,

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.550
because of the
perspective, but hopefully

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.633
that starts to make sense.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:04.660
And I encourage you,
go to your bathroom

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.076
and look in the mirror, and
look at objects in the mirror,

00:06:07.076 --> 00:06:09.810
and think about the angle
that the light from the object

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.030
must be hitting the mirror
for it to get to your eye,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.821
and where it's actually
hitting the mirror.

00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.040
It's actually a pretty
interesting thing

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.400
to do if you're looking for
things to do in the bathroom.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.020
Now all we've talked about
is specular reflection,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.764
but the other type of reflection
is diffuse reflection.

00:06:24.764 --> 00:06:26.180
And this is the
type of reflection

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.010
that it may not be
as obvious to you

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.940
that it's occurring
everywhere you look.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.156
Diffuse reflection.

00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.970
And in diffuse reflection,
because the surface

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.690
isn't smooth, it's not
what we kind of associate

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.060
as a mirrored surface.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.060
So I'll draw it,
I'll zoom in a bunch.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.040
So in diffuse reflection,
maybe the surface looks

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.230
like that, what happens
is-- and let me be clear.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.900
In specular reflection
any light ray

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.030
that comes in like that,
the reflection will come off

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.680
at the same-- the
angle of incidence

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.680
will always be equal to
the angle of reflection.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.820
This is for the situation
of, say, a mirror.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.010
It'll always be the same.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.010
If I come in at a
steeper angle, then I'll

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.980
go out in a steeper
angle, just like that.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.620
That's for specular reflection.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.030
For diffuse reflection all
sorts of crazy things happen.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.840
And that's because we don't
have this really smooth surface,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.430
or the molecules that
make up the surface

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.210
do crazy things to light.

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.580
So if I come in in one
direction, right over here,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.010
over at that point
the light might

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.690
reflect in that direction.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.130
Although if I come in at
the same angle over here,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.660
now all of a sudden the light
might go in that direction.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.970
And then if I come in at
the same angle over here,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.346
now all of a sudden the light
might go in that direction.

00:07:41.346 --> 00:07:43.928
And if I come in-- and I think
you get the general idea here--

00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:45.730
if I come in over
here, now the light

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.190
might scatter in that direction.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:51.264
If I come in over here
at the same angle,

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:53.180
now the light might
scatter in that direction.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.060
So the general idea is,
with diffuse reaction,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.700
the reflected rays are going in
all sorts of crazy directions,

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.720
and they're getting
all mixed up.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.879
So think about here, if you
had an image here of the sun,

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.420
and I'm not drawing
it in particular,

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:16.210
but let's say that these rays
right here are coming directly

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.590
from the sun, then
when they reflect

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.180
it'll kind of
preserve the image.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.830
You'll have the reflected
image of the sun.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.880
But over here, if all
of these light rays

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.270
are coming from the
sun, they're not all

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.770
going off in the same direction.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.794
This will be a part of
the sun, part of the sun.

00:08:31.794 --> 00:08:33.919
And it's happening at a
really, really small level.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.110
So you're really just
capturing the light,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.980
but you're losing all
of the information

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.039
from the actual image.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.539
And if you're wondering where
diffuse reflection occurs just

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:43.470
look around your room.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.300
Anything that's not a mirror
is reflecting diffusely.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.160
It's diffusing the light.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.050
Do you see that here?

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.340
The mountain right here
is diffuse reflection.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.920
You have light
coming from the sun,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.670
but that's being reflected in
all sorts of crazy directions.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:04.200
So you don't see a reflection
of the sky over here.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.290
The water here, that's
specular reflection

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.417
because it's so super
smooth that it preserves--

00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:12.000
The angle of incidence is going
to be the angle of reflection.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.125
It's always going to be
the same angle because it's

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:17.090
a kind of almost
perfectly smooth surface.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.897
The trees, that's
diffuse reflection.

00:09:18.897 --> 00:09:21.230
And I also want to be clear
on something like the trees.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.856
So on something that's
white, and white

00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:25.230
is the entire
spectrum of light--

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.590
and we'll do more videos
on that in the future--

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.090
it's reflecting the
entire spectrum.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.850
It's just mixing
it all up so you

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.290
don't see an actual reflection.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.660
But if you look
at the trees, you

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.790
have the entire spectrum
from the sun coming down

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.660
on the trees, but the trees
themselves-- and you should

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.710
watch the videos on
photosynthesis-- they're

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:50.280
absorbing every other frequency
of light except for the greens

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.590
you see.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:58.320
So they are just reflecting
the green back to us.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.770
And they're doing it in
a way they're diffusely

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.360
reflecting it.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.350
So we actually don't
see an actual reflection

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.125
in those trees.

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.250
And I'll just finish up
with one kind of neat thing

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.230
because it's kind of
like playing billiards

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.563
here, because you can actually
have a double reflection.

00:10:13.563 --> 00:10:16.125
That's why I even had
this image over here.

00:10:16.125 --> 00:10:18.310
The sun is being reflected
on the water here,

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.830
and then you have a reflection.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.455
This is a direct
reflection of the sun,

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:23.720
but this is a reflection
of the sun reflected

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.290
on the water right over here.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.190
So what you have over
here is the light

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.520
from the sun coming
to this reflection,

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.290
reflecting at that
point on the water,

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:35.640
then going to this
point on the paddle,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.930
and then coming to our eye.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:42.060
But once again the angle of
incidence in every situation

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.030
here is going to be equal
to the angle of reflection.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.450
Although the paddle looks like
it's a little bit distorted

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.380
here, so it's not a
completely smooth surface,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.240
so it makes the math
a little harder.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.904
But when you start
thinking about this

00:10:52.904 --> 00:10:54.320
it becomes pretty
interesting just

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.660
to look at almost any
reflective surfaces

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.510
and to think about
the actual angles.
