JEROME SILBERGELD: Trying to study
architecture from a photograph

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.050
or a slide is a
little bit like trying

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.380
to understand a movie
by reading about it.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.860
You really have
to see the thing.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.140
You really have to be there.


00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.800
You have to experience it.

HENRIQUE DE FREITAS: It became completely
an intellectual experience.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.020
Every rock, every shape of
the pond and every plant

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.780
asks a question
from you and you're

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.250
trying to find the answer.


00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.400
And there's just not enough
time to answer all of them,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.710
but that's what I
enjoyed most about being

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.960
able to actually walk through
these gardens as opposed

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.120
to just talking about them
or looking at pictures.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.540
PHWAY AYE: I sort of thought
that going into the gardens,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.880
it would be a professor
led discussion.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.330
But there was a lot of fluidity.


00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.910
I remember Professor Hare
and Professor Silbergeld

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.460
always being around to
facilitate discussions.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.570
But at the same time,
we had a lot of leeway

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.140
to walk around individually
and experience it ourselves.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.470
So any time I found
myself walking

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.710
around a certain feature
and if I had a question

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.900
or if I had something
I was curious about,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.450
a professor would always be
around to spark that or just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.450
continue that
conversation with me.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.520
THOMAS HARE: We told them to
find a feature in the gardens

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.070
that we toured and to
focus on that feature

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.070
throughout the week
and then tell us

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.600
something about the feature
in their second paper, once we

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.730
got back.


00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.870
We didn't tell them
what a feature was.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.570
We didn't identify any
specific kinds of things.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.220
But they came up with lots
of different possibilities,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.380
including things as broad as
just the idea of space itself.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.850
A couple of students worked
on sound in the gardens,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:06.060
and we had students work
on paths, and sand-- trees.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.910
HENRIQUE DE FREITAS: It opened
a completely new world

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.360
in the academic field of
history of art, of culture,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.870
of religion-- things
that I hadn't really

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.820
considered much before
and that now I just

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.790
can't wait to go into.

JEROME SILBERGELD: I have never
worked, in all of my time

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.790
here, with a more enthusiastic
group of students,

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.220
especially after
the trip, or a group

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.800
of students that had more
closely bonded together,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.020
got to really know each other,
work together, share topics,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.880
share information, learn
together, teach each other.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.430
And I think it is fair to
say that the opportunity

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.130
to undertake a trip
like this-- and we're

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.050
doing more and more
courses like this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.830
so that more and more students
can participate in classes

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.390
of this kind-- really gives
them a unique experience.
