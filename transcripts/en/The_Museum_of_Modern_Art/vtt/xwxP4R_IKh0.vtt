00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.211
I would like to start
with the very beginning

00:00:02.378 --> 00:00:04.463
about your work in the exhibition

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.726
Mood Disorder,

00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:09.876
and ask you perhaps
to describe the work.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.221
Mood Disorder is an artist book

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:18.143
and it shows basically what happens
when I put a photograph of myself

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
kind of like this

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.775
in this kind of generic stock pose
of what depression would look like,

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:25.558
and I put that
onto the Wikipedia page

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:26.618
for Mood disorder.

00:00:26.778 --> 00:00:29.870
I was kind of playing
these stereotypes

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.095
of how depression looks
in stock imagery.

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.238
That's what influenced me
to make that image.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.951
Websites, journalists,
bloggers began to use it

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.643
because they could legally use
these copyright-free images.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:42.168
They don't have to pay royalties.

00:00:42.418 --> 00:00:45.751
And they began to use it
to illustrate mental health issues,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.010
depression, sadness,
anti-depressant pill articles.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.555
And then what I did was
I used Google reverse image,

00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:58.768
or I took the image
and did the reverse image search

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:02.786
and re-found all of these articles
that had used my image.

00:01:02.938 --> 00:01:06.025
The Mood Disorder piece
is the image in –

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:09.076
I don't like to say circulation
because it's not really.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.280
It's more like propagation.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:13.073
So it's the image
propagating over the internet

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:17.245
maybe changing the black-and-white,
changing color, getting cropped

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:19.331
going into different languages.

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:23.578
Danish, Norwegian, German,
Arabic and Thai I think I found.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.445
And then using Google,

00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:28.923
I collected all of these sites
and then made this artist book.

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:35.090
So what does it mean for an artist
to actually claim ownership

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.806
for something
that is so widely distributed?

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:40.293
I think authorship,
to author a work,

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:45.231
is to kind of delineate an artwork
and say like this is an artwork

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.048
that I'm entering
into a kind of public discourse

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:50.340
on photography or art making.

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:53.191
And it's just a way
of defining an artwork.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:56.700
For me, I don't really believe
in maybe what the author meant

00:01:56.868 --> 00:01:59.695
a hundred years ago,

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.718
that the author is the sole creator,

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:06.626
because lots of people helped
in the production of this work

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:08.510
that aren't being credited.

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:12.668
How do you feel that photography
has changed in the 21st century

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.510
with this further increase

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:19.640
both in the production
but also circulation of images?

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.406
It’s so complicated
because photography is everywhere.

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:29.733
People today almost use photography
to almost perform themselves

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.591
for the public.

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:32.528
So when people are on Instagram
or on Twitter,

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:36.490
the images they make are like
an extension of their sensibility

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.781
that they're sharing
with the worldwide web.

00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:42.371
It's like saying who they are,

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:47.376
which I don't think
that was the case before.

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:48.836
Like for me,
I'm using Wikipedia,

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:52.353
and that's specifically
a copyright-free website,

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:55.301
so these are images
that can freely circulate.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.626
And so in my project,

00:02:56.793 --> 00:03:00.055
I'm playing with that space
of open circulation.

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:03.768
I'm actually participating
with Wikipedia

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:05.728
how like a normal user would.

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:08.021
You upload images,
which I think is relevant.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.815
But in this process

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.106
a lot of Wikipedia editors
caught on to what I was doing,

00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:16.581
and over a course of a few years
there were these discussions,

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:17.895
conversations

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.910
which ended up with me
being officially banned.

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:24.913
And after that ban became official

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.250
the Mood Disorder image was taken off
of the Mood disorder web page

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:31.711
and so it no longer circulates
from Wikipedia

00:03:32.088 --> 00:03:36.968
but it still will circulate
from the internet, hopefully, maybe.
