00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.429
Does your life have purpose, meaning, and
direction?

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:10.639
… Turns out, if you have a reason to live,
you just might live longer!

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.839
Hi Guys, Crystal here back for DNews.

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.830
It seems like we are alway seeing news articles
discussing the connection between mental and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.631
physical health, but researchers at Mount
Sinai Hospital have recently announced that

00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.310
a sense of purpose in our lives can actually
increase longevity.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.849
The research team performed a meta analysis
-- so they didn’t collect their own data--

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.180
but they reviewed 10 studies containing information
from a total of more than 137,000 people.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.520
They found that a strong sense of purpose
reduces deaths from all causes by 23 percent

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.020
and lowers the risk of heart attack by 19
percent.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.370
Researchers defined “purpose” as a self
reported sense of “meaning, direction, and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.330
a feeling that life is worth living.”

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.330
And that could mean different things to different
people - whether it’s spirituality, raising

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.460
a family, having a career you love, or creating
art.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.550
A preventive cardiologist associated with
the study, is quoted as saying: "As part of

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.970
our overall health, each of us needs to ask
ourselves the critical question of 'do I have

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.920
a sense of purpose in my life?'

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.700
If not, you need to work toward the important
goal of obtaining one for your overall well-being."

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.470
So, that’s easy! if you want to live longer,
find a reason to.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.610
Simple right?

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.930
Well … not really.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.870
Besides the task of finding a life’s purpose
being a little more complicated than simply

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.960
deciding to be happy, the impact of mental
health on physical health has greater implications

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.530
than just individual experience and longevity.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.490
According to the Center for Disease Control
(CDC), In 2010, the total costs of cardiovascular

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.240
diseases in the United States were estimated
to be over 400 billion dollars.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.310
Approximately $1 of every $6 spent on health
care in this country is spent treating cardiovascular

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.310
conditions.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.920
As the U.S. population ages, the economic
burden of cardiovascular diseases on our health-care

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.780
system will continue to grow.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.480
A study performed at Harvard University followed
men and women aged 25 to 74 for 20 years,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.560
found that a sense of enthusiasm, of hopefulness,
of engagement in life, and the ability to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.590
face life’s stresses with emotional balance
reduced the risk of coronary heart disease.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.870
And cardiovascular health isn’t the only
health concern impacted by a more fulfilled

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.900
life, similar results have been published
for diabetes, and stroke amongst other things.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.200
Society pays an increasing cost for treatment
of these diseases, and it will be interesting

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.660
to see whether the ever increasing scientific
literature linking mental well-being to reduced

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.280
risk for chronic disease will result in a
shift in emphasis from treating resulting

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.030
conditions to preventative care.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.580
So what gives you purpose in your life?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.310
For one 13-year-old boy, it’s helping the
blind.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.370
Our new sister channel Seeker has a video
about this inspiring teenager, who built a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:55.270
braille printer out 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.819
