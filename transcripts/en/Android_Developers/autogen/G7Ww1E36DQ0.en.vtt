00:00:02.742 --> 00:00:04.630
 For the first time to sign a roll board 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.020
 switch after 6 or 8 months of hard work and see it properly, 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.950
 is the best feeling in the world. 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.440
 2 years ago I and a friend were the first Argentines 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.140
 who won an international robotics competition. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.870
 I felt I had to tell people and help more and more people 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.217
 to involve in robotics. 

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:26.547
 I started traveling through the country and teaching robotics 

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:29.147
 so that the kids can get fantastic tools for the future. 

00:00:29.507 --> 00:00:33.767
 I see how they work with a robot, and they feel like they're just playing, 

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.147
 but they learn how to become incredibly competent. 

00:00:37.147 --> 00:00:40.217
 They think, "I'm too young to do this kind of thing," 

00:00:40.217 --> 00:00:43.297
 but they are not. So when you get this idea 

00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:46.907
 planting them, they become unstoppable. 

00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:50.907
 However, one of my goals is to create a generation of good robot developers, 

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:54.017
 and good competitors that will change the world. 

00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:56.102
 Mateo is also the founder of Â¡Hablalo !, 

00:00:56.102 --> 00:01:00.082
 a program to help deaf and dumb people communicate more easily. 

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:01.232
 Mateo Salvatto. 

00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:02.656
 Robotikakampioen. 

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:03.741
 Program maker. 

00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:05.201
 We celebrate programmers worldwide 

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.351
