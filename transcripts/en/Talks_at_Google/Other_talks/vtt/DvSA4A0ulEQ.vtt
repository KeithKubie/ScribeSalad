[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.530
MICHAEL ROTH: We're going to
talk about five or so thinkers

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.210
that I write about in the book.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.340
And I'll talk for
somewhere between 20 and 25

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.320
minutes or something like that,
maybe a little longer, and then

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.870
see what kinds of questions
you have about education today

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.780
or the argument I'm
making in this book.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:35.000
I think the tradition of liberal
education in the United States

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.550
is a great resource
for the culture

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.720
and economy of the country.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.680
And I argue that
that's a resource that

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.480
began to be cultivated really
in the founding generation

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.940
of the United States, so
with Thomas Jefferson and Ben

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.500
Franklin.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
On the other hand, I
also argue that there's

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.080
nothing incompatible
between liberal education

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.920
and, let's say, massive,
open online classes.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.100
So on the one hand, the
argument is a comfort

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.290
to the traditionalists in
higher education who really want

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.510
to emphasize what they see as
core disciplines that might be

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.390
forgotten in the rush to
practicality or vocational

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.950
education.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.500
On the other hand,
I actually don't

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.240
argue about liberal
arts education, which

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.860
really is about a
set of disciplines.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.710
My approach is from
American pragmatism,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.447
which helps us see that
anything can be taught

00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:40.030
in the framework of
liberal education.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.940
That is, you can have
a skill-based approach

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.640
to teaching, but as long
as that approach includes

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.800
conceptual and contextual
dimensions that

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.100
look at the integrative
dimensions of whatever you're

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.030
learning, its connections
with other things,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.500
then that would qualify,
in this American tradition,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.874
as liberal education, which
is different from the European

00:02:02.874 --> 00:02:05.040
notion of liberal arts,
which really said there were

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.810
certain things you just had to
know if you were well-educated.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.130
You had to read Shakespeare,
or you had to learn Greek.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.340
Or you had to learn
history and literature.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.570
I actually don't think that that
is what liberal education has

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.640
been about in the
United States, which

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.710
has been about useful
knowledge, but useful knowledge

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.510
put in a broad,
contextual framework.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.400
So I'll talk about
it in terms of four

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.290
moments in this tradition.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.890
The first one goes under
the rubric of liberate,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.650
and I'll talk about
Jefferson in that regard.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.000
And a word about a commentator
on the Jeffersonian tradition,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.710
a man named David Walker, a free
black living in Massachusetts

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.100
who wrote an incendiary
document against slavery.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.340
I'll talk about-- the
second beat will be animate,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.580
and I'll talk about Emerson.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.620
The third will be cooperate,
and I'll talk there very quickly

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.145
about Dewey and Jane Addams.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.700
And the fourth
will be instigate.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.470
And I was pretty
proud when I came up

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.930
with these four things that
rhyme, because I'm a historian.

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.070
I don't usually get
to rhyme things.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.190
But the dumb part of this
was that I came up with this

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.330
while I was sitting
waiting to give

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.250
my lecture at the University of
Peking about a year and a half

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.919
ago.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.460
I was trying to
organize my thoughts,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.540
and I said, oh, I'll
have four things,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.650
and they'll be liberate,
animate, cooperate, instigate!

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.220
And I went up there
to deliver it,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.220
and I realized that it was
in simultaneous translation,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.576
and that my translator--
although she was very gifted--

00:03:56.576 --> 00:03:57.950
was not going to
make any attempt

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.050
to find rhyming
words in Chinese.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.920
So you get the benefit
of the Chinese version

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.560
of my book in this framework.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.090
It is interesting to me--
we could talk about it

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.829
in the discussion session--
it is interesting to me

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.519
how liberal education,
although it's

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.370
under enormous pressure
in the United States,

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.440
is attracting adherents
like never before

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.520
in China, in Korea,
in India, where there

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.320
is a great dissatisfaction
with rote education

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.780
and exam-based education, and
a growing interest in what we

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.360
might call liberal education.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.040
So let me say a word about
"liberate" and Thomas

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.930
Jefferson.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.090
So Jefferson writes to his
friend-- or frenemy-- John

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.700
Adams.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.400
He says, ours will be the
follies of enthusiasm.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.810
Ours will be the follies of
enthusiasm, not of bigotry.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.130
So Jefferson
realized that if you

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.570
had an open-ended
educational framework, if you

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.060
let students do what they want,
you're going to get follies.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.640
You're going to get
overly-enthusiastic students.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.250
I am a president
of a university.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.100
I have to deal with things like
fraternities and big parties

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.050
and things like that.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.589
And so I was both
intrigued and depressed

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:23.130
by seeing that Thomas
Jefferson, when

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.713
he started the
University of Virginia,

00:05:24.713 --> 00:05:27.370
was doing the same thing that I
have to do on Monday mornings.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.640
He was dealing with things
like the students were overly

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.670
inebriated over the weekend,
and they were throwing rocks

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.400
at a professor's house.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.430
And so he said, what do I do?

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.420
Do I call the police
in town, or do I

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.750
settle this on the university's
disciplinary sessions itself?

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.319
The same kind of questions,
alas, that many university

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.610
administrators deal with today.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.000
I'm sure you don't have these
problems at Google, even

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.150
in the well-stocked cafeteria.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.990
But for Jefferson, liberate
meant that you got education

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.860
so that you were capable
of autonomous thinking.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.860
Education-- he was an
enlightenment guy-- education

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.830
meant that you were able to
stand on your own two feet,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.380
make autonomous
decisions, and you

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.220
were learning things that
not only made you autonomous

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.520
but gave you the capacity
to act in the world.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:27.320
He was interested in history
and in literature to be sure,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.930
but for Jefferson,
the model of this

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.210
was the sciences, that inquiry
should drive education,

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.450
but inquiry without stifling
questions through predetermined

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.750
organizational frameworks.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.990
That's a clumsy way of saying
something rather simple.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:49.020
He didn't want his educational
system to look like Harvard.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.710
And that's a red thread
through American education.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.420
How can both the
emulation of Harvard

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.360
and the resentment of
it-- Jefferson said,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.820
what happens when
you go to Harvard

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.340
is your parents
tell you-- anybody

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.630
go to Harvard in this room?

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:06.800
Very nice.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.150
Thank you for admitting that.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.930
Jefferson said what happens--
in his day, of course,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.480
the early 1800s-- what
happens when you go to Harvard

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.940
is your parents picked out what
you were going to major in.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.800
Your parents picked
out your slot,

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.710
and so you went to school in
order to assume your fate.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.740
And that was the
opposite, for Jefferson,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.910
of what education should be.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.560
Education should
be the time when

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.950
you discover who
you might become,

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.390
rather than having
to take on the burden

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.480
that your parents
had ascribed to you.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.000
So at the University of Virginia
he said, when you start,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.820
you shouldn't choose your major.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:47.060
You should start with questions,
with inquiry, and over time,

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.640
because you've been liberated
by knowledge, by learning,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.760
over time you choose the thing
you want to learn more about.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.010
You choose the thing you
want to specialize in.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.430
Education will set you free.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.290
And for Jefferson,
it was so important

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.790
because he thought that
the young republic needed

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.042
an educational
system that would tap

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:12.740
in to the natural talents
of an increasing and diverse

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.500
population.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.580
So he worried that what would
happen in education, as it

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.500
had happened in Europe, is
that the rich and powerful

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.319
would have a monopoly
on good education.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:25.610
They would make sure that
only rich and powerful people

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.740
could go to really good schools.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.960
And so Jefferson said-- in a
not politically correct phrase--

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.390
he said, we have
to rake the rubbish

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.690
to find really talented people.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.299
And then the state should
pay for them to go to school.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.304
Financial aid was
absolutely crucial,

00:08:42.304 --> 00:08:44.220
because otherwise, rich
people would make sure

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.469
that only rich people would
go to really good schools.

00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:49.207
It sounds a little bit
familiar, in some ways.

00:08:49.207 --> 00:08:50.540
I mean Williams-- no, I'm sorry.

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:54.470
I have to make
one Williams joke.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.030
It's a Wesleyan tradition.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.714
But that without
financial aid, what

00:09:00.714 --> 00:09:02.380
would happen through
educational systems

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.150
is you would reproduce
social hierarchy.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.060
And Jefferson was
interested in the ways

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.250
that educational
institutions could challenge

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.530
social hierarchy,
allowing people of talent

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.150
but without resources
to get ahead.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.234
Pretty straightforward.

00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:17.650
Now, of course, you all know
that Thomas Jefferson was not

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.170
the most-- well, he was
egalitarian in some respects,

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.020
but also viciously
prejudiced against Africans,

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.170
against Indians
in different ways,

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.100
against women in different ways.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.670
And so although I
want to emphasize

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.580
that Jefferson's enlightenment
view of education as liberation

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.260
is fundamental in
the United States,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.976
it also had many blind spots.

00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:42.350
But what was interesting for
me in researching this book,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.490
because my own work
was in European history

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.490
before I wrote this book
"Beyond the University,"

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.250
is that many people took up
the Jeffersonian tradition

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.970
in their own efforts
to achieve liberation.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.820
David Walker, who writes
just before the Civil War,

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.950
he writes a pamphlet
denouncing Jefferson.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.770
But he denounces Jefferson
in Jeffersonian terms.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.320
In other words,
he says Jefferson

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.660
was right about education.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:08.880
He was right about liberation.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:14.680
But we blacks should take
that message of liberation

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.740
and overthrow the
system of slavery.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.890
David Walker writes, I
don't want any white people

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.650
helping us to get
free from slavery.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.730
I want education to get
us free from slavery.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.900
David Walker, when he published
this, became a marked man.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.127
A price was put on his head.

00:10:30.127 --> 00:10:31.960
People wanted to bring
him back to the South

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.610
so he could be tortured
before he was killed.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.930
But he was-- if you
killed him right away,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.890
you'd be able to
collect a reward.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.660
He didn't get-- he died
of tuberculosis, we think.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.920
But that pamphlet,
which he sewed

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.530
into the clothes of sailors who
were going through the South

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.420
and other itinerant
workers, that pamphlet

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:57.390
was a call to education as
a vehicle for liberation.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.310
Frederick Douglass, writing
just around the time the Second

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.230
World War, he relates
the story of when

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.960
he was a slave-- a young
slave, a kid-- working

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.726
with a pretty, genteel mistress.

00:11:11.726 --> 00:11:13.100
She was teaching
him how to read.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.340
She was teaching him
how to read the Bible.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.410
She said, look at
this little Freddie!

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:17.870
He can read the Bible!

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.980
Showed her husband.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.360
He went crazy.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.570
He said, you can't
let this kid read.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.570
He'll never be fit for slavery.

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.740
And Douglass said,
ding, ding, ding!

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:32.990
That's the Jeffersonian thing.

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.667
If you learn, you are
not going to be a slave.

00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:36.500
You'll be liberated.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.430
You'll be free.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.350
And so Douglass says, look at
all these laws in the South

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.730
that say don't teach
black people to read.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.050
There are no laws saying
don't teach cows to read

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.920
or don't teach dogs to read.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.560
It's because they
know we can read.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.810
They know we are human beings.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:54.220
They know we should
be liberated.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.090
They just pass
laws to oppress us,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.220
Frederick Douglass
writes in the 1840s.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.870
So liberation is part of
this American tradition

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.920
of, or devotion to, education.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.210
Animate, the second
of my four moments--

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.040
I'll be quicker about-- but
it just gives me a chance

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.610
to say a word about-- one of
my heroes in writing this book

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:19.340
is Ralph Waldo Emerson, who is
just an extraordinary writer,

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:23.680
and a really
important philosopher.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.020
Americans don't always think
of him as a philosopher.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.580
He really inspired
Nietzsche's best work,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.450
and is a glorious figure in
American intellectual history.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.785
Emerson, he goes
to visit colleges--

00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:37.460
and I'm afraid it's
Harvard again--

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.620
he goes to visit Harvard.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.700
And he's telling people,
you should get out of here!

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.140
What you're learning
here in college

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.141
is how to conform to society.

00:12:49.141 --> 00:12:51.390
You're not learning to think
aversively, as he put it.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.460
You're not learning to
think against the grain.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.960
You're not learning
to be what you'd

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.580
might call today a contrarian.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.490
What you're learning
is how to fit in.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.530
And Emerson said, no.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.810
Stop learning.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:02.670
That's not learning.

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.590
That's corruption.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.350
What should happen
in college, he says,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.057
is not that you
learned by drilling

00:13:09.057 --> 00:13:10.140
and learned to take tests.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.230
Emerson says what
should happen in college

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.500
is that it should set
your souls aflame.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.020
Set your souls aflame.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.990
And what he talks
about so beautifully,

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.410
in "The American Scholar"
and in "Self-Reliance"

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.670
and in other places-- these
short essays that are just

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.950
glorious works of American
literature-- he says,

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:34.130
what we should learn,
what learning should be is

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:37.530
the process through which we
increase our ability to make

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.844
the world alive for ourselves.

00:13:39.844 --> 00:13:40.760
You know what happens.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.350
You walk out of Google,
down Ninth Avenue.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.210
You go by lots of
things that don't

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:46.480
make any impression on you.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.580
They are kind of
dead to you, right?

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.990
But then, suddenly, something
will make an impression.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:53.870
It's alive for you.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.720
And Emerson said,
what education should

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.030
do is make more of the
world alive for you

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.190
as you move through it.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.380
If you walk around-- everybody
blames Google for this.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:07.470
I don't know if it's true.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.120
And if we walk around
like this, the only things

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.120
that are going to
be alive for you

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.285
are going to be framed
by this little device.

00:14:15.285 --> 00:14:16.410
Now I guess they're bigger.

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:20.670
But for Emerson,
what should happen

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.760
is you should toss to
society and see what's

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:28.010
vital out there in
nature, in art, in music.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.750
And you've all had this
experience, right, sometime

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.020
in your past, maybe in college,
when something that you-- music

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.660
you would have not even known
was music suddenly becomes

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.821
alive for you.

00:14:38.821 --> 00:14:40.570
People who you would
have ignored suddenly

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.170
become interesting to you.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.030
The world becomes
a bigger place.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.530
And Emerson thought that was
part of liberal education.

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.420
Not just liberate, animate.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.000
Make the world more alive.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.970
The third moment in
my four is cooperate.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.390
Because those first two
guys-- Emerson and Jefferson--

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.750
they're very individualistic.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.290
They're guys.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.770
They're really focused
on the individual self,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.890
becoming autonomous
and liberated

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:21.090
or becoming capable of
making the world alive.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:25.540
Towards the end of the 1800s,
through American pragmatism,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.550
there develops another
way of thinking

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.590
that emphasizes
cooperation as part

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.762
of what education
should be about.

00:15:32.762 --> 00:15:34.970
And the figure there that
I write about in the book--

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.095
I write about a few people.

00:15:36.095 --> 00:15:39.040
William James is
very important to me,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.930
and I'll say a word about Dewey.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.170
But Jane Addams is
really key here.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.910
Jane Addams is most
famous in American history

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.480
for founding Hull
House and being

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:55.430
kind of one of the founders of
modern social work, in a way,

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:58.430
working with immigrants
and poor people in Chicago.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.000
But her intersection with
this tradition of education

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.460
is worth spending a
couple of minutes on.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.970
Jane Addams was born a kind
of well-to-do Midwesterner,

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:14.290
wanted to go to college,
wanted to get a real education.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.960
There weren't that many
options for women at that time.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.670
She wanted to go to Smith.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.320
Her dad said, no, too far.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.340
You're too fragile.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.150
Go to a convent school.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.490
So she goes to a convent school.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.939
She's not religious.

00:16:27.939 --> 00:16:30.230
She's not really anti-religious,
but she doesn't really

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.160
feel the vocation.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.800
And so she goes to the school.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.285
She does very well.

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:37.240
And she finishes up.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.940
She's really, really smart.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.200
But her father says, no, I
don't think-- you're a girl.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.780
You don't have to go to
a university or college.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.930
But just around
that time, he dies.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.340
And so there she has this--
and she inherits this money.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.620
She could do what she
wants, one would think.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.310
But since I spent most of
my life working on Freud,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:01.860
I realize that the most
powerful parent is often

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.130
the dead parent, the parent
whose wishes you follow

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.380
even though they're not there.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.599
This is a basic psychoanalytic
tradition or myth or law,

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.010
depending on your
view of such things.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.810
And so Jane Addams,
when her father dies,

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.190
respects his wishes and says
I'm not going to go to college.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.836
But I'm going to
learn in other ways.

00:17:20.836 --> 00:17:21.710
And so she has money.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:22.960
She travels.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.680
She really does educate herself.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.970
She has an entourage
of other women

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.920
who are interested in learning.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.670
And at some point,
she realizes something

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.730
what she calls the
snare of preparation.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.680
And you may see this
among your friends.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.810
Or maybe here at Google,
you may see some of this.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.500
People who learn so many things
that they become less and less

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.700
capable of doing very much.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.440
They kind of get overwhelmed
by what they know.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.470
Yeah, you're laughing.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.380
I guess that you know
people like this.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:59.050
In universities, I've
seen it once or twice.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.004
And so Jane Addams gives
this great example.

00:18:01.004 --> 00:18:02.170
I want to share it with you.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.250
She says she's walking
down the street-- I think

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.690
in London-- she's
walking down the street,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.420
and she sees a guy
hit by a carriage,

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.649
a horse-drawn carriage.

00:18:09.649 --> 00:18:10.440
It knocks him over.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.640
He falls into the street,
and he's in distress.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.280
She immediately thinks
of a poem by De Quincey,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.520
who was thinking about
something in Homer

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.930
that was about the inability
of a person to act in relation

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.200
to someone who needs help.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.710
You see the circuit, right?

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.760
Instead of just saying,
get an ambulance

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.400
or call the cops or what
can I do to help you,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.670
she thinks of a poem about
a poem about the inability

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.790
to call for help.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:44.799
She calls this the
snare of preparation.

00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:45.840
And it's a lovely phrase.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.442
She says, I've lumbered
my mind with literature.

00:18:49.442 --> 00:18:51.660
It's so cluttered.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.590
And what I want to do, she
says, is take what I've learned

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.350
and put it to work in the world.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.290
Preparation can be a
snare if you are never

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.226
really going to act on it.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.950
I guess it's like being
intellectually muscle-bound.

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.210
If you go to the gym,
you see sometimes

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:14.311
people who are so
muscle-bound, all

00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:15.810
you can do is look
at their muscles.

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.360
They're not really
good for anything.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.510
And that happens
intellectually, too.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:22.880
People get intellectually
muscle-bound.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:28.000
And she says that one of the
attributes of this inability

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.760
to act is also an
inability to see things

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.520
from the perspective
of another person.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.020
Jane Addams was very
interested in how

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.770
you can have very
smart people gathered

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:47.550
around a table, gathered
around an issue,

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:53.980
and they seem incapable
of compromise because

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:58.710
of their unwillingness
to sympathetically enter

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:01.700
into the way of thinking
of another person.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.650
She calls the talent
for overcoming

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.220
this sympathetic interpretation.

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.417
You probably know people
who are very good at this.

00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:16.250
If you go to a meeting
and people are really

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.130
arguing about
something, like what's

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:20.650
a tactic they're going
to use, sometimes there's

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.280
a person in the room
who is able to say,

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.527
if we do some of this and
some of that, you have

00:20:25.527 --> 00:20:27.610
a point in this way, you
have a point in that way.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.820
And they're not
merely fudging it.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.670
They're actually
advancing the conversation

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.490
into action that
will be productive.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.750
What Jane Addams worries
about in universities

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.640
is that we sometimes
show how smart we

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.540
are by showing how
intransigent we can be,

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.170
how we get stuck in
our own perspective,

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.920
and that, instead, she looks
for a kind of intelligence that

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.830
would be exemplified in
our ability to see things

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.620
from someone else's perspective.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:05.550
Cooperation as an important
vehicle of real education.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:10.020
William James, who was a fan
of Addams's-- and they were

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.100
in a mutual admiration
society, I guess--

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.570
William James talks about
this as overcoming a certain

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:17.960
blindness.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.470
He wrote an essay
based on a lecture

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.080
he gave to teachers called
"Overcoming a Certain Blindness

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.840
in Human Beings," where he
says-- he tells a story.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.400
He's being shown some
settlements in North Carolina

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.520
out in the woods.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.680
And he's looking at
these settlements

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.200
where the people have just kind
of chopped down the forest,

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.460
and they're burning
and making clearings.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.270
And his driver is going along,
and James is like, oh god,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.915
this is horrible.

00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:50.040
What happened to the
beautiful nature in the woods?

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.240
And then the driver turns to
him and says, isn't this great?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.740
Can you see what
we've accomplished?

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:55.910
We've created homes.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.530
We've created farms.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.970
And James suddenly
realizes that he's

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.759
been blind to what
this driver sees.

00:22:03.759 --> 00:22:06.050
And just like, he says, if
the driver came to Cambridge

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.590
and saw William James sitting
in his room reading his book,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.339
studying, he would
say, oh, that poor guy.

00:22:10.339 --> 00:22:12.580
He must be being punished.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.230
He'd be blind to
James's reality.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.540
So James says, as
teachers, how do we

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.740
enter into someone
else's reality?

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:22.460
How do we overcome
blindness so that we

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.170
can engage in cooperation?

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:31.010
So we've gone from autonomy
and liberation in Jefferson

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:34.850
to animation, making the
world more of an alive

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.580
place, in Emerson,
and cooperation

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.130
in Jane Addams and James.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:49.650
And now for the last
word, instigate, I

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:54.000
want to use, as a
bridge, John Dewey.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.210
And I end with Richard Rorty,
who some of you may have known.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.610
He was a philosopher at
Princeton and Stanford

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:06.850
and UVA, a teacher of mine
when I was at Princeton.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.130
What Dewey said--
Dewey read Jane

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.420
Addams with great
admiration and affection,

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.330
and Dewey thought we should be
emphasizing not just autonomy,

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.980
we should be emphasizing
interdependence.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.110
Dewey would not be surprised
by network theory today.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.930
For Dewey, the
search for autonomy

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.170
was a kind of
American pathology,

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.740
that what we should be
searching for and exploiting

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.840
is greater interdependence,
because that's

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.050
where great things happen.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:40.610
And Dewey emphasized that
education should always

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:44.910
be dealing with the
problems of human beings.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.710
It should never retreat
from the social, political,

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.770
and scientific spheres
into esoterism,

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:58.110
because that was a failure of
connecting ideas to action.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.110
And for Dewey, as a
pragmatist, the only reason

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:06.250
to learn new ideas was to
create new habits of action.

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.360
That is a fundamental
pragmatist principle,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.700
that what we learn when we learn
new ideas are habits of action

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.920
and that habits
of action are what

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.240
make us more liberated,
more able to animate.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.080
It's all about
activity in the world,

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:27.880
and not just about
accumulating facts.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.330
Dewey here is, in some
ways, echoing Ben Franklin,

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.780
who bemoaned the
state of education

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:35.775
in the late 18th century.

00:24:35.775 --> 00:24:37.900
Franklin said, all you
learn at these fancy schools

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.450
is how to exit a
drawing room properly.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.870
You learn how to
put on your tie.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:45.820
That's all you learn at these
fancy schools, Franklin said.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:50.572
But Franklin said-- not like our
Silicon Valley friends today--

00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:52.530
Franklin didn't say, like
those guys say today,

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:53.850
don't go to school.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.360
Just learn how to code.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.500
Don't go to school.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.180
Just learn how to make an app.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:24:59.360
Don't go to school.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.630
Just learn how to do a startup.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:02.550
He didn't say that.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.510
Franklin said, don't go to
a school where all you learn

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.670
is how to drop names
and recite facts.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.580
Let's start a reading school.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.920
Let's start a science club.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.180
Let's start an
educational project

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.710
that will broaden us
and not narrow us.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.010
Broadening rather than narrowing
is the key to this tradition,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:27.120
and Dewey picks up on that.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.550
Broadening-- so a
problem in philosophy

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.820
is a problem for human beings
and not just for philosophers.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.340
A problem in history
is a human problem

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.610
that is informed through
historical study,

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.570
not just some facts you
learned so you could recite

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.390
to impress your friends
or your teachers.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.000
And so that move
towards human problems,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.500
towards social issues, ends me
up with this term, instigate,

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:00.660
that Richard Rorty used to
talk about higher education.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:05.190
He said, what higher education
should be mostly about

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.180
is giving us a
capacity to challenge

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:11.690
the prevailing consensus
to instigate change.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.770
Rorty was rigorously
anti-consensus.

00:26:20.339 --> 00:26:21.880
I remember when E.O.
Wilson published

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.963
this very popular book
called "Consilience," which

00:26:23.963 --> 00:26:27.020
is about how all science and
humanities can come together

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.390
into a happy harmony.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.390
Rorty said, harmony, bah humbug.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.010
You don't get progress
through harmony.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.420
You get progress by
challenging consensus and then

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.870
necessitating new
modes of cooperation

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:43.510
to build a new consensus that
someone else will challenge.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.210
You don't want consensus.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.840
You want challenge, inquiry.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.360
You want to instigate change.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.540
Science and the humanities
are about challenging

00:26:55.540 --> 00:27:02.120
the prevailing wisdom through
inquiry, instigating change.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.450
And so this liberal tradition of
education in the United States

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:12.480
is pragmatic because it is not
about acquiring a set of facts.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.500
It is not about assuming a role
that your parents or someone

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.110
else has set up for you.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:22.660
It is not about
supporting the status quo.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.420
Liberal education
in the United States

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:31.770
has been about increasing our
ability to stand on our feet,

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.500
work with other people,
animate the world,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.580
challenge the
prevailing consensus,

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:42.400
because that is how
innovation and positive change

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.700
can take place.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.830
Today, that tradition
is under great pressure.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.550
As I'm sure you know, I
published a little piece

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.660
earlier this fall
in "The Daily Beast"

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.800
called "How to Destroy American
Higher Education," which

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.660
is about the retreat from
this tradition towards only

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.850
technical fields, and
especially for only

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.990
some people who only
need to know one thing.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.780
I think that is going to
result in the impoverishment

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.320
of American thinking
and diminishing

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.740
our capacity for innovation.

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.080
It is true that liberal
education shouldn't

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.490
be about the same things
that would have been taught

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.860
100 years ago or 50
years ago, for sure.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.040
But it should still be, at
least in my hopeful view,

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.450
it should still be about
challenging the prevailing

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:41.210
consensus through
cooperation, liberation,

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.730
and making the world
more vital, animating it

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:47.400
for ourselves and for
the people around us.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.710
So thank you very much.

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.700
I'm happy to take
questions if-- questions?

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.769
You've been so attentive.

00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:55.269
Yes?

00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:59.616
AUDIENCE: Could you relate
the early years of education

00:28:59.616 --> 00:29:03.238
by Jefferson, et
cetera-- correct me

00:29:03.238 --> 00:29:05.378
if I'm mistaken in
my understanding,

00:29:05.378 --> 00:29:07.550
but a lot of
education at that time

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.817
was geared to preparing you
for the law or the clergy.

00:29:11.817 --> 00:29:12.650
MICHAEL ROTH: Right.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:13.700
That's a great question.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:18.460
So Jefferson was
rigorously anti-religion.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.080
And so when he founded UVA,
he wouldn't let any chapels

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.230
on the campus,
and he didn't have

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:26.930
a place for the study
of religion at all.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:31.576
So for Jefferson, when I say
he rejected the model that you

00:29:31.576 --> 00:29:33.700
know what you're going to
study when you get there,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.976
it was both-- either
it be a minister

00:29:36.976 --> 00:29:39.190
or a judge or a lawyer.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:45.052
And so for him, it was
inquiry-based education,

00:29:45.052 --> 00:29:47.510
which meant you couldn't know
what you were going to do yet

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:50.160
because you didn't
start the inquiry yet.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.580
And that meant
being open to what

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:55.300
he called all forms
of useful knowledge.

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:01.360
And so he was very interested
in astronomy, in agriculture,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.180
in investigations
of the natural world

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.610
and in politics, that would
result in further inquiry

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.460
and different kinds
of work after you

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.490
had finished your studies.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.700
So that was against
the grain, for sure,

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.894
of higher education as it
was practiced in New England.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:28.710
Yes.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:31.470
AUDIENCE: So how do you
think that universities

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.540
are doing with regard to
these four philosophies?

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.745
How do you think Wesleyan,
the institution that you lead,

00:30:36.745 --> 00:30:37.294
is doing?

00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:38.710
Are these philosophies
prevailing?

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.819
And how learning offerings
are constructed, developed--

00:30:43.819 --> 00:30:45.110
MICHAEL ROTH: Absolutely, yeah.

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:53.450
I think that at a
place like Wesleyan,

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.930
these four things
are very strong.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:01.220
I think they are unevenly
distributed across the campus.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:06.992
So for example,
cooperation, which we all

00:31:06.992 --> 00:31:09.450
know is such an important part
of the work people are going

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.050
to do after they
leave the university,

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:15.570
is probably not as prominent at
Wesleyan and a lot of schools

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.590
as it should be.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:19.210
I teach history and
philosophy classes.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.690
And I give you an assignment.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.590
You write a paper.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.130
I get it.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.909
I give you brilliant comments.

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:25.700
But I give it back to
you, and that's that.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.900
No one else sees them.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:30.330
And people aren't
working enough in teams.

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.830
People aren't learning
the skills of cooperation

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.970
as much as they can.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.560
There's more of that at
Wesleyan than there was before,

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.967
but there could be a lot more.

00:31:39.967 --> 00:31:41.800
In the sciences, of
course, you do have that

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.966
because people work in labs.

00:31:42.966 --> 00:31:45.160
And so they do work in teams.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.900
And we find more
and more the desire

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.350
of students to work in
concert with one another.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:52.670
So what are the challenges?

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.190
It's kind of a dumb example,
but it's an easy one.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.920
So I teach a class with a
hundred some odd students now

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.890
on film and philosophy.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:05.240
And at times, especially
if I'm droning on too long,

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.180
I'll say, OK, we're
going to get into groups.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.700
I want you to come
up with an answer

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.800
to the following question.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.001
So everybody can talk,
and the chairs don't move.

00:32:13.001 --> 00:32:15.250
They're all geared to everybody
sitting there watching

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.370
the professor, which gives
me a narcissistic thrill

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:18.980
twice a week.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.810
But it's not great
for education.

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:25.230
You'd want more of that mixture.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.660
We are creating
MakerSpaces now, where--

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.280
there's a strong
desire of students

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.260
at a place like Wesleyan
to immediately start

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.670
thinking what I can build
with what I'm learning.

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:36.920
That could be an organization.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.295
That could be a
computer program.

00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:39.930
That could be an object.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.860
And I think that's a very--
I find that exciting, given

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.950
the pragmatist views that
I've been describing to you.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.460
I think a lot of schools
now are trying to figure out

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.980
how they can maintain this
tradition while also answering

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.180
the anxiety that a lot
of students and parents

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.760
have about what are they going
to do when they graduate.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.220
In the book I say, in this
book "Behind the University,"

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.974
I tell the story that--
when I was a kid,

00:33:07.974 --> 00:33:09.390
the movie "The
Graduate" came out.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.922
Has anybody seen "The Graduate"?

00:33:10.922 --> 00:33:11.880
Some of you've seen it?

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.714
Oh, OK, so some of
you have seen it.

00:33:14.714 --> 00:33:16.630
In the early part of the
movie, Dustin Hoffman

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.020
is the main character
in the film.

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.311
He was a young guy at the time.

00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:21.470
He's, I guess,
graduated from college.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:28.640
He's confronted by I think it's
his uncle, and his uncle goes,

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.100
I got one word for you.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.250
Plastics.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.750
Plastics!

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.143
And he'd say, uh-huh.

00:33:33.143 --> 00:33:34.110
Uh-huh.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.100
So today, it would be apps.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.470
Or, I don't know, startups.

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.580
But when that movie came out,
everybody who saw that scene

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.200
laughed at this
idiot who was a jerk.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.960
He was an old fart jerk.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.130
You laughed at him.

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.380
Today, people would
say, oh, really?

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.490
OK, apps.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.830
That's the feeling I get, that
today people are so worried

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.260
about-- and there's good
reason for you to worry--

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:03.840
about their economic
prospects, that they're

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.470
looking for great shortcuts,
which may actually

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.380
tend to undermine
their abilities

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.830
in the economic sphere.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.110
So schools are trying
to do a lot more

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.520
to show how you can translate
what you're learning

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.980
on campus to what
you're going to do next.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.380
I think that's a good thing.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.699
I think the good thing is
that people shouldn't just

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:26.060
go to college as an
interruption in their life,

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.050
like I want to have
three or four great years

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:29.780
and then I go do other stuff.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.900
College-- one of my
predecessors said,

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.620
if these are the best
four years of your lives,

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.580
we will have failed
you, because I

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.080
don't want you just
to be nostalgic.

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.560
I want you to say I'm
using my education.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.344
And we, as professors
at colleges,

00:34:45.344 --> 00:34:47.010
should actually help
students figure out

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:49.442
how they're going to translate
the theoretical computer

00:34:49.442 --> 00:34:51.150
science that we teach
at Wesleyan to what

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.739
they might do next.

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:54.850
Not just skip the
theory, but to always

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:57.010
be thinking about can
you translate this

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:58.148
into other [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:58.148 --> 00:34:58.648
Yeah?

00:34:58.648 --> 00:35:00.624
AUDIENCE: I had a
followup question.

00:35:00.624 --> 00:35:03.588
So I went to University of
Michigan [? with a major in ?]

00:35:03.588 --> 00:35:06.058
political science and a minor
in Latin American studies.

00:35:06.058 --> 00:35:09.516
No plan, really, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:09.516 --> 00:35:15.938
And I, luckily, have ended
up at a great company working

00:35:15.938 --> 00:35:19.396
in marketing, but I have a
much younger step-sister.

00:35:19.396 --> 00:35:20.878
And she's in middle school now.

00:35:20.878 --> 00:35:24.235
And when she talks to me about
what she might want to do,

00:35:24.235 --> 00:35:25.818
I have a very hard
time reconciling it

00:35:25.818 --> 00:35:27.546
with the experience
I had and the love

00:35:27.546 --> 00:35:30.280
I had for learning sort of
for the sake of learning,

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.010
with a recommendation
for her, because it

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:36.420
seems so impractical to me now--

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.280
MICHAEL ROTH: You're
an old fogey now, huh?

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.210
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:42.700
And so but my question
is more-- in Europe,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.980
you see kids going
off to college

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.050
who seem a bit more
prepared, with experience

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.466
or a sort of
practical internship,

00:35:49.466 --> 00:35:51.341
and things that they've
done to explore maybe

00:35:51.341 --> 00:35:53.948
a little bit earlier what they
might want to do, it seems.

00:35:53.948 --> 00:35:55.774
Versus, in the US,
you kind of get there

00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:57.434
and you have your two years
to try and figure it out

00:35:57.434 --> 00:35:58.928
before you declare your major.

00:35:58.928 --> 00:36:00.754
And I'm just wondering,
is there a way

00:36:00.754 --> 00:36:02.754
we could do something
better before you actually

00:36:02.754 --> 00:36:06.232
get to college to help prepare
kids to think about what they

00:36:06.232 --> 00:36:09.386
could do afterwards, even
if they decide [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:09.386 --> 00:36:10.690
more liberal arts major?

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.190
MICHAEL ROTH: It's
a great question.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:17.650
I do think the European
model does really

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.890
decide-- people have
to decide what they're

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.850
going to do with their
lives very early.

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:33.130
And some people, they're just
not going to get the education.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.310
So I think about this a lot.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:40.360
When I was finishing
college in 1978,

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.235
the job market was
far worse, I think,

00:36:43.235 --> 00:36:45.130
than it is today actually.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.410
And my parents
didn't go to college.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.940
They found this whole thing
kind of very befuddling,

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.600
that I was studying
philosophy and history.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.770
And I told my dad, who was
a farrier, that I wanted

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.135
to go to graduate
school, I thought.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.710
But I was worried because I
didn't know any professors that

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.010
weren't my own teachers.

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:09.140
So what are you
going to do with it?

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.240
And my professor
said, there's no way

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.250
you should go to
graduate school thinking

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:13.833
you're going to get
a job in academia.

00:37:13.833 --> 00:37:14.850
There were no jobs.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:16.550
And so you can go for education.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.480
If you get a
fellowship, it's OK.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.840
But don't think
you can get a job.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.350
So I remember
telling my dad this.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.516
And he said to me, well,
you know how to make money.

00:37:24.516 --> 00:37:26.120
I washed dishes in college.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.130
I had an uncle who
was a cab driver.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:30.070
You see, I've got connections.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.720
And so he said,
if you don't try,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.990
you're always going to wonder,
what did you really love to do?

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.425
And if it doesn't work,
you'll figure it out.

00:37:40.425 --> 00:37:41.925
You'll figure out
how to make money.

00:37:41.925 --> 00:37:44.290
Now I thought--
in retrospect, I'm

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.510
thinking to myself, my god,
what a brave thing to say.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.760
It was so liberating as a kid.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.676
I asked him about this
at the end of his life.

00:37:50.676 --> 00:37:52.530
He said, I don't remember
telling you that.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.470
That's the kind of guy he was.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.094
He was like, I wouldn't
have said that!

00:37:55.094 --> 00:37:57.360
He was a tough guy.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.080
And I think part of the
answer is economics,

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.450
that America is a much
more unequal place

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:04.340
today than it was when
I was leaving college.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.090
And so there is
a legitimate fear

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:11.220
that, if you don't make it,
you are really in dire straits,

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.670
rather than being in this
middle range, which is eroded.

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.420
But I think it's also that
people-- my parents expected

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.360
I might have to struggle.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.670
A lot of the parents I
talk to, they-- their kids

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.130
have never had to struggle.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.360
And they don't want them to
start struggling after college.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.180
And they want more certainty.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.209
And I don't know.

00:38:33.209 --> 00:38:35.250
A lot of you probably
majored in computer science

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.250
or other things that were
related to what you're

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.980
doing now, but a lot
of you may not have.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:45.300
And I think the ability
to explore new things

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.760
has enriched what we wind up
doing in such dramatic ways

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.410
in this country for such a
long time, that to cut that off

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.410
and think that we are going to
be more successful if we have

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:58.080
more specialization,
I think is a mistake.

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.630
I think what we'll
have are specialists

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.970
who become obsolete
more quickly,

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.870
and we will have less
intellectual resources

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:10.696
to draw upon for
creative change.

00:39:10.696 --> 00:39:12.133
AUDIENCE: Doesn't it-- sorry.

00:39:12.133 --> 00:39:13.466
A really quick followup to that.

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:17.402
So how do you think maybe
certain institutional faculty

00:39:17.402 --> 00:39:18.839
needs to change
and support that?

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:20.540
Because student
debt, for example,

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:24.201
is a very scary thing now.

00:39:24.201 --> 00:39:27.079
I think interest rates have
gone up-- well, not all of them.

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:28.370
MICHAEL ROTH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.711
Student debt is scary
even without-- yeah, yeah.

00:39:30.711 --> 00:39:31.210
Absolutely.

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.656
AUDIENCE: So I wonder
how-- what needs

00:39:34.656 --> 00:39:37.639
to happen so that kids can
feel more secure taking over.

00:39:37.639 --> 00:39:38.430
MICHAEL ROTH: Yeah.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:39.430
That's a great question.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.500
And that's the onuses
on schools like mine,

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.670
which becomes so darn expensive.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.950
So we have a lot more
low-income students at Wesleyan

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:50.852
than we did 20 years
ago or 15 years ago.

00:39:50.852 --> 00:39:52.560
And we have a lot of
very wealthy people,

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.590
but the middle ground is
eroded, because if you're not

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.610
poor enough to get
a big scholarship,

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:02.900
you may also not be rich
enough to afford to go.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:07.580
And so we need colleges
and universities

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.180
to find ways to contain costs.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.072
And we've been doing
that at Wesleyan

00:40:12.072 --> 00:40:13.030
for the last few years.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.920
And I think a lot
of schools, it would

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.650
be in their interest to do that.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.880
But part of the answer is also
that the state and governments

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.120
have massively retreated from
supporting education, making

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.620
it a lot more expensive
for a lot more people.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:33.082
And I think that's
unconscionable.

00:40:33.082 --> 00:40:36.840
And that's a political decision,
to spend money on other things

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.440
and not on education.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.270
And I think some of this
call for vocationalism

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:46.510
is coming from people who have
made it impossible for folks

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:49.457
to go to community colleges and
to state universities, which

00:40:49.457 --> 00:40:50.790
have become much more expensive.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:53.190
The growth in fees
at state universities

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:55.870
far outpaces the privates.

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:57.950
And the student debt is
also driven, of course,

00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:59.510
by a lot of for-profit
institutions

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.426
that have no intention
of graduating students,

00:41:01.426 --> 00:41:03.160
but they can just claim tuition.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:05.201
So there are things that
the government could do.

00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:07.130
There are things
that schools can do.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.552
The reason I taught
these MOOCs is

00:41:08.552 --> 00:41:11.010
because I wanted to see if you
could do something much more

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:11.585
efficiently.

00:41:11.585 --> 00:41:13.210
It wouldn't be the
same as just meeting

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:15.970
with a group like this size
and having the conversation.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:20.720
But I've taught 150,000
people in the last two years

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:23.530
online, as opposed
to the hundred--

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.889
my big, massive class
at Wesleyan is 100 kids.

00:41:26.889 --> 00:41:28.930
And I think that's a very
interesting experience.

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:31.220
It's not the answer to
all of these things,

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.690
but experimentation
and scale will help us,

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.990
I think, make the investment
in education less risky

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:40.650
for students.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:41.210
Yes.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.850
One, two.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.642
OK.

00:41:43.642 --> 00:41:46.606
AUDIENCE: So I'm a huge
liberal arts proponent.

00:41:46.606 --> 00:41:49.570
I went to a liberal arts
school, and every time

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.710
I just think, especially
in the computer age,

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.856
it is completely
an essential part

00:41:54.856 --> 00:41:57.960
about just becoming
a better human being.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:01.879
But I have seen
the reality of-- I

00:42:01.879 --> 00:42:05.116
guess it's not to say that--
I have seen the reality

00:42:05.116 --> 00:42:08.602
that, because of internet,
because of Google,

00:42:08.602 --> 00:42:10.096
data is available everywhere.

00:42:10.096 --> 00:42:10.594
MICHAEL ROTH: Yeah.

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.802
AUDIENCE: So what that means
is that specialization--

00:42:12.802 --> 00:42:14.578
or commitment, shall we say?

00:42:14.578 --> 00:42:16.570
Rather than
specialization, commitment

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:20.272
becomes really important, even
for a very liberal arts person.

00:42:20.272 --> 00:42:21.098
MICHAEL ROTH: Yeah.

00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:23.966
AUDIENCE: I want to be
a better human being.

00:42:23.966 --> 00:42:25.491
There's a lot of
other stuff that

00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:27.340
can help me make
decisions, but I also

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:31.298
want to be going
into new territories

00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:35.533
and exploring new things within
that field, because you want

00:42:35.533 --> 00:42:37.844
to be actually contributing,
rather than just talking.

00:42:37.844 --> 00:42:38.885
MICHAEL ROTH: Absolutely.

00:42:38.885 --> 00:42:40.664
AUDIENCE: Like if you want
to join the [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:40.664 --> 00:42:42.128
you have to be very specialized.

00:42:42.128 --> 00:42:44.144
If you want to actually
make a difference,

00:42:44.144 --> 00:42:45.838
you have to know
your stuff, which

00:42:45.838 --> 00:42:49.810
is why-- as a result
of this data, internet,

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.130
and world coming
closer together.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:57.080
So have you seen very
specific initiatives

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:02.525
that your university or other
college leadership teams

00:43:02.525 --> 00:43:06.630
have done to kind of help
the liberal arts tradition,

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:10.422
but specifically really
work towards people

00:43:10.422 --> 00:43:13.199
who are a little bit
more better prepared?

00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:14.240
MICHAEL ROTH: Absolutely.

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.050
I think a lot of schools--
and this won't be a surprise

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.660
to you-- have responded to
student demand for internships,

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.210
for example.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.064
So they start very
early figuring out

00:43:23.064 --> 00:43:25.480
if they can translate what
they're doing on campus to what

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.771
they're going to do off-campus.

00:43:26.771 --> 00:43:31.950
This is good for businesses
that get inexpensive labor,

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.510
in some cases.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.740
And I must say, I
resisted it for a while,

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.570
because I thought they should
be paid a decent wage--

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.730
and some companies do-- but
I see that students really

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.160
want-- even though they
want that broader education,

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:49.850
they want the capacity to
connect it to other things.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:53.050
That desire to connect, I think,
is part of this tradition,

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.870
and can be very important.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:59.210
Specialization within a
liberal learning tradition

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:00.800
is important.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.980
In other words,
you don't want just

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.280
to be a jack of all trades
and master of none, right?

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:12.360
It takes real skills to do work
in any variety of fields today.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.920
And that may be language skills.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.360
That may be technical skills.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.560
That may be experience
over long periods of time.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:26.380
And so I think our colleges
and universities are aware

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.340
that, while you're
giving people breadth,

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.010
you also have to
give them skills

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:31.964
so that they can
continue to learn.

00:44:31.964 --> 00:44:33.880
The point of this book
"Beyond the University"

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:37.130
is that the university
should give you the ability

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:41.500
to keep learning, and not
just a smattering of things,

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:43.780
but habits of mind
and spirit that

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.620
keep you learning so
that you can go deeper

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.470
into subject areas and not
just scatter across them.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.065
Yeah.

00:44:52.065 --> 00:44:55.160
AUDIENCE: So to continue along
the line of thinking in regards

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:02.490
to, I guess, placing the
burden of financial pressure

00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.610
on parents of students
who are worried

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:08.660
of the economic realities
the students will face

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.130
after college-- how
do you negotiate

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:15.020
that ideal with the
financial realities

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.784
that the university encounters
on a day-to-day basis?

00:45:17.784 --> 00:45:19.450
MICHAEL ROTH: Well,
I'm going to ask you

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.025
all for money before you leave.

00:45:21.025 --> 00:45:21.524
No.

00:45:24.334 --> 00:45:25.250
It's a great question.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.680
I mean, I'm in New
York for fundraising.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:33.170
After I leave today, I'm going
to a fundraising campaign

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.830
meeting for Wesleyan.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.190
And most of the money we
raise is for financial aid.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.540
So it just is kind
of straightforward

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.950
economic-- we depend for about--
more than 2/3 of our revenue

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:50.000
comes from tuition.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.981
We would be able to do a
lot more if we depended less

00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:55.480
on tuition.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.870
We would have greater access
and more research opportunities.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:00.600
That's just to take two things.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:06.730
And so one of the
things that I think

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:10.510
can be very dangerous for
American institutions is,

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:13.850
in the search for
good, strong tuition

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:15.830
dollars and good,
strong donations,

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.280
to just cater to the wealthy.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.299
And Wesleyan has
this long tradition

00:46:20.299 --> 00:46:22.590
that even the wealthy people
who come to Wesleyan, they

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.381
don't want to be among
only wealthy people.

00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:26.960
They realize that, for
them, that's not going to--

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.660
they didn't want to
join a social club.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.080
They want to join
a diverse community

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.890
where they'll learn from
different kinds of people.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.590
And so the pressures
at places like Wesleyan

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:41.840
is to balance access
and the investment

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.390
in high-quality programs,
because most of our budget

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.460
is going to compensation.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.515
And teachers are
certainly not overpaid

00:46:52.515 --> 00:46:54.520
at a place like Wesleyan.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.420
And they work best when
they work in small groups

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.690
with students.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.730
That's expensive.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.000
How to combine that
with, let's say,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.360
the ability to do
deliver lectures online.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:09.130
I mean, I do think,
before too long, no one

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:12.910
will have lecture classes at an
expensive school like Wesleyan.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:14.471
All of that will
be done elsewhere.

00:47:14.471 --> 00:47:16.970
And then when you're there, you
really are working in teams.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.344
You're working in small groups.

00:47:18.344 --> 00:47:19.760
You're getting the
most out of it.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.530
There are efficiencies
we will gain.

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.050
At Wesleyan, we
started-- and you

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:28.130
may remember this--
we started showing

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:31.280
how you can get a three-year
diploma with the same number

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.240
of credits and then save
20% off your total tuition.

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:37.940
I did that when I
was a student to save

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.570
my grumpy dad some money.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.660
And he was unimpressed.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:47.370
But most students don't
take advantage of it,

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.560
even though it really is a
great economic-- it's not

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.245
that hard intellectually.

00:47:50.245 --> 00:47:52.830
You just work in the summer a
little bit, and in the winter.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.290
But people really
love being there.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:59.090
So we are-- I'm trying
to create more avenues

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:01.690
for more efficient education
that doesn't sacrifice

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:05.370
the breadth of the education,
but more access points that

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:09.462
will be more efficient
and cost-effective.

00:48:09.462 --> 00:48:10.587
Was there a hand back here?

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:12.572
No?

00:48:12.572 --> 00:48:13.072
Yes.

00:48:13.072 --> 00:48:14.066
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:28.976 --> 00:48:35.931
We had some [INAUDIBLE]
learning [INAUDIBLE] And many

00:48:35.931 --> 00:48:36.431
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.420
MICHAEL ROTH: You need
scaffolding, right?

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.128
To build something,
you need scaffolding,

00:48:53.128 --> 00:48:57.320
and memory work is a really
important scaffolding for this.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.840
So if I sounded like I was
saying no rote learning,

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:07.830
I misspoke, because there is
a dimension of just exercising

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:10.380
these faculties
that is key, just

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.775
like when you're learning
to play the piano.

00:49:12.775 --> 00:49:14.150
I think, as
Thelonious Monk said,

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.010
there are no wrong
notes on the piano.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:18.837
But that may be good when
you're Thelonious Monk,

00:49:18.837 --> 00:49:20.670
but when you want to
learn how to do scales,

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:21.860
you want to learn
to do theory, there

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:23.276
are things you
just have to learn.

00:49:23.276 --> 00:49:25.180
Muscle memory,
mental muscle memory,

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.574
that's really important.

00:49:26.574 --> 00:49:28.240
I don't know how
you'll feel about this,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.680
but just last night I read
this article in "The Atlantic"

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.930
mobile that says, "Is
Google Making Us Stupid?"

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.910
This is not the first time
this title has been used.

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:38.170
But it's about this.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.130
The article is about people
who use GPS all the time get

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.690
lost in their own bathroom
kind of thing, right?

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.660
And people who just
use calculators,

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.602
they don't even understand
what multiplication is,

00:49:51.602 --> 00:49:52.560
let alone how to do it.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.880
And so the ways in
which our machines

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.020
replace the exercise
of our faculties,

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:02.740
this article is pointing
at, is dangerous.

00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.410
So obviously, you don't want
to throw away the machines,

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:09.090
but you want to use them in a
way that enhances your capacity

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:12.310
rather than replaces
your capacity.

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:14.770
That's the sweet spot.

00:50:21.676 --> 00:50:23.050
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:24.300
It was great to talk with you.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.266
