&gt;&gt;Peggy: The teacher doesn't just
throw control to the students

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:08.436
and say, "Let me know
what you figure out."

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:11.856
She really has to plan ahead of
time, she has to figure out how

00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:14.406
to group the students so that
they're the most productive.

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:18.856
She has to scaffold their work,
so she provides hints or clues

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:21.236
or templates, worksheets
is necessary,

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:24.466
to kinda show them what
they need to do first,

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.216
what they might consider doing next.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.966
She has to teach them
how to work together.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.046
Teamwork is not something
that comes naturally,

00:00:30.416 --> 00:00:31.746
especially for younger students.

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:33.856
They really need to
learn how to do that.

00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:38.356
&gt;&gt;Sheela: So we would have a
anchor or a set of expectations

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:42.916
about what kind of language
would be used, what the roles

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:46.096
and responsibilities are for
each person in that group.

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:51.336
And what are the processes for asking
further questions or clarification?

00:00:51.406 --> 00:00:54.106
&gt;&gt;Student: So you start with one
trail mix and give out stickers.

00:00:54.336 --> 00:00:56.216
I'll do two trail mixes.

00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:58.836
Bryce does the questions and
then you do the other things.

00:00:58.836 --> 00:01:00.186
&gt;&gt;Student: I do the
sticker charge thing.

00:01:00.656 --> 00:01:03.746
&gt;&gt;Liza: So when students are working
on projects in different groups,

00:01:04.186 --> 00:01:06.576
it's difficult to get
to all of them at once,

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:08.636
and they may really need you.

00:01:08.696 --> 00:01:12.306
So my first strategy for
that is teaching a child how

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:15.456
to use each other, teaching
them how to talk to one another,

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:17.426
and so here we call
it accountable talk.

00:01:17.806 --> 00:01:20.586
So what are ways that you talk
with each other when you disagree?

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:24.116
How do you do that in a respectful
manner, to continue to collaborate

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.996
with each other and
keep the project moving?

00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:29.426
Also, I do a lot of
tabletop directions,

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:33.056
if I have short directions that they
need to get through or a checklist

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:36.576
or an agenda, they have to get
through so many things by the end

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:39.346
of the day or the end of the week,
instead of raising their hand

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.516
and asking me and I have
to run back and forth,

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:42.856
it's right there in front of them.

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:43.646
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, that makes sense.

00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what's this
lake potentially used for?

00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:47.556
&gt;&gt;Sheela: So it's really
the art of facilitation.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.646
The teacher would not be at the front
of the room directing instruction,

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:56.366
but instead she is
choreographing instruction.

00:01:56.636 --> 00:02:00.686
So she's like a conductor and she
would go to all the different tables

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:06.246
and groups to ensure that each
group is working in harmony

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:10.006
to achieve that goal at the end.
