00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Welcome to the Android Developer
Office Hours.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
[someone whistles]

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.680
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We are your Android EMEA Developer
Relations team.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.170
I'm Sparky in Munich, Germany.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.650
I'm also joined by Matt and Rich and Nick
in London, UK.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.090
We're here to answer any questions that you
have regarding any topics around Android development.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.580
We won't answer any questions about unannounced
things.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.320
But barring our refusal to look into the future,
we're here to talk about whatever interests

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.430
you regarding Android development.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.810
So let's see who's in the Hangout and what's
goin' on.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.820
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, we're here Sparky.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.640
Hey, good to see you again.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.100
We've changed rooms this week as you may have
noticed.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.130
It's not just a faulty camera, our room's
turned blue.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.580
We're in Haskell instead of the standard Android
room.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.580
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Haskell?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.580
[inaudible]

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: [unintelligible] I'm shoppin' around
here.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.580
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh, oh.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.780
Well, we don't talk about future product directions
do we, so?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.780
[laughter]

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.940
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes, this is the Haskell room, soon
it will be [inaudible]

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.909
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We, we emphatically deny that Haskell
is going to be the future of Android.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:07.909
[laughter]

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.200
&gt;&gt;Rich: Please deny that a lot.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.049
I don't want to have to learn that.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:13.049
[laughter]

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.890
Just 'cause we got the ball rolling.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.890
&gt;&gt;Nick: It worked out quite well today.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.890
'cause I've got an Android t-shirt and Matt's
got a Google TV t-shirt.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.390
So we're quite clearly product [inaudible]

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.390
[laughter]

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.820
Who knows about Richard's.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.270
Bit of everything.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.070
&gt;&gt;Rich: I just do IO.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.070
It's fine.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.070
Bright here, as well.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.070
Interesting.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.070
Well, better lit than normal.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.070
So, yeah.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.360
&gt;&gt;Nick: Who else is live in the Hangout?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.690
Who do we have?

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.630
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hey Johann, good to see you there?

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.630
&gt;&gt;Johann: Hi guys.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.630
[clears throat]

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.630
&gt;&gt;Rich: You alright?

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.630
Is that actually your office now?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.630
I don't think you've called in from your office
before.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990
&gt;&gt;Johann: No, that's true, that's true.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.990
It's the office.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: Nice.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.990
[laughter]

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: I've just bought my ticket for DroidCon
Holland, so I'll be seeing you out there in

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.520
November.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.520
&gt;&gt; Johann: Good, good, good, good.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: Quite looking forward to it.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.520
&gt;&gt;Johann: That's good.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520
Yeah.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: You can [inaudible] us coming up already.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.520
&gt;&gt;Matt: I'm already on it.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh, yeah, that's right, you're speaking
at DroidCon Holland.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.320
&gt;&gt;Rich: There you go, you've got two of us
heading there already.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't know that Nick is going to DroidCon
UK?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.080
Are you going to DroidCon UK?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.710
You're speaking at DroidCon UK, aren't you?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.710
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yep.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.710
I'm working my way 'round.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.330
&gt;&gt;Rich: So both of those guys will be at DroidCon
UK and us guys will be, and maybe Nick as

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.629
well, will join us at DroidCon Holland.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:12.629
&gt;&gt;Nick: Maybe.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.629
&gt;&gt;Johann: Very good.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.629
&gt;&gt;Rich: Looking forward to the DroidCon Season.

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.629
&gt;&gt;Johann: Yeah.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Good chance to get back and see all
the developers.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.849
Who else is on the Hangout today?

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.109
We've got Ravi?

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:22.370
Hey there Ravi.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.120
Do you have, um--?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.064
&gt;&gt;Nick: Where are you phoning in from Ravi?

00:02:26.064 --> 00:02:28.290
&gt;&gt;Rich: Can you have a microphone today?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.769
Or are you just on chat?

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.450
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, we can't hear you right now.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.450
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.450
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Uh, can you hear me now?

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.450
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.989
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes we can.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:38.989
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Yeah.

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:39.989
Um.

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.989
&gt;&gt;Nick: Nice fat dings

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.439
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Yeah, can you hear me now?

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.430
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yes, we can hear you.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Yeah.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.430
OK.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.370
Um, I just have some questions about audio.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.409
Handling audio in Android.

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.560
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible] this morning [inaudible]
about KPI [inaudible]

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.310
&gt;&gt;Rich: Uh, one second Ravi.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.310
Because.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.409
[multiple people talking, background noise]

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.159
&gt;&gt;Rich: That should be [inaudible].

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.340
Sorry, carry on Ravi.
[man talking indistinctly in background]

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.760
&gt;&gt;Ravi: OK.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.019
[inaudible] take longer than [rustling noise].

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.709
So I've been working on audio in Android.

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.699
So I've got this stream, which I'm doing streaming
soundtrack.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.780
Streaming to the headphones.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.769
Are you clear so far?

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.849
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.469
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, yeah.

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:33.329
&gt;&gt; Nick: [inaudible] is just about a half
hour, so.

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.989
&gt;&gt;Ravi: And now what I just need is another
audio track or maybe a sound tool, which sends

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:45.059
the audio to a speaker only, which means that
the headphones signal will be uninterrupted.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:50.299
And the SoundPool, which sends to the speakers
would be an independent one.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.040
Is there any way to do this?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.559
&gt;&gt;Matt: I think I catch you.

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.569
So you, are you trying to play a sound through
the speakers as well as the headphones at

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.569
the same time.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.739
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Yeah.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:01.739
Different.

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.180
&gt;&gt;Rich: Different sounds?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.449
I don't think that's actually physically possible.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:15.599
&gt;&gt;Ravi: I've been trying through using AudioTrack
which sends a sound, a continuous sound through

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.220
speakers, I'm sorry, headphones.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.240
And I've been using SoundPool to use this
as an audio manager.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.840
Using an audio manager stream ring.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.180
Do you get it?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.360
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.010
We've had some questions like this before.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.460
I think the first thing I would ask is, why
do you want to do that?

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:46.169
I mean, I think that one of the strongest
use-cases for headphones is that you don't

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.250
play sound out through the speakers.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.460
So, I mean, you know, it seems like you have
the possibility of circumventing the basic

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.250
contract that the device makes that says when
you plug in your headphones you won't be annoying

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.310
your neighbors.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.550
[male voices in background] [door slams]
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Mm-hm.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:13.319
But the thing is here, we are actually sending
the entire audio input signal as in one source,

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:20.810
while the other one we're using has maybe
more [unintelligible]stuff . When we use a

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.800
notification on the ring, [inaudible] in a
stream, it's interrupting the stream to wait.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.139
And in this audio's finished, and then it
returns the signal back again.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.650
Which is quite, not what we are expecting
to do.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.860
[someone comments in background, inaudible]

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:46.320
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I don't think, I don't know if any
of us are really that expert in the multimedia

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320
framework.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.969
I don't know, maybe, I won't speak for you
guys in London.

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.569
I mean, technically I don't know the answer.

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.469
I'm just not convinced that it's a good idea.

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.860
Maybe you guys in London have a perspective
on this.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.729
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, I think we'd know about it if
it was possible.

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:06.210
'Cause you'd end up setting separate volume
controls for the speaker, to the headphones.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.810
And you know, when you, there's events that
happen when you plug in headphones and unplug

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.909
them for example.

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.749
The music will stop playing.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:22.389
So I know that you can get events to tell
you that event's been plugged in but then

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.970
[inaudible] speakers.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.069
Probably confuse users somewhat as well, 'cause
they would be expecting the speakers to mute

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:31.250
as soon as they plugged in the headphones.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.229
Could be potentially embarrassing.

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.979
I'm guessing it's just not possible.

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:38.229
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Mm.

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:42.740
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Or if it is possible, maybe the
way to do it is to do it in the NDK.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:50.409
You know, once you get below the Java framework,
then you can get much more direct control

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:57.249
over the actual hardware devices and you might
be able to open electrical audio channels

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:02.249
that might just might not be possible to populate
at the NDK, or at the framework level.

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:06.150
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sounds like a good question to try
on StackOverflow and see if you get any response.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.680
&gt;&gt;Ravi: I'm already in a discussion with StackOverflow.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.680
Great.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.680
If you want you can post a

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Yeah, so.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.060
&gt;&gt;Rich: Question in the chat window and we'll
have a look at it as well.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:22.080
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Did you also, are you the poster
of the questions in the Moderator as well?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.080
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Yeah.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.080
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.300
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Android Boy.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.840
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Good.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.860
Yeah, I gave about the same response in the
Moderator that I just told you.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.880
I wanna thank you for coming into the Hangout
and to let us consider your question live.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880
That's great.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:40.880
That's what we're here for.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Mm-hm.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.430
&gt;&gt;Ravi: Thank you very much.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.800
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, thank you, thank you.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.439
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Does anyone else want to jump in
with a question.

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:53.120
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hi.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.129
I wrote a question down on the chat bar.

00:07:57.129 --> 00:08:04.629
But I wanted to know if, I just wanted to
see if we were able to use Google credentials

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:05.629
inside of Android.

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:07.259
&gt;&gt;Sparky: You mean like Open OPS?

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:09.169
Or Open—
[background feedback throughout]

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:10.400
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.529
I'm using OPS.

00:08:11.529 --> 00:08:14.879
I'm using the account manager to get an OPS
token.

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:21.360
And then I want to use Google credentials
in order to fetch data from the, from I don't

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.499
know, from contacts or from calendar and so
on.

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:26.499
And—

00:08:26.499 --> 00:08:32.270
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, yes there is a good way, and it's
coming soon.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.390
&gt;&gt;Male #2: OK.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:44.149
&gt;&gt;Nick: And basically we're working on a new
file library [inaudible] Right now it's [inaudible].

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:46.410
[audio cutting out and interfering noises]

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.279
Anything, you can try that.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:49.410
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yes.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.410
&gt;&gt;Nick: Android.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:56.350
You watch that [inaudible] So your API is
going to write for an app.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:02.640
So you can get up to speed [inaudible] 'cause
when you [inaudible.].

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.760
So that would be, I think now.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.529
&gt;&gt;Male #2: OK.

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:13.050
And for now, is there a workaround or something?

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.600
Besides the Google Java API?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:21.750
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, yeah, you still can use like
O Authors and C Scape [inaudible]

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.060
&gt;&gt;Rich: I put the link in the chat for you.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.860
[feedback continues]
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Oh, OK.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.030
I just saw that now.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.190
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] the API.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.440
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.700
[inaudible] authorization.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:42.399
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, in the side bar, the chat bar,
do you see that Rich has put a couple of links.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:43.399
Yeah?

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:44.399
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.339
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's that [unintelligible] I just
mentioned.

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:53.110
And at first there's an example of [inaudible]
using the Google Tasks API which [inaudible]

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.850
&gt;&gt;Male #2: OK.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:03.180
GoogleTasks will also be the one, the example
one that I can use and switch to, I don't

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.540
know, to get contacts, get calendar events
and so on?

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, you would have to use different
scopes.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.920
Different [unintelligible] scopes.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.920
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: To collect data.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.920
But yeah, it's the basic steps.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.920
&gt;&gt;Male #2: OK.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.920
Thank you.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920
&gt;&gt;Rich: Right.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible] in the comments in
the G Plus links.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.920
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.920
That's right.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.570
So, I will check the situation.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.260
There it is.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.050
Google Tasks.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.630
Or is this Google?

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:35.079
&gt;&gt;Nick: Did we have any more live questions
to people in the Hangout?

00:10:35.079 --> 00:10:37.980
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We've got a pretty full house here.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.329
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:47.459
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So, looks like Talid has joined
us but I don't see him.

00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:49.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: Richard, go ahead.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.259
Please ask away.

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:57.830
Feel free to either speak it if you can or
type it in the sidebar.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.830
&gt;&gt;Matt: [inaudible]

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.980
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Does anyone want to ask a question
while Richard is typing or should we take

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.370
one from the Moderator?

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:10.740
&gt;&gt;Rich: What happened to users dynamic fragments?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.910
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.759
[chuckles] Let's jump in with one from the
Moderator.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:19.350
Here's, this should be a quick one.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:24.570
Orin in Israel wants to know, is it possible
to show the in-app billing dialog.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.300
The Google Play in-app billing in landscape
mode instead of portrait?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.870
Um, I suggested that he run one of those utilities
that forces the entire device to landscape

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.600
and see what happens.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.220
That'll probably work.

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:43.970
I think that, when possible, the Android team
tries to make its activities orientation agnostic

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.339
and support rotation.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:51.200
And if they don't support it by default on
a particular device, it's probably because

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.949
they weren't able to get a user experience
that they were happy with in that orientation.

00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.560
And so they locked it out.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:03.709
That's, so my guess there is that if they
don't support landscape on the Galaxy Nexus

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:08.709
it's because they weren't happy with the UX
that they got when they tried it.

00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:12.639
&gt;&gt;Rich: I thought it was already done, to
be honest.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:16.300
Um, I've seen it appear in landscape on multiple
devices.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.990
Now, certainly on the Nexus 7 it appears in
landscape.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.560
Maybe there are some smaller screened handsets
that they still haven't got a landscape layout.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.540
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] version not [inaudible]

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.190
&gt;&gt;Rich: No, it was there from IO, I've seen
it.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.640
But no, there's nothing you can do to force
it.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.310
There were versions of the market client that
would only show in portrait mode which was

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.350
annoying.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.529
And they are updating.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:45.500
Yeah, the ones that we have here are showing
in landscape.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.660
I'm just concerned that maybe he's testing
on a smaller screen device, like, just—

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.660
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.670
&gt;&gt;Sparky: It's the Galaxy Nexus.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.670
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah?

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:55.509
Well on Galaxy Nexus it should already be
done.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:59.450
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I'm never sure of what everyone
else is seeing on the Galaxy Nexus.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:04.850
'Cause I'm usually running some hairy dog-food
build that's you know, several steps removed

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:08.149
from what any sane person would dare to load
on their only device.

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:11.779
&gt;&gt;Matt: Living life on the edge.

00:13:11.779 --> 00:13:16.329
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK, we have a question from Richard.

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:22.339
"I'm trying to implement the Up button for
the tablet version which has dual pane layout.

00:13:22.339 --> 00:13:27.589
All the fragments in the dual pane layout
share an activity and implement an interface."

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:28.589
Um.

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.509
Up button.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:37.640
Well, I mean you don't need the up button
if you're just changing, say, fragments on

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.120
the same activity.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.190
The up affordance is for changing between
activities.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:50.649
Generally speaking when you have a dual pane
layout, right, you've got a selector in one

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:53.360
fragment and your detail in the other fragment.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.980
And we don't really do like, we don't do back
history and that.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:00.160
And we don't do navigation history and that.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.579
Navigation is for changing activities.

00:14:01.579 --> 00:14:03.720
Is that about right, Nick?

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.510
&gt;&gt;Nick: So I'm going to interpret this question
as you have like layers of hierarchy and navigation.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.569
But instead of having separate activities
it sounds like you just have one activity

00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:17.000
and you just dynamically change the content
of that one activity depending on which layer

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.139
of navigation you're at there.

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:21.420
That's how I interpret it.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.160
That you've done so differently.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:32.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: So it sounds like you're trying to
almost, take control of what you [inaudible]

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.660
activities [inaudible].

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.660
Uh.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.240
Which [inaudible] a little bit.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.440
You know, it's timing your control.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.569
You just click on an option item, select it
[inaudible]

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:44.579
[someone in the hangout speaking, inaudible]

00:14:44.579 --> 00:14:50.620
So, you can just kind of react to it as that,
or if you use the latest, the later version

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.420
of the support library.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.670
Um, if you wrote to the activities you can
provide a metadata tag, saying "Defining the

00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:01.839
name of the parent activity" so that it will
handle the up button popping the stack and

00:15:01.839 --> 00:15:04.170
reproducing the parent.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.170
So that could work.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.769
But I'm not quite sure what the exact question
[unintelligible] is.

00:15:07.769 --> 00:15:08.769
[laughter]

00:15:08.769 --> 00:15:13.269
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I suppose, to, taking what you said
there and running with it a little bit.

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:17.970
If he's swapping out fragments rather than
changing the activity, then you want no parent

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:18.970
activity.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.200
And you just wanna receive that menu event
that option menu event and handle it by changing

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.420
out the fragment instead of—

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:29.769
&gt;&gt;Nick: I would caveat that there are some
places where the up button's kind of overloaded.

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:33.230
And doesn't just do navigation.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:37.100
So I think a good example there is the expand-collapse
pattern.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.720
Which is probably best demonstrated by Gmail.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.620
Where if you're reading am message, kind of
in landscape.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.709
And then you go to portrait.

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:50.149
The message expands to take up the entire
width of the screen and hides the kind of

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:52.009
sidebar with the list of messages.

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:56.899
And in that instance you might use the up
button there to create and out for the content.

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:00.450
So it's not always just kind of hierarchical
navigation.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.450
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Hm.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: Just to complicate things.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.660
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Right.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.790
&gt;&gt;Nick: But yeah, is that your question?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.259
Is that, how do you literally react to it,
say?

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:15.370
In which case it's the on-option item selected
on the Android.ab.home isn't it?

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.370
Yeah.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.550
It's in the action bar docs.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.319
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Right, and while we're on the topic.

00:16:22.319 --> 00:16:30.500
In the cases where you have that slide-in,
that slide-in control panel on the left side.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.019
Like in the YouTube app.

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:33.019
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yep.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:36.740
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Our guidance there is to not implement
that if there's any parent activity.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:37.740
Right?

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.819
That's only for top portal activities with
no parent.

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:42.040
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.139
Correct.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:49.740
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK, so whilst two people are typing,
we'll have a quick look at the Moderator.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:55.490
There's a few questions in the Moderator from
Markus that actually came through for our

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:03.100
session last week, but then got answered at
the Mountain View low-level media session.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.500
So the top one was how to detect if the audio
codec was for AMR wideband on a certain device.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.750
They got to the point where they could detect
whether a device supported AMR, but not whether

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.300
it was wideband or narrow band.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.420
So they didn't answer for that one.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.760
And we're looking into what you could find
out about that.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.450
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think that got answered in the Mountain
View when James Dong was there.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:22.450
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.450
&gt;&gt;Nick: Um, but interesting on this one—

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:24.920
&gt;&gt;Rich: I thought James had some more information
on it.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, you should stick with that.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.630
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.430
&gt;&gt;Nick: But interestingly, one thing I did
see today in my streams, is ACRA.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.311
If any of you out there are using the Android
crash reporting system.

00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:37.690
It's quite a handy little system lots of people
are using.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.410
For catching core exceptions and sending them
to Google Spreadsheet.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.990
There's a new thing that Kevin, is it?

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.280
The, is that it?

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.280
Uh.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.280
Can't remember his name.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280
I think it's Kevin.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.180
Has added a protocol action on Jellybean devices,
also report back all the codecs.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:55.140
And the device you're experiencing crash on
supports.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.570
So if you're having this kind of media stuff,
and you're using acra, I'd encourage you to

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.600
take a look at that so you get a bit more
debug information about, oh, the device doesn't

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.910
support it or whatever.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.880
So, definitely worth looking into.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.880
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.420
Do you wanna have a go at the next question
in the moderator, Sparky?

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.940
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Um, let's see.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.100
What is the next question in the Moderator.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.100
[laughs]

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.100
&gt;&gt;Rich: Ah.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.450
&gt;&gt;Sparky: The next one I see is one about
SQL.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.080
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.710
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:26.820
So this says, oh wait.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.570
No, actually, the one I see before that is
"How would a malicious Android keyboard be

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.430
treated in the Google Play Store?"

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:41.670
Well, if you know of a malicious keyboard,
you should go into your Google Play Store

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.830
application and flag it as inappropriate.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.270
And then that'll be escalated to the Google
Play team.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:53.020
When the Google Play team finds applications
that are misbehaving, they are suspended.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:58.460
And in extreme cases the developer may be
banned and his account can be blocked.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:04.680
So we don't treat lightly malware in the application
store.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680
&gt;&gt;Rich: No.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.180
And malware keyboards could be potentially
really, really bad of course.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.600
'cause they could read everything you're typing.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.900
&gt;&gt;Nick: Be careful of any keyboard asking
for friends app permissions.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Be careful of anything asking for
friends app permissions.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.200
I would totally agree with that.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.640
If you want to provide more detail on your
error report, instead of opening the Google

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.400
Play client on your handset, and reporting
it as inappropriate, if you go to Google Play

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.880
Help on the web, we have a nice form that
you can fill in there.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.430
To report inappropriate apps.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.890
And you can just Google for Google Play Inappropriate
Apps and it comes up straight away.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.220
You can click on that and fill in the details.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:37.551
And it just gives our team a little bit more
to go on.

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:41.390
When they're trying to figure out why you
think it's malicious.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.390
OK.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:45.990
Let's take that one off.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.190
Anyone else in the hangout have any questions
before we jump to the next--?

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.840
&gt;&gt;Nick: Who is that with the scariest avatar
face there?

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.840
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yes.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, thank you Ben S. for having
a really scary avatar.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.230
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.480
I think you know exactly who it was typing,
straight away.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480
[laughter]

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
&gt;&gt;Rich: Benedicta.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.480
It's me.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.480
Same question here.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480
Its SQL.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480
Ah.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK then, well, let's answer it.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480
&gt;&gt;Rich: [unintelligible]

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.430
&gt;&gt;Nick: Do you wanna ask it live then?

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:15.370
&gt;&gt;Rich: Do you have a microphone there.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.070
I'm guessing not.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.270
&gt;&gt;Nick: Everyone must get bored of seeing
us chatter on.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.270
&gt;&gt;Sparky: [laughs]

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.270
&gt;&gt;Rich: He's typing.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.270
At the same time I'll check the—

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.270
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.270
He's got a lot of background.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:26.270
Well, thank you for muting then.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.270
We appreciate that.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:28.270
[laughter]

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.270
OK.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.570
"I'm creating an app where the user enters
some value daily and I store it to SQL eight.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:37.250
That should work offline, but, if the user
has multiple devices, his data should be synchronized.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.330
Instant, not necessarily.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.070
What's the best way to do this?"

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:47.350
Um, this says to me, you want a Google app
engine app up there.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.540
And you should be syncing data up there to
your app engine.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.050
What do you guys think.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.380
&gt;&gt;Nick: Or, Google Drive.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.990
I would do, whenever I did, might be to use
Google Drive and a sync adapter.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:06.500
So you could have a sync adapter to periodically
call the drive API to sync up somewhere.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.350
So if you don't wanna go down the route of
having to maintain your own storage service,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:16.630
which is what the app engine side would be
doing, you could ask the user to store it

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.570
in their Google Drive folder or Drop Box or
something.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.040
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, well if you're going to go
there then you don't even need SQL, do you?

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.690
I mean you could write rows into a spread
sheet or something, couldn't you?

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.880
Can we do that with the drive API?

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.880
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Cool.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.260
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, and that's right actually, we
talked about the talk earlier on, which Rich

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.690
even linked to earlier on, about using Google
Drive from Android.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.170
So if you take a look at that talk from Google
IO, it's exactly that.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.550
It takes the notepad application, which many
of you might have used.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:50.450
You might have worked through that sample
code as a first time resource SQL like database.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.003
And it takes that and every time you save
a note in, so not every time.

00:21:54.003 --> 00:21:56.730
But it has a sync adapter, just what you want.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.410
So it periodically backs up that database.

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.370
It just inserts and updates.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.230
To Google Drive backed up files.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.450
So you can have it on multiple devices.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.450
All in sync.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:13.460
And it handles checking MP5 hashes to make
sure you were there.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.700
[inaudible] and all that good stuff.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.700
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That's pretty cool.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.590
I've written a, I've written a Google Drive
app that tied a spreadsheet t to a web app.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.450
But I've never done it on Android before.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:25.270
So, maybe I should tried that next.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:26.990
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:30.430
Fun to be had.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:36.450
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Right, uh, let's see, next.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.580
Oh, my world is upside down.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:45.100
I'm living on the bleeding edge here, I just
updated to Mountain Lion and all my scroll

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.100
bars are backwards.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.100
[laughter]

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.090
&gt;&gt;Rich: It took me a good week to get used
to but it's worth persevering with.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.530
'Cause now everyone else's scroll bars are
backwards.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.530
[laughter]

00:22:55.530 --> 00:23:01.330
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, yeah, I don't know how many
years I've been using scroll bars where you

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:03.010
mouse down to scroll up.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.010
And—

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.880
&gt;&gt;Rich: Every mouse move has run down, every
scroll bar has run—except the ones on my

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880
callback.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.340
&gt;&gt;Sparky: But actually, I kinda like it this
way.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:14.370
Because now, because you know, since I'm using
a track pad instead of a mouse, then now,

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.970
my, well, my laptop works exactly the same
as my tablets.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:17.970
So.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:18.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:19.970
Exactly.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:20.970
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So it's all good.

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:21.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: That's why it feels a bit more natural.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:22.970
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Huh.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:23.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.970
There was a question.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.160
"I am a user but I have a problem.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.400
From NDBJR.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.540
In, from nowhere actually.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.540
It doesn't have a location.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.540
&gt;&gt;Nick: Aw.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:35.540
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.280
"The system pop-up, about Google authentication
apparently.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.170
The pop-up only stays up for one second and
contains too much info to discern.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:45.500
Where can I find the message to look at longer?"

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.840
Is this, wow, I can't really ask you 'cause
you're not in the hangout.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:53.070
Uh, we need a bit more information on that
before we can answer the question.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:57.400
It's whether, if you're developing an application
and you're seeing this pop up, then it should

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.820
be up until you approve it.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:03.910
So, I don't know what you're doing to override
the pop-up and make it disappear.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:09.110
But as Sparky mentioned in the Moderator,
check your log CAT and see what's actually

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.340
happening to make that pop-up disappear.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.940
Because our authentication screen should be
dialogs that come up for quite a long time

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.390
and let you accept or deny them or approve.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.560
NTK.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.740
Oops.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:27.550
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Hm. Paul Hanson has a question.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.270
"Regarding NFC.

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.200
I'm missing the ability to card emulate.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.390
Is there a way to do this to beam?"

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:39.770
Um, I mean, there is some sort of a card emulation
feature isn't—I mean, there's an API for

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:40.770
it.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.560
It's in NFC extras.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.240
I looked this up just earlier today for somebody
else.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.160
Maybe I can find that for you.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.020
I don't know exactly what it means, I just
know that there's an API to turn it on.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:59.780
I guess it's needed for some of the e-commerce
related applications.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:04.110
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I think we have very limited
card emulation.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.380
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.660
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.360
So it looks like actually the rest of the
Moderator questions have already been dealt

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360
with.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.950
In last week.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:20.110
Unless you—In there Sparky that we haven't
answered.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.600
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Shouldn't be.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.600
No.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.550
I think we've got a few, actually.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.020
Let me take a look at this.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:30.020
Um.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:31.020
Let's see.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.020
Keyboard SQL.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.020
AudioCodec.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.340
Um, there's one from Markus about encoding.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.510
Was that also in the detailed session last
week?

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.570
'Cause I didn't, or in the Mountain View session?

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.810
'Cause I answered it but I didn't know—

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.460
&gt;&gt;Rich: What was the question.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.460
&gt;&gt;Sparky: That—

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.960
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh, [unintelligible]

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.210
&gt;&gt;Sparky: All these ones from Markus have
they all been answered before?

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:50.320
&gt;&gt;Rich: I think so.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.960
They did mention quite a few questions from
Markus.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.900
&gt;&gt;Rich: But he's still there.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.840
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well, I can answer it anyway.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:03.350
He says "How can I encode media that is not
from camera or microphone?

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:07.280
Or how can I decode something without also
outputting it?"

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.450
Um, search StackOverflow.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:12.200
There's lots of examples of people who have
done this.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.200
[laughter]

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200
I mean, that's—

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.720
&gt;&gt;Nick: And then you can go look at the new
MediaCodec classes.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.330
Um, introduced in Jellybean.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.920
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, if you want to encode it for
Jellybean I'd always look at MediaCodec.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.110
'cause that's awesome.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:28.460
Um, although, it's much better at the moment
in decoding than it is in encoding.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:34.990
Also, if you want to do it over a wider variety
of formats and platforms.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:40.920
FFMPEG is always a good group to check out.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920
OK.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:46.470
So does anyone in the Hangout have anything
else to ask?

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:55.770
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Um, if you guys can stall for a
minute I will find that note that I sent about

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:57.410
the NFC API.

00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:03.170
&gt;&gt;Nick: Uh, there's one live question that's
come in on the G plus post.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:09.650
"Do you guys recommend a good way the usage
tests for Android applications like Selenium?"

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.600
Any favorite testing approaches?

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.540
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh, auto testing.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.540
Or—

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.750
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.960
&gt;&gt;Matt: Or [unintelligible]

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.430
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:26.660
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, there's a couple out there that,
roboelectrics slash roboting combination.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.800
There's one that a lot of people talk about

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.170
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] The unit tests.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Johann.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.530
How do you test your Android apps?

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.330
Put you on the spot.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.660
&gt;&gt;Johann: [chuckles] Currently, currently
not.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.660
[laughter]

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:39.660
&gt;&gt;Rich: Excellent.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:48.670
&gt;&gt;Johann: I've, I'm currently working on an
app which needs the Wi-Fi, so and that's not

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:50.010
available in the emulator.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:57.590
And I, I know the robotium can test a real
device as well, but at the time when I made

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.330
the decision, so I'm more in the project now,
so—

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.000
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, OK.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
One suggestion.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.220
At Google IO we had a Talks partner in called
TestDroid.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.600
It's a product called TestDroid by Bitbar.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.600
And they do a really nice thing.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:17.300
They have a system where they let you record
your entire test on the device using key presses

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.360
whatever focuses.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.980
And then records it as a script, it uploads
it to their cloud.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.390
Where they then replay it across any number
of devices that you'd like.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:29.500
And they have like 100 varieties of Android
devices up there.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:33.900
And they photograph the screens for you and
they do all the touch presses and everything.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.260
Automated in their cloud.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:39.650
So you can run, you can choose exactly which
devices you want to run it on.

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.730
And you can just go and say "I want the Motorola
Droid One, I want Sony X, and Xperia.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:44.730
Whatever.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.730
Ark.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:46.730
Maybe.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:47.730
And a Galaxy Nexus and a Nexus 7."

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.730
And submit.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.730
And it just runs through.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:50.730
Runs them all for you.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.410
And it seems like a pretty cost effective
way of being able to test your application

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.240
on a number of devices.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:02.410
Which they're working on integrating that
into people's project build flows.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.690
[Hangout dings] So that at the end of each,
so you can sanity check, basically, as you're

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.950
doing your builds, that will automatically
upload, and run the tests.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.500
So there are other services out there.

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:17.630
&gt;&gt;Matt: Trying to think if there may be one
way you can actually get access to a live

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.830
device with a video camera on top of it.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:20.830
&gt;&gt;Rich: That would be [inaudible]

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:21.830
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:22.830
&gt;&gt;Matt: [inaudible]

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.830
&gt;&gt;Rich: [inaudible] when I was at DroidCon
last year.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:24.830
&gt;&gt;Matt: I've got a Testdroid [unintelligible]
that I remember from DroidCon.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:27.610
[Hangout dings]
&gt;&gt;Rich: I'd like to finish all of them.

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:28.910
If you Google TD services.

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:29.910
Also—

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:30.910
&gt;&gt;Matt: MonkeyRun [inaudible]

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:32.580
&gt;&gt;Rich: MonkeyRun and stuff like that.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.580
Yeah.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.890
It might be MonkeyRun scripts that Testdroid
uses.

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:36.890
Um.

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:37.890
&gt;&gt;Matt: OK.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.540
&gt;&gt;Rich: And I think it was Samsung which opened
up their own online testing lab free for developers

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.700
if you sign up for Samsung Developer.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.540
Was that Samsung or Sony, Nick?

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.720
&gt;&gt;Nick: Samsung had an online legend, Sony
had a [inaudible]

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.340
&gt;&gt;Rich: [inaudible] devices.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:54.770
So you can go to the OEM developer sites as
well.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.720
Alright, it sounds like you can borrow devices
from Sony and Samsung is a bit like Testdroid.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.820
The one that you mentioned.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.820
[all speak together]

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.820
Device [inaudible]

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.180
&gt;&gt;Rich: Where you can go online and [crashing
sound] the device.

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: If you're using Selenium, I'd probably
check out [inaudible] as my first tool.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.960
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960
[door closing sound]

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.710
&gt;&gt;Johann: Well, Rich, to put a question back
to you then.

00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:17.530
Um how do you test apps which use like a server,
server side back end?

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:23.180
Do you, and which might be intermittent or
so, do you mock that out?

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.180
Yeah.

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:31.230
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, if it was gonna be like a high
grade application that needed testing, that

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.160
was being built as a contract work.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:35.160
Then yeah.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:42.100
I would mock it out as I was building the
application so I could run through the tests

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.420
and make sure I was happy with the server
side component.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.990
And then test the server side and run it separately
and bring it all together.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.990
&gt;&gt;Johann: Yeah.

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.080
&gt;&gt;Rich: Can't say that I ever actually went
to those lengths.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.510
[laughs] 'Cause I just build the applications
for myself.

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.390
And as is often the way with Android, we test
on our users.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.310
Users are pretty eager to give feedback at
Android, right?

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:59.310
&gt;&gt;Johann: Yeah.

00:30:59.310 --> 00:31:00.310
[chuckles]

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:04.270
&gt;&gt;Matt: Um, there was a, uh, thing that you
posted up a long while ago, Nick.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.990
About being [unintelligible] like a beta.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.860
APK, and we're disputing it.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:09.300
It's kind of [inaudible]

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.774
&gt;&gt;Nick: [indistinct] is the popular one these
days.

00:31:10.774 --> 00:31:11.774
[inaudible]

00:31:11.774 --> 00:31:13.980
&gt;&gt;Rich: A few of those as well.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.120
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, [unintelligible] doin' it.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.090
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So, apropos of testing on your users,
I will give a piece of advice.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:27.290
Which is, don't do live user testing for your
negative test cases.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:31.770
"Oh my God, you just deleted my entire album!"
[laughter] "Yeah, I know, it was supposed

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:33.750
to do that.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:34.750
Success."

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.750
[laughter]

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:41.400
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK, did you find that thing, Sparky?

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.700
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I did.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:51.360
I just posted into the file that implements
the functions for card emulation.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:58.390
For turning on and off card emulation is called
"NFCadapterextras.Java" and I found it in

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.740
the AOSP just by Googling on the file names.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.270
So that's what I suggested that Paul do.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:05.590
So.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:10.810
I don't have like documentation for what exactly
it does or how to use it or anything.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:15.010
Just, you know, somebody asked "Can you do
a card emulation?" and the answer is "Evidently,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.010
yes."

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:22.810
&gt;&gt;Rich: I think it's pretty limited as well.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.350
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.890
&gt;&gt;Rich: Unfortunately.

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:30.440
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Alright.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.950
Looks like Yossi's going away.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.960
So, farewell to Yossi.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.900
Does anyone else have an issue they want to
bring up?

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:43.550
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, I'd just like to follow up
on my issue earlier.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.220
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hey, Richard.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.880
&gt;&gt;Richard: Hi there.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.870
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's two of you.

00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.100
[laughter]

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.330
&gt;&gt;Richard: I jumped on another machine.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.930
I thought it might be easier if I jumped on
in person.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.080
To try to find a quiet spot.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] So you had the issue with
the dynamic fragments, right?

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.650
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:09.640
So I've got, um, an app.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.700
I've got the sort of, seems to be working
fine for the sort of mobile version.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:21.640
The tablet version, I have sort of a search
list and then when somebody performs a search,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.540
they get a list of results that slides in
and then when they sort of click on a result

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.720
it then slides in the detail screen.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.450
And that will then allow them to slide in
a more detailed screen.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.549
Again after that.

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:37.040
So I wanted to do something like the Gmail
app.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.290
Which then allows you to sort of navigate
back upwards.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:43.980
[Hangout dings]
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Mm.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:49.900
Right, so maybe the little up button would
simply close the rightmost tab essentially?

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.570
Or close the rightmost detail view?

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.830
&gt;&gt;Rich: I apologize for that Richard.

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.480
We dropped out just as you were saying about
the fourth list that drops in.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.310
Our Hangout dropped out for a second there.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.340
&gt;&gt;Richard: That's fine.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:06.990
So it just goes to results list and then a
summary detail screen and then goes into a

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.679
more detailed screen.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:13.859
And I'm just looking to do something like
the Gmail app where you just hit the back

00:34:13.859 --> 00:34:20.309
button, it would take you from the very detailed
screen to the detailed screen, up to the search

00:34:20.309 --> 00:34:22.220
results, then up to the search screen.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.529
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm-hm.

00:34:23.529 --> 00:34:27.360
&gt;&gt;Richard: So I've kinda got out a structure.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:34.990
All my for the tablet layout, all the fragments
are sort of contained within a search activity.

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:40.260
And all the fragments implement and interface
that calls back to that—

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.109
[video cuts out]

00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:50.000
&gt;&gt;Richard: that will do all the fragment transactions
and swap out all the screens appropriately.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.919
Now, where I'm having the issue is, is obviously
for the initial top level search screen, I

00:34:56.919 --> 00:34:58.870
don't want the up button on that screen.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:02.210
I just want it in all the sort of child screens.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:10.640
So because everything shares the one activity,
it's a, what is the best way of having, specify

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.259
I want the up button to be there for every
screen except for that top level screen?

00:35:16.259 --> 00:35:22.940
And then b, how do I handle the view suppressing
the up button?

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.970
That those are the two problems that I'm facing.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.609
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well, you can show and hide that
chevron, right?

00:35:29.609 --> 00:35:32.210
I mean that's a function call.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.210
A method.

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.430
Which I recall.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.549
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, it's [unintelligible]

00:35:36.549 --> 00:35:42.680
&gt;&gt;Sparky: It seems to me like what you just
wanna do is know your, sort of know your depth

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.720
of view.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:49.790
And anytime your depth is greater than one,
close the rightmost fragment and decrease

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:50.790
your depth.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.190
That's kind of, I mean, it sounds like a pat
answer.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.970
But that's what I'm seeing when I hear you
describe it.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:36:00.280
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, well it sounds like simply,
you know you have certain states which you

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280
get into.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.799
Like maybe just, you know, define it or as
constant in it, and you know, just call up

00:36:06.799 --> 00:36:11.450
your current state and you know, so you can
say, at home "Set up button."

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.450
You know.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.210
And you pass in your current state.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:18.900
And you know, if you're in the root with those
you don't show it.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.990
Something like that.

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:25.150
But yeah, I think you're basically gonna have
to manage it yourself.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.150
&gt;&gt;Richard: So [inaudible]

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.170
&gt;&gt;Sparky: [inaudible] would be a good implementation
for that.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:29.369
&gt;&gt;Nick: Say again, Sparky?

00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:34.540
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I'm trying to think if you could
get some good UX by using the, a view pager

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:35.540
there.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.609
And rather than just popping fragments in
and out of existence.

00:36:39.609 --> 00:36:40.900
I don't know.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.760
I'm sort of mulling over it.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.079
&gt;&gt;Matt: You might be able to if you had, if
they weren't taking up the entire screen.

00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:52.049
There could be some really weird stuff that
you could do with it but, not sure whether

00:36:52.049 --> 00:36:55.539
it would make sense or not.

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:58.789
&gt;&gt;Nick: ViewPage doesn't have [inaudible]

00:36:58.789 --> 00:37:00.740
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah, exactly.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.890
So you could have sort of a third—yeah,
that would be interesting.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:07.890
Could you dynamically change the width developments?

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.890
The ViewPage width?

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:11.339
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, the page width on the adapters.

00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:12.339
You could do that.

00:37:12.339 --> 00:37:13.339
You could change it.

00:37:13.339 --> 00:37:14.339
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well, if you stick your fragments
in a linear layout, can you give them layout

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:15.339
widths?

00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:16.339
Mm.

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:17.700
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, if it's in the ViewPager it wouldn't
respect that.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.510
You'd have to use the set page width, which,
API on, Set, page, width.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.300
The API on the page adapter I think.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.300
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh yeah.

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.300
&gt;&gt;Nick: But yeah.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.300
Yeah, that's the question.

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.300
Um.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:33.299
Yeah, I think essentially you're gonna have
to handle your own state.

00:37:33.299 --> 00:37:37.049
So whatever you do, like join those callbacks
you talk about.

00:37:37.049 --> 00:37:42.970
So when a fragment is talking to the activity
to do the fragment transactions, that's the

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:47.150
point at which you wanna kind of enable, save
all the app [unintelligible]

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.940
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, so I think I've got something
to do that.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.460
I wasn't sure it was the best way.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:59.880
The other problem I'm having is about handling
the user pressing the up button.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:06.859
'Cause I found various ways online, but it
just jumps the user straight back to the home

00:38:06.859 --> 00:38:07.859
screen.

00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:13.730
&gt;&gt;Nick: So you can override that with the,
in the activity, if you add override the option

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.400
item selected method.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.609
And switch on the idea, I'm pretty sure it's
Android.r.id.home.

00:38:21.609 --> 00:38:23.930
I think that's it.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:29.440
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, so I've implemented that
method and I'm checking for that case.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.440
&gt;&gt;Nick: So you're saying that sometimes when
you hit the up button it's not going active?

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:40.059
&gt;&gt;Richard: Well, my slight question is, what
code should I be putting in there because

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:42.710
I found some example code online.

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:48.310
And um, what's OK, or I think I've got some
slightly bad code.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.500
I've been using for the mobile stuff, which
works find.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:56.329
But with the tablet layout, having the screens
side by side, I found some code about using

00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:57.720
an intent.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.010
And calling an intent.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:01.440
But that always jumps the user back to the
–

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.230
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I think it [unintelligible]
you probably wanna be invoking your own callbacks

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.890
to do whatever any one state they're in, so.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:15.010
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Right, it seems to me like that
on options menu, options item selected, is

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:23.130
where you want to look at your depth of detail
and remove the fragment and decrease the depth.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.299
Or you know, change your state variable, whatever
that happens to be.

00:39:26.299 --> 00:39:31.259
&gt;&gt;Richard: Yeah, I was thinking I have to
do something custom to deal with my own program

00:39:31.259 --> 00:39:32.259
transactions.

00:39:32.259 --> 00:39:36.910
I was just wondering if there was anything
better, a better way of doing it inbuilt.

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:39.519
But it sounds like the answer is "No."

00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:43.619
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's nothing particularly wrong
or hacky about using the fragment manager

00:39:43.619 --> 00:39:45.359
to remove a fragment.

00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:47.080
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.790
&gt;&gt;Rich: Great.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:51.910
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I guess you could.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.109
I mean you could allocate all of your fragments
statically and just show and hide them.

00:39:56.109 --> 00:40:02.279
You just stick 'em in the XML and if you know
that there's exactly one of each, you could

00:40:02.279 --> 00:40:03.279
hide it.

00:40:03.279 --> 00:40:05.420
And then when you need to see it you could
populate it with the right stuff and show

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.420
it.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.839
Um, I don't know.

00:40:07.839 --> 00:40:10.950
It's another way to do it, I guess.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.200
&gt;&gt;Richard: OK.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.460
Thank you.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:20.319
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I suppose if you statically create
them all then you don't ever need to actually

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:21.319
search for one.

00:40:21.319 --> 00:40:25.740
You can just get the IDs of your fragments
and just access them directly.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:30.329
Might be a little bit simpler that way, I
don't know.

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:33.299
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK, we've had another question dropped
into the Moderator.

00:40:33.299 --> 00:40:35.309
From Weimar, as well.

00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:39.059
So, um, we can have a quick look at that.

00:40:39.059 --> 00:40:42.569
He posted his StackOverflow question and then
linked to it in the Moderator.

00:40:42.569 --> 00:40:45.490
Which is great.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:50.869
StackOverflow question is, "One of my activities
embeds a video view.

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:57.470
And on pausing and resuming, it's calling
OnPause and OnResume respectively but OnResume

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.730
is called before the activity is actually
visible to the user.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:05.920
And it's happening when he presses the power
button to lock the device, and then presses

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.890
the power button again to unlock it.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:10.660
OnResume gets called before the user unlocks
the screen.

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:15.000
This is something actually we've spoken about
quite a bit in terms of games.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.809
Uh, "Games That Play Nice" was a talk that
Dan and Ian did.

00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:21.849
And there's also a blog post on it.

00:41:21.849 --> 00:41:22.849
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:41:22.849 --> 00:41:25.880
&gt;&gt;Rich: There was a blog post in there that
was also in there at the Google IO talk this

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880
year.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.549
You actually need to lock the OnResume and
the OnFocused changed event.

00:41:29.549 --> 00:41:32.270
To say that you've gained focus again.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:39.109
Because the lock screen, before Jellybean,
wasn't actually an activity.

00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:42.740
It was just something that appeared on the
very top of the actual screen.

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.950
Your application became resumed.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.380
But there was something still on top of it.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.380
And it was only once the user unlocked it,
or got to that screen, you got the focus back

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.440
again.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.820
But some, it's like complications.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.660
In just waiting for OnFocus changed, or OnResumed.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.769
So, you need to look for both of them.

00:42:01.769 --> 00:42:03.070
But it's in the blog post.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:09.990
I'll post it on the StackOverflow to explain
the exact blog post in there.

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:12.119
But you, yeah, it's a well-known issue.

00:42:12.119 --> 00:42:13.790
And from Jellybean, it doesn't' exist anymore.

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:18.070
So if you test it on a new Galaxy Nexus or
a Nexus 7, you'll see it doesn't happen.

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:21.609
Because the lock screen has been changed.

00:42:21.609 --> 00:42:23.079
&gt;&gt;Matt: Nice.

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:28.039
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Let's see, we have another question
from Paul in the chat here.

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:33.680
He wants to know "Can I use NFC to bootstrap
a Wi-Fi communication channel?"

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.119
Um, maybe?

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:38.460
Did we have that for Jellybean?

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.869
Do you know, can you use the--?

00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:42.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: What kind of Wi-Fi communication?

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.029
You mean, like to [inaudible]

00:42:44.029 --> 00:42:50.140
&gt;&gt;Sparky, no, I think he's talking about using,
yeah, using NFC beam to, or using Android

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:52.470
beam to initiate the transfer and then.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:53.950
Oh, no that's not Wi-Fi.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.789
That hands it over to Bluetooth for the bulk
transfer, doesn't it?

00:42:55.789 --> 00:42:57.290
&gt;&gt;Nick: I don't think you can.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.760
I think there's no programmatic way to turn
on Wi-Fi direct, if that's what you're talking

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760
about.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.829
I think it requires user intervention.

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:08.309
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's, there's an emerging standard
for this, isn't there?

00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:11.660
It's like sort of a, it's a recognized practice.

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.369
I just don't know if we've implemented it
yet.

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:14.369
I don't think we have.

00:43:14.369 --> 00:43:18.690
&gt;&gt;Nick: Paul, can you be a bit more specific
about what you mean by Wi-Fi communication

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:19.690
channel.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:20.690
What are you trying to do?

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:25.690
&gt;&gt;Matt: I've kind of got this image of someone
scanning an NFC card and then input in the

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:26.690
Wi-Fi password or something.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.690
And turning it on.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:28.690
And just—

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:29.690
&gt;&gt;Nick: I've thought about making an app like
that one.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.160
You see the hacker farms, you walk up and
you [inaudible] the Wi-Fi.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:38.390
&gt;&gt;Matt: But anyway [unintelligible] the settings
and there's some way you know to write the

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:39.970
actual pass code for that, the keyboard.

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:42.849
&gt;&gt;Nick: Which you can do.

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:44.619
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:43:44.619 --> 00:43:48.160
That'd be pretty cool.

&gt;&gt;Rich: Hey there.

00:43:57.009 --> 00:44:03.510
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Look like we've just been joined
by a new viewer, Lindon.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.109
Hello, welcome to the hangout.

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:06.109
&gt;&gt;Lindon: Hi.

00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:07.640
[loud microphone interference noises]

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.579
&gt;&gt;Sparky: is there anything you have to discuss
related to Android development?

00:44:11.579 --> 00:44:12.790
What are you working on right now?

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.829
Do you have any questions?

00:44:14.829 --> 00:44:21.369
[Hangout dings]
&gt;&gt;Nick: So Paul has provided more information

00:44:21.369 --> 00:44:24.630
in the sidebar saying that he's basically
looking to transfer data.

00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:27.950
As far as using NFC to kind of initiate the
connection.

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:30.140
And then [unintelligible] through Wi-Fi.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.640
Well the good news is, as of Jellybean, that's
exactly what Android beam does for you.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.230
So you get that for free.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:42.410
So it will initiate a Bluetooth connection
through the two devices and send it via the

00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:43.410
Bluetooth.

00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:44.859
It doesn't use any form of Wi-Fi yet.

00:44:44.859 --> 00:44:48.039
I know Samsung had rolled their own solution
there, I think.

00:44:48.039 --> 00:44:49.039
S Beam or something.

00:44:49.039 --> 00:44:50.039
Which [unintelligible] to Wi-Fi direct.

00:44:50.039 --> 00:44:51.039
Which is good for them.

00:44:51.039 --> 00:44:55.869
But at the moment the IP for Android platform
won't do that.

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:56.869
Um, so that's Jellybean onwards.

00:44:56.869 --> 00:45:03.039
If you are trying to bring that back to older
devices like I guess Gingerbread or ICS, then

00:45:03.039 --> 00:45:07.390
I imagine you could do that but you'd be setting
up an insecure Bluetooth connection.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:10.330
But I would have to look into that.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:11.700
Haven't tried it myself.

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:12.700
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:19.180
Yeah I don't know if there's any part of that
Bluetooth connection that would need the secure

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.180
part of the system.

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.180
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think, yeah.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:25.009
&gt;&gt;Rich: But you can have a Bluetooth zero
connection actually without the user's [inaudible].

00:45:25.009 --> 00:45:30.000
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think it also needs the exchange
there, the NFC. 'cause most of the NFC stuff

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.440
is about pushing your way.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:36.039
And where this is an opportunity to exchange
like [inaudible] or whatever.

00:45:36.039 --> 00:45:37.039
[inaudible]

00:45:37.039 --> 00:45:38.150
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:44.019
Of course NFC is just a great way to transmit
a shared secret because it works over such

00:45:44.019 --> 00:45:45.609
a short range.

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:50.720
So that's why it's ideal for bootstrapping
something like a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:51.720
&gt;&gt;Rich:[inaudible]

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.350

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:00.630
Cool.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:01.630
Yeah.

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:03.760

&gt;&gt;Sparky: That was nice.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:14.640
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well I saw a plus one thing in the
comments on the Google plus hangout.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.779
There's a Google plus hangout.

00:46:15.779 --> 00:46:17.700
You would have thought they would have had
plus one buttons, but.

00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.200
You have to make them yourself.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.810
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, it's a good idea.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.980
But it looks almost suggestively obscene.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:25.980
I don't know.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:26.980
[laughs]

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:32.900
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] have any, it died and
there's a hangout so there's no URL to which

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:33.900
to go.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.269
&gt;&gt;Rich: Are we up to ten?

00:46:35.269 --> 00:46:38.319
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, have we answered everyone's questions?

00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:39.319
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh!

00:46:39.319 --> 00:46:42.119
We've got another new one come in.

00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:43.710
From "S" from Nowhere.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:45.700
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] out.

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.849
&gt;&gt;Rich: Uh, it's a long one.

00:46:47.849 --> 00:46:50.140
That's all right there.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:55.119
"How do you make those one by one shortcut
widgets which link to other widgets?

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:56.220
But the one by one settings.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.650
Also, is there a high level summary of these
somewhere?

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.240
I couldn't find anything in the API guides
search section?"

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.119
So, a one by one widget is just that.

00:47:06.119 --> 00:47:09.779
You just give it out, well, like an icon.

00:47:09.779 --> 00:47:10.779
One by one.

00:47:10.779 --> 00:47:11.990
You [inaudible]

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.410
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible]

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.410
[laughter]

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:19.720
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, when you touch it, it files
an intent which launches the settings page.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.890
You can see those intents often if you plug
the device, I don't know why I'm doing it.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:23.890
Sorry, I'm not bored.

00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:29.079
If you plug your device into your ADB long
cat.

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:31.880
It's often, when you press settings, you'll
see the settings intents file.

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:33.609
And you just need to file the same intent.

00:47:33.609 --> 00:47:35.440
They're all listed.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.200
So all the service intents documented as well.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.750
So you can build them very quickly and usually
it's these one by one widgets.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.640
For about five rows of code.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:48.730
It's nice if you put different resolution
icons in there.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:53.099
So people on different devices having the
ability to get them the best one.

00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:54.309
And then touch it and file intent.

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:55.339
&gt;&gt;Nick: I don't quite get what you mean by
link to other widgets.

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.869
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm. like the one by one settings.

00:47:56.869 --> 00:48:02.130
Oh, do you think when you say, "settings"
and then it says, "do you want settings for

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.910
this, this, or this, or this?"

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.299
So, widget settings.

00:48:06.299 --> 00:48:07.299
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:48:07.299 --> 00:48:08.299
Don't know.

00:48:08.299 --> 00:48:10.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Do we do that?

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.170
I think we do.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.170
They did it on [inaudible]

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:13.170
&gt;&gt;Matt: [inaudible]

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.690
And if you drop it, it'll say then, yeah,
so that's just it.

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.820
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's just your configuration [inaudible]

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.050
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yep.

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:22.050
OK.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:23.050
Does he mean the folder--?

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:27.470
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, so basically the feature of
widgets which is when you picked it, and you

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.970
add it to the home screen, you can optionally
then have a configuration setup.

00:48:30.970 --> 00:48:33.109
So, you supply this configuration activity.

00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:38.589
At which point they can then pick what actually
you wanted to stay on that widget.

00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:43.030
So that's, so check out the widget docs for
that configuration info.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:45.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes.

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.059
Just in case they are actually watching.

00:48:47.059 --> 00:48:50.109
&gt;&gt;Nick: And are there any [inaudible] docs
anywhere.

00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:51.109
Yes.

00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:52.109
&gt;&gt;Rich: [laughs]

00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:53.109
&gt;&gt;Nick: Are you?

00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:54.660
&gt;&gt;Sparky: So I did get one more questions
in the Moderator.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:59.150
Which said "Can you please look at this issue
in the IssueTracker?"

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.380
Which I'll go ahead and read.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:07.010
He says, um "I override getchildstaticstransformation
to create my own transformations according

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:08.010
to locations.

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:11.509
The child I am drawing every child worked
fine before Jellybean but fails when hardware

00:49:11.509 --> 00:49:13.249
acceleration is on."

00:49:13.249 --> 00:49:15.009
Etcetera, etcetera.

00:49:15.009 --> 00:49:21.210
And yeah, some canvas drawing operations are
not supported in hardware acceleration.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:24.049
I don't know if this is one of them.

00:49:24.049 --> 00:49:29.039
But every time I've reported something like
this to the guys on the engineering team,

00:49:29.039 --> 00:49:32.890
the one who implemented it, usually Romain
Guy, says, "Oh yeah, that's not supported

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:34.710
in hardware acceleration.

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:37.670
Just turn off hardware acceleration and use
software rendering."

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:47.420
So I would say, in cases like this, if software
rendering is acceptable, then just you know,

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:49.630
bite the bullet and use that.

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:54.329
Otherwise, we can look into it and see if
it's a bug but it's probably not a bug.

00:49:54.329 --> 00:49:55.410
So.

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:59.839
It's probably intentionally not hardware accelerated,
is my guess.

00:49:59.839 --> 00:50:02.140
Let's see.

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:09.049
&gt;&gt;Nick: Hey Al, how's it going?

00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:13.260
&gt;&gt;Al: Hey guys, pretty good.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.190
I was trying to join using a mobile device
but was having no luck.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.999
So I thought I'd go back to the PC.

00:50:18.999 --> 00:50:19.999
[laughter]

00:50:19.999 --> 00:50:20.999
&gt;&gt;Nick: Aw.

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:21.999
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh dear.

00:50:21.999 --> 00:50:23.779
It's a relatively new feature.

00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:28.920
&gt;&gt;Al: I could hear you guys but I couldn't
see any video and couldn't broadcast audio.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.920
Couldn't broadcast video.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.049
But as you say, it's early days, so.

00:50:32.049 --> 00:50:33.049
&gt;&gt;Rich: Wow.

00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:37.720
&gt;&gt;Al: I did get one, uh, basically, more than
five second delay.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.279
So it was wanting to report a "application
not responding."

00:50:41.279 --> 00:50:42.400
So I put that through.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.859
Hopefully things will get better.

00:50:45.859 --> 00:50:46.859
[laughter]

00:50:46.859 --> 00:50:47.940
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:48.940
[laughter]

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.019
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh.

00:50:50.019 --> 00:50:54.839
&gt;&gt;Nick: You got any questions this week, Al,
or are you just hanging out?

00:50:54.839 --> 00:50:55.859
&gt;&gt;Al: I'm just hanging out.

00:50:55.859 --> 00:51:00.349
I've been playing with the multi window stuff
on the Samsung Note, so—

00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:01.349
&gt;&gt;Nick: Cool.

00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:06.819
&gt;&gt;Al: It's, I've been doing a bit of delving
into it and it's written in a way that potentially

00:51:06.819 --> 00:51:10.660
could appear in a future version of Android
if I guess all the legal guys work it out

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.580
and it's all deemed acceptable.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:14.789
So it could be useful little bit of technology.

00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:16.460
&gt;&gt;Nick: So I've not actually tried it yet.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.859
So this is in the Galaxy Note ten, one.

00:51:18.859 --> 00:51:19.859
Right?

00:51:19.859 --> 00:51:22.720
And you said it's also present in the S three
which lets you have two apps on the screen

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720
at once, right?

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.849
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah, basically splits the ten inch
screen in two.

00:51:26.849 --> 00:51:31.829
So when you've got it in landscape mode, you
can have one app on the left and one app on

00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:32.869
the right.

00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:34.440
And they get equal spacing.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.970
But it's only for a certain select few applications.

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.599
Which are part of the stock firmware.

00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:46.030
Um, the reason behind that, is there's a lot
of private APIs that are used to firstly detect

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:50.529
whether it's, the functionality to do two
apps on the screen at once is present.

00:51:50.529 --> 00:51:55.240
And secondly actually to implement the switch
between the dual screen mode and single screen

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.240
mode.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.819
&gt;&gt;Nick: So is it, well my concern is, it's
not really a dual screen mode.

00:52:00.819 --> 00:52:02.349
It's, one app that's actually--

00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:04.760
[loud unintelligible talking from other hangout

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.520
&gt;&gt;Al: Sorry Nick, I lost you there, mate.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:08.520
I just got—

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:10.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: So my concern, like I said I've not
played with it.

00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:16.700
But I've only seen, this is all based on the
Burgess feature review of the ten one note.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:20.549
It looked like one app was kind of paused
and one app was kinda running.

00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:25.160
So that if you tried to switch back and forth
there'd be like a, I don't know, what, you

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.210
kind of like unpause the other application,
you run back to the other, had to unpause

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:29.920
that one, and—

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:35.019
&gt;&gt;Al: It, from what I can see, the judder
doesn't seem to be noticeable.

00:52:35.019 --> 00:52:39.580
It may be that only one is active at any one
time and certainly when dialogs pop up they

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.029
can be modal dialogs.

00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:44.680
You can't switch to the other app and leave
the modal dialog on one of them.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.200
It takes control of the whole screen.

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.660
It's, it may be pausing it.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.440
I would suspect it is.

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:55.019
But it's nothing that's sort of a severe judder
on most of the switches.

00:52:55.019 --> 00:52:56.940
I guess that's something that they've sorted
out recently.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:00.480
'Cause there was one firmware update I've
had for it so far.

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.720
&gt;&gt;Rich: Interesting.

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:07.599
[Hangout dings]
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, I did see they are using the

00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:08.599
Android name space.

00:53:08.599 --> 00:53:12.010
They've just gone right in there, and added
the Android name space.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.089
&gt;&gt;Al: [laughs] Yeah, they've used Android.sec.

00:53:14.089 --> 00:53:16.730
Samsung electrical corporation.

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:19.510
So they're trying to tuck it away in their
own little area.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:25.099
But the way it's written, the actual multi
window, window manager is very similar to

00:53:25.099 --> 00:53:27.829
the window manager that already exists in
Android.

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:32.569
So my, from looking at the S3 firmware as
well, it looks very much like they're using

00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:38.030
this as a base part of all of their Ice Cream
Sandwich and Jellybean firmwares.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:42.349
And this is why I think it's a potential for
being upstreamed and put into the IO SP at

00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:43.349
some point.

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:48.369
Because the way it's written, it wouldn't
involve a lot of changes for most applications.

00:53:48.369 --> 00:53:49.880
To make use of it.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: Interesting.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:59.220
So, it makes an interesting scenario is where
an app going from a full window into a half

00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:02.880
window, like what new configuration do they
get notified.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.299
&gt;&gt;Rich: I assume it switches to portrait.

00:54:05.299 --> 00:54:06.299
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah, it does.

00:54:06.299 --> 00:54:07.299
It does.

00:54:07.299 --> 00:54:08.299
It switches to portrait.

00:54:08.299 --> 00:54:09.950
And it's, it's exactly the same as you've
got, an orientation rotation.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:10.950
So it's--

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:11.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah?

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:16.609
It was the pad phone I guess was one of the
first devices that you know, had those quite

00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:20.290
drastic changes in configuration and most
apps just died.

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:21.450
Don't they?

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.195
When you plug the phone into the tablet.

00:54:23.195 --> 00:54:26.170
&gt;&gt;Al: The Sony P series is exactly the same
thing.

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:28.700
That's the one with the two screens and the
clamshell design.

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:34.491
You've got a button on the task bar which
allows you to make apps on both screens or

00:54:34.491 --> 00:54:36.099
limited them to one.

00:54:36.099 --> 00:54:39.579
And even stuff like Google Music was crashing
originally.

00:54:39.579 --> 00:54:41.920
So, it's there's stuff to be wary of.

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:45.609
But from what I've seen of the framework stuff.

00:54:45.609 --> 00:54:50.810
And looking at some of the way they've implemented
it, it looks almost the same as any app would

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:54.190
get, by being put on a phone and twisted in
orientation.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:58.549
So most apps, most well written apps, should
be able to handle it a lot easier than the

00:54:58.549 --> 00:55:02.910
kind of huge change in dimensions that was
present when you were using things like the

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:05.009
P Series and the Pad Phone and stuff like
that.

00:55:05.009 --> 00:55:06.009
&gt;&gt;Nick: Interesting.

00:55:06.009 --> 00:55:09.359
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah, it will be interesting to see
how it goes.

00:55:09.359 --> 00:55:11.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: Were you just dissecting it first,
though?

00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.990
&gt;&gt;Al: I was.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:18.690
It's one of those things that I've been working
with some devices that do TV's and when you've

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:23.300
got the space for a TV, having two apps on
the screen at once is quite possible.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:27.519
So it was interesting to see whether it could
be an Android driven device.

00:55:27.519 --> 00:55:30.289
And doing those two things on screen at once.

00:55:30.289 --> 00:55:32.880
&gt;&gt;Matt: IT would be interesting to see what
it does with intents.

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.930
Like open intents have started becoming a
lot more feasible, you can then just start

00:55:37.930 --> 00:55:39.410
launching apps on the others.

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:44.160
So it comes a part of your app and then starts
communicating on the same sort of basis.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.579
Like at the same time.

00:55:45.579 --> 00:55:46.599
Be kind of cool.

00:55:46.599 --> 00:55:47.710
&gt;&gt;Al: It would be brilliant.

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:51.990
At the moment, all that happens is when you
select multiscreen you get the drop down list

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:53.529
of like five or six apps.

00:55:53.529 --> 00:55:55.479
And you select which other one you want to
go in the pane.

00:55:55.479 --> 00:55:56.479
So it's limited like that.

00:55:56.479 --> 00:55:57.479
But yeah.

00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:58.479
That would be a really cool—

00:55:58.479 --> 00:56:03.349
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] those apps are Samsung
Mail, Samsung Browser, not Gmail and Chrome.

00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:09.210
&gt;&gt;Al: The browser is actually the Android
stock browser with very small amount of tweaks.

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.499
I did a quick comparison of some of the classes.

00:56:11.499 --> 00:56:14.700
And most of the tweaks seem to be in the UI
rather than anything more fundamental.

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:20.690
And that's literally because the way they've
implemented it, they've put in the action

00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:24.819
bar the button to go between multi-screen
and single screen mode, rather than making

00:56:24.819 --> 00:56:29.520
it part of the strip bar at the bottom where
the most of the buttons, most of the settings

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:30.520
are.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:36.599
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well, it's decompiling framework.Java
for fun and profit.

00:56:36.599 --> 00:56:37.599
[laughter]

00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:40.130
&gt;&gt;Nick: So I think that pretty much brings
us to the end of our time.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:56:41.130 --> 00:56:44.819
If we didn't get to answer your question today,
but I think we got through most of them.

00:56:44.819 --> 00:56:46.819
Um, same time next week.

00:56:46.819 --> 00:56:49.609
Don't know if there's anything special on
next Wednesday?

00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:53.309
Um, thank you all for joining us today in
the hangout.

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:55.369
And answering such, answering?

00:56:55.369 --> 00:56:57.430
Asking such good questions.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:58.430
[laughs]

00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:59.490
&gt;&gt;Matt: Thanks guys.

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:00.509
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yep.

00:57:00.509 --> 00:57:02.059
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Answering, too.

00:57:02.059 --> 00:57:03.089
&gt;&gt;Matt: Cheers.

00:57:03.089 --> 00:57:04.119
Bye, everyone.
