00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:06.840
Can you believe it?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.370
We've made 50 of these dumb things!

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.160
From the 
guy who made Batman comics cool again

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
and the guy who’ll probably make Batman
movies suck again

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.919
comes a film based on a graphic novel

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.680
based on an older film

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.899
based on ancient Greek propaganda

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.830
based on a true story...

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.000
300.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.360
Before the release of the unnecessary sequel
on a boat

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.100
revisit the movie that made guys everywhere
feel really out of shape.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.630
Meet the Spartans, a society built on reason,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.260
sit ups,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.770
and child abuse.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.840
Led by Leonidas, cinema’s yelliest king

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.289
"This is Sparta!"

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.289
"Spartans!"

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.739
"No mercy!"

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.739
"No!"

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.739
"Regroup!"

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.010
"Stay on!"

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.100
"Tonight we dine in hell!"

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.540
Who hails from the Scottish part of Greece?

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.700
"We've been sharing our culture with you all
morning."

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.560
Watch as Leonidas and his 300 closest gym
buddies stand against the might of Xerxes,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.850
a hairless giant with an entire jewelry store
on his face

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.930
and a voice that sounds like he’s in the
witness protection program.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.420
"I will erase even the memory of Sparta from
the histories."

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.490
Lace up your sandals for a blend of historical
truth and Zack Snyder nonsense,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.490
mixing

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.229
real Greek battle formations

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.570
qith crazy ninja spin moves,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.189
real Spartan councils

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:41.590
with sexy stripper oracles,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.750
and actual Persian fighting units

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.760
With mutant Persian goat men?

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.760
Huh?

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.820
Oil up for the most confusing thing to happen
to teenage boys since calculus class,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.479
full of homoerotic undertones like

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.840
Men wearing thongs

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.409
Men getting speared with phallic objects

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.340
Men holding hands

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.179
Men holding men tenderly from behind

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:07.189
Men letting it hang

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.530
Men getting all wet in the rain

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.320
Men getting all sweaty on the beach.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.040
Men playing two flutes at the same time

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.959
Men saying things like this:

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.120
“A fine thrust.”

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120
or this:

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.000
"Your Athenian rivals will kneel at your feet
if you will but kneel at mine."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.410
And a male-to-female nipple ratio of 600 to
4.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.680
Man, I haven’t seen a movie this deep in
the closet since Top Gun!

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.349
"I am dangerous!"

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.790
So get pumped for a dumb movie that’s only
cool because of Zack Snyder’s bag of overused

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.989
visual tricks

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:43.989

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.650
And

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.280
suuuper

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.910
sloooow

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.549
moootion.

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.549
Come on!

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.629
I might as well be reading the book!

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.930

Cersei Lannister?

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.980
McNulty?

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.260
and Michael Fassbender?!

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.129
300

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:35.040
One cool looking movie and now he gets to
make Batman vs. Superman?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040
Great.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.099
Thanks for watching our 50th Honest Trailer.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.000
Who knows - maybe someday we'll make it to
300!

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.730
Hehe, get it?

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.730
Ugh.
