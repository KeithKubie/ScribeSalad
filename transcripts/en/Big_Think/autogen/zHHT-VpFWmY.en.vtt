do know exists starting with that then

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060
do know exists starting with that then
 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.659
do know exists starting with that then
starting to go off on tangents and to

and again that the process of
 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:31.710
and again that the process of
digitization began to pay benefits first

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720
digitization began to pay benefits first
 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.350

immense transformation of digitization
 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.659
immense transformation of digitization
and this appears primarily not in

actually the power of digitization
 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.110
actually the power of digitization
actually adds time to the process

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120
actually adds time to the process
 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.390
actually adds time to the process

more convenient but also the sheer

more convenient but also the sheer
 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.309
more convenient but also the sheer
amount of material means that the

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319
amount of material means that the
 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.800
amount of material means that the
process actually takes longer if you're

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810
process actually takes longer if you're
 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.440
process actually takes longer if you're
