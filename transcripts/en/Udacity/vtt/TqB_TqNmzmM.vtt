00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.840
So now we understand our persona for our pizza app, Dorm

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.980
Room Debbie. We know all about her attributes and we understand

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.580
her use cases. So in a minute we're going to talk about

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.530
how we can build feature lists that are perfect for Debbie.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah but before we do that though let's address the elephant in the room.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.720
&gt;&gt; We actually didn't have an elephant so

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.840
we got this thing instead. The Abominable Snowman?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.610
&gt;&gt; So where did these persona attributes and use cases come from?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.710
&gt;&gt; How to we validate that they're

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.060
representative of actual users in the real world?

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.480
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.650
the way we do that is there's an

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.270
entire field called UX research which does just that.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.740
&gt;&gt; There are folks that go out in the world and

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.090
they use a variety of tools like interviewing people, observing their behavior.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.210
&gt;&gt; They have things hypnography and they figure what people

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.890
do, what tasks want to perform with technology in their

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.330
daily lives and what they expect from this technology. Exactly,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.580
so they give us all the data to help us build

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.980
the really informed personas in news cases so we

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.830
know that our designs are going to be really accurate.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah and we're going to see a video just now from Rich

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.850
that talks about UX Research and why it's important and how it's done.
