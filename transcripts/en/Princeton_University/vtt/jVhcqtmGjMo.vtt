00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.150
[music]

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.230
David Heinz:
I'm Dave Heinz.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.440
David Clifton:
I'm David Clifton, and we are both

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.500 position:78%
David Clifton:
undergraduates in Professor Naomi Leonard's lab at

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.280
David Clifton:
Princeton University.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.350 position:67%
David Heinz:
And we're working on controlling underwater

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.170
David Heinz:
autonomous vehicles.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.010 position:89%
David Heinz:
So, our most important task here, what we were hired for,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.320 position:72%
David Heinz:
was to make a system to control these vehicles
under water.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.890 position:81%
David Heinz:
And to start that we had to model them, make a good,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.070
David Heinz:
accurate model which we could
use to predict how they were

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.470 position:70%
David Heinz:
going to behave, then control them like that.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.640
David Heinz:
This testbed setup allows us
to test algorithms that have

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.900
David Heinz:
been proposed in theory, but
never used in the real world,

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.750
David Heinz:
and see how they actually work
before they're implemented in

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.740 position:72%
David Heinz:
somewhere more expensive and more complicated.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.530
David Clifton:
This is the beluga

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.120
David Clifton:
that we use for testing.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.950 position:63%
David Clifton:
The vertical thruster provides
vertical motion, much like a helicopter.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.620 position:61%
David Clifton:
These bolts hold down the black plastic

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.100
David Clifton:
top used for tracking.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.950
David Clifton:
It provides very nice contrast
against the white bottom of

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.060 position:58%
David Clifton:
the tank, for the cameras to pick up.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.140 position:66%
David Clifton:
This foam top is very buoyant, relative to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.780
David Clifton:
the rest of the beluga.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.300 position:66%
David Clifton:
This is the metal water-tight compartment.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.040
David Clifton:
It has the computer inside of
it, the pressure sensor on

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.570
David Clifton:
this side over here, and then
it's what controls the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.960
David Clifton:
outputs, given via the tether here.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.250
David Clifton:
This is the servo that angles
this back motor, and back

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.100
David Clifton:
motor provides thrust, so it can
do, basically, two degrees

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.300
David Clifton:
of freedom.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.810
David Clifton:
This keel works oppositely of
the foam top, and provides a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.750
David Clifton:
lot of weight at the bottom,
to help to keep the beluga

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.580
David Clifton:
oriented, and that's pretty
much everything.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:47.730
[music]

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.210 position:59%
David Heinz:
We use four cameras hooked up to image

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.000
David Heinz:
processing software in a
computer to give us the

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840 position:70%
David Heinz:
real-time position of the beluga in the tank.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.100
David Heinz:
And this allows us to close the
loop, which is our goal in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.820
David Heinz:
the control system, so we know
where we are and we know where

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.530
David Heinz:
we have to go,


00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.660 position:69%
David Heinz:
and that allows us to know how to get there.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.290
[music]

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.960 position:59%
David Clifton:
These four cameras are responsible for

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.410 position:69%
David Clifton:
tracking the beluga in the horizontal plane.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.130 position:66%
David Clifton:
Each camera corresponds, roughly, with one

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.780
David Clifton:
quadrant of the tank.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.720
David Clifton:
And as the beluga makes its
way around the tank, the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.370
David Clifton:
camera responsible for tracking
it switches on automatically.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.140 position:69%
David Heinz:
On a day-to-day basis, though, we're looking

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.510
David Heinz:
at anything from a full day in
the machine shop to sitting

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.290
David Heinz:
around, testing MATLAB code,
modifying a full C program of

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.600 position:63%
David Heinz:
tracking, or even just arguing about how

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.780
David Heinz:
best to make our model.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.310
David Heinz:
There's a whole lot of stuff
we have to do, and now that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.080
David Heinz:
we've fixed most of the things
that were broken, we spend a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.200
David Heinz:
lot of time tinkering with our
model, adjusting parameters to

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.330
David Heinz:
make it represent the real
system better, and comparing

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.000
David Heinz:
it to the real results.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.830
David Heinz:
Well, what's been really cool,
I think I can speak for both

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.100
David Heinz:
of us on this, is that we've
been able to take things we've

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.610
David Heinz:
learned in textbooks, we've seen
on paper, and actually

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.750
David Heinz:
implement them in the real world.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.580
David Heinz:
There are no simulations here.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.360
David Heinz:
We actually take our algorithm,
we write it up into

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.420
David Heinz:
code, and we run it,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.820 position:56%
David Heinz:
and we see what happens in the tank.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.410
David Heinz:
We can tell if it works or not.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.120 position:63%
David Heinz:
And that's an experience we can't really

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.370
David Heinz:
have any other way.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:40.640
