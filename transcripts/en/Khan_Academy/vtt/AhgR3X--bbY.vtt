00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:03.201
Voiceover: You'll hear
the word "tax bracket"

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:04.207
thrown around a lot,

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:06.538
and there's often a misunderstanding

00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:09.193
of what a tax bracket is,

00:00:09.193 --> 00:00:11.140
so that's what we're
going to do in this video.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.276
I'm going to do it in a
very general, simple way

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:16.433
that doesn't use the exact same tax code

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.803
of any particular country,

00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:19.472
but most countries use

00:00:19.472 --> 00:00:21.739
some kind of a progressive tax system,

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.701
that has some type of tax brackets.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.612
Let's say my country has a tax code

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:36.789
that says between $0 of
income and $10,000 of income

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:39.570
you pay no taxes on it,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.924
and then between 10,000
and, let say, 50,000,

00:00:44.924 --> 00:00:46.527
let me write that a little bit neater,

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:49.859
between 10,000 and 50,000,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.854
so that's 50,000 right over there,

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:56.010
you pay 20% of your income,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.860
and then let's just say,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.863
this is very simple;

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.853
much simpler than any
actual tax codes out there;

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:07.257
let's say anything above
$50,000, you pay 30%.

00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:09.322
30% of your income.

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:11.457
The reason why I say that
there is confusion here

00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:12.458
is many people feel

00:01:12.458 --> 00:01:14.661
that if their income
throws them into a bracket,

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.459
that they pay 20% on all of their money,

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:18.864
but that's not the way it works.

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:20.989
Let's just do a couple of examples.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:22.790
Let's say that someone earns ...

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.524
let's say income,

00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:31.001
and then let's think about
how much taxes they will pay.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.523
Let's say someone makes $5,000 in income.

00:01:34.523 --> 00:01:36.257
How much taxes would they pay?

00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:38.727
The first $10,000 you pay no taxes,

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:42.487
so they'd pay $0 in taxes.

00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:45.657
Let's say someone has $15,000.

00:01:45.657 --> 00:01:48.051
$15,000 in income.

00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:50.389
How much taxes would they pay?

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:54.991
They would pay 0% on the first $10,000,

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.789
so it would be 0% x $10,000.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.321
x Â£10,000,

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.909
and then the next 5,000,

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.896
they're going to be right over here,

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:08.923
the next 5,000 they're going to pay 20%.

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:15.401
So, + 20% x the next $5,000.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.354
The next $5,000.

00:02:17.354 --> 00:02:18.723
They'll pay, this is just 0,

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:20.928
then 20% of $5,000.

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:24.666
They will pay $1,000 in taxes.

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.384
The misconception that many people have

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:29.669
is, "Oh, $15,000 puts me
into this middle bracket,

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:34.080
"so I'm going to have to
pay 20% on all $15,000,"

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.856
and that's not the way it works.

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:38.300
You only pay 20% for the increment

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.880
that throws you in that bracket.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.586
Just for the $5,000.

00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:44.547
Let's do another example.

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:47.993
Let's say that someone makes $100,000.

00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:51.326
Let's say that someone makes $100,000.

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:53.059
$100,000.

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.913
How much taxes would they pay?

00:02:54.913 --> 00:02:57.281
It wouldn't be that they're
in this last bracket,

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:01.029
so they'd pay 30% on
their entire $100,000.

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:03.861
They pay 0% on the first 10,000.

00:03:03.861 --> 00:03:08.281
0% x 10; I'll just write "10K" for 10,000.

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:12.529
Then they'll pay 20% on the next 40,000.

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.257
This range right over here.

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:19.255
So, + 20% x the 40,000,

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:22.653
and then they only pay 30% on
the increment of their income

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:26.086
that is above this $50,000 threshold.

00:03:26.086 --> 00:03:30.665
Then they will pay 30%.

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:34.665
They will pay 30% x the next $50,000,

00:03:34.665 --> 00:03:36.259
so 10,000 + 40 + 50.

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.862
That's what adds up to $100,000.

00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:40.454
x $50,000.

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.586
This adds up to, well, this is nothing.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:49.082
20% of $40,000 is going to be $8,000.

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:57.088
Then 30% of $50,000 is going to be 15,000.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:59.515
Is going to be $15,000.

00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:01.835
In this situation, the
person will not pay 30%

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.526
on the entire 100,000.

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:07.010
They will pay 8,000 + $15,000,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.462
which is equal to $23,000 in income taxes.
