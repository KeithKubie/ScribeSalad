output the prediction which you only
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.679
output the prediction which you only
call y hat which is your estimate of Y

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
call y hat which is your estimate of Y
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.950

more formally you want Y hat to be the
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.530
more formally you want Y hat to be the
probability or the chance the Y is equal

to 1 given the input features X so in

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
to 1 given the input features X so in
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450
to 1 given the input features X so in
other words if X is a picture as we saw

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
other words if X is a picture as we saw
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.910

in the last video you want Y hat to tell

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
in the last video you want Y hat to tell
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619
in the last video you want Y hat to tell
you what is the chance that this is a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.459
you what is the chance that this is a
cat picture so X as we said in the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
cat picture so X as we said in the
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.729

previous video is a MX dimensional

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
previous video is a MX dimensional
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.040

logistic regression will be W which is

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
logistic regression will be W which is
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.390
logistic regression will be W which is
also an annexe dimensional vector

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400
also an annexe dimensional vector
 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.789

together with B which is just a real
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.820
together with B which is just a real
number so giving an input X and the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
number so giving an input X and the
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.240
number so giving an input X and the
parameters W and B how do we generate

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
parameters W and B how do we generate
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.350
parameters W and B how do we generate
the output Y hat well one thing you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
the output Y hat well one thing you
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270
the output Y hat well one thing you
could try that doesn't work would be to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
could try that doesn't work would be to
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.770
could try that doesn't work would be to
have Y hat be W transpose X plus B you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
have Y hat be W transpose X plus B you
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.310
have Y hat be W transpose X plus B you
know kind of a linear function of the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
know kind of a linear function of the
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.670
know kind of a linear function of the
input X and in fact this is what you use

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680
input X and in fact this is what you use
 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.609
input X and in fact this is what you use
if you were doing linear regression but

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
if you were doing linear regression but
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.859
if you were doing linear regression but
this isn't a very good algorithm for

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
this isn't a very good algorithm for
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.319
this isn't a very good algorithm for
binary classification because you want Y

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
binary classification because you want Y
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.050
binary classification because you want Y
hat to be the chance that Y is equal to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
hat to be the chance that Y is equal to
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.139
hat to be the chance that Y is equal to
1 so Y hat should really be the team 0

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
1 so Y hat should really be the team 0
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.730
1 so Y hat should really be the team 0
and 1 and it's difficult to enforce that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
and 1 and it's difficult to enforce that
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.969
and 1 and it's difficult to enforce that
because W transpose X plus B can be much

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
because W transpose X plus B can be much
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.039
because W transpose X plus B can be much
bigger than 1 or can even be negative

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
bigger than 1 or can even be negative
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.289
bigger than 1 or can even be negative
which doesn't make sense for probability

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
which doesn't make sense for probability
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.069
which doesn't make sense for probability
that you want to be between 0 &amp; 1 so in

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
that you want to be between 0 &amp; 1 so in
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.139
that you want to be between 0 &amp; 1 so in
logistic regression our output is is

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
logistic regression our output is is
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.839
logistic regression our output is is
there going to be Y hat equals the

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
there going to be Y hat equals the
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.059
there going to be Y hat equals the
sigmoid function applied to this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
sigmoid function applied to this
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.420
sigmoid function applied to this
quantity this is what the sick one

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430
quantity this is what the sick one
 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.319
quantity this is what the sick one
looks like if on the horizontal axis I

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329
looks like if on the horizontal axis I
 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.569
looks like if on the horizontal axis I
plot Z then the function sigmoid of Z

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579
plot Z then the function sigmoid of Z
 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.390
plot Z then the function sigmoid of Z
look like this so it goes smoothly from

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400
look like this so it goes smoothly from
 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.670
look like this so it goes smoothly from
0 up to 1 let me label my axes here this

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680
0 up to 1 let me label my axes here this
 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.610
0 up to 1 let me label my axes here this
is 0 and it crosses the vertical axis at

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620
is 0 and it crosses the vertical axis at
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.479
is 0 and it crosses the vertical axis at
0.5 so this is what sigmoid of z looks

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489
0.5 so this is what sigmoid of z looks
 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.270
0.5 so this is what sigmoid of z looks
like and we're going to use Z to denote

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280
like and we're going to use Z to denote
 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.300
like and we're going to use Z to denote
this quantity W transpose X plus B just

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310
this quantity W transpose X plus B just
 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.490
this quantity W transpose X plus B just
the formula for the sigmoid function

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500
the formula for the sigmoid function
 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.629
the formula for the sigmoid function
sigmoid of Z where Z is a real number is

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639
sigmoid of Z where Z is a real number is
 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.690
sigmoid of Z where Z is a real number is
1 over 1 plus P to the negative T so

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700
1 over 1 plus P to the negative T so
 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.440
1 over 1 plus P to the negative T so
notice a couple things if Z is very

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
notice a couple things if Z is very
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.890
notice a couple things if Z is very
large then e to the negative Z will be

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900
large then e to the negative Z will be
 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.280
large then e to the negative Z will be
close to 0 so then sigmoid of Z will be

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290
close to 0 so then sigmoid of Z will be
 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.220
close to 0 so then sigmoid of Z will be
approximately 1 over 1 plus something

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230
approximately 1 over 1 plus something
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.959
approximately 1 over 1 plus something
very close to 0 because you know e to

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:07.969
very close to 0 because you know e to
 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.300
very close to 0 because you know e to
negative of the very large number will

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310
negative of the very large number will
 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.030
negative of the very large number will
be close to 0 so this is close to 1

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
be close to 0 so this is close to 1
 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.640
be close to 0 so this is close to 1
and indeed we if you look on the plots

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
and indeed we if you look on the plots
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.920
and indeed we if you look on the plots
on the left is Z is very large then

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930
on the left is Z is very large then
 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.399
on the left is Z is very large then
sigmoid of Z it is very close to 1

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409
sigmoid of Z it is very close to 1
 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.180
sigmoid of Z it is very close to 1
conversely if Z is very small or it is a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190
conversely if Z is very small or it is a
 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.879
conversely if Z is very small or it is a
very large negative number then sigmoid

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889
very large negative number then sigmoid
 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:38.949
very large negative number then sigmoid
of z becomes 1 over 1 plus e to the

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959
of z becomes 1 over 1 plus e to the
 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.770
of z becomes 1 over 1 plus e to the
negative Z and this becomes needs a huge

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780
negative Z and this becomes needs a huge
 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.499
negative Z and this becomes needs a huge
number so this becomes you know think of

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:44.509
number so this becomes you know think of
 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.499
number so this becomes you know think of
it as 1 over 1 plus a number that is

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509
it as 1 over 1 plus a number that is
 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:56.140
it as 1 over 1 plus a number that is
very very big and so that's close to 0

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150
very very big and so that's close to 0
 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.629
very very big and so that's close to 0
and indeed you see that as Z becomes a

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639
and indeed you see that as Z becomes a
 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.300
and indeed you see that as Z becomes a
very large negative number sigmoid of z

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310
very large negative number sigmoid of z
 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.119
very large negative number sigmoid of z
you know goes very close to 0 so when

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129
you know goes very close to 0 so when
 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.339
you know goes very close to 0 so when
you implement logistic regression your

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349
you implement logistic regression your
 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.309
you implement logistic regression your
job is to try to learn parameters W and

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319
job is to try to learn parameters W and
 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.610
job is to try to learn parameters W and
B so that Y hat becomes a good estimate

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620
B so that Y hat becomes a good estimate
 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.920
B so that Y hat becomes a good estimate
of the chance of Y being equal to 1

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930
of the chance of Y being equal to 1

feature called x0 and with that equal to

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430
feature called x0 and with that equal to
 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.730
feature called x0 and with that equal to
one so that now X is in R of and X plus

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740
one so that now X is in R of and X plus
 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.760
one so that now X is in R of and X plus
one and then you define Y hat to be

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770
one and then you define Y hat to be
 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.750
one and then you define Y hat to be
equal to Sigma of theta transpose X in

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760
equal to Sigma of theta transpose X in
 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.180
equal to Sigma of theta transpose X in
this alternative notational convention

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190
this alternative notational convention
 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.350
this alternative notational convention
you have a vector parameters theta theta

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360
you have a vector parameters theta theta
 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.190
you have a vector parameters theta theta
0 theta 1 theta 2 down to theta and X

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200
0 theta 1 theta 2 down to theta and X
 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.630
0 theta 1 theta 2 down to theta and X
and so theta 0 plays the role of D

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640
and so theta 0 plays the role of D
 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.420
and so theta 0 plays the role of D
that's just a real number and theta 1

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430
that's just a real number and theta 1
 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.330
that's just a real number and theta 1
down to theta and X play the role of W

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340
down to theta and X play the role of W
 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.430
down to theta and X play the role of W
it turns out when you implement your

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440
it turns out when you implement your
 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.800
it turns out when you implement your
neural network will be easier to just

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810
neural network will be easier to just
 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.940
neural network will be easier to just
keep B and W as separate parameters and

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950
keep B and W as separate parameters and
 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.880
keep B and W as separate parameters and
so in this class we will not use any of

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890
so in this class we will not use any of
 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.800
so in this class we will not use any of
this notational convention that I just

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810
this notational convention that I just
 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.990
this notational convention that I just
wrote in red if you've not seen this

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000
wrote in red if you've not seen this
 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.180
wrote in red if you've not seen this
notation before in other classes don't

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190
notation before in other classes don't
 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.250
notation before in other classes don't
worry about it it's just that for those

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260
worry about it it's just that for those
 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.170
worry about it it's just that for those
of you that have seen this notation I

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180
of you that have seen this notation I
 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.390
of you that have seen this notation I
wanted to mention explicitly that we're

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400
wanted to mention explicitly that we're
 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.280
wanted to mention explicitly that we're
not using that notation in this course

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290
not using that notation in this course
 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.260
not using that notation in this course
but if you've not seen this before is

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270
but if you've not seen this before is
 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.850
but if you've not seen this before is
not important and you don't need to

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
not important and you don't need to
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.460
not important and you don't need to
worry about it so you've now seen what

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470
worry about it so you've now seen what
 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.740
worry about it so you've now seen what
the logistic regression model looks like

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750
the logistic regression model looks like
 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.130
the logistic regression model looks like
next to train the parameters W and B you

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140
next to train the parameters W and B you
 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.530
next to train the parameters W and B you
need to define a cost function let's do

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540
need to define a cost function let's do
 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.530
