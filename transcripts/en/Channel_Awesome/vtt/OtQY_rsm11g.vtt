"Mickey Mouse and the Three Musketeers"

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.020
That is... pretty much exactly what you get.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.400
Mickey, Donald, and Goofy all going off to save Princess Minnie so that evil Captain Pete

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.380
can't take over the crown. Yeah, somehow kidnapping her makes him king...

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.260
This isn't really story-based.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.300
The plot is... hmm... wait, no, that was pretty much it.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Yeah, it's about as generic and old-fashioned a cartoon plot for kids goes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.680
So, is it any good?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.400
(Uncertain mumbling)
I... well, it's...

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.340
hard to pick on something that's obviously meant for, like, *little*, little kids.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.840
I mean it's a Mickey Mouse direct-to-DVD movie.
 What do you expect?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.480
Well, but, again, I guess that's not fair;
Mickey's been in some really good stuff.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.020
There's a great short he was in called "The Prince and the Pauper".

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.860
"Fantasia" is a masterpiece. Even that "Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas" had a lot of charm to it.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.600
This, I don't really describe as a having a lot of charm, but it's... harmless.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.960
Every character and motivation is exactly what you think it's gonna be.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.000
Mickey is optimistic, but he dreams of being a "Mouseketeer".

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.940
(sigh) Did I really just say that? You know what I mean.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.640
Goofy is a doofus, but he wants to apply his brain.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.100
Donald is a coward and wants to learn how to be brave.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.960
And Minnie is a princess, so, of course, she wants to fall in love.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.840
There is nothing new or original in this.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.740
Even the songs are classical, public domain tunes that they just put lyrics to.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.400
Some of them already have lyrics. They just add new ones.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.580
I guess it's good this teaches kids classical music, but it's music you're gonna hear everywhere, anyway,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.700
and I don't know...

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.080
The animation is clearly trying, and the backgrounds are clearly trying, but nothing really stands out as... great.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.340
Everybody does exactly what you think they do. Everybody reacts exactly how you think they react.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.040
So why doesn't this work as well as, say, the Buzz Lightyear cartoon?

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.460
Well, that one still threw in some good laughs,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.320
and it was creative and had kind of a goofy story, but it also had some imagination to it.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.480
The best way I can describe this one is by looking at the opening and closing credits.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.360
You see this comic strip style? This was very popular back in the day.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.440
In fact, these Mickey Mouse comics are kind of these rarities.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.360
They're seen as this pure, innocent artwork of more simple times.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.420
They didn't have much depth. In fact, they had virtually no depth.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.720
But they were so simple and colorful that kids really loved it, and it sort of carried over for some adults.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.120
This is pretty much the same thing.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.300
It's innocent, it's harmless, but I don't really see any reason to watch it, either.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.520
It's fine for kids, I guess...

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.260
But aside from the smoothness of the animation and some of the backgrounds,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.600
nothing really screams, "Disney! Top of the game!"

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.380
But, again, it's a direct-to-DVD Mickey Mouse movie, but, AGAIN, more effort has been put into those in the past,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.940
but, again, it's not like *no* effort was put into this, but...

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.380
(sigh) I'm probably making it more complicated than it needs to be.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.880
If you're an adult, it's unlikely you'll get into it at all,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.580
but, if you're a little, little kid that just wants to see Mickey Mouse go an an adventure,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.560
it's energized, colorful, and harmless.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.100
Don't expect anything great, but, honestly, you probably weren't anyway.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.420
You're probably just expecting a Mickey Mouse cartoon, and that's what you get:

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.460
a really long Mickey Mouse cartoon.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.340
Fine for little boys and girls, but that's really about it.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.900
It's all for one, and one for... eh.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.980
*Music*
