00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.404
Although the example you just saw about eye color nicely demonstrates the

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:10.868
principles of dominant and recessive traits. The particular trait of eye color

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:16.770
is not actually as simple as we just explained it. The trait of eye color is

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.347
actually controlled by multiple genes that affect the outcome. And we call this

00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:27.880
a polygenic trait. However, there are some traits that are controlled by a

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.873
single gene in an actual dominant recessive fashion like we just explained.
