00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.716
Android O introduces a new icon
format called adaptive icons,

00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:05.340
which aim to make
our home screens more

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.250
coherent by unifying the
size and shape of all app

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.360
icons and opened the door to
interesting visual effects.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
With adaptive icons, you
supply a 108 by 108 dp icon,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.110
and the device will
apply a mass shape to it.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.360
Different devices or
third party launches

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.250
choose what shape mass to use.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.860
For example, they might use
a simple circle, a rounded

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.780
square, or perhaps a squircle.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.110
The mass is at most 72 by 72 dp
but might be smaller in parts.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.800
Mass are guaranteed not to touch
the central 66 dp of your icon.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.641
So this can be
considered a safe zone.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.390
And you should keep
any parts of your icon

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.670
that should never be
clipped within this area.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.650
Adaptive icons comprise
two separate layers,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.020
a background and a foreground,
stacked on top of one another.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.440
This allows the device to offer
interesting visual effects

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.520
by treating each
layer independently.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.030
For example, a launcher
might apply a parallax effect

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.069
when the icon is
moving by translating

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:57.360
the letters at different rates.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.300
That's why your overall asset
is larger than the mass size.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.610
The outer 18 dp on each
side will only ever

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.610
be revealed when motion
effects are applied.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.350
To add an adaptive
icon to your app,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.670
create an adaptive
icon definition in XML

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.940
like this, where you
can specify which

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.140
assets to use for the foreground
and background elements.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.430
Masses will only ever be
used on Android O devices.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.460
You can place this drawable
in the v26 configuration,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.760
so that it overrides your
standard icon on newer devices.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.680
Also new in Android
O is the ability

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.174
to use vector ovals
as launcher icons.

00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:30.090
Each of the foreground
and background elements

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.570
can be a raster asset like
pings or WebP, a vector asset,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.784
or even a color drawable.

00:01:34.784 --> 00:01:36.450
The background must
be completely opaque

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.180
while the foreground can
contain transparency.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.280
If your app also
offers app shortcuts,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.282
then they should also update
to use adaptive icons.

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:45.990
Shortcuts can be pinned
to the homescreen

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.440
right next to app icons,
so they need to fit in.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.930
If you offer a bitmap app
shortcut, such as the user's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.770
photo, then there's a new API
on icon or icon compact classes

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.900
to create an adaptive
icon from that.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.430
To help you to
create these icons,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.120
Android Studio 3.0
offers an updated wizard

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.620
where you can import or create
the foreground and background

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.240
layers.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.340
If you set your target
SDK to version 26

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.336
but don't supply
an adaptive icon,

00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:13.210
then some launchers,
like the pixel launcher,

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.240
will scale down your icon
and place it on a background.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.690
So that's what you need to
know about making your icons

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:20.680
adaptive.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.500
Doing so will ensure they fit
in with other apps on the device

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.210
and benefit from the
new possibilities

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.360
for displaying them.
