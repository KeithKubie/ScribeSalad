00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
In today's video,

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.292
we're taking really thin sheets
of aluminum, and see

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.400
if we can twist them
into something stronger,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.600
a metal rope.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.340
[Music]

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.400
On YouTube, Skylar Parks asked,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.740
if we can make a rope
using aluminum foil.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.300
Skylar, that's an
interesting question.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.500
As most people know,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.100
aluminum foil is
not terribly strong.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.488
It's made of metal,
but it's so thin

00:00:25.488 --> 00:00:27.300
that it shreds apart easily.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.354
This is definitely

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:31.372
not something you would think
of as holding any support.

00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:33.900
Even when we take sort
of a bunch of it at once,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.000
it's pretty easy to bust
right through it.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.300
So can we take this super
thin flimsy material,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.910
and turn it
into something stronger,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.600
a cable or rope

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.900
that we can actually pull
against with some strength.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.194
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:44.884
In the past,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:47.300
we've used uncommon
materials to make rope.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.979
Today, we're going to take
something really light and thin,

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.750
and see if we can get
the same result.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.500
We've made rope

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.809
out of some uncommon or weak
materials in the past.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900
We've used soda bottles
cutting into strands.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.800
We've used pretty weak string
to make a fairly strong rope.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.100
We've used coconut fibers

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.699
that we were able
to twist together

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.099
into long continuous pieces.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.800
All of those were able to take
a fair amount of strength.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.400
Our rope made out of paper towel
was able to hold my weight,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.660
and pull a car.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.200
So we know that we
can take something

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.750
weaker and bind it together
into something stronger.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.619
Today, we want to see

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.400
if we can make that work
with aluminum foil.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.573
The aluminum does present
a few challenges

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:21.761
that other materials
we've used don't have.

00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:22.698
Most of the time,

00:01:22.698 --> 00:01:25.225
when we've tried to make
any sort of rope involves

00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:26.358
taking long strips

00:01:26.358 --> 00:01:29.126
or pieces of the material
and twisting it together.

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:30.400
However, with the foil,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.991
sometimes we run into a problem
that if we keep twisting it,

00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.100
rather than getting stronger,
it becomes brittle,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.800
and just breaks right apart.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.000
I believe this is mostly

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.470
because rather than being
strands or fibers

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.700
that are really strong
pulled one direction,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.200
the foil is sort of uniformly
week in every direction.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.960
Easy that direction.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.700
Easy that direction.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.460
Easy at an angle.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.000
It just rips really easily.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.100
So, it's not the same
as others materials we've used.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.000
Even paper towels,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.500
which aren't very strong
on their own, we were able

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.948
to twist into something
that made a pretty strong rope,

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:04.431
because it is
a fibrous material,

00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.886
and twisting it together
helped it bind even stronger.

00:02:06.886 --> 00:02:08.600
With the foil,
it's a different beast.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.399
Before we get started
with the whole rope,

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.900
we at least want to see if we
can have a proof-of-concept.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.684
Can we take one sheet of foil

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:18.700
and make it stronger
by changing the shape at all?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.960
[Music]

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.400
Two sheets of foil
about the same size.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.700
Now, we want to attach one

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.470
of these sheets of foil
onto our scale to see

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.200
how hard we can pull on it
before it breaks.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.540
To try and make sure

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.000
that we're pulling evenly with
the whole width of the foil,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.080
I'm going to take a dowel,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.700
and I'm going to tape
it to either side.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700
That should make it

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.000
so that when pressure
is being put on one spot,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.500
it's transferred to the whole
sheet at the same time.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.800
Let's test this out.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.560
[Music]

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.100
Now, I'm going to hold
onto the dowel on this side.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.100
I'm going to pull
until something breaks.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.600
And hopefully,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.080
we're using the whole strength
of the foil here.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.540
[Music]

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.200
I think I saw
that get 28 pounds,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.400
which is surprising.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.100
I really didn't think
we were going to be able

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.500
to get that much force
out of one sheet of foil.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.597
Hard to know exactly
where it did fail,

00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:09.385
but we can see

00:03:09.385 --> 00:03:11.973
that it did tear
along this whole taped edge.

00:03:11.973 --> 00:03:14.200
So I imagine it gave out
in one spot first,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.100
and then quickly
spread to the sides.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.000
The question now is
if we take this sheet of foil,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and we modify it,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.600
maybe by rolling it up,
is it going to get stronger

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.200
or weaker than the whole sheet
of foil spread out wide.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.550
I'm going to start
by wrapping the piece of foil

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.195
around this wooden dowel to make
it into a nice tube shape,

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:31.700
and then I'll twist
it from there.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.288
I'm going to take this end,

00:03:33.288 --> 00:03:35.016
fit it into the chuck
of a drill,

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:37.500
hold on to the other end,
and just let it spin.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.400
[Music]

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.700
Wow, that's a lot shorter.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.997
Okay.

00:03:43.997 --> 00:03:45.900
Now this looks more like a rope.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.800
Obviously, this is more rope
shape than the sheet of foil.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.500
Let's see what strength we
can get off of this thing.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.440
[Music]

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.400
I've got the foil attached
at both sides,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400
and hopefully,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.900
we'll get all of the strength
being put into the foil,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.000
and not too much into the tape
and stuff like that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.400
I think it's going to work.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.869
We may have to adjust
if it doesn't.

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:07.982
Now, one thing I noticed,

00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:09.800
just as I was putting
on here and testing

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.300
if I had any tension at all,
it started spinning.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.502
Our foil is coiled
up really tightly,

00:04:14.502 --> 00:04:16.361
and when I start putting weight

00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:19.000
on it, it starts uncoiling
just a little bit.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.352
Let's see what happens.

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:22.600
I might end up stretching
this foil back out

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.980
as it twists a bit.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.900
[Music]

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.060
That gave out early.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.400
The scale got up to 9 pounds.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.000
It took some pressure off to try

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.100
and hold the scales
so the camera can see it better,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.916
and then it seemed

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.500
to break it about 7 pounds
when I was pulling on it again.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.640
This highlights another worry
that I had about the foil.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.500
If you've ever held
a little piece of thin metal,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.400
like a paper clip,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.600
and you bend it back and forth,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.800
you may notice
that it starts to get brittle,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.980
it loses its ductility,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.068
and you can't bend
it as easily anymore.

00:04:48.068 --> 00:04:50.778
And then when you put pressure
on that twisted spot,

00:04:50.778 --> 00:04:52.000
it just wants to break,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.800
because you've already made
the metal a little bit weaker.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.749
Our first test shows

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.129
that a stretched-out piece
of foil laid out flat

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.320
is actually holding more weight
than a twisted up piece of foil.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.483
A flat piece of foil
may in theory be able

00:05:03.483 --> 00:05:06.324
to hold more weight, but it's
horrendously impractical.

00:05:06.324 --> 00:05:09.400
You never want to try and pull
anything with a sheet of foil.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.070
So I think we can still turn
our twisted aluminum foil

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.400
into something that can still
take quite a bit of pull.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.300
There's a few different
things I want to try.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.220
The first is sort of making
the foil into a rope,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.600
a little bit more the same way
other ropes are made,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.700
that's with thin strips
twisted together,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.100
and then twisting
those thin pieces together.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.260
The second is I want to try
using our rope machine.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.800
You've probably seen
us use this before.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.100
You put some strands in,

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.201
you atttach drill
onto the back, spin it.

00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.700
It twists everything up,
and coils them together.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.322
Will this machine
work with foil?

00:05:38.322 --> 00:05:40.372
That twisting effect
that makes it brittle

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:42.881
and break is something we've
already seen happen by hand.

00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:44.531
It could be even worse
in the machine.

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:46.541
But even with that,
I still think we'll be able

00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:48.449
to twist pieces together
into a strong rope,

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.800
whether we use this or not.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.760
To cut nice long strips
out of the sheet of foil,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.280
I'm going to fold it
over a few times,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.200
so I don't have to cut in
the whole length over and over.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.382
This way, I'll be able
to cut much shorter length,

00:06:01.382 --> 00:06:04.083
but still get this strips
running through the whole length

00:06:04.083 --> 00:06:04.700
of the sheet.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.900
Before I cut it though,

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.600
there is one other
thing we have to do,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.300
and that's to put a layer
of paper towel in between foil.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.200
If you try and cut foil,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.300
fold it over without
anything in between,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.170
it tends to bind to itself.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.642
So here I've got a piece,
just folding it a couple

00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:19.500
of times in half.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.700
That's four layers
thick right there.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.920
Now, if I cut through,
I have this strip of foil,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.520
but the edges have sort
of curled over each other,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.300
and they don't always
like to let go.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:52.340
[Music]

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.300
I don't think the drill is
the way to do this.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.940
[Music]

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.060
We've got a much more
string shaped piece of foil.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.820
Maybe now, it will twist nicely?

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:11.380
[Music]

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.840
Twisted better than before,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.940
but I think we're actually

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.717
getting a better result just
by rolling it in our hands,

00:07:16.717 --> 00:07:18.600
so it's not actually twisted up,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.980
but it is still rolled up.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.900
[Music]

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.440
We now have three decently long

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.880
fairly round strands
of the aluminum,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.795
and the goal is to see

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.800
if we can twist these together
into a stronger cord.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:42.580
[Music]

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.600
We've now got a cable made

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.920
from three strands of
aluminum foil twisted together.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:49.420
Attatch to the scale, pull test.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.400
Oh, getting a lot of spinning.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.680
And it broke.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.660
Very low stress test
on that one.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.500
Oh, I think it just barely maxed
out at about 6 pounds.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.700
What do you think?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.760
Are we going to get any better
luck using our rope machine?

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:25.120
[Music]

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.080
Here it goes.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.040
Oh, well, we got three or four
inches of our rope,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.500
and then our individual
strands just snapped.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.683
That's not a lot of rope,
but it's a little bit,

00:08:43.683 --> 00:08:46.100
so we can try and take this,
and put it on the scale,

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.600
and see what is measuring at.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.100
[Music]

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.400
Hey, our tape gave out.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.300
Let's reinforce it
and try again.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:03.620
[Music]

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.640
There it is.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.000
We got to 56 pounds.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
That is something

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.100
that is definitely a higher
result than the 28 pounds,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.250
of course, we had
with the plain flat sheet,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.700
and this is still one sheet
of foil just cut into thirds,

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.817
and then rolled up.

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:18.232
So we finally managed
to get a little better

00:09:18.232 --> 00:09:19.435
than the plain sheet.

00:09:19.435 --> 00:09:22.200
However, we did use
our rope machine to do this,

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.143
and then, all
of our cables broke.

00:09:24.143 --> 00:09:25.849
So the rope machine itself is

00:09:25.849 --> 00:09:28.300
not a very effective way
to keep making this rope.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.880
I want to scale that up.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.650
We're just gonna use
a lot of aluminum foil,

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.100
we're you use whole
sheets this time,

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.822
and I think I'm going to try
and do three wrapped together,

00:09:35.822 --> 00:09:37.700
and then three
of those wrapped together,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.500
so nine total sheets.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.300
I lost about two feet
in length doing that.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.100
Let's do it eight more times.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.900
We've got nine chords
laid out now.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.588
So we're going to start
twisting them together.

00:09:50.588 --> 00:09:52.731
We're going to twist 3 together,
3 together, 3 together,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.080
and then we're going to twist
all of those together,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.255
and make ourselves sort
of a big monster cable,

00:09:57.255 --> 00:09:58.200
see how it works.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.640
[Music]

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.200
Now we've got three cables,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.700
and we need to twist them all
together into one giant cable.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.060
Let's turn it
into one big ol rope.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:28.780
[Music]

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.180
Giant foil rope.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.500
Oh, that's great.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.120
Question is, does it have
any strength to it at all?

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.400
About 3 feet, 4 inches long.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.400
Each sheet of foil
before we started was about 6,

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.900
maybe 6 and 1/2 feet long.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.920
So we've lost almost 50%

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.260
of our foil length
in turning it into this rope.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.900
We got to see
how much weight this can take.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.600
All right cable, rope foil,
whatever you are.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.260
[Music]

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.520
It holds.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:06.360
[Music]

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.613
It's not the most
comfortable rope to hold onto.

00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:10.600
It does hold its shape
better than most.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.279
Today, we've got the truck,

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:15.160
which is got like 4 layers
of paracord attached

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160
to our foil rope.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.200
I unwound the rope
just a little bit,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.300
and I sort of braided
the paracord in there.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.900
And then I've got a lot
of layers of tape after braiding

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.100
the rope back around it.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.650
Same thing on the other side,
attached to our scale.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.753
This is hooked onto
the tow hook of a car.

00:11:28.753 --> 00:11:30.600
And so now,
we're just going to test.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.174
We're going to have
Mark drive away very slowly,

00:11:33.174 --> 00:11:35.715
and we're going to see
how our foil rope holds up.

00:11:35.715 --> 00:11:36.700
See how many pounds

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.900
of pressure it takes
before it just tears open.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:49.760
[Music]

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.640
Broken.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.280
That was a very relaxed break.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.200
It just like...

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.300
Gone.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:55.800
All right.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.300
There we go.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300
Our rope broke.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.700
It was not a very
energetic breaking.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.700
I thought that maybe
it would just pop

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.420
and catastrophically
fail all at once.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.379
But really, it just
was pulling and pulling,

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:06.849
and then just was like, I'm out,

00:12:06.849 --> 00:12:09.300
and just let go, and everything
kind of fell down.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.000
But I'm quite sure I saw
it over 200 pounds.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.800
I think I saw it

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.300
about 215 or 225,
something like that.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.182
Overall though,

00:12:16.182 --> 00:12:18.790
that's definitely a rope
yhat was doing something.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.474
Skylar Parks, thank you
