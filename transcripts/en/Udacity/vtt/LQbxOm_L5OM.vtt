00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.040
So Charles, how would we go about trying to figure this out?

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.215
&gt;&gt; How would we go about trying to figure this out?

00:00:05.215 --> 00:00:07.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do you think? Which one

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.190
would you choose and how would you choose?

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.700
&gt;&gt; so, well that's a good question. Well

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.760
just given what you, what you've given me, I'm

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.210
going to ask. I think smartly guess, that

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.540
probably k equals 3, is the right one, and

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.556
&gt;&gt; K equals 3

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.560
&gt;&gt; And I'll tell you why.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.223
It's because zero, one and two seem to make quite a few errors.

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:32.990
&gt;&gt; Mh-hm

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.610
&gt;&gt; Three does a pretty good job but doesn't, doesn't over commit to the data.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.820
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.050
&gt;&gt; And that's the problem with eight, is that

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.490
eight says, you know, the training data that I have

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.300
is exactly right and I should been and moved

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.810
heaven and earth in order to, to match the data.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.390
And that's probably the wrong thing, certainly if there's any

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.740
noise or, or anything else going on in the data.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.230
&gt;&gt; Right. So it sort of seems like it's overkill,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.220
especially that it's doing these crazy things between the points. Whereas

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.849
the cubic one, even though it clings pretty close to the

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.780
points, it stays between the points, kind of between the points.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.400
&gt;&gt; Which seems like a really smart thing. So yeah so, so that

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.010
turns out to be the right answer but let's actually let's actually evaluate

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.970
that more concretely.
