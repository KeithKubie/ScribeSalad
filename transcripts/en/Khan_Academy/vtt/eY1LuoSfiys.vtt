00:00:00.548 --> 00:00:02.032
- [Instructor] Let's say that Y

00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:06.032
is equal to sin of X
squared to the third power,

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:09.201
which of course we could also write

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:12.368
as sin of X squared to the third power

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:16.763
and what we're curious about

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:19.603
is what is the derivative
of this with respect to X?

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:23.770
What is DY/DX which we
could also write as Y prime?

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:26.663
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:29.967
This isn't a straightforward
expression here

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.846
but you might notice that I have something

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:34.955
being raised to the third power,

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:37.051
in fact, if we look at the
outside of this expression

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:38.705
we have some business in here

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.097
that's being raised to the third power.

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:42.658
And so, one way to tackle this

00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:44.468
is to apply the chain rule.

00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:45.793
So, if we apply the chain rule

00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:47.568
it's gonna be the
derivative of the outside

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.225
with respect to the inside

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:51.373
or the something to the third power,

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.219
the derivative of the
something to the third power

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.315
with respect to that something.

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:59.482
So, it's going to be three
times that something squared

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:04.421
times the derivative with respect to X

00:01:04.421 --> 00:01:07.088
of that something, in this case,

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:11.628
the something is sin,

00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:13.837
let me write that in the blue color,

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:15.754
it is sin of X squared.

00:01:18.238 --> 00:01:20.155
It is sin of X squared.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:26.679
No matter what was inside
of these orange parentheses

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.296
I would put it inside of
the orange parentheses

00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:31.554
and these orange brackets right over here.

00:01:31.554 --> 00:01:34.074
We learned that in the chain rule.

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:36.410
So, let's see, we know
this is just a matter

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.730
of the first part of the expression

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.835
is just a matter of
algebraic simplification

00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:44.082
but the second part we need
to now take the derivative

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:46.108
of sin of X squared.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:49.886
Well, now we would want to
use the chain rule again.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.400
So, I'm going to take the derivative,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.233
it's sin of something,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.061
so this is going to be,
the derivative of this

00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:58.138
is gonna be the sin of something

00:01:58.138 --> 00:01:59.522
with respect to something,

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:02.439
so that is cosine of that something

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.488
times the derivative with respect to X

00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:08.538
of the something.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:12.205
In this case, the
something is our X squared

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.413
and of course, we have
all of this out front

00:02:15.413 --> 00:02:17.746
which is the three times sin

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:23.934
of X squared, I could write
it like this, squared.

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:25.491
Alright, so we're getting close.

00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:26.700
Now we just have to
figure out the derivative

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.086
with respect to X of X squared

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:31.746
and we've seen that many times before.

00:02:31.746 --> 00:02:33.140
That, we just use the power rule,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.227
that's going to be two X.

00:02:35.227 --> 00:02:39.394
Two X and so, if we
wanted to write the DY/DX,

00:02:40.873 --> 00:02:43.015
let me get a little bit
of a mini drum roll here,

00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:44.538
this shouldn't take us too long,

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:48.520
DY/DX, I'll multiply the
three times the two X

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.385
which is going to be six X,

00:02:50.385 --> 00:02:52.359
so I've covered those so far

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.942
times sin squared of X squared,

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.482
times sin squared of X squared,

00:03:00.452 --> 00:03:02.619
times cosine of X squared.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:07.904
And we are done applying the
chain rule multiple times.
