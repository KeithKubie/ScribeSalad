00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.250
- This right here is an
equation for a parabola

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.830
and the role of this video
is to find an alternate

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.560
or to explore an alternate method

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.820
for finding the focus and directrix

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.590
of this parabola from the equation.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.060
So the first thing I like to
do is solve explicitly for y.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.250
I don't know, my brain just processes

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.860
things better that way.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.950
So, let's get this 23 over
four to the right hand side.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.090
So let's add 23 over four to both sides

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.220
and then we'll get y is
equal to negative one-third

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.250
times x minus one squared

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.138
plus 23 over four.

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:36.090
Now let's remind ourselves
what we've learned

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.710
about foci and directrixes,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.030
I think is how to say it.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.090
So, the focus.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.720
If the focus of a parabola
is at the point a, b

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.020
and the directrix,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.330
the directrix, directrix

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.700
is the line y equals k.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.980
We've shown in other videos

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.890
with a little bit of hairy algebra

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460
that the equation of the parabola

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.642
in a form like this is going to be

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:12.642
y is equal to one over
two times b minus k.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.420
This b minus k is then the difference

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.450
between this y coordinate
and this y value,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850
I guess you could say.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.020
Times x minus one squared

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.000
plus b plus k.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.090
I'm sorry, not x minus one.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.130
I'm getting confused with this.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.130
x minus a squared.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.790
x minus a squred plus b plus k

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.170
over two.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.860
The focus is a,b

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.600
and the directrix is y equals k

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.300
and this is gonna be the
equation of the parabola.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.922
Well, we've already seen the technique

00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:48.490
where, look, we can see
the different parts.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.890
We can see that, okay,
this x minus one squared.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.330
Actually, let me do this
in a different color.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.160
This x minus one squared

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.250
corresponds to the x minus a squared

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.090
and so one

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.860
corresponds to a,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.720
so just like that, we know that a is going

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.820
to be equal to one

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.580
and actually let me just write that down.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.580
a is equal to one in this
example right over here.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.550
And then you could see
that the negative one-third

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.050
over here corresponds to
the one over two b minus k

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.050
and you would see that the 23 over four

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.360
corresponds to the b plus k over two.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.230
Now the first technique that we explored,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.350
we said, "Okay, let's
set negative one-third

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.520
"to this thing right over here.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.930
"Solve for b minus k."

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.020
We're not solving for b or k,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.900
we're solving for the
expression b minus k.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.113
So you got b minus k equals something.

00:02:49.113 --> 00:02:51.390
And then you could use
23 over four and this

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.920
to solve for b plus k.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.920
So you get b plus k equals something

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.420
and then you have two
equations, two unknowns,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.689
you can solve for b and k.

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.090
What I wanna do in this video

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.660
is explore a different method

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.860
that really uses our
knowledge of the vertex

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.350
of a parabola to be able to figure out

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.460
where the focus and the
directrix is going to be.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.020
So let's think about the vertex

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.250
of this parabola right over here.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.660
Remember, the vertex, if the
parabola is upward opening

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.460
like this, the vertex
is this minimum point.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.590
If it is downward opening,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.420
it's going to be this maximum point.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920
And so when you look over here,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.960
you see that you have a negative one-third

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.750
in front of the x minus one squared.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.520
So this quantity over here is either going

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.090
to be zero or negative.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.320
It's not going to add to 23 over four,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.060
it's either gonna add
nothing or take away from it.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.104
So this thing's going
to hit a maximum point,

00:03:46.104 --> 00:03:50.250
when this thing is zero,
when this thing is zero,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.730
and that's just gonna go down from there

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.560
and when this thing is zero,

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.620
y is going to be equal to 23 over four.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.220
So our vertex is going
to be that maximum point.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.930
Well, when does this equal zero?

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.040
Well, when x equals one.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.690
When x equals one, you
get one minus one squared.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.460
So zero squared times negative one-third,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.890
this is zero.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.690
So when x is equal to one,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.130
we're at our maximum y
value of 23 over four

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.160
which five and three-fourths.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.490
Actually, let me write that as a .

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.050
Actually, I'll leave
just that's our vertex.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.990
23 over four

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.620
and it is a downward opening parabola.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.920
So actually, let me start to draw this.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.299
So we'd get some axis here.

00:04:34.299 --> 00:04:37.219
So we have to go all the way
up to five and three-fourths.

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.389
So.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.389
Let's make this our y, this is our y axis.

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.119
This is the x axis.

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:48.759
That's the x axis.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.419
We're gonna see, we're gonna go to one.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.769
Let's call that one. Let's call that two.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:55.189
And then I wanna get, let's see,

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:56.449
if I go to five and three-fourths,

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.977
let's go up to, let's see

00:04:57.977 --> 00:05:01.859
one, two, three, four

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:05.829
five, six, seven.

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:06.789
We can label 'em.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.189
One, two, three, four

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.719
five, six and seven

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.929
and so our vertex is right over here.

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:19.279
One comma 23 over four,

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:20.919
so that's five and three-fourths.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.299
So it's gonna be right around

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:25.119
right around there

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:27.619
and as we said, since
we have a negative value

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:31.499
in front of this x minus one squared term,

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:32.679
I guess we could call it,

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:34.319
this is going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.199
This is going to be a maximum point.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.589
So our actual parabola is going to look

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.659
is going to look something

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.659
it's gonna look something like this.

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:50.209
It's gonna look something like this

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:53.599
and we could, obviously,
I'm hand drawing it,

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.349
so it's not going to be exactly perfect,

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:58.519
but hopefully you get the general idea

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:00.599
of what the parabola is going

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.549
look like and actually,
let me just do part of it,

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:07.019
'cause I actually don't
know that much information

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:08.369
about the parabola just yet.

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:09.759
I'm just gonna draw it like that.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.899
So we don't know just yet

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:15.489
where the directrix and focus is,

00:06:15.489 --> 00:06:17.129
but we do know a few things.

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.529
The focus is going to sit on the same,

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.649
I guess you could say, the
same x value as the vertex.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:27.519
So if we draw, this is x equals one,

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.319
if x equals one, we
know from our experience

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.989
with focuses, foci, (laughs) I guess,

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:36.589
that they're going to
sit on the same axis as

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.059
the vertex.

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:42.089
So the focus might be

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:43.999
right over here and then the directrix

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.619
is going to be equidistant
on the other side,

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:48.159
equidistant on the other side.

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.129
So the directrix might
be something like this.

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:53.829
Might be right over here.

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:54.979
And once again, I haven't
figured it out yet,

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.859
but what we know is
that because this point,

00:06:57.859 --> 00:07:00.189
the vertex, sits on the parabola,

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:02.159
by definition has to be equidistant

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:05.714
from the focus and the directrix.

00:07:05.714 --> 00:07:06.799
So.

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:10.089
This distance has to be the same

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:13.829
as this distance right over here

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:15.219
and what's another way of thinking

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:17.359
about this entire distance?

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:18.871
Remember, this coordinate right over here

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:23.259
is a, b and this is the line

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.049
y is equal to k.

00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:26.589
This is y equals k.

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:28.789
So what's this distance in yellow?

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:32.359
What's this difference in y going to be?

00:07:32.359 --> 00:07:34.489
Well, you could call that, in this case,

00:07:34.489 --> 00:07:36.549
the directrix is above the focus,

00:07:36.549 --> 00:07:38.459
so you could say that this would be k

00:07:38.459 --> 00:07:41.929
minus b

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.919
or you could say it's the absolute value

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.529
of b minus k.

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.819
This would actually always work.

00:07:46.819 --> 00:07:49.219
It'll always give you kind
of the positive distance.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:53.819
So if we knew what the
absolute value of b minus k is,

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:55.689
if we knew this distance,
then just split it

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:57.319
in half with the directrix is gonna be

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.989
that distance, half the distance above

00:07:58.989 --> 00:08:02.089
and then the focus is gonna
be half the distance below.

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:04.089
So let's see if we can figure this out.

00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:05.919
And we can figure this out because we see

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:08.889
in this, I guess you
could say, this equation,

00:08:08.889 --> 00:08:11.599
you can see where b minus k is involved.

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:14.429
One over two times b minus k needs to be

00:08:14.429 --> 00:08:16.959
equal to negative one-third.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:20.019
So let's solve for b minus k.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:21.759
So we get

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:26.759
we get one over two times b minus k

00:08:27.559 --> 00:08:30.359
is going to be equal
to negative one-third.

00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:33.259
Once again, this corresponds to that.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.889
It's going to be equal
to negative one-third.

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:38.235
We could take the reciprocal of both sides

00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:41.729
and we get two times b minus k

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.609
is equal to, is equal to

00:08:44.609 --> 00:08:47.389
three, is equal to three.

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:50.859
Now we can divide both sides

00:08:50.859 --> 00:08:54.159
we can divide both sides by two

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.289
and so we're gonna get

00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:58.669
we're gonna get b

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:03.669
b minus k is equal to

00:09:03.699 --> 00:09:08.389
is equal to, what is that,
three-halves, three-halves.

00:09:09.377 --> 00:09:11.517
b minus k is equal to, oh,

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.887
let me make sure that has
to be a negative three,

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.567
so this has to be negative three-halves.

00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:18.717
And so if you took the
absolute value of b minus k

00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:21.657
you're gonna get positive three-halves,

00:09:21.657 --> 00:09:22.957
or if you took k minus b,

00:09:22.957 --> 00:09:26.017
you're going to get positive three-halves.

00:09:26.017 --> 00:09:28.267
So just like that, using this part,

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:30.597
just actually matching
the negative one-third

00:09:30.597 --> 00:09:32.387
to this part of this equation,

00:09:32.387 --> 00:09:34.887
we're able to solve for the absolute value

00:09:34.887 --> 00:09:37.427
of b minus k which is
going to be the distance

00:09:37.427 --> 00:09:40.127
between the y axis in the y direction

00:09:40.127 --> 00:09:41.857
between the focus and the directrix.

00:09:41.857 --> 00:09:44.687
So this distance right over here

00:09:44.687 --> 00:09:47.097
is three-halves.

00:09:47.097 --> 00:09:48.287
So what is half that distance?

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:49.457
And the reason why I care
about half that distance

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:51.017
is because then I can calculate

00:09:51.017 --> 00:09:52.917
where the focus is, because
it's going to be half

00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:56.129
that distance below the vertex

00:09:56.129 --> 00:09:58.287
and I could say, whatever that distance is

00:09:58.287 --> 00:09:59.827
is going to be that distance also

00:09:59.827 --> 00:10:01.317
above the directrix.

00:10:01.317 --> 00:10:03.117
So half that distance,

00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:08.117
so one half times three-halves
is equal to three-fourths.

00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:09.987
So just like that,
we're able to figure out

00:10:09.987 --> 00:10:13.617
the directrix is going to
be three-fourths above this.

00:10:13.617 --> 00:10:16.457
So I could say the
directrix, so let me see,

00:10:16.457 --> 00:10:18.227
I'm running out of space,

00:10:18.227 --> 00:10:19.727
the directrix is gonna be y is equal

00:10:19.727 --> 00:10:23.087
to the y coordinate of the focus.

00:10:23.087 --> 00:10:26.917
Sorry, the y coordinate of the vertex.

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.787
I might be careful with my language.

00:10:28.787 --> 00:10:31.147
It's gonna be equal to the
y coordinate of the vertex

00:10:31.147 --> 00:10:36.007
plus three-fourths, plus three- fourths.

00:10:37.097 --> 00:10:42.097
So plus three-fourths, which
is equal to 26 over four,

00:10:42.257 --> 00:10:43.988
which is equal to, what is that,

00:10:43.988 --> 00:10:47.197
that's equal to six and a half.

00:10:47.197 --> 00:10:48.417
So this right over here,

00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.177
actually I got pretty close when I drew it

00:10:50.177 --> 00:10:52.557
is actually going to be the directrix.

00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:54.825
Y is equal to six and a half

00:10:54.825 --> 00:10:57.681
and the focus, well, we
know the x coordinate

00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:00.985
of the focus, a is
going to be equal to one

00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:02.717
and b is going to be three-fourths less

00:11:02.717 --> 00:11:06.297
than the y coordinate of the directrix.

00:11:06.297 --> 00:11:08.887
So 23 over four minus three-fourths.

00:11:08.887 --> 00:11:11.927
Gonna be 23 over four

00:11:11.927 --> 00:11:15.097
23 over four minus three-fourths

00:11:15.097 --> 00:11:18.557
which is 20 over four,
which is just equal to

00:11:18.557 --> 00:11:21.227
which is just equal to five.

00:11:21.227 --> 00:11:23.017
And we are done.

00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:24.377
That's the focus, one comma five.

00:11:24.377 --> 00:11:26.977
Directrix is y is equal to six and a half.
