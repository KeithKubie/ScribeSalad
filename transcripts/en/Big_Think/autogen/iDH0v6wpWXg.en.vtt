curious thing is how often it happens so

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600

eventually that became codified into

eventually that became codified into
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609
eventually that became codified into
hieroglyphs and when we did that we

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
hieroglyphs and when we did that we
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.050
hieroglyphs and when we did that we
standardized language and we put it on

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060
standardized language and we put it on
 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.080

allowed us to have holy books that

went from tribes to empires because we
