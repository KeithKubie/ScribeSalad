00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.900
In 2005, two researchers published a series
of articles investigating the subject of other

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.410
people’s smelliness.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.240
They examined how much disgust people would
feel and show after smelling a variety of

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.900
odors, including armpits, garbage and farts.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
Among the stinks examined, farts elicited
the strongest negative response, and across

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.530
all body odors, people consistently rated
odors of other people worse than their own

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.010
(with one notable exception in that the armpit
sweat of one’s partner was generally rated

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.570
as less offensive than a person’s own.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
For why this might be the case, see: Why Do
We Still Have Pubic and Armpit Hair)

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.280
This all leaves us with the question of why
other people’s farts smell worse.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.110
Probably the leading reason your own farts
aren’t generally as offensive to your nose

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.690
is that you’re used to your own smell.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.739
The more you’re used to something, like
a smell, the more likely you are to, if not

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:09.009
prefer it, at least to partially tune it out
consciously, making it less extreme to

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:17.750
your senses.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.289
As you’re smelling yourself all day, every
day, your brain tunes out some of the smells

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.770
emanating from your pores, the surface of
your skin, and the air expelled from your

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.200
lungs, all creating a somewhat unique blend
of odors largely resulting from various microbes

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.920
that call your body home and, of course, what
you eat.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.560
(Note: on average there are about 10 times
more bacterial cells in your guts alone than

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.280
human cells that make up your whole body.)

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.840
For example, if you eat a lot of garlic, even
if you brush your teeth and rinse with mouthwash

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.500
directly after, you’re still likely to smell
a bit to others who aren’t eating garlic,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.700
but not so much to yourself.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.340
This is because some of the sulfuric compounds
in the garlic get metabolized and make their

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.700
way into your blood stream.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.440
Once they’re in your blood, they eventually
get passed out of your body through various

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.810
bodily excretions, which includes being exuded
through your pores and also passed into the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.310
air that fills your lungs.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.340
So not only does your whole body smell like
you’re wearing a stinky perfume, but, as

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.420
you breathe, the air goes into your lungs
and is contaminated by the allyl methyl sulfide;

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.250
this in turn causes your breath to continue
to smell even though you’ve cleaned your

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.250
mouth out.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.170
Of course, you are typically unaware of any
of this, as your brain quickly tunes out the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.170
odor emanating from yourself.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.680
The same type of thing is happening, albeit
to a much lesser extent, with some of the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.880
odors that make up your farts.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.710
It has also been proposed that there is probably
some level of your brain tuning the smell

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.560
of your farts out for another reason- it expects
a potentially strong smell directly after

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.310
it knows you just farted.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.620
While this may seem farfetched, it turns out
your brain does stuff like this all the time.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.700
For instance, have you ever noticed that you
can’t tickle yourself?

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
(Well, most people can’t anyway.)

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.460
This is because your brain anticipates things
going on around you in order to help speed

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.070
up response times, among other reasons.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.960
In the case of touch, more technically, the
cerebellum monitors body movements and can

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.810
also distinguish between expected sensations
and unexpected ones, generally resulting in

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.630
diminishing or completely discarding expected
sensations, while paying much more attention

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.090
to unexpected ones.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.260
For instance, when you are typing on a keyboard,
your brain significantly dulls the touch sensation

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.780
in your fingertips so that you don’t really
notice it unless you consciously think about

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.780
it.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.790
This same type of thing happens when you try
to tickle yourself.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.720
Researchers at University College London tested
this by scanning the brains of subjects while

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.510
the palms of their hands were touched by themselves
and by experimenters.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.450
The brain scans revealed that when the touch
was externally produced, the somatosensory

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.671
cortex (involved in processing touch) and
anterior cingulate cortex parts of the brain

00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:49.460
reacted much more strongly than when the touch
was produced by the subjects themselves.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.740
In these latter cases, the brain was using
information it has on hand such as motor movements

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.430
of the finger and arms to anticipate the touch.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.439
In the extreme case, like when someone sneaks
up behind you and starts tickling your neck,

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.599
the sensation can be extremely strong, possibly
even resulting in you jumping out of your

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.260
chair and slapping the back of your neck before
you really even consciously register the touch.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.740
This is a good thing.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.910
You see, it turns out the panic response when
a tarantula is crawling on your leg or the

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.989
like is exactly what is happening in your
brain and body when you are getting tickled.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.780
The body’s response to being tickled is
panic and anxiety.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.510
It is thought that this is a defense mechanism
for exactly this type of thing where an external

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.060
touch, such as a venomous insect crawling
on you or the like, might be occurring.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.140
The body needs to react quickly to this unanticipated
touch and without time for much conscious

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.610
thought, so produces the panic reaction.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.380
(Interestingly, the panic reaction that results
from tickling doesn’t feel like tickling

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.050
when the person tickling you isn’t someone
you want to be doing this.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.169
In this case, it more closely resembles actual
panic reactions, rather than having associated

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.169
laughter.)

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.330
In any event, the same exact thing is thought
to be happening with farts.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.610
Your brain knows you just farted, so at least
partially tunes out the smell.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.723
That said, when another person farts and you
definitely know they just did before the smell

00:04:58.723 --> 00:05:00.510
hits you, it still seems to smell worse.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.780
While it’s not wholly understood why this
is the case, it’s generally thought that

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.650
there are two factors at play.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.080
First, there may be an element of confirmation
bias going on here.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.660
Essentially, you remember the really stinky
farts from other people, but not so much the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.560
numerous farts you take a whiff of daily that
don’t really smell at all (whether you knew

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.160
the person farted or not).

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.919
Second, we return to the aforementioned fact
that your brain isn’t tuning out foreign

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.980
smells necessarily like it does your own,
as well as the fact that our brains, for whatever

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.650
reason, seem geared to react more strongly
to negative smelling odors from others, even

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.070
if the fart in question contains more or less
the same levels of noxious fumes as your own.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.350
There are important evolutionary reasons why
this is the case, even if the mechanism isn’t

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.350
wholly understood.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.230
For instance, it is entirely possibly for
you to become infected with a disease from

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.160
smelling another person’s fart.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.790
This isn’t so common anymore now that most
humans tend to walk around wearing underwear

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.639
and other garments on top of that, filtering
your rear expulsions a bit.

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:59.800
But, much like certain viruses and the like
can be transmitted via coughs, pathogens like

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.650
streptococcus pyogenes can be transmitted
to you via an improperly filtered fart where

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.960
the poop particles are peregrinating through
the air, perhaps ultimately ending up in your

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.169
nose, throat or lungs.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.510
Your brain is seemingly built to be keenly
aware of this danger and so goes ahead and

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.440
reacts more negatively to said odoriferous
odor from an external source, just in case,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.300
motivating you to want to leave the stinky
zone or at least hold your breath for a bit

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:49.230
while the air clears out.
