IAN LAKE: Hello, internet.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.828
We've heard that
you're mad at Joanna.

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:04.870
JOANNA SMITH: Wait, what?

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.490
IAN LAKE: Your toolbar
video did not even

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.575
cover scrolling gestures.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:08.510
What's with that?

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.780
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.280
Hold on.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.130
I only had two minutes,
and the internet

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.735
has the attention span of Dory.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:13.610
IAN LAKE: Wait, wait.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.160
Don't leave.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.850
It's OK.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.772
This is important.

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:16.730
We'll get through this.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.896
We just need to cover the
whole scrolling, toolbars,

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:19.605
and AppBar thing.

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:20.312
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:22.000
So let's go over
some scrollFlags.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.750
IAN LAKE: Well, it's
not just scrollFlags.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.197
We have to talk about
the whole thing.

00:00:26.197 --> 00:00:27.155
JOANNA SMITH: Fun fact.

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:29.360
The AppBar is actually
just the ActionBar

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.701
with a fancy new name.

00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:32.659
IAN LAKE: Well, it's not
just a fancy new name.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:34.860
It's actually the anchor
for your whole app.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.610
JOANNA SMITH: If that
were true, don't you

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.359
think they would have
called it AnchorBar?

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.140
IAN LAKE: Eh,
AnchorBar's a silly name.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.640
And the Android SDK has
nothing silly in it.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.020
JOANNA SMITH: Of course not.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.220
But anyway, you can
customize your AppBar

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.120
if you choose to use
a toolbar instead

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850
of the standard
framework choice.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.410
Thanks, Ian.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.930
IAN LAKE: You're welcome.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.856
JOANNA SMITH: Like I
explained in my DevByte.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:53.980
IAN LAKE: It's really good.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.200
You should go watch it.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.710
JOANNA SMITH: Aw, thanks, Ian.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.190
IAN LAKE: But it doesn't
actually answer the question.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.582
Where's the scrolling magic?

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:02.790
JOANNA SMITH: Well, it's an
AppBar layout, of course.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.570
But you're right.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.080
I still haven't talked
about scrolling gestures.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.560
IAN LAKE: You're right.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.976
You should probably
talk about it.

00:01:06.976 --> 00:01:07.722
It's a big deal.

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:08.430
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.433
So I was just about to.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.320
[SIGHS]

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.070
So you want scrolling
gestures in your app

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.590
to help you put content first
in a pretty fantastic way

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.930
by hiding the
chrome of your app.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.430
Right.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.037
OK.

00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:21.870
So when you decide to
use an AppBar toolbar,

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.200
you'll need three things.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.400
The first is a
CoordinatorLayout on the top.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.120
Thanks, Ian.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.440
IAN LAKE: You're welcome.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.440
JOANNA SMITH: And then
you need an AppBar layout

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.510
containing the toolbar.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.300
Thanks, Ian.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.700
IAN LAKE: You're welcome.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.158
JOANNA SMITH: And
finally, you want

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:34.990
your main scrollable content,
such as our RecyclerView.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.549
Thanks, Ian.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.590
IAN LAKE: You're welcome.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.630
JOANNA SMITH: Now, if you forget
to specify the layout behavior

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.740
attribute, your app is going to
go all cattywampus and overlap.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.067
So don't forget it.

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:45.150
And then finally, the
layout scrollFlags attribute

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.944
is the magic that'll make it go.

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:47.860
IAN LAKE: Cattywampus?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.091
Is that really a word?

00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:49.590
I'm--

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.950
JOANNA SMITH: Yes,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.510
IAN LAKE: --not seeing it.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.176
JOANNA SMITH: Well,
if it wasn't a word,

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:53.800
I would not have said it.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.311
IAN LAKE: I believe her.

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.560
So what do these scrollFlags
actually do for your app?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.340
JOANNA SMITH: Well,
so values like scroll

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.790
indicate that the whole thing
will scroll off the screen.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.410
And then enterAlways
indicates that it'll overturn,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.520
as soon as you scroll back.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.210
IAN LAKE: Wow.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.169
A quick return pattern.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.668
It's actually a
very common pattern.

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:11.740
JOANNA SMITH: Precisely.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.570
So hopefully, that helped
clear up some of the-- thanks--

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.720
scrolling magic for all
of you eager developers.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.220
Thanks, Ian.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.780
IAN LAKE: No problem.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.700
JOANNA SMITH: And
so go out there

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.951
and build better apps already.

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.450
Stop.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.089
Stop.

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.880
IAN LAKE: Good job.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.280
JOANNA SMITH: Build better apps.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.630
