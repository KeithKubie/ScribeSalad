00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.480
Earthquakes strike all over the world, and
once they're over a certain threshold, they

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.710
become BIG news.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:16.850
But what do those numbers they tell you on
the news really mean?

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.310
Nepal was recently hit by a 7.3 on the Richter
Scale, less than 3 weeks after being hit by

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.900
a 7.8.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.539
The 7.8 destroyed buildings, killed thousands
and caused an avalanche; the 7.3 caused a

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.249
panic, and killed only a few dozen.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.710
Does Zero Point Five on the scale make that
big a difference?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.539
Firstly, let me step back for a bit, when
you describe a great dessert to a friend,

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.710
you probably give it a rating.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.469
We humans love to rate things -- but to truly
rate it fairly, you'd have to understand the

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.010
ingredients, the preparation, the plating,
and the ideal dessert comparison, what you've

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.640
just eaten prior, what you're drinking, where
you're sitting, the temperature in the room

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.489
you're in and your mood at the time; not to
mention whether you had a fight with your

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.489
friend earlier that day!!

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.539
Science needs history, context, and tons of
points of data, and that's just for a piece

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.610
of cake!

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.670
How can you take all that data and turn it
into one simple rating?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.720
Most people don't.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.460
They measure how they FEEL about it, right?

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.479
Like a layer cake, earthquakes are all different.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.960
When rocks slide, knock and buffet against
one another; they can slip, crack or jerk

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.280
and cause an earthquake, but the friction,
the fault, the pressure, depth, type of rock

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.549
and varied stressors of its history; all matter.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.860
To turn that into one number is pretty crazy,
if you think about it.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.579
The Richter scale was invented in the 1930s
to give some understanding to the magnitude

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.370
of a quake as measured by seismographs; ground
monitoring equipment.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:49.110
It's logarithmic, so every 1.0 point on the
scale is a TEN FOLD increase.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.189
So a 3 to a 4 is a ten-fold increase, and
3 to a 5 is 100 fold; or, put another way,

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.550
a 7 is a 10,000 times more powerful than a
3.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.890
The U.S. Geological Survey says there are
1.4 million quakes that register above 2.0

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.202
every year, and only 16 that get a 7 or higher,
but even after I've explained it to you, do

00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:16.440
you know what it means?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
I don't!

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.800
Richter is only concerned with the amount
of energy released by a single quake, and

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.160
doesn't tell us much about what it DID.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.800
Maybe it was deep, or away from a populated
area, maybe the quake was under soft ground,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.320
or in the middle of firm bedrock -- all of
that would change how it was experienced;

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.700
or how humans FEEL it.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.690
Mercalli Scale or Modified Mercalli Scale,
measures intensity.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.980
This is used by the U.S. Geological survey
to understand how the earthquake FELT on the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980
surface!

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.130
The Mercalli scale was developed in the 30s
too and it uses Roman numerals to determine

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.620
how intense a quake is from I to XII.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.900
It is subjective, so, for example, a II is
weak and is quote "Felt only by a few persons

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.490
at rest,especially on upper floors of buildings,"
but a VI is strong and quote "Felt by all,

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.810
many are frightened.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.600
Some heavy furniture is moved; a few instances
of fallen plaster.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.870
Damage slight."

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.810
This measure of how it FEELS adds more data
to what happened in an earthquake, moving

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.370
us closer to understanding what really happened!

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.370
There's also the Moment Magnitude scale, which
is a new measure for quakes.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.870
Moment Magnitude allows scientists to use
computer models to create synthetic seismograms

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.330
and determine exactly how the energy released
relates to the magnitude of a quake.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.381
Essentially how far a fault moved, and the
force required to move it.

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:44.500
It gets seismologists really excited because
it's WAY more accurate than the antiquated

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:51.870
Richter measurements, works all over the world
as a standard measure, and can go above M8,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.570
which Richter cannot.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.040
Okay, so now that you know the basicsâ€¦

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.561
According to the Incorporated Research Institutions
for Seismology, the April 25th earthquake

00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:06.650
in Nepal was a M7.8 with MMI ranging from
IV to IX.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.890
Most of the reports were in V to VI -- so
it felt strong, the ground moved and for some

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.370
people it was severe and violent,.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.950
This complicated cocktail of factors that
have to be considered help determine how earthquakes

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:54.900
are experienced, and categorized; just like
anything we can always learn more.
