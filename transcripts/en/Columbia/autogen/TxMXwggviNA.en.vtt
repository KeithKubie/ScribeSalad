sir survive you compare the English in
the Americas situations at all I think

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:03.700
the Americas situations at all I think
 

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.080
the Americas situations at all I think
Americans were more overt about what

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:08.090
Americans were more overt about what
 

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:14.710
Americans were more overt about what
they did Bush Cheney Rumsfeld they said

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720
they did Bush Cheney Rumsfeld they said
 

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.370
they did Bush Cheney Rumsfeld they said
what they were doing torture is

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:20.380
what they were doing torture is
 

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.950
what they were doing torture is
internationally prohibited there is no

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960
internationally prohibited there is no
 

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.750
internationally prohibited there is no
defense if you are involved in torture

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760
defense if you are involved in torture
 

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.899
defense if you are involved in torture
has no defense of superior orders or

00:19:31.899 --> 00:19:31.909
has no defense of superior orders or
 

00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:36.659
has no defense of superior orders or
necessity and so what the Americans did

00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:36.669
necessity and so what the Americans did
 

00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:40.960
necessity and so what the Americans did
was redefine some of the mechanics of

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:40.970
was redefine some of the mechanics of
 

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.380
was redefine some of the mechanics of
torture in order to give immunity to

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:44.390
torture in order to give immunity to
 

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.549
torture in order to give immunity to
those who who were carrying it out so

00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559
those who who were carrying it out so
 

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:52.240
those who who were carrying it out so
waterboarding was read was defined as

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:52.250
waterboarding was read was defined as
 

00:19:52.250 --> 00:20:00.909
waterboarding was read was defined as
not torture but um a British were

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919
not torture but um a British were
 

00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:10.100
not torture but um a British were
complicit but not overt in what they did

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:10.110
 
 

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.500
 
but yet they knew and they should have

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:12.510
but yet they knew and they should have
 

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.130
but yet they knew and they should have
known they should have recognized

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.140
known they should have recognized
 

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.640
known they should have recognized
prohibited techniques if if you if you

we have we have a problem in Britain in
particular because although we say we've

forsworn a number of things we haven't
 

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:24.900
forsworn a number of things we haven't
full sworn secrecy and that's our one of

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:24.910
full sworn secrecy and that's our one of
 

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:29.810
full sworn secrecy and that's our one of
our particular national vices that if

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820
our particular national vices that if
 

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.950
our particular national vices that if
the state claims that it's in the

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960
the state claims that it's in the
 

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:39.320
the state claims that it's in the
interests of national security not to

reveal something that trumps everything
 

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:47.670
reveal something that trumps everything
here and so although the government has

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:47.680
here and so although the government has
 

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.730
here and so although the government has
ordered an inquiry into our complicity

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:50.740
ordered an inquiry into our complicity
 

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.790
ordered an inquiry into our complicity
in torture particularly in relation to

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:53.800
in torture particularly in relation to
 

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.750
in torture particularly in relation to
the Guantanamo former detainees it's

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760
the Guantanamo former detainees it's
 

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.500
the Guantanamo former detainees it's
going to be in secret and those who were

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:04.510
going to be in secret and those who were
 

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.570
going to be in secret and those who were
involved or responsible will give their

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:06.580
involved or responsible will give their
 

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:12.210
involved or responsible will give their
evidence and secret and so it's it's a

now no country is allowed to extradite

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480
now no country is allowed to extradite
 

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.090
