00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.160
- Hello, I'm Jordan Mendoza.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.680
I'm here with some of
the most popular people

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.530
on the internet at VidCon.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.960
And I'm here with The Try Guys.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.510
- Hey!
(cheering)

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.740
- Thanks for doing the show, guys.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.280
- Yeah, thanks for having us.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.675
- Okay, I look like an
idiot next to this guy.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.097
- You look great.

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:16.610
- Can we get a box?

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.090
- We can switch places if you want.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.170
- Yeah, we can put Zach by you.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.270
- Yeah, Zach's tiny.
- I'm used to that.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.480
- This is great.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.580
- Now you look really small.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.410
- Wow, you're making
Zach look like an idiot.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.290
- You guys have millions of views.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.000
I wanna do exactly what you're doing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.220
How do I become internet popular
without having much talent

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.053
at all?

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:36.140
- I mean, it's pretty doable.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.590
- Your vids get millions of views.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.403
How hard does that make you?

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:42.617
(laughing)

00:00:42.617 --> 00:00:44.780
For example, I got 700
followers this morning

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.550
and I went to town on myself.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.383
- Wow.

00:00:48.383 --> 00:00:50.970
- That's actually in a
morning that's a great number.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.187
700 more a morning, that's great.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.460
- That's 700 total.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.990
- Oh, you got to 700?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.963
- Got to 700 followers on Instagram.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.753
- Great.

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:02.540
- Follow me on Instagram.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.640
- Okay.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.540
- Just take out your
phones and the first person

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.660
to follow me on Instagram wins.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.200
- And what's the prize?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.140
- Anyone have $20?

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.650
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Let's do it.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.660
- You gotta tell me the name.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.493
What's the name?

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:17.970
- Oh, yeah, jordypizza.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.810
- Got it.
- Dammit!

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.810
- You really do only have 700 followers.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.595
Famous internet person
convention and you have 700

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:26.968
in his account.

00:01:26.968 --> 00:01:29.218
(laughing)

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.288
I thought that was a bit.

00:01:33.288 --> 00:01:34.440
(laughing)

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.910
- Let's see what your story is.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.270
- [Jordan] That's my friend Chris.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.634
- Cotton?
- Right here is fine.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:39.467
- [Jordan] Yeah, he's in the background.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:40.300
- Cotton has almost 2,000.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.150
- Cotton has 2,000.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.718
- Cotton has more than you!

00:01:42.718 --> 00:01:43.551
- That's respectable.

00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:44.620
- Cotton, what are you up to?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.460
- Cotton, get up here.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.220
- Alright, you guys
have millions of views.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.530
I want to do exactly what you're doing.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.640
What are the principles of
becoming popular on the internet

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.515
when you aren't that talented?

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.500
- First of all, I think
you're very talented.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.333
- I don't know what you're doing tonight

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.310
but there's a party.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.283
We can talk shop.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.980
- The five of us are going to party.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.014
- Jordan, we're talking here.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:09.431
What did you say?

00:02:10.265 --> 00:02:11.310
- You're welcome to chill with us later.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.610
- The whole point of this
convention is about meeting

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.443
people, meeting of the minds.

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:16.190
- [Chris] As long as there's
only five of us, I'm in.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.440
- Yeah, it is a five-person
table so beyond that we'd be...

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.890
- I'm in, man.
- [Keith] Great.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.708
- I happy to be accepted by this dude.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.958
(cheering)

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.123
Group hug, baby!

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:29.083
It's official.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.350
- So there you have it.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.250
That's how you become internet popular.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.160
I'm Jordan Mendoza.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.850
This is my segment and
these are my friends,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.203
