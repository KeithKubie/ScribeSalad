00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.740
UH OH FELLAS, LOOKS AS THOUGH WE HAVE COMPANY.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.043
- AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
NIGGRAS DOIN' OUT HERE?

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.311
- WE ARE THE TIME HATERS.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:15.681
WE TRAVELED ALL THE WAY
BACK THROUGH TIME...

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:18.418
TO CALL YOU A CRACKER.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.319
- YOU BETTER
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:23.056
- ACTUALLY, YOU BETTER
WATCH YOUR MOUTH, WHITE BOY,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.024
BEFORE I PUT THESE GATORS
UP YOUR ASS

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.094
AND SHOW YOUR INSIDES
SOME STYLE.

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:30.396
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.768
- I CAN'T BE NO SLAVE, SILKY.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:38.071
- OH, GOOD GOD.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.541
- LOOK, SILKY,
HE DONE PULLED OUT A WHIP.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.409
- NICE WHIP.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.179
THIS HERE IS A PISTOL.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.214
REACH FOR THE SKY, HONKY.

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.483
- HONKY?
HONKY?

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:55.655
- HONKY IS A RACIAL EPITHET
USED FOR WHITE PEOPLE.

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.458
WAS MADE POPULAR BY
A MAN NAMED GEORGE JEFFERSON

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.827
IN THE 1970s.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.095
YOU SEE,
HE AND HIS WIFE, WEEZY,

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:03.529
HAD A DRY CLEANING BUSINESS,

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.765
SO THEY MOVED ON UP
TO THE EAST SIDE,

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:08.534
TO A DELUXE APARTMENT
IN THE SKY.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:12.538
THEY FINALLY GOT
A PIECE OF THE PIE.

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.607
CONVOLUTED STORY, I'LL ADMIT,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.709
BUT THE POINT IS THIS:

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:21.414
THAT IN THE FUTURE,
ALL BLACK PEOPLE WILL BE FREE.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.216
- IN A SECOND, ALL RIGHT,

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.218
THIS IS WHAT STOPPED
THE WHOLE SHOW.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:26.853
THIS STOPPED--
I MEAN, LITERALLY,

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:30.256
THE WHOLE EPISODE CAME
TO A SCREECHING HALT RIGHT HERE.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.226
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I CAN PREDICT THIS EPISODE

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.294
COMING TO A SCREECHING HALT
RIGHT NOW.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:36.929
BUT I'LL SHOW IT.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:39.265
- WHEN'S WE GONNA BE FREE?

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:42.835
- THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION,
MY MAN.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.437
HOW ABOUT NOW-ISH?

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.872
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:47.573
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.142
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.111
[gunshot]
- [grunts]

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.083
- APPARENTLY,
SHOOTING A SLAVE MASTER

00:01:57.116 --> 00:02:01.687
ISN'T FUNNY TO ANYBODY
BUT ME AND NEAL.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.525
IF I COULD,
I'D DO IT EVERY EPISODE.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:06.958
SO THAT WAS THAT ONE.
