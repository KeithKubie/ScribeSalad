00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.040
Now that Tim Burton’s remake is all but
forgotten,

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.660
watch the Planet of the Apes movies reclaim
their place as the best talking animal franchise

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.100
since Babe.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.300
Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.939
Wait, why does Dawn come after Rise?

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.390
Don’t you rise after the dawn?

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.550
Whatever.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.550
Settle in for the thinking man’s summer
blockbuster chock full of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.180
complicated characters,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.289
political maneuvering,

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.420
family dynamics,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.420
and a monkey dual-wielding machine guns on
horseback fighting a tank.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.339
OK that was kinda dumb, but who cares?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.140
It’s still awesome, right?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.499
Thrill as apes engage in guerrilla warfare

00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:59.219
against a society of way less interesting
humans, like

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.159
the pragmatic leader who spends most of his
screen time talking into a bullhorn,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.959
"We are survivors!"

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.340
"We've been through hell together!"

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.700
this generic good guy,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.840
this assh*le,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.400
“I’m the assh*le."

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.020
this... woman...

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.390
and this... kid who... draws things.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.160
Yeah, let's get back to the apes.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.760
See Andy Serkis deliver an Oscar-worthy performance

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.860
by capturing the graceful movements and emotions
of Caesar

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.110
and doing his best Christian Bale Batman impression

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050
"One day!"

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.520
"Where's the trigger?!"

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.280
"Move him!"

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.450
while the cast and crew deliver an even MORE
Oscar-worthy performance by not laughing at

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.610
a tiny British man in a unitard pretending
to be a monkey.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.200
Wow, when you take away the CGI, this looks
f*cking ridiculous.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.180
So immerse yourself in a movie full of stunning
visuals and great acting, that will have audiences

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.060
everywhere ignoring its forgettable plot about
fixing a dam

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.730
"The city used to run off nuclear power, but
that ran out years ago so we've been using

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.030
diesel generators and gasifiers. But if we
could just get this dam working…"

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.600
Blah blah blah blah.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.600
And the super cliche death of the main villain,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.670
because once again: apes with guns on horseback
equals AWESOME.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.360
Starring...

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.600

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.110
and Damn Dirty Apes!

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.030
Actually, they’re pretty clean, and civilized.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.220
And Damn Civilized Apes!

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.620

of the Apes

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.870

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:54.290

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.660
So, uh, how can I put this...

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.270
where 
are all the monkey dicks?
