00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.719
&gt;&gt; Alright, so we have our code. We have our editor. Let's open up the code

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.210
in the editor. We can just pull this

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.820
over from Finder and have this nice little sidebar.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.360
&gt;&gt; That is cool. I had no idea you could do that. Okay, so these

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.630
are all our files. This is looking

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.050
familiar now. I played around with these before.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470
&gt;&gt; So this, these are all JavaScript files.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.970
I don't want to look at them right now.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.160
&gt;&gt; Alright. The one that seemed most important was the index file.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.260
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, yeah. So this is the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.170
HTML that we saw in the browser earlier.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so, so right, this is the HTML.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.475
This is that great container with the rows and the cells.

00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:35.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.743
&gt;&gt; I had some different tiles. I made a Udacity flavored version of this app.

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:41.040
&gt;&gt; Okay. I want to get them in there. So, basically,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.660
I want these different, the two tile, the four tile-

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.190
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.310
&gt;&gt; To be something different.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.030
&gt;&gt; Okay, so just replace the pictures.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, should we do that in here or is that going to happen in the CSS?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.510
&gt;&gt; Well, let's see. Do we see anything in here about the pictures themselves?

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.390
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.940
&gt;&gt; Alright, so let's try looking.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.580
&gt;&gt; So, you open up Style.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we've got a couple of different CSS.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.020
&gt;&gt; So, the one we were playing with before

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.660
was the main, so maybe that's the place to go.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's probably, probably the best place to look.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.970
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to search around for tiles and make some changes?

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.510
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.760
&gt;&gt; Cool.
