00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.810
How do you fight
a fire when it's in motion?

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.260
The challenges faced by
Air Force firefighters

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.330
are unlike any other job in the world.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.600
Their response times must be instantaneous

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.740
and the challenges, whether spatial,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.116
chemical, or kinetic, are numerous.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.520
The only thing all aircraft
fires have in common

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.440
is their immense stakes.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.870
That's why firefighters
prepare with top-level training

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.580
at Duty Fire Academy.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.500
- It's a science: how you manage it,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.180
how you put it out, how you control it.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.420
The Air Force's unique challenges

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.230
make its firefighters some of
the very best in the world,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.770
ready for any situation.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.970
- It's not just pulling up on scene

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.220
and putting water on the fire.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.480
Firefighters must contend

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.020
with high-intensity scenarios,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.130
pressurized systems,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.640
immensely powerful machines

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.430
and hazardous substances not found

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.370
in civilian society.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.180
- We have a burning, flammable liquid

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.740
an aircraft spills fuel

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.840
on the ramp due to a crash...

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.930
In addition,
these fires burn incredibly hot

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.930
such as temperatures between
427 and 816 degrees celsius.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.950
- In order to put that
out you need to cool it.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.150
And you need to keep the
heat separated from the fuel.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.400
Foam is one way of doing that.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.280
Foam flows on top of the fuel.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.890
It smothers the oxygen away from the fire,

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.883
puts the fire out.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.410
As technology keeps evolving,

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.420
so too do the potential
problems when it goes wrong.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.960
Coordination is key,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.170
from inspection to
prevention to suppression.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.435
When a call comes in,
firefighters have to be dressed

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:35.230
to go in under one minute

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.873
and arrive in two minutes.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.940
After that, they have one more minute

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.277
to reduce the fire by 90%.

00:01:43.277 --> 00:01:46.490
If temperatures reach 649 degrees celsius,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.913
the plane is done for.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.800
Although the extinguishing materials

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.900
vary by the fire's causes,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.340
Air Force firefighters must
prepare for every combustion,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.640
from jet fuel to live weapons,
to metal itself burning.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.120
If airborne, firefighters
have to be careful

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.280
to preserve the integrity
of the plane hull

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.520
with high-pressure extinguishing methods,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.520
so as not to give the fire
a path into the cabin.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.320
- The fire on aircrafts
spreads very quickly.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.440
It'll start one end
and spread very quickly

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.300
to the other end.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.700
In order to be
as effective as possible,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.100
firefighters also have
to memorize the layouts

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.480
of different model aircrafts,
which can vary greatly.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.615
- Where it may be as
little as a couple of feet

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:30.260
in length all the way up to an aircraft

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.316
that may be 300 feet long and is loaded

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.743
with thousands of gallons of fuel.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.210
Air Force firefighters are called upon

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.170
to help far beyond the air field.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.560
Their special skills are used to combat [everything] from

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.080
natural disasters such as wildfires

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.453
to commercial airlines.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.780
- The Fire Academy was very intense,

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.113
a very grueling process.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.280
We do have a lot of responsibility

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.520
for responding to whatever may happen.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.120
But it's a very rewarding career

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.793
and I'm proud to be part of the
Air Force and a firefighter.
