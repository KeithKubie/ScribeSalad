00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
In pretty much all of
the videos so far we've

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.590
been assuming an economic
ideal, and that economic ideal

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.290
is perfect competition.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.560
And perfect competition
is exactly what

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.282
you think it is, competition.

00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:15.740
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.600
is think about it in a
little bit more exact terms,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470
in terms of what are
the ground rules we need

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.501
to have to really have this
ideal perfect competition.

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.000
It's important to realize that
there's very few markets that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.370
are truly perfectly competitive.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.540
And those that are are
very good for consumers,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.510
but there are that get
very close to being

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.520
perfectly competitive.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.810
And if we have time, we will
discuss those in this video.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.620
Now, to be perfectly
competitive,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.550
you have to have
many competitors.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.550
So one of the first
stipulations is many players.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.290
And they need to be competing
for the kind of the same buyer

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.200
and kind of offering
the same thing.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.330
And so they need to
have identical products.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.670
Remember, we're talking
about an economic ideal here.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.990
There's very few markets where
the product is absolutely

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.650
identical or the service
is absolutely identical,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.340
but we're talking about an
economic ideal over here.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.860
The next condition you need
is no barriers to entry.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.660
So, if at any given
moment it looks

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.460
attractive for other people
to go into that market,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.200
other people will
go into that market

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.440
and there's nothing that's
really going to stop them.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.231
If the firms that are
already in the market

00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:32.830
are making an economic profit
that means that it's good.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.740
It's a good option
for people to do.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.910
You can do better in this market
than your opportunity costs,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.470
and so people will
enter into that market.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.210
And in order for this market
to be perfectly competitive,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.070
we can't have any barriers,
nothing stopping those people.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.750
On top of that, there
can be no advantage

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.560
for established firms.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.440
No advantage for existing firms.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.200
So once someone
jumps into the fray

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.310
and, assuming that they
are somewhat competent,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.419
they are going to be able to
compete on kind of equal terms

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.470
with the people that
are already there.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.510
And then the last one,
and this is important,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.440
is that you have to have
really good price information.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.170
That the buyers
and the sellers all

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.910
have to know about
each other's prices.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.493
The buyers need to know all the
prices so that they can really

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.451
do good comparison
shopping, and the sellers

00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.700
need to know everyone's
prices so that they can really

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.105
match prices really well.

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:34.540
So good price information.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.380
Now, there are many
different types

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.450
of markets that
somewhat approximate

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.330
perfect competition.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.420
There are very few that
are completely purely

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.740
perfect competition.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.430
But one of them that does
come to mind, one of them that

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.264
does definitely come to mind
is the US airline industry.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:50.680
And the US airlines--
We can think

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.180
about these different
bullet points,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.320
how closely it matches it.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.194
There are definitely
many different airlines.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.690
They don't offer
identical products.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.859
I'm sure the airlines
would not agree.

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.650
They would say that
they're differentiating

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.010
on their service and what type
of food they give or, I guess,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.160
don't give to you,
or how much they're

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.680
charging for the baggage
check-in and all the rest.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.222
But for most consumers,
they're just like, look,

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:13.680
I just want an
economy class ticket

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.070
from San Francisco to New
York, and they view them

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.780
as almost identical products.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.030
So the airline industry
does pretty well

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.670
on this first point.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.200
No barriers to entry?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.846
Well, there are some barriers to
entry in the airline industry.

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:28.470
You need a few billion
dollars that you

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.230
need to either find
or borrow or whatever,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.850
so that you can buy
the capital so you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.177
can start operating planes.

00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:35.760
Or, I guess you could
rent the planes.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.509
But, either way, you
need a lot of capital

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.950
to get into this business.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.450
You need access to
airport terminals

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.391
that you'll have to
lease and landing

00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:43.390
rights and all the rest.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.070
So there are some
barriers to entry.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.680
But for the most part, at
least in the United States,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.687
if you are a US
operator-- so there

00:03:51.687 --> 00:03:53.270
are some barriers
to entry, especially

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.340
for foreign operators.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.570
But if you are a US operator
and you have the capital

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.110
you will be able to be the next
Virgin America or Southwest

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.210
Airlines or JetBlue.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.497
So there are some barriers
to entry, but they are low.

00:04:05.497 --> 00:04:07.080
It's not like the
government is saying

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.110
that no one else can
start a new airlines.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.721
No advantage for
existing airlines?

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:12.220
Yeah.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.230
That's somewhat true.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.895
If I start a new
airlines tomorrow

00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:20.070
and it's offering comparable
rates and comparable service,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.200
I could imagine people would be
willing to take this airlines.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.460
So the airline industry
seems pretty good there.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.350
And good price
information-- and this

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.690
is why the airline industry
definitely came to my mind,

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.150
because I can't imagine an
industry where you have better

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.080
price information that at least
now, after the internet came

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.520
about-- than in the
airline industry

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.980
you want a flight from
San Francisco to New York,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.700
you go to any of these
travel sites, Orbits, Kayak,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.620
Expedia, whatever
you want to go to.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.620
And you get all of the
flights listed for you

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.950
and they're listed by price.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.750
They consort them by price.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.520
And you can actually
pick-- and it's

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.060
known that people do this--
they pick a flight that

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.750
might be $500 or
$600, but they can

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.410
compare based on a few
pennies or even a few dollars.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.080
So there's extremely
good price information.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.947
And, obviously, the sellers
have all of their IT systems,

00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:09.530
the airlines have
all their IT systems

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.270
to keep track of where airline
prices are going as well.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.410
So the air travel industry,
like most industries,

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.700
is not absolutely
perfect competition,

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.274
but it gets pretty close
to perfect competition.

00:05:19.274 --> 00:05:20.940
And you even see that
in the real world,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.565
is that it's very
hard for the airlines

00:05:22.565 --> 00:05:26.100
to make really a lot of
profit, whether you're

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.410
talking about accounting
profit or even economic profit.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.720
And you can see that from
this supply and demand curve

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.770
right over here.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.576
So on this axis, the horizontal
axis, this is the quantity.

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:37.950
This is a measure
of the quantity

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.684
of kind of airline service.

00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:41.100
And we're measuring
it in billions

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.850
of seat miles per
week, and I know

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.414
that sounds like
a strange thing.

00:05:45.414 --> 00:05:46.830
But really, we're
just saying, OK,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.010
in a given week tell me all
of the seats that are in use,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.080
and multiply those
number of seats--

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.240
so the seat miles
in a given week.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.100
The number of seats
times the miles

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:08.460
or the average miles per
seat in a given week,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.350
and that gives you
how much air travel.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.580
This is a measure of air
travel in, let's say, in the US

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.610
in that week.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.339
And on this axis,
this is the price.

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:18.130
This is price per, and
this should actually

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.810
say price per seat mile.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.520
And, of course, you have your
supply curve right over here.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.280
This is your supply curve.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.750
At first, to start providing
those first few miles.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.360
The airlines are willing to do
that relatively inexpensively.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.790
Maybe they're finding that
from the most obvious airports

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.685
that maybe the landing
rights are cheaper

00:06:41.685 --> 00:06:43.670
or it's cheaper to lease
things, or whatever.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.749
But as they start running
more and more and more

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.040
routes, maybe between smaller
and smaller cities, maybe

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.910
smaller and less
efficient planes,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.200
it starts to become more
and more expensive for them

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.640
to supply those
incremental miles.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.560
And obviously, on
the demand side,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.232
if air travel is
very, very expensive,

00:06:59.232 --> 00:07:01.065
very few people are
going to want to travel.

00:07:01.065 --> 00:07:03.273
There is going to be very
little travel that happens.

00:07:03.273 --> 00:07:09.510
If it's very cheap, many people
are going to want to travel.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.160
Now, let's say that this is
where the market is right now.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.290
Obviously, we have an
equilibrium price right

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.840
over there.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.130
And then we have an equilibrium
quantity of seat miles.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.320
But let's say that the price
level in order for the players

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.460
to actually have an economic
profit is over here.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.690
So it is right over here.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:42.770
So this is the price needed
for zero economic profit,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.170
or you could say for
neutral economic profit.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.250
Or you could even say
for normal profit,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:54.980
for economic profit
to be equal to zero.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.360
So at that point, if
that is the price, then

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.990
the firms that are
offering airline travels,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.680
they're kind of neutral between
shutting down and continuing

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.550
to offer service.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.550
But notice, the way
I've drawn it here

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.189
that is substantially lower than
the current equilibrium price.

00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:14.480
So what this is saying is
since the current equilibrium

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.021
price is a good bit
higher than this,

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:19.890
or it's just higher at all,
these firms in the market right

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.200
now are generating
economic profit, definitely

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.117
positive economic profit.

00:08:25.117 --> 00:08:25.950
So what's happening?

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.710
If there is positive
economic profit,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.380
that means that there's an
incentive for other firms

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.380
to enter into this industry.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.870
So what's going
to happen is this

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.078
is going to be the supply
curve right at that moment.

00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:40.190
But as soon as another
carrier realizes

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.809
that they can, or
any of the carriers

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.220
realize they can offer
more-- it doesn't even

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:45.610
have to be new
carriers entering.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.984
It could be existing carriers
just offering, maybe buying

00:08:47.984 --> 00:08:49.810
more planes or
offering more routes.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.580
Then maybe a little
bit later the supply

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.540
curve shifts like this.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.630
The supply curve
shifts like that.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.460
And then this would be
our new equilibrium price.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.200
But we're still
making economic profit

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.670
because our new
equilibrium price

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.780
is still higher than
the price needed

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.710
for zero economic profit.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.080
So still more people
will continue to enter.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.200
And so then you might
have a new supply

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.940
curve that looks like this.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.800
And now this is our
new equilibrium price.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.966
And notice what's happening.

00:09:15.966 --> 00:09:20.310
We're traveling down to the
right along the demand curve.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.740
As more supply comes
on, we are obviously

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.820
increasing the quantity and
the price is going down.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.460
But still, the
equilibrium price is

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.640
higher than this
line right over here.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.130
So even more people
will enter, until we

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.150
get to that point
right over there.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.500
And at that point, now
the equilibrium price

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.280
is the price at which
all of the players

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.050
are having zero economic profit.

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.100
And there's no incentive
for more people

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.200
to enter into it, because then
the equilibrium price will

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.790
go down, or they're,
essentially right

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.500
now economic profit is zero.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.302
So everyone is neutral
in this scenario.

00:09:57.302 --> 00:09:58.510
So I want to leave you there.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.760
This is what happens
with perfect competition.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.135
That there's no
barriers to entry

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:05.180
and more people go in and in
and in, the price goes down,

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.250
the quantity will go
up in this scenario.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.872
But what I want to
do in the next video

00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:09.040
is to think about
what if we didn't

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.080
have perfect competition.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.496
And especially,
what happens if we

00:10:11.496 --> 00:10:13.690
have something
like, I don't know,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.460
something like a monopoly.
