one way of thinking about is this

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170
one way of thinking about is this
 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.359
one way of thinking about is this
there's an approach to quantum mechanics

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
there's an approach to quantum mechanics
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.870
there's an approach to quantum mechanics
where one imagines that there are many

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
where one imagines that there are many
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.279

in some sense parallel realities moving
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.920
in some sense parallel realities moving
along in some larger environment if you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
along in some larger environment if you
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.520
along in some larger environment if you
will where for instance if I want to

measure an electron quantum theory says

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
measure an electron quantum theory says
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560
measure an electron quantum theory says
well there's a 50% chance it's there and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
well there's a 50% chance it's there and
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810
well there's a 50% chance it's there and
a 50% chance it's over there

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
a 50% chance it's over there
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.610
a 50% chance it's over there
and what does that mean well one

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
and what does that mean well one
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920
and what does that mean well one
interpretation says well there's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
interpretation says well there's
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229
interpretation says well there's
actually two universes and in one

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
actually two universes and in one
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.270
actually two universes and in one
University electron is here and in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
University electron is here and in
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939
University electron is here and in
another universe it is over there it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
another universe it is over there it's
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.740
another universe it is over there it's
kind of a crazy sounding idea but a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
kind of a crazy sounding idea but a
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.349
kind of a crazy sounding idea but a
quantum computer perhaps can harness

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
quantum computer perhaps can harness
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.170
quantum computer perhaps can harness
that by doing some calculations over

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
that by doing some calculations over
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390
that by doing some calculations over
here and other calculations over there

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
here and other calculations over there
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.670
here and other calculations over there
in parallel now it's doing in some times

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
in parallel now it's doing in some times
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.649
in parallel now it's doing in some times
twice as many calculations as a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
twice as many calculations as a
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.499
twice as many calculations as a
classical computer existing in one world

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
classical computer existing in one world
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.899

would be able to do now imagine taking

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
would be able to do now imagine taking
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.109
would be able to do now imagine taking
that idea and spreading it over all of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
that idea and spreading it over all of
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.149
that idea and spreading it over all of
the possible realities allowed by

the possible realities allowed by
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.820
the possible realities allowed by
quantum mechanics now you're harnessing

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
quantum mechanics now you're harnessing
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100
quantum mechanics now you're harnessing
all of these different worlds if you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
all of these different worlds if you
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.580
all of these different worlds if you
will

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
will
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530
will
to do all of these calculations in

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
to do all of these calculations in
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.760
to do all of these calculations in
parallel much faster much more powerful

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
parallel much faster much more powerful
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710
parallel much faster much more powerful
doing calculations that in a single

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
doing calculations that in a single
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.399
doing calculations that in a single
universe would be impossible so this is

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
universe would be impossible so this is
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.039
universe would be impossible so this is
one way of thinking about it and it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
one way of thinking about it and it
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.920
one way of thinking about it and it
offers amazing possibilities and we just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
offers amazing possibilities and we just
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.850
offers amazing possibilities and we just
need to see how successful we are at

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
need to see how successful we are at
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490
need to see how successful we are at
harnessing these ideas to actually put

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
harnessing these ideas to actually put
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.249
harnessing these ideas to actually put
it into practice and that we don't know

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
it into practice and that we don't know
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.709
it into practice and that we don't know
yet we'll see going forward but it's an

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
yet we'll see going forward but it's an
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480
yet we'll see going forward but it's an
exciting possibility

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
