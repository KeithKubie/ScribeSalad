00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:22.450
SAL: Hi.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.880
I'm Sal.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.830
Today, we're going to solve
problem nine of fall 2009, the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.060
final for 3091.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.820
The problem reads, the phase
diagram of the binary system

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.400
neodymium, praseodymium and
EPR is given below.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.800
There are two allotropes--

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.780
alpha, which is hexagonal
close pack--

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.870
HCP--

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.780
and beta, which is body
center cubic--

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.000
BCC.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.170
Now this problem obviously is
about phase diagrams. So

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.760
before you attempt to solve the
problem, you need to make

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.130
sure that you understand how
to read phase diagrams and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.920
also how to apply the lever
rule and know where in the

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.580
phase diagram to apply
the lever rule.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.880
So if we look at our phase
diagram, which I have drawn

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.100
over here for part A--

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.010
the part A asks, explain why a
lenticular phase diagram is to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.800
be expected for the
binary system.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.310
So this is a lenticular phase
diagram and a lot of students

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.690
when answering this problem
get confused and say, oh,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.140
because the components are
soluble together, that's why

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.650
you get a lenticular.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.570
That's correct, but that
information you can get from

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.620
the phase diagram.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.130
It's obvious by looking that you
have an alpha phase that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.320
you have from zero to a 100%
that can be missable together,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.870
but it doesn't really
explain the answer.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.670
Now the best thing to do is to
look at the periodic table of

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.070
elements and look at the
physical and chemical

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.530
properties of the elements.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:01.460
So here we're comparing to--
we're comparing neodymium and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.570
praseodymium, which are
two components that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.310
are making the alloy.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.900
So here this is atomic percent
praseodymium on your x axis

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.340
and on your y axis, you have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.640
temperature in degrees Celsius.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.890
So at zero percent praseodymium,
we have a 100%

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.940
neodymium and at 100%
praseodymium, we have zero

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.320
percent neodymium.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.790
That pretty much comes from
the phase diagram.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.530
So why would these
two have formed a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.280
lenticular phase diagram?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.290
Well, if you look at the
periodic table, you'll notice

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.990
that these two elements lie
right next to each other.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.100
So what does that mean?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.740
That means that chemically,
they're pretty

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.950
much almost the same.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.240
To answer this question for part
A, I would look at it and

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.260
I would notice that actually
both these elements have the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.510
same crystal structure.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.030
So I would write down,
they have the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.280
same crystal structure.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.760
They also have pretty much the
same electronegativity or very

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.450
similar electronegativity.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.770
So very similar
electronegativity.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.020
Also, they have pretty
much the same atomic

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.270
radii--atomic radius.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.640
And also very similar, very
close to each other--

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.410
the same density.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:02.350
So the density is
almost the same.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.070
So because these two components
have the same

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.310
properties together-- the same
size, same crystal structure,

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.870
then you should expect that they
should form a missable

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.720
lenticular phase diagram, which
is what we have here.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.050
So if you were to answer that
for part A, that would give

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.550
you pretty much all the points
and that hints that you

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.380
understand how to look at the
chemical properties of the

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.300
elements and the physical
properties of the elements and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.510
compare them together and
rationalize why the phase

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.520
diagram looks the way it does.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.750
Part B asks--

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.000
I'll come over here
to do part B.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.590
At each point, I identify all
the phases present in

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.660
equilibrium.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.200
II--

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.960
state the composition of
each phase and III--

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.240
calculate the relative amount
of all phase presence.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.570
And it asks us to analyze the
three points that we have on

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.820
our phase diagram.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.190
So we have one for
I, II, III--

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.170
So number one-- if we look at
our phase diagram, we lie

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.600
exactly where your
alpha phase is.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.560
So to answer the first part of
the problem is identify all

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.810
the phases present--

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.470
we only have the alpha
phase here.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.480
So if you were to write down
alpha phase, that's correct.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.010
The part two says, state the
composition of each phase.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.390
So what's the composition of
the alpha phase in here?

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.770
Well, if I trace down my line
down to my x axis, I notice

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.980
that for the atomic percent
of praseodymium, pretty

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.420
close to about 18%.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:02.150
So it's 18 atomic
percent here.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.150
So to answer the question for
part I, I would notice that--

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.220
I would write down that
it's alpha phase.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.840
For the second part,
we have 18%--

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:25.700
18 atomic percent praseodymium,
which leaves

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:36.610
behind about 82% atomic
percent of neodymium.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.750
And for part three--

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.580
part three asks about
the relative amounts

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.830
of the phases present--

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.160
we only have the alpha phase
in that part so I would say

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.790
that we have 100% pure
alpha, which is--

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.610
if you write this,
that's correct.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.090
Now for the second point that
we're going to analyze in our

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.330
phase diagram number two--

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.490
if we come over here and look at
it, you'll notice that now

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.710
we lie in between or between
two phases so where the

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.910
lenticular region is at.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.610
So here, I don't have pure
beta or pure liquid.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.780
I have a combination of both
beta and liquid and this is

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.590
exactly where you need to
apply the lever rule.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.380
You can't apply the lever rule
here because it's just 100%

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.330
pure phase.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.270
You can only apply when you're
in a region where you have two

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.360
phases that coexist
in equilibrium.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.190
So if I go ahead and
analyze part two--

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.210
part I--

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.470
the phases that are present are
beta and the liquid phase.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.720
For part II, it asks, what
are the compositions?

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.205
Well, if I blow up my lenticular
phase diagram--

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:03.240
so I'm sitting right here and
this is sitting at around 62

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.870
two atomic percent of Pr--

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.520
praseodymium and it asks about
the phases or the relative

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.030
composition of each phase.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.390
Well, over here, I have beta,
over here I have the liquid

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.860
phase and in between I have the
beta plus the liquid that

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:25.620
are coexisting in equilibrium.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.510
So if I want to know
how much--

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.560
what's the composition of my
beta phase that I have here--

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.400
well, I'm going to have to
go to the line where both

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.730
intersect with the beta and
the beta plus liquid

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.690
intersects.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.880
And if I analyze this point--

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.030
if I look down what the
composition of that is for

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:52.320
that line, I see that I have
about 56 atomic percent of

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.600
praseodymium.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:58.890
So to start answering part two,
I would say that if I

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:00.950
look at beta--

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:10.410
in the beta phase, I have 56% or
atomic percent of Pr and if

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:19.350
I have 56% of Pr, then this
leaves just 44 atomic percent

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.050
of neodymium and if I
look at my liquid--

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.000
so I'm going to just move
this over here.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.190
I look at the liquid, which
is going to be where it

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.600
intersects in the liquid region
and if I trace it down,

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.710
I see that this is
about 70% or so.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.980
So here I have around
roughly 70%.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.290
If you trace it down to your x
axis, this is 70% or 70 atomic

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:55.700
percent Pr, which leaves 30
atomic percent of neodymium.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.260
So if you were to write this
down for the liquid, just

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.700
write an arrow here so I won't
have to rewrite that--

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.530
that would be the answer for
part two because again, we're

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.480
analyzing this point, which is
point number two and we're in

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.130
between two phases.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.260
So that covers the second
part of part B.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.210
And for the third part--

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.660
I'll go ahead and I'll
put up here.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.290
That one now is where we have
to apply the lever rule

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.180
because now we have to figure
out exactly how much of each

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.780
phase is present
at equilibrium.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:37.490
So if I look at my diagram, it's
going to be very simple.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.900
If I want to know how much beta
I have in this mixture,

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.540
you're simply going to apply the
lever rule and for beta,

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.820
it's going to be whatever this
magnitude is or whatever the

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.720
difference between these two
points are over the length of

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.960
the whole existence at that
temperature of the length of

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.220
the whole composition that you
have. So if I do the simple

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.230
calculation for beta--

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:15.470
beta is going to be simply 70
minus 62 over 70 minus 56 and

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:22.370
this essentially just equals
eight over 14, which is about

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:28.620
57 atomic percent
praseodymium.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.860
So--

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.270
sorry-- not percent Pr--

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:36.380
percent beta phase.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.760
So in beta, I have 57%.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.030
So that means that
for my liquid--

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.520
I can do two things for this
problem, for the liquid.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.780
I know that everything is
normalized to 100%.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.530
So the difference between 157
will be the liquid composition

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.150
where I can go ahead and
apply the lever rule

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.220
again and do the math.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.520
So if I apply the lever rule
again for my liquid phase,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.820
it's going to simply
be 62 minus 56.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.930
We're coming back on our--

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.060
looking at the liquid phase
that is coexisting in this

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.160
equilibrium at this temperature
and I want to know

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.000
how much liquid--

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.220
it's going to be the magnitude
of this over the total length

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.920
of my composition there--

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.060
that's what I'm doing here.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.900
Again, this is 70 minus 56.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:31.240
So this would end up being just
six over 14, which is

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.140
essentially just--

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.050
if you have 57% here, if you do
the math, you're going to

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:45.560
get 43% of liquid.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.270
So part three--

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:53.610
when you apply the lever rule,
you see that at this point you

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.710
have more beta than
you have liquid--

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.600
and it kind of makes sense
because if you look at your

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.730
diagram, your point is sitting
closer to the beta phase.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.030
So I would expect intuitively
that I would have more beta

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.910
present then the liquid present
and that's exactly

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:12.780
what the lever rule tells us.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.010
So that's point number
two for part B.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.730
And if I look at point number
three now, which I'll write

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.040
right here--

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.190
this is essentially the same
thing as point number one.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.610
But now point number three--

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.680
we're no longer lying
in alpha.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.440
We're lying in the beta phase.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:36.260
So if I trace down what my
composition is here, I'm about

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:43.110
78% of Pr--

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.810
so to answer the
first part I--

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.060
beta--

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.600
the second part II, which is
dealing with the compositions

00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:04.590
of that beta phase is going to
be 78% or 78 atomic percent Pr

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:12.690
and that leaves just 22 atomic
percent neodymium--

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.940
and for the third part III--

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.880
what is the relative amounts
of the phases present?

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.160
Not the composition,
the phases.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.340
I'm exactly where only pure beta
exists so I can say that

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:37.590
I have 100% beta.

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.930
So that pretty much does
it for this problem.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.170
Again, knowing how to read phase
diagrams, knowing how to

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:47.310
apply the lever rule and where
to apply the lever rule will

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.120
allow you to very easily
solve the problem.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.950
A lot of students make the
mistake of trying to apply the

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.640
lever rule when you
have a pure phase.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.200
I mean, that makes no sense
because said lever rule pretty

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.470
much calculates what fraction
of the phases are present in

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.080
that equilibrium mixture.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.750
So keep in mind that you can
only do that when you have a

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.660
region in your phase diagram,
when you have two phases that

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.040
are coexistant in equilibrium.
