00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.810
Here we are in our
RollViewController.swift file.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.390
And the first thing I want you to
do is delete any code that's in

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.980
the rollTheDice method.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.030
Here in this method, we're going to
present our custom view controller.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.250
So how are we going to do that?

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.900
We might as well start by trying
to present it the same way we did

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.990
the UI Kit view controllers.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.810
So in that case, we just construct our
DiceViewController and then present it.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.860
But also we need to
set those dice values.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.209
So we'll do that in these two lines.

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:25.610
Okay, let's see if it runs.

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:30.106
Okay, so far, so good.

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:32.700
Mm, got a problem.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.205
What does the console say?

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:39.273
Okay, fatal error, unexpectedly found
nil while unwrapping an optional value.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:42.880
Okay, so the green highlighting is
pointing to the first die property,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800
and we know if the first
type property is nil,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.570
that's going to cause a runtime error.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.720
Because firstDie is an implicitly
unwrapped optional.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.600
So why is firstDie nil?

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.960
If we look back at our object diagram,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.720
we're reminded that these outlets to
our views were created in storyboard.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.860
We created this instance of
DiceViewController without storyboard.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.220
So that means these outlets, these
views, and this action don't exist yet.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.550
So that's a problem.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.190
So in order to get rid of this error,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.920
we need to get a fully assembled
DiceViewController from storyboard.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.750
So let's close the console and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.800
then go back into our
RollViewController.swift file.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.231
So here's where we were presenting
our DiceViewController before in

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.517
the rollTheDice method.

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:29.645
You go ahead and delete this reference
to the DiceViewController, and

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:31.500
we're going to replace it.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.190
In this line, first we get
a reference to a storyboard object.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.130
And then we asked for

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.960
the DiceViewController by name,
using its storyboard identifier.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.995
Let's take a closer look
at this new method,

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:45.140
instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.730
This identifier is just a string.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.780
It's the name that you give
the view controller in storyboard.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.460
So let's double check that we
actually set that name in storyboard.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.680
So if I open up the storyboard file and
click on the DiceViewController,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.430
I can look in the Utilities pane and
click on the Identity Inspector.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.340
In the Identity Inspector, right here
you'll see the storyboard identifier.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.250
And we can see that, yes, indeed,
it is set to Dice View Controller.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.020
Just for kicks, I'm going to go ahead
and delete this storyboard ID and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.260
the class ID and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.900
see what would happen if you forgot to
put the name of the view controller.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.640
Now let's try and run it.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.090
Okay, so it compiles fine.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.475
Roll the dice.

00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:30.490
Uh-oh, terminating with
uncaught exception.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.750
Okay, so if you get one of
these exception errors,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.240
what you want to do is scroll
up to the top of the console.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.890
And then you'll get more
information about the error.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.600
In here we can see, storyboard
doesn't contain a view controller with

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.360
identifier DiceViewController.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.740
So that's pretty much what we expected.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.640
But we know how to fix that.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.287
We'll just go back in storyboard and
reset the name.

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.075
There, that ought to do it.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.465
Now let's go back into our
RollViewController.swift file.

00:02:59.465 --> 00:03:01.605
Because I want to point out
one more thing about that

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:03.925
instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier
method.

00:03:03.925 --> 00:03:07.427
What's going on at the end of
this line here where it says,

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:10.428
DiceViewController as
DiceViewController.

00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:15.590
If you Alt+click on this method,
you can see that it returns any object.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.295
That's why we need to cast that returned
object as a DiceViewController.
