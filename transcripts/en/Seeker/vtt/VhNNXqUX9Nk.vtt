00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.700
Hi everyone, for this week, Seeker is continuing
our collaboration with The Swim to raise awareness

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.180
about ocean health.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.840
And Ben Lecomte has already seen a lot of
plastic on his journey.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.940
Plastic is a material that’s cheap, versatile,
and lightweight.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.790
It is also a major source of ocean pollution,
which we’re reminded of every time a dead

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.580
whale washes ashore with one hundred and fifteen
plastic cups in its stomach.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.240
So who is most responsible for all this pollution,
and why?

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.580
At first glance, the numbers seem to point
the finger at a handful of countries in Asia.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.460
A 2015 study named the five biggest contributors,
which were Sri Lanka, Vietnam, the Philippines,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.210
Indonesia, and topping the charts at number
1 by a wide margin, China.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.320
Much of the plastic pollution from these countries
stemmed from underdeveloped waste management

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.320
systems.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.020
In China, 76% of waste was mismanaged, meaning
it was either just dropped as litter or disposed

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.000
of in dumps or landfills that weren’t well
contained and allowed the plastic to escape.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.170
The study concluded that all that mismanaged
plastic ended up depositing between 1.3 and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.579
3.5 million metric tons of debris in the ocean
each year, almost a third of the estimated

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.840
annual marine plastic scrap.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.209
But don’t be so quick to pin all the blame
on China.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:21.950
Starting in 1992 China started importing plastic
waste from other countries, and it’s bought

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.710
up a total of about 45% of the post-consumer
plastic exported since then, adding about

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.649
10 to 13 percent to their domestic waste.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.649
Why?

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.990
Because that plastic can be processed and
turned into other goods.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.179
Well, some of it can anyway.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.759
Not all plastics are created equal, and some
types of plastic are more easily recycled

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.850
than others.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.679
You may have noticed the recycling symbol
on your plastic products has a number between

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.609
1 and 7 in the middle.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:52.679
Those numbers actually tell you what kind
of plastic the product is made from, and some

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.609
types are easier to recycle than others.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.859
The two most common types of recycled plastic
are polyethylene terephthalate, found in clothes

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:06.249
and disposable bottles;and high-density polyethylene,
found in detergent bottles, milk jugs, and

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:07.399
toys.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.420
Those are numbers one and two, but plastics
labeled 3 to 7 can be harder to process.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.390
No matter the number China was accepting it
all.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.390
8.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.800
Further complicating things is when materials
get mixed.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.120
Single-use coffee cups, for example, often
have a thin coating of polyethylene to make

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.510
them liquid-proof, which means the materials
have to be separated first before they can

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.630
be recycled.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.410
The process is difficult and expensive, so
most waste management facilities just treat

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.770
the cups as trash.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.031
Likewise when single use food containers still
have scraps of food or liquid in them, they

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:42.130
can’t be processed either and are just discarded.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.710
So since China was buying up nearly half the
world’s exported used plastics, and plenty

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.180
of that was too difficult or impossible to
recycle and was subsequently put into inadequate

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.260
dumps and landfills, then some of the responsibility
lies with the exporters.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.790
At 693 million metric tons, The US was the
second biggest seller of plastic to China

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.220
in 2016, so even though USA ranked 20th on
the list of biggest marine plastic polluters,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.850
that’s only because we weren’t handling
all our trash ourselves.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.820
At the start of 2018 though, things changed.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.200
Citing environmental reasons, China stopped
the import of post-consumer plastics completely.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.840
The last link in the supply chain just isn’t
accepting our low-quality stuff anymore.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.241
Other countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand are buying more plastic, but

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:33.790
those countries struggle to manage their waste
already, so a lot of that plastic will likely

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.840
find its way to the ocean too.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.810
Plus, they can never match the market size
of China, so we still have a lot of trash

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.610
to deal with all of a sudden.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.780
Our waste management systems weren’t ready
for this influx of plastic, and much of what

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.530
we used to send overseas for recycling is
heading right to the landfill.So what can

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.150
an individual like you do if you’re worried
about plastic finding its way to the ocean

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.110
and hurting fish and sea turtles and whales?

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.410
Well lots of thing as it turns out.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.990
You can use less plastic, full stop.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.750
You can recycle more, and be better at recycling
too by rinsing your used plastics and being

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.630
aware of what plastics your local recycling
facility can handle.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.209
And you can demand that manufacturers use
more recycled plastics.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.359
Even though the recycling process increases
the cost, some companies are planning to make

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.960
more products with recycled materials because
it’s important to their consumers.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.660
And lastly, just don’t litter.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.370
It’s the laziest crime.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.960
Do it for the turtles.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.750
Are you surprised by how much plastic gets
mismanaged?

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.419
If you have some helpful tips, why don’t
you share them down in the comments.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.180
Seeker is highlighting The Swim for the rest
of this week to bring awareness to the impact

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.020
of pollution since it’s one of the most
important issues facing humanity today.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.620
We ask you to help us spread the message and
keep coming back to Seeker for all your environment

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.919
updates, and thanks for watching.
