00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.750
is talk about the notion of equilibrium

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.130
in a macroeconomics context.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.320
So let's review a little bit
of what we've already studied

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.350
about aggregate demand
and aggregate supply.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.410
So this vertical axis here,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.860
that is the price level

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.180
for the economy that
we are trying to study,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.210
and this horizontal axis right over here,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.240
this would be the real
GDP for that economy,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.540
the real GDP,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.110
and now I could draw an
aggregate demand curve.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.550
In previous videos we've talked at length

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.670
why economists like to model
it as a downward-sloping curve,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.503
but once again,

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:39.750
take all of these things
with a grain of salt.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.050
There's a lot of assumptions baked in,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.920
and then I could also
draw aggregate supply,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.527
aggregate supply.

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:48.820
This would be short-run aggregate supply,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.330
upward-sloping curve,

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.760
so I'll just call that
short-run aggregate supply,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.040
and I'll call that short-run
aggregate supply one,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.920
'cause we might look at

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.750
other potential aggregate supply curves,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.583
I could also look at

00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:00.870
other potential aggregate demand curves,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.710
but let's just do that for now.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.520
So given these curves,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.700
what would be the price
level and the level of output

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.800
for this economy?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.820
Pause this video and think about it.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.560
Well, some of you all might
just very naturally say,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890
well, it would be the
output and the price level

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.860
that corresponds to this
point of intersection,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.230
and if you said that,
you would be correct.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.230
So this would be our
short-run equilibrium output,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.930
let me label that.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.350
So that right over there

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.210
is our short-run equilibrium,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.930
equilibrium,

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.320
equilibrium output

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.590
corresponds to where the
short-run aggregate supply

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.510
intersects to the aggregate demand curve,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.890
and then this right over here

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.570
would be our equilibrium price level.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.930
Let's call that PL1.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.420
Now why do we feel good

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.480
that this would be the
short-run equilibrium output

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.130
and this would be the price level?

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590
Well, let's imagine what would happen

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.690
if we were at a lower price level,

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.440
let's say right over here.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.440
At that price level, we
see that aggregate demand

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.650
is outstripping aggregate supply.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.170
The output that the aggregate demand wants

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.280
is much higher than the
output of the aggregate

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.190
the short-run aggregate supply,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.500
and so that would be a shortage situation.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.190
There's not enough output
for all of that demand,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.080
and what would likely
happen in that situation?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.460
Well, the folks producing that
output would probably say,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.090
hey, I'm gonna charge a
little bit more for my output,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.500
and as they're charging more they'll say,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.330
hey, maybe I'll also produce
a little bit more output,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.830
and they'll move up the curve

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.330
towards that equilibrium point,

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.940
and then on the demand
side, people would say,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.750
hey, I'm not getting the output I need.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.450
I'm willing to pay more for it,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.090
but as the cost of that output
also goes up, the demand,

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.060
the output demanded would go down,

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.530
and we'd end up back at
that equilibrium point,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.200
and we could do the same
thought exercise if,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.350
for some reason we were at
a price level above PL1.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.010
In this situation, aggregate supply,

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.680
short-run aggregate supply

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.110
is a good bit higher
than aggregate demand,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.940
and so you have more output
than what is being demanded,

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.920
and so what's likely to happen?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.690
Well, the suppliers,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.220
the people producing the output, will say,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.360
well, I'm gonna charge a
little bit less for my output,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.810
and produce less,

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.560
and then similarly,
those demanding will say,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.810
hey, there's this glut of output.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.750
I'm gonna pay less for that output,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.280
but as they're able to pay
less for it, they'll say,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.650
hey, I want more and more of it,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.020
and we get back to the equilibrium point.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.870
Now, what we've talked about
so far is in the short run,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.940
but some of you might be saying,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.860
well, what about the long run?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.220
And in previous videos

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.520
we have talked about
long-run aggregate supply,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.520
and so let's say that this
curve right over here represents

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.530
the long-run aggregate supply curve,

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.880
and where it intersects the
horizontal axis, this Yf,

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.210
you could view this as

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.930
the output of this economy
at full employment,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.790
and it's really the sustainable output

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.820
of this economy at full employment,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.220
and so what's going on in
the graph right over here,

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.430
our equilibrium output is

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.500
well, our short-run equilibrium output

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.620
is below our full employment output,

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.120
and so we have a gap.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.490
So there's a negative to go
from our full employment output

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.170
to our equilibrium output,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.760
and so if we wanted to think about this

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.320
in the context of the business cycle,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.670
where would we be on it?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.070
So let's draw the business cycle.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.070
So now I'll make the vertical
axis the level of real output.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.190
So this would be real GDP right over here,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.620
and then on the horizontal axis,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.530
this will be the passage of time.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.890
That is time, and so what typically

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.620
So at any given point in
time, there will be a Yf.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.210
There will be some
sustainable potential output

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.630
for that economy,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.320
and when I say sustainable it means,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.560
you know, people are sleeping
properly, resting properly,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.040
you're not unsustainably
depleting resources,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.160
and so, for example,
at this point in time,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.800
that might be the Yf,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.750
and that may be a few years later.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.610
Maybe the population has grown,

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.330
there's more infrastructure,
technology's improved.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.210
So now they can sustainably produce more,

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.210
and then a few years after that,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.920
maybe they could produce even more.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.460
Population grows,

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.520
they've thought about better ways

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.240
to arrange the resources in their economy,

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.350
technology improves,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.550
and so you could imagine a world

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.790
where that full employment output

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.100
could just grow in a
very nice way like this,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.220
where it could just grow nicely like this,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.910
but we know that's not the
way real economies work.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.850
They experience the business cycle,

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.620
and the business cycle
looks more like this.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.730
So it will look more like this,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.320
where you have your
peaks and these troughs,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.800
a boom-and-bust cycle, sometimes
people will talk about it,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.640
and the parts of this curve

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.510
where you have increasing
real GDP, like there,

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.460
or there, or there, we
would call those expansions.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.870
So that is economic expansion,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.450
and the parts where GDP is receding.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.760
So for example, right over
here, right over here,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.350
we would call those recessions,

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.860
recessions,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.050
but let's go back to our aggregate demand

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.870
and aggregate supply
world right over here.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.320
This equilibrium point, Y1,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.360
what point could that correspond to

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.360
on this graph right over
here of the business cycle?

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.210
And let me label that.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.380
This is the business

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.040
the business cycle.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.873
Pause this video.

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.586
Think about what point
it could correspond to.

00:06:49.586 --> 00:06:50.520
Well, we're at a point

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.840
where a short-run equilibrium output

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.240
is below our full employment output,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.420
our potential output,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.630
our sustainable full potential output.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.600
So this would correspond to some point

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.900
where our real GDP is sitting
below this blue curve,

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.030
or this blue line the way I've drawn it,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.060
and so Y1 could, for
example, be this point,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.040
or it could be that point,
or it could be that point,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.180
and so if it was this one right over here,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.530
then that right over there would be Y1

00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:25.910
and this right over here would be the Yf,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.930
would be the Yf for this point in time.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.340
Now, as we go forward in time, this Yf,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.210
we see this economic growth,
it could move to the right,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.500
as population grows, as
we have better technology,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.460
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.196
but you're probably thinking,
well, what about other points?

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:48.000
Are there other possible scenarios?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.070
And my answer to you would be absolutely.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.330
So you could imagine a world
where the equilibrium output

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.020
is to the right of our potential output,

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.660
and I will construct that

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.760
by making a different short-run
aggregate supply curve,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760
although I could also do that

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.550
by shifting the aggregate demand curve,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.610
and we'll do that in future videos,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.720
but imagine a situation like this,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.553
imagine.

00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:13.150
So I'll call this short-run
aggregate supply two,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.670
and now this is our equilibrium,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:20.210
equilibrium output, Y2,

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.350
and it corresponds to price level,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.180
price level two right over here,

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:31.130
and notice, here there's a
gap, but it's a positive gap.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.140
Our actual output is above
our sustainable output,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.210
and so for example,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.240
this could correspond to maybe this point.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.130
If it does correspond to this point,

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.340
so if this was Y2, then this
would be our current Yf.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.750
I didn't actually shift it,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.860
but hopefully you're
getting the general idea,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.693
and you're saying,

00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:52.780
well, how can you produce
beyond full employment?

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.540
How can you produce beyond
your sustainable potential?

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.510
Well, this is an economy
that is producing output

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.260
in an unsustainable way.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.600
Unemployment is unusually low.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.800
You have, maybe, depleting resources.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.020
People are working too hard.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.960
They're getting stressed out.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.130
They're not sleeping properly.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.180
However you wanna think about it,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.430
it's not considered sustainable,

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.800
and then you have a third scenario

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.770
where your short-run equilibrium output

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.400
actually equals your
full employment output,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.480
and so that could be this
scenario right over here.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.800
So this would be our short-run
aggregate supply three,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.140
and notice over here, our
equilibrium output, Y3,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.200
is equal to our full employment output,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.560
and when this happens,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.960
this is considered a long-run equilibrium.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.150
So let me write that down.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.150
That is considered a long-run equilibrium,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.470
equilibrium,

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.620
and points that correspond
to long-run equilibria

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.680
on this business cycle right over here

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.750
would be this point right over there,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.530
and that point, and that
point, and that point.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.860
So I'll leave you there.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.840
In future videos,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.220
we will actually think
about how aggregate demand

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.960
and short-run aggregate supply will shift,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.500
and connect it even further

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.940
to the cycles in the business cycle.
