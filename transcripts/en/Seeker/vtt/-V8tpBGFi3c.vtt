00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.870
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Norton Security.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.850
Flying around the world without any fuel isn’t
just for the birds.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.679
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.360
As fuels prices soar and the carbon footprint
of air travel gets bigger, isn’t is nice

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.869
to imagine a world where solar powered planes
fly from city to city without using up a costly

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.869
natural resource?

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.800
Well, we’re on the way to seeing that dream
become a reality.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.210
Next month, Swiss Pilots André Borschberg
and Bertrand Piccard will begin a slow but

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.930
steady flight around the globe without using
any fuel.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.880
Their airplane, Solar Impulse 2, is entirely
solar powered.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.380
Solar Impulse 2 is a revolutionary single-seater
aircraft made of carbon fiber so it’s ultra

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.220
light; it weighs just under 7,055 pounds,
which is about what a small car weighs.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.010
And it’s wingspan is comparatively massive.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.330
From tip to tip, Solar Impulse measures just
over 263 feet, which is larger than the wingspan

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.220
of a Boeing 747.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.820
On those wings are more than 17,000 solar
cells designed to recharge 2077 pounds of

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.000
lithium batteries.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.430
The batteries store enough energy to allow
the airplane to fly at night, too, supplying

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.620
continuous energy to its four engines.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.040
So it should be able to fly around the world
without stopping, right?

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
Not quite.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.790
Solar Impulse 2 is almost all wing.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.900
The cockpit is just over 134 cubic feet and
can only support one pilot at a time.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.760
There are no facilities, no inflight meal
service, and no place to rest.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.980
So Borschberg and Piccard will be alternating
legs of the journey.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.890
They will start from Abu Dhabi in the United
Arab Emirates, then make several stops in

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.150
India, China, the U.S. and Europe before returning
to Abu Dhabi.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.900
If everything goes according to plan, they
should complete the trip in late July or early

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.900
August.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.170
The flight is going to take a while because
Solar Impulse 2 can’t fly that high or that

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.170
fast.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.660
After its unveiling last April, the solar
plane made its debut flight in Switzerland

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
last June 2014.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.740
It reached a maximum altitude of 5,500 feet
and flew at an average ground speed of 35

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.740
mph.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.280
This isn’t the first long-distance solar-powered
flight these pilots have made.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.681
In the summer of 2013, they flew from California
to New York in the predecessor aircraft, Solar

00:01:58.681 --> 00:01:59.681
Impulse.

00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:04.490
It was also a slow journey, though not as
slow; it reached a top speed of about 53 miles

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.490
per hour.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.520
It’ll be really interesting to see how this
flight develops, and more interesting to see

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.660
how this technology eventually trickles into
the commercial market.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.140
But it’ll still be a while.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.630
This solar powered plane is the first of its
kind and change doesn’t always come quick

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.120
to the aviation industry.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
Flying people all around the world is a massive
business that can’t stop while new technologies

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
are introduced.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.090
So if solar powered planes do become commonplace,
not only is it a way off, but it will likely

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.650
be a slow transition.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.650
So what about you guys?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.400
Are you keen to fly by solar power?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.470
Providing there was a washroom on board, that
is.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.370
