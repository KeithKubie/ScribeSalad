happens if you've got the same

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860
happens if you've got the same
 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.830

different users are they is the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090
different users are they is the
 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.819
different users are they is the
application going to see the same area

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829
application going to see the same area
 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.330
application going to see the same area
for those two users and the user will

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340
for those two users and the user will
 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.509
for those two users and the user will
see a different view of the data okay so

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519
see a different view of the data okay so
 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.039

the hard-coded string slash SD card has
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.420
the hard-coded string slash SD card has
been grandfathered in as well so if you

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430
been grandfathered in as well so if you
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.890
been grandfathered in as well so if you
were doing it wrong like please you know

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.599
don't do that but I think we've catered
for that as well but at the same time

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609
for that as well but at the same time

each app will only be installed once on
 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.750
each app will only be installed once on
the device so if you do install an

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760
the device so if you do install an
 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.220
the device so if you do install an
application and then another user goes

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230
application and then another user goes
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.080
application and then another user goes
to install it it will just instantly be

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090
to install it it will just instantly be
 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.210
to install it it will just instantly be
installed so you don't have to duplicate

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
installed so you don't have to duplicate
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.879
installed so you don't have to duplicate
all the actual application and apps data

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889
all the actual application and apps data
 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:14.710
all the actual application and apps data
it's just the user specific data so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
it's just the user specific data so
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.449

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.740
might not be able to answers so do you
know when the 4.2 SDK is going to be

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:01.750
know when the 4.2 SDK is going to be
 

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.610
know when the 4.2 SDK is going to be
available generally historically it

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:05.620

tends to get shipped when we launch a

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:09.190
tends to get shipped when we launch a
 

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.000
tends to get shipped when we launch a
device or open source or reach the

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.010
device or open source or reach the
 

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.440
device or open source or reach the
factory image so historically that's

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.450
factory image so historically that's
 

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.170
factory image so historically that's
what has happened so when that happens I

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.180
what has happened so when that happens I
 

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:23.070
what has happened so when that happens I
guess but I don't have a date okay yes

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.080
guess but I don't have a date okay yes
 

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:33.750

for a number I think it gets even turned

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000
for a number I think it gets even turned
 

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.620
for a number I think it gets even turned
into 480 dpi by a a PCT by a apt so you

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:43.630
into 480 dpi by a a PCT by a apt so you
 

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.990
into 480 dpi by a a PCT by a apt so you
can actually just use drawable - 480 dpi

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000
can actually just use drawable - 480 dpi
 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.480
can actually just use drawable - 480 dpi
rather than draw with us okay nothing

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.110
where's it going to end if you keep on
 

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.720
where's it going to end if you keep on
adding excess it's kind of silly but

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:54.730
adding excess it's kind of silly but
 

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.240
adding excess it's kind of silly but

so in the developer settings there's now

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:38.569
so in the developer settings there's now
 

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:42.550
so in the developer settings there's now
a new setting which I'll bring up in the

questions from people in the Hangout you
 

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:46.629
questions from people in the Hangout you
hear me now yeah first of all I wanted

00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639
hear me now yeah first of all I wanted
 

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:49.720
hear me now yeah first of all I wanted
to try something with the Google

Calendar maybe do something very very

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:53.569
Calendar maybe do something very very
 

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:59.110
Calendar maybe do something very very
simple but without using the without

00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120
simple but without using the without
 

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.379
simple but without using the without
showing an intent to the user and

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:01.389
showing an intent to the user and
 

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:04.509
showing an intent to the user and
basically schedule an appointment into

00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519
basically schedule an appointment into
 

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:09.879
basically schedule an appointment into
the calendar yeah is it I know it's

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:09.889
the calendar yeah is it I know it's
 

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:14.499
the calendar yeah is it I know it's
possible I saw some some code is it

00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:14.509
possible I saw some some code is it
 

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:17.889
possible I saw some some code is it
considered a good convention or I must

00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:17.899
considered a good convention or I must
 

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:20.920
considered a good convention or I must
show the user the exact appointment and

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:20.930
show the user the exact appointment and
 

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.879
show the user the exact appointment and
scheduling

00:15:23.879 --> 00:15:23.889
 

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:26.499
depends very like if you have a screen

00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:26.509
depends very like if you have a screen
 

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:28.269
depends very like if you have a screen
basically showing the same

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279
basically showing the same
 

00:15:28.279 --> 00:15:29.619

nation that will go into the great

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:29.629
nation that will go into the great
 

00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:32.860
nation that will go into the great
events Creek I think just that within

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:32.870
events Creek I think just that within
 

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:39.340
events Creek I think just that within
your UI and if you just basically be

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:39.350
your UI and if you just basically be
 

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.559
your UI and if you just basically be
creating what the candor UI shows

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:41.569
creating what the candor UI shows
 

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:43.960
creating what the candor UI shows
they're not probably say this is the

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:43.970
they're not probably say this is the
 

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:49.840
they're not probably say this is the
intent the basic idea was to just use

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:49.850
intent the basic idea was to just use
 

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.379
intent the basic idea was to just use
the calendar as a sort of time stamp for

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:53.389
the calendar as a sort of time stamp for
 

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:56.110
the calendar as a sort of time stamp for
actions you do like went to the market

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120
actions you do like went to the market
 

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.340
actions you do like went to the market
10:15 answer the phone 10:20 and so on

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:00.350
10:15 answer the phone 10:20 and so on
 

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.009
10:15 answer the phone 10:20 and so on
so on just use it as a timestamp to all

00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:03.019
so on just use it as a timestamp to all
 

00:16:03.019 --> 00:16:05.999
so on just use it as a timestamp to all
events you want to record on your yeah

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:06.009
events you want to record on your yeah
 

00:16:06.009 --> 00:16:08.259
events you want to record on your yeah
so you probably create your in kindness

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:08.269
so you probably create your in kindness
 

00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:09.790
so you probably create your in kindness
you probably wouldn't like write those

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800
you probably wouldn't like write those
 

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.280
you probably wouldn't like write those
into the users kind of like Google kind

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:12.290
into the users kind of like Google kind
 

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.480
into the users kind of like Google kind
or whatever you probably want to create

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:13.490
or whatever you probably want to create
 

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.489
or whatever you probably want to create
your own mu or whatever calendar and

00:16:15.489 --> 00:16:15.499
your own mu or whatever calendar and
 

00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:17.079
your own mu or whatever calendar and
then create events and that so then the

00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:17.089
then create events and that so then the
 

00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:18.819
then create events and that so then the
user can wholesale turn that calendar on

00:16:18.819 --> 00:16:18.829
user can wholesale turn that calendar on
 

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:20.439
user can wholesale turn that calendar on
and off and you know I didn't show those

00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:20.449
and off and you know I didn't show those
 

00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:21.699
and off and you know I didn't show those

right I don't know one see I think it's
 

00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.320
right I don't know one see I think it's
going to depend on how far away the

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:33.940
texts are like headers like you say that
 

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.840
texts are like headers like you say that
I think it can work really well if you

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:35.850
I think it can work really well if you
 

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.100
I think it can work really well if you
provide some contrast and relief by

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:38.110
provide some contrast and relief by
 

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.049
provide some contrast and relief by
using robots of life and also for

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:40.059
using robots of life and also for
 

00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:41.580
using robots of life and also for
secondary texts as well so if there's a

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:41.590
secondary texts as well so if there's a
 

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.200
secondary texts as well so if there's a
piece of information which isn't of

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:43.210
piece of information which isn't of
 

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:44.360
piece of information which isn't of
primary importance

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:44.370
primary importance
 

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:47.100
primary importance
rather than using a different font color

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:47.110
rather than using a different font color
 

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:49.830
rather than using a different font color
or the size per se you can use a

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840
or the size per se you can use a
 

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.630
or the size per se you can use a
different way to give it relative

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:51.640
different way to give it relative
 

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.600
different way to give it relative
importance my caution there is using

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:54.610
importance my caution there is using
 

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.210
importance my caution there is using
light fonts at smaller sizes you might

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:57.220
light fonts at smaller sizes you might
 

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.909
light fonts at smaller sizes you might
end up affecting legibility especially

00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919
end up affecting legibility especially
 

00:24:59.919 --> 00:25:02.340
end up affecting legibility especially
on smaller screens so be cautious with

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:02.350
on smaller screens so be cautious with
 

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.460
on smaller screens so be cautious with
using it too much so I'd say stick with

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:05.470
using it too much so I'd say stick with
 

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:06.030
using it too much so I'd say stick with
Roboto

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.040
Roboto
 

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.159
Roboto
normal weight for most of good body text

00:25:08.159 --> 00:25:08.169
normal weight for most of good body text
 

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:10.169
normal weight for most of good body text
as it were and because that's a fun

00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:10.179
as it were and because that's a fun
 

00:25:10.179 --> 00:25:12.299
as it were and because that's a fun
that's been optimized for most of these

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:12.309
that's been optimized for most of these
 

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:13.890
that's been optimized for most of these
like general reading operations and it

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:13.900
like general reading operations and it
 

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.960
like general reading operations and it
works for a variety of intensities and

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:15.970
works for a variety of intensities and
 

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:19.169
works for a variety of intensities and
then use something like Roboto light or

00:25:19.169 --> 00:25:19.179
then use something like Roboto light or
 

00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:22.890
then use something like Roboto light or
fin yeah in less often in kind of like

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:22.900
fin yeah in less often in kind of like
 

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.419

places to give relief so use them used

00:25:27.419 --> 00:25:27.429
places to give relief so use them used
 

00:25:27.429 --> 00:25:29.159
places to give relief so use them used
to use the lighter weight typefaces in

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:29.169
to use the lighter weight typefaces in
 

00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:30.630
to use the lighter weight typefaces in
the larger sizes where they won't get

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640
the larger sizes where they won't get
 

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.070
the larger sizes where they won't get
anti-aliased away yeah yeah I know from

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080
anti-aliased away yeah yeah I know from
 

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.380
anti-aliased away yeah yeah I know from
the pretty much the earliest days of

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.390
the pretty much the earliest days of
 

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.799
the pretty much the earliest days of
WYSIWYG typography the general guidance

WYSIWYG typography the general guidance
 

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:45.180
WYSIWYG typography the general guidance
has been used multiple you know multiple

don't think accent not not mishmash and

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:52.540
don't think accent not not mishmash and
 

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.360
don't think accent not not mishmash and
I don't know about you guys but yeah

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.370
I don't know about you guys but yeah
 

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.060
I don't know about you guys but yeah
there were definitely times early on

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.070
there were definitely times early on
 

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:00.270
there were definitely times early on
when I was like ooh this computer has 25

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:00.280
when I was like ooh this computer has 25
 

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.430
when I was like ooh this computer has 25
fonts I must use every one in my

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440
fonts I must use every one in my
 

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.280
fonts I must use every one in my
document otherwise yeah I might be

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:05.290
document otherwise yeah I might be
 

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.500
document otherwise yeah I might be
missing an opportunity and I think the

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:07.510
missing an opportunity and I think the
 

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:12.900
missing an opportunity and I think the
opportunity I missed was legibility yeah

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:12.910
opportunity I missed was legibility yeah
 

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:14.820
opportunity I missed was legibility yeah
well one of the things I always think is

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:14.830
well one of the things I always think is
 

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.400
well one of the things I always think is
well that a screen can get too busy if

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:17.410
well that a screen can get too busy if
 

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.110
well that a screen can get too busy if
you have multiple font sizes so I've

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120
you have multiple font sizes so I've
 

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.000
you have multiple font sizes so I've
seen screens where people are trying to

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.010
seen screens where people are trying to
 

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.950
seen screens where people are trying to
use the size of font to basically

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960
use the size of font to basically
 

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.090
use the size of font to basically
determine the importance of the

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.100
determine the importance of the
 

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.169
determine the importance of the
information so you might have like a

00:26:25.169 --> 00:26:25.179
information so you might have like a
 

00:26:25.179 --> 00:26:27.210
information so you might have like a
headline in the list item and then some

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:27.220
headline in the list item and then some
 

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.520
headline in the list item and then some
secondary text and there might be

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.530
secondary text and there might be
 

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.530
secondary text and there might be
account in a third font size and so on

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:30.540
account in a third font size and so on
 

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.690
account in a third font size and so on
and that can get really busy if you're

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700
and that can get really busy if you're
 

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.100
and that can get really busy if you're
basically having all these different

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.110
basically having all these different
 

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:35.810
basically having all these different
like you know line Heights essentially

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:35.820
like you know line Heights essentially
 

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.790
like you know line Heights essentially
doesn't really scan very easily it's

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:37.800
doesn't really scan very easily it's
 

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.170
doesn't really scan very easily it's
quite hard to process it makes you think

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:39.180
quite hard to process it makes you think
 

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.480
quite hard to process it makes you think
about it more and so what you can do

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:41.490
about it more and so what you can do
 

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.580
about it more and so what you can do
instead is even use color or even a lot

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:43.590
instead is even use color or even a lot
 

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.440
instead is even use color or even a lot
lighter font face so you maintain the

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:45.450
lighter font face so you maintain the
 

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.680
lighter font face so you maintain the
same cover line height or X height and

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:47.690
same cover line height or X height and
 

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.180
same cover line height or X height and
just have some slight contrast in the

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.190
just have some slight contrast in the
 

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.650
just have some slight contrast in the
weight of the font instead so it makes

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:51.660
weight of the font instead so it makes
 

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.010
weight of the font instead so it makes
it a bit easier to read I think a lot of

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020
it a bit easier to read I think a lot of
 

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.070
it a bit easier to read I think a lot of
HTML renderers are kind of annoying in

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080
HTML renderers are kind of annoying in
 

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.250
HTML renderers are kind of annoying in
the way they deal with h1 h2 h3 h4 etc

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260
the way they deal with h1 h2 h3 h4 etc
 

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.800
the way they deal with h1 h2 h3 h4 etc
because they do they do a scale in size

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:03.810
because they do they do a scale in size
 

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:06.350
because they do they do a scale in size
and weight quite a lot and it kind of

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360
and weight quite a lot and it kind of
 

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.330
and weight quite a lot and it kind of
makes for a little busy appearance okay

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:13.340
makes for a little busy appearance okay
 

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.320
makes for a little busy appearance okay
so before we move onto the next one

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:15.330
so before we move onto the next one
 

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.030
so before we move onto the next one
one other nice new developer API that's

one other nice new developer API that's
 

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.880
one other nice new developer API that's
come along with Android 4.2 is the

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:19.890
come along with Android 4.2 is the

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:24.270
daydream we now have I guess a similar
 

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.480

checkbox selected after the data is

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:21.270
checkbox selected after the data is
 

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:22.730
checkbox selected after the data is
loaded so I have a cursor loader which

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740
loaded so I have a cursor loader which
 

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.890
loaded so I have a cursor loader which
has load some stuff for the database

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900
has load some stuff for the database
 

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.760
has load some stuff for the database
yeah and then I won't wanted to make it

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:27.770
yeah and then I won't wanted to make it
 

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.830
yeah and then I won't wanted to make it
select it of course it was well it was

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:30.840
select it of course it was well it was
 

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.550

VX I was hacking and doing ugly stuff in

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:34.560
VX I was hacking and doing ugly stuff in
 

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.780
VX I was hacking and doing ugly stuff in
the in the adapter yeah but that didn't

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:38.790
the in the adapter yeah but that didn't
 

00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:42.070
the in the adapter yeah but that didn't
work on all devices for obvious reasons

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:42.080
work on all devices for obvious reasons
 

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.870
work on all devices for obvious reasons
and then in the end I said up with just

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880
and then in the end I said up with just
 

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.880
and then in the end I said up with just
loading the data to the cursor loader

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:46.890
loading the data to the cursor loader
 

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.300
loading the data to the cursor loader
and then after they did have of loaded

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:49.310
and then after they did have of loaded
 

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.930
and then after they did have of loaded
iterating the cursor again to set the

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:52.940
iterating the cursor again to set the
 

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.420
iterating the cursor again to set the
selected the check item on the on the

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:56.430
selected the check item on the on the
 

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:58.700
selected the check item on the on the
ListView yeah but it feels a little bit

00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:58.710
ListView yeah but it feels a little bit
 

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.590
ListView yeah but it feels a little bit
clunky so I was wondering what well

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:00.600
clunky so I was wondering what well
 

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.480
clunky so I was wondering what well
what's the proper way to do it or is

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:02.490
what's the proper way to do it or is
 

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.490
what's the proper way to do it or is
this the proper way to do it because I

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500
this the proper way to do it because I
 

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.960
this the proper way to do it because I
asked around to some other deaths and

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:05.970
asked around to some other deaths and
 

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.380
asked around to some other deaths and
they you know didn't really have had a

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.390
they you know didn't really have had a
 

00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:11.750
they you know didn't really have had a
proper answer so see extending see

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760
proper answer so see extending see
 

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.450
proper answer so see extending see
simple cursor adapter right yeah so

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460
simple cursor adapter right yeah so
 

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.640
simple cursor adapter right yeah so
using your bind view method there so

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:16.650
using your bind view method there so
 

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:19.340
using your bind view method there so
that would be the right place to find to

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:19.350
that would be the right place to find to
 

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:21.200
that would be the right place to find to
whatever the case is data is to your UI

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:21.210
whatever the case is data is to your UI
 

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:24.800
whatever the case is data is to your UI
right the other thing I did that but

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:24.810
right the other thing I did that but
 

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:28.010
right the other thing I did that but
then it messed up well I think what

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020
then it messed up well I think what
 

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.650
then it messed up well I think what
happened there is that the checkbox is

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660
happened there is that the checkbox is
 

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.180
happened there is that the checkbox is
then maybe selected but the ListView

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:32.190
then maybe selected but the ListView
 

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.820
then maybe selected but the ListView
itself doesn't know if selected for some

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:34.830
itself doesn't know if selected for some
 

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:39.680
itself doesn't know if selected for some
reason Heatran synchronize the state of

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:39.690
reason Heatran synchronize the state of
 

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:42.080
reason Heatran synchronize the state of
the control within the list item with

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:42.090
the control within the list item with
 

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:47.960
the control within the list item with
the selected state of yeah yeah I guess

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:47.970
the selected state of yeah yeah I guess
 

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.280
the selected state of yeah yeah I guess
that's what I'm trying to do because

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:49.290
that's what I'm trying to do because
 

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:52.190
that's what I'm trying to do because
what makes sense is that because you

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:52.200
what makes sense is that because you
 

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.150
what makes sense is that because you
call set item check I guess that's what

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160
call set item check I guess that's what
 

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.050
call set item check I guess that's what
is called from the list

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060
is called from the list
 

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.930

mm-hm so that yeah reflects the state

00:44:59.930 --> 00:44:59.940
mm-hm so that yeah reflects the state
 

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.310
mm-hm so that yeah reflects the state
and then the viewed also gets updated

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:01.320
and then the viewed also gets updated
 

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.510
and then the viewed also gets updated
which is quite nice and likewise if you

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520
which is quite nice and likewise if you
 

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.970
which is quite nice and likewise if you
touch a list item then it's

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980
touch a list item then it's
 

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.390
touch a list item then it's
automatically reflected in the list but

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400
