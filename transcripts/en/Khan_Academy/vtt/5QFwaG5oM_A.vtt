00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:03.516
- [Instructor] Brooklyn
purchased three pounds of pasta

00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:07.886
and 12 ounces of cheese to
make macaroni and cheese.

00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:11.377
What is the total weight, in ounces,

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:13.497
total weight in ounces,

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:16.785
of the pasta and cheese combined?

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.210
So they give us the weight
of the pasta in pounds,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.030
and they give us the weight
of the cheese in ounces,

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.783
and we want to add the total weight,

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:28.081
but they have to all be in ounces.

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:28.914
So let's first,

00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:32.233
let's first convert these
three pounds of pasta

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:35.623
into a certain amount of
ounces of ounce, of pasta.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.523
So we already know that one
pound is equal to 16 ounces.

00:00:38.523 --> 00:00:39.651
They tell us that.

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.567
So what would three pounds be?

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:44.401
So, if I had

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.121
three pounds,

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:48.184
how many ounces would that be?

00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:50.746
I encourage you to pause the
video and think about it.

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.256
Well, let's see, if you're
having three times the pounds,

00:00:54.256 --> 00:00:58.150
you're also going to have
three times the ounces.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.170
So, if one pound is 16 ounces,
if you have three times

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.708
as many pounds, you're
gonna have three times

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:04.162
as many ounces.

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:07.537
So 16 times three is 48,

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:09.869
48 ounces.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.434
So Brooklyn, the three pounds
of pasta that she purchased,

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:17.244
that can also be viewed as 48 ounces.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.692
48 ounces of pasta.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:22.471
So she has 48 ounces of pasta,

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:24.293
and 12 ounces of cheese.

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:27.382
So what is the total weight,
in ounces, of them combined?

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:29.251
Well it's going to be 48

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.084
ounces

00:01:30.973 --> 00:01:32.502
48 ounces

00:01:32.502 --> 00:01:34.574
plus the 12 ounces of cheese.

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:38.556
48 ounces of pasta plus
12 ounces of cheese,

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:43.180
give us a total of 60
ounces of pasta and cheese,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.806
combined.

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:45.856
Let's do another example,

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:47.273
with other units.

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:50.299
So we are told,

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.344
David is making a wall out of bricks.

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:57.666
Each brick is 2/3 of a foot long.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:59.688
Each brick is 2/3 of a foot long.

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:04.075
There are 20 bricks lined up
end to end to make the wall.

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:07.752
What is the total length
of the wall in inches?

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.918
We've got to pay attention to the units.

00:02:09.918 --> 00:02:13.094
So they give us the length
of each brick in feet.

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:15.367
So, we know

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:16.938
that each brick here,

00:02:16.938 --> 00:02:18.253
let me draw a brick.

00:02:18.253 --> 00:02:22.141
The length here is 2/3 of a foot.

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.167
2/3 of a foot.

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:26.735
So what would this length be in inches?

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.289
Well, once again, we can look
at the conversion between

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.581
foot and inches.

00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:35.148
If I go from one foot to 2/3 of a foot,

00:02:35.148 --> 00:02:38.115
well I've multiplied by 2/3.

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:40.794
So, if one foot is 12 inches,
and if I want to know how many

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:43.577
inches 2/3 inches,

00:02:43.577 --> 00:02:45.944
or 2/3 of a foot is in inches,

00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:48.654
well, I would multiply by 2/3 again.

00:02:48.654 --> 00:02:50.910
In either case, you could
view this as multiplying both

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.263
sides of this conversion, by 2/3.

00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:59.430
And so, 2/3 of a foot
is 2/3 times 12 inches.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:04.557
And so 12 times two over three,

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:07.276
that would be 24 over three.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:11.557
So this is going to be
equal to 24 over three

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:12.839
inches.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.385
I'll just write I-N for
short, right over here.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:20.641
24 over three, which is
equal to eight inches.

00:03:20.641 --> 00:03:24.093
So each brick is, either you
could view it as 2/3 of a foot

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:27.482
long or you could view it as eight inches.

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:29.101
Eight inches long.

00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:30.813
And there are 20 bricks lined

00:03:30.813 --> 00:03:32.664
up end to end to make the wall.

00:03:32.664 --> 00:03:35.142
So what is the total length
of the wall in inches?

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:36.417
Well, it's going to be eight brick,

00:03:36.417 --> 00:03:39.139
each brick is eight inches, times 20.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.647
Times 20.

00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:42.588
And eight times two is 16,

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:47.374
so eight times 20 is 160

00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:48.673
inches.

00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:50.202
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:53.887
And this time, let's
deal with some volume.

00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:58.054
So this says, Blanca buys
two gallons of green paint.

00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:03.547
She uses five quarts to
paint her front porch

00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:06.164
and 0.5 quarts

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:09.027
to paint the front porch swing.

00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:12.279
How may quarts of paint
does Blanca have left?

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.801
So we're given the
original amount in gallons,

00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:17.204
but we want to know how
many quarts she has left.

00:04:17.204 --> 00:04:20.441
So let's convert the amount
she originally has into quarts.

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:23.364
So they tell us one gallon
is equal to four quarts.

00:04:23.364 --> 00:04:24.614
So two gallons,

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.183
two gallons

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.529
is going to be equal to

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:32.522
two gallons

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:34.782
is going to be twice as many quarts,

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:36.865
is gonna be eight quarts.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.104
So that's what she starts with.

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:40.107
And one way to think about this,

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:41.257
I just took this conversion,

00:04:41.257 --> 00:04:43.801
well if I'm a have twice as many gallons,

00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:46.212
then I'm gonna have twice as many quarts,

00:04:46.212 --> 00:04:48.681
if I want to express
that volume in quarts.

00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:49.893
So, one way of thinking about it,

00:04:49.893 --> 00:04:51.754
she starts with eight quarts.

00:04:51.754 --> 00:04:54.171
She starts with eight quarts.

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:56.825
Eight quarts.

00:04:56.825 --> 00:05:00.603
She uses five quarts to
paint her front porch.

00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:03.494
So minus five quarts,

00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:04.957
on the front porch,

00:05:04.957 --> 00:05:05.963
is what she used.

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:08.968
And she used .5 quarts
to paint the porch swing.

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:13.718
So minus 0.5 quarts.

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:15.892
That looks like a "g."

00:05:15.892 --> 00:05:18.212
0.5 quarts.

00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:19.956
Well, what is that going to be?

00:05:19.956 --> 00:05:22.834
Well, eight minus five is three,

00:05:22.834 --> 00:05:25.764
minus .5 is 2.5.

00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:30.130
So she is going to be
left with 2.5 quarts.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.674
And we have answered the question

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:33.506
in terms of the units they care about.

00:05:33.506 --> 00:05:35.173
In terms of quarts.
