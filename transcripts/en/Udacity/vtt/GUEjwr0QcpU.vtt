00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.691
Now, let's go answer the same question we asked about the thread per row approach.

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:08.993
Let's say we have 32 adjacent threads in a warp that are each processing a separate element in the matrix.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:11.890
The rows in this matrix may be of different lengths.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.966
Will the overall run time of these threads be proportional

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:18.853
to the longest row of any of any of those elements, proportional to the shortest

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:23.575
row of any of those elements, or completely insensitive to

00:00:23.575 --> 00:00:26.605
the distribution of rows and elements in the matrix?
