many of you would do you do it would say

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460
many of you would do you do it would say
 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.610
many of you would do you do it would say
you do it really well and you wouldn't

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620
you do it really well and you wouldn't
 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.630
you do it really well and you wouldn't
change a thing if you could well okay I

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
change a thing if you could well okay I
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.220

think we haven't had that in London or
 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.960
think we haven't had that in London or
Paris so that's zero percent of the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970
Paris so that's zero percent of the
 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.730
Paris so that's zero percent of the
audience which in turn means to the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740
audience which in turn means to the
 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.290
audience which in turn means to the
presentation is highly relevant so

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300
presentation is highly relevant so
 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.580
presentation is highly relevant so
that's good

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590
that's good
 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.550

minutes of our time to lifetime value
 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.100
minutes of our time to lifetime value
and why is it the last session of the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110
and why is it the last session of the
 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.560

apps well essentially you should think
about lifetime value it will help you

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640
about lifetime value it will help you
 

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.920
about lifetime value it will help you
it's one of the metrics but it's a good

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930
it's one of the metrics but it's a good
 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:05.360
it's one of the metrics but it's a good
one to look at if you calculate lifetime

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370
one to look at if you calculate lifetime
 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.860
one to look at if you calculate lifetime
value there are some pitfalls and I want

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870
value there are some pitfalls and I want
 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.210
value there are some pitfalls and I want
to point them out before we actually go

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220
to point them out before we actually go
 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.020
to point them out before we actually go
into the maths itself first of all make

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030
into the maths itself first of all make
 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.110
into the maths itself first of all make
sure your growth strategy is not just

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120
sure your growth strategy is not just
 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.300
sure your growth strategy is not just
focused on maximizing lifetime value

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310
focused on maximizing lifetime value
 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.000
focused on maximizing lifetime value
like I said it's one metric but it

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010
like I said it's one metric but it
 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:21.950
like I said it's one metric but it
should be rather an effect than a cost

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960
should be rather an effect than a cost
 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.850
should be rather an effect than a cost
right

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860
right
 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.830
right
so lifetime value if it increases it

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
so lifetime value if it increases it
 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.450
so lifetime value if it increases it
should be the result of actions that you

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460
should be the result of actions that you
 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.280
should be the result of actions that you
take on your product when your marketing

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:28.290
take on your product when your marketing
 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.750
take on your product when your marketing
strategy and your communication strategy

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760
strategy and your communication strategy
 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.540
strategy and your communication strategy
and so on and so forth

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:31.550
and so on and so forth
 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.340
and so on and so forth
lifetime value should also not be your

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350
lifetime value should also not be your
 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.560
lifetime value should also not be your
competitive advantage so if you have

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.570
competitive advantage so if you have
 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.780
competitive advantage so if you have
let's assume you have a lifetime value

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790
let's assume you have a lifetime value
 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.670
let's assume you have a lifetime value
of $5,100 and your competitor why why

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680
of $5,100 and your competitor why why
 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.520
of $5,100 and your competitor why why
ever you know that has $50 don't get

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530

lazy on that because it's a temporary
 

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.270
lazy on that because it's a temporary
snapshot so if you get lazy on the

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280
snapshot so if you get lazy on the
 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.710

higher lifetime value you get and you

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720
higher lifetime value you get and you
 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.620

lifetime of their subscriptions of 15

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:47.520
lifetime of their subscriptions of 15
 

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.579
lifetime of their subscriptions of 15
months so that's the lifetime variable

00:10:49.579 --> 00:10:49.589
months so that's the lifetime variable
 

00:10:49.589 --> 00:10:51.590
months so that's the lifetime variable
not the period however they decide to

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600
not the period however they decide to
 

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.510
not the period however they decide to
calculate the period for one and for two

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:53.520
calculate the period for one and for two
 

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.550
calculate the period for one and for two
years why do they do that because they

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560
years why do they do that because they
 

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.720
years why do they do that because they
want to see how the numbers change

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:56.730
want to see how the numbers change
 

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:57.930
want to see how the numbers change
between those two models

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:57.940

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.000
between those two models
right they funnel it together they look

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.010
right they funnel it together they look
 

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.950
right they funnel it together they look
at the aggregate and to take decisions

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:01.960
at the aggregate and to take decisions
 

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.330
at the aggregate and to take decisions
based on the two isolated to each other

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:03.340

that's for them to understand how it

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:05.650
that's for them to understand how it
 

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.220
that's for them to understand how it
actually defers that's a nice example

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:08.230
actually defers that's a nice example
 

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.000
actually defers that's a nice example
you lifetime calculation now this curve

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.010
you lifetime calculation now this curve
 

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:15.540
you lifetime calculation now this curve
the retention the survival curve so for

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:15.550
the retention the survival curve so for
 

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.530
the retention the survival curve so for
lifetime retention is critical right

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540
lifetime retention is critical right
 

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:21.240
lifetime retention is critical right
because it essentially tells you the

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.250
because it essentially tells you the
 

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.610
because it essentially tells you the
opportunities that you have to convert a

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:23.620
opportunities that you have to convert a
 

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.390
opportunities that you have to convert a
user into a paying user so lifetimes

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:27.400
user into a paying user so lifetimes
 

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.310
user into a paying user so lifetimes
also highly correlated to engagement

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320
also highly correlated to engagement
 

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.230
also highly correlated to engagement
because the more engaged the user is the

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240
because the more engaged the user is the
 

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.700
because the more engaged the user is the
more likely he is to really to be

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:32.710
more likely he is to really to be
 

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.560
more likely he is to really to be
retained the more life time you will

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:34.570

per month make sure that you're doing

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.090
per month make sure that you're doing
 

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.630
per month make sure that you're doing
that you're taking the right units so

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:36.640
that you're taking the right units so
 

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.070
that you're taking the right units so
you should have the same units then when

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.080
you should have the same units then when
 

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.640
you should have the same units then when
you do a lifetime calculation right now

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:41.650
you do a lifetime calculation right now
 

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.680
you do a lifetime calculation right now
that's the basic that's the basic

only look at revenues they do look at

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:57.430
only look at revenues they do look at
 

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.000
only look at revenues they do look at
costs as well because in real life you

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.010
costs as well because in real life you
 

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.280
costs as well because in real life you
want to know how your net lifetime value

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:02.290
want to know how your net lifetime value
 

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.380
want to know how your net lifetime value
actually looks like so what you would do

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:04.390
actually looks like so what you would do
 

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.960
actually looks like so what you would do
is typical top-down method you take the

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:06.970
is typical top-down method you take the
 

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.910
is typical top-down method you take the
revenue you earned you deduct all

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920
revenue you earned you deduct all
 

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.010
revenue you earned you deduct all
variable costs and you get into variable

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.020
variable costs and you get into variable
 

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:11.620
variable costs and you get into variable
contribute

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:11.630
contribute
 

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.350
contribute
right so be aware that variable

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360
right so be aware that variable
 

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.990
right so be aware that variable
contribution can vary for different user

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000
contribution can vary for different user
 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.210
contribution can vary for different user
segments and that's something also to

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:19.220
segments and that's something also to
 

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.830
segments and that's something also to
look at obviously the more user segments

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:20.840
look at obviously the more user segments
 

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.060
look at obviously the more user segments
you define and for the more user

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.070
you define and for the more user
 

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.220
you define and for the more user
segments you make this analysis the more

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:24.230
segments you make this analysis the more
 

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.260
segments you make this analysis the more
tricky it will be in the end to

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:26.270
tricky it will be in the end to
 

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.080
tricky it will be in the end to
calculating your lifetime value but it's

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.090
calculating your lifetime value but it's
 

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.770
calculating your lifetime value but it's
worth it also you might ask yourself

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:32.780
worth it also you might ask yourself
 

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.150
worth it also you might ask yourself
well if I am a very long cycle app how

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160
well if I am a very long cycle app how
 

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.350
well if I am a very long cycle app how
how should I do it with future revenues

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:38.360
how should I do it with future revenues
 

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.410
how should I do it with future revenues
that occur far out in the in the future

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:40.420
that occur far out in the in the future
 

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.420
that occur far out in the in the future
that's when the discount rate comes in

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:43.430
that's when the discount rate comes in
 

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.280
that's when the discount rate comes in
so like some of you might have learned

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:45.290
so like some of you might have learned
 

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.040
so like some of you might have learned
in investment calculations you discount

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:48.050
in investment calculations you discount
 

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.830
in investment calculations you discount
future cash flows into net present value

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:50.840
future cash flows into net present value
 

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.350
future cash flows into net present value
so that's very important because if you

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360
so that's very important because if you
 

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.090
so that's very important because if you
think about the example if you have 10

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.100
think about the example if you have 10
 

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.090
think about the example if you have 10
euros today those 10 euros won't buy you

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:58.100

the same amount of goods in five years
 

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.750
the same amount of goods in five years
right inflation so that's something to

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760
right inflation so that's something to
 

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.550
right inflation so that's something to
take into consideration here because

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560
take into consideration here because
 

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.470
take into consideration here because
your investments today will be impacted

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480
your investments today will be impacted
 

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.940
your investments today will be impacted
by those revenues tomorrow in the best

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:06.950
by those revenues tomorrow in the best
 

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.520
by those revenues tomorrow in the best
case scenario will be refinanced that's

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:09.530
case scenario will be refinanced that's
 

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.900
case scenario will be refinanced that's
something to take into account as well

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:12.910
something to take into account as well
 

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:16.900
something to take into account as well
right so that's it for the theory like I

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:16.910

following in subscriptions the ARPU is

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:11.630
following in subscriptions the ARPU is
 

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.000
following in subscriptions the ARPU is
fairly straightforward because it's

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.010
fairly straightforward because it's
 

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.740
fairly straightforward because it's
fixed if you're having your monthly

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:14.750
fixed if you're having your monthly
 

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.350

quarterly your annual subscription and

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360
quarterly your annual subscription and
 

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.180
quarterly your annual subscription and
the rate is fixed so you know that

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:19.190
the rate is fixed so you know that
 

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.480
the rate is fixed so you know that
beforehand the LTV in subscriptions is

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:22.490
beforehand the LTV in subscriptions is
 

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.030
beforehand the LTV in subscriptions is
really driven by lifetime which is equal

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:25.040
really driven by lifetime which is equal
 

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.190
really driven by lifetime which is equal
to the average subscription rate that

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200

again depends on the renewal rates that

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.390
again depends on the renewal rates that
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.790
again depends on the renewal rates that
you're having at the end of the term and

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:30.800
you're having at the end of the term and
 

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.680
you're having at the end of the term and
that again depends on churn right

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:34.690
that again depends on churn right
 

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.790
that again depends on churn right
everybody I hope everybody follow me

everybody I hope everybody follow me
so churn rates and renewal rates are

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:39.590
so churn rates and renewal rates are
 

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.190
so churn rates and renewal rates are

using right take the formula do you the

00:21:35.169 --> 00:21:35.179
using right take the formula do you the
 

00:21:35.179 --> 00:21:36.970
using right take the formula do you the
percentage in terms of usage and you get

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:36.980
percentage in terms of usage and you get
 

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.710
percentage in terms of usage and you get
an average to have that's like as a
