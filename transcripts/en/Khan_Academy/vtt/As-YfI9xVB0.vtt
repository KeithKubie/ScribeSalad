00:00:00.483 --> 00:00:02.659
- [Voiceover] Hi, this is
Becca from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.273
and today I'm going to be
talking about temperance.

00:00:05.273 --> 00:00:07.356
So, what was the temperance movement?

00:00:07.356 --> 00:00:09.036
In this video, I'll talk a little bit

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.005
about what temperance
was, what its causes were,

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:17.899
and how it started to
develop in the early-1800s.

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.342
Temperance was the idea
that Americans drank

00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:23.837
way too much alcohol and needed
to temper their consumption.

00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:25.887
It started as kind of this idea

00:00:25.887 --> 00:00:28.013
that people should just
drink a little bit less,

00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:31.971
they should drink less whiskey,
less rum, less hard alcohol.

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:34.550
And then, slowly, it started to take on

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.920
this kind of prohibitory character.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.522
So, again, it was the
idea that we just needed

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:42.355
to temper our alcohol consumption.

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:46.944
And so, how did the
temperance movement take root?

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:49.359
The temperance movement
kinda has three main causes

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.990
that I like to think about.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.157
So, the three main causes were
the Second Great Awakening,

00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:58.378
the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:03.799
and growing nativism

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.393
and, frankly, racism that
started as new immigrants

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:12.467
were coming to America in the early-1800s.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:15.053
So, this was all kinda
happening right around here,

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:16.264
and so I'll talk a little bit more

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:19.227
about each of these causes
for the temperance movement

00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:21.234
and how it began.

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.686
So, I'll start by talking about
the Second Great Awakening.

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:26.953
So, the Second Great
Awakening was this time period

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:31.455
in the early-1800s that
focused a lot of social reforms

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:35.990
around capturing moral
good or Christian ideals

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.478
so Christian ideals,
here's the little cross,

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:41.961
within our social institutions.

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.951
So, this happened in
education, in prisons,

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:48.593
in the first women's rights movement.

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:50.666
And so, this was all going on in the 1800s

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:51.589
and it was about this idea

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:53.767
that we needed to be
good and moral people,

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.633
and we needed our social
institutions to reflect that.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.996
So, temperance can be seen as a part

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:00.682
of the Second Great Awakening.

00:02:00.682 --> 00:02:02.539
And so, down here, you can kind of see

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.163
the Second Great Awakening image here.

00:02:04.163 --> 00:02:05.930
This is the idea that the family

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.012
was also intimately affected
by people being too drunk.

00:02:10.012 --> 00:02:12.298
Here's the father and he's really drunk

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.807
and things are kind of going to mayhem.

00:02:14.807 --> 00:02:16.084
People were just too drunk,

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:19.236
and this was tearing apart
lots of different institutions,

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.871
including the family, including education,

00:02:22.871 --> 00:02:24.590
including the workplace.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.179
And so, that's a good transition

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.440
to talking about the
Industrial Revolution.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.405
So, the Industrial
Revolution was also going on

00:02:30.405 --> 00:02:31.620
at this time period

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.545
and people could no longer
be drunk on the job, right?

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.703
So, people used to be artisans.

00:02:36.703 --> 00:02:38.443
They used to just kind
of sit in their home,

00:02:38.443 --> 00:02:42.494
make their shoes or sew something by hand,

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.153
and they could be drunk while doing that.

00:02:44.153 --> 00:02:47.549
But now, if you're kind
of in a factory setting,

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.676
people were getting their fingers cut off

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:52.211
by these new machines that were promoted

00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:54.701
in the Industrial Revolution
because they were drunk

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:56.539
while trying to operate the machinery.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:57.771
So, with this new industry,

00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.435
workers could no longer
be drunk on the job.

00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:02.524
And so, the final cause is this nativism

00:03:02.524 --> 00:03:05.850
that people were seeing with
new Catholic immigrants.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.050
So, there were Catholic immigrants
coming into the country.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.567
And lots of Protestants
were very anti-Catholic

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.499
and anti-immigration.

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.214
They decided that the
Catholics were drunks.

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:18.653
They did drink a lot,

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:21.093
but it was definitely this
kind of racist sentiment

00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:24.144
that was percolating within
the Protestant community,

00:03:24.144 --> 00:03:27.018
and this kind of aligned
itself with the Whig Party.

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:30.101
So, the Whigs became more Protestant;

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.226
they were really big temperance people.

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:36.077
And the Catholics more aligned themselves

00:03:36.077 --> 00:03:37.660
with the Democrats.

00:03:38.973 --> 00:03:41.906
The sentiment towards
these immigrant populations

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:44.739
had this kind of political effect.

00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:48.441
So, at this time, temperance
was starting to become

00:03:48.441 --> 00:03:50.239
more of a political movement

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.588
and different social groups
were taking this more seriously.

00:03:53.588 --> 00:03:56.513
There were some state-level organizations.

00:03:56.513 --> 00:03:59.787
It was just becoming more
of a social phenomenon.

00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:04.621
In 1825, right over here,
this really famous preacher,

00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:08.788
Lyman Beecher, did his six
sermons on the sins of alcohol.

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:12.648
And so, these sermons in 1825

00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:17.445
solidified this idea in the American mind

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:21.391
that it was anti-Christian
to be a huge drinker,

00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:23.522
and this idea really took root.

00:04:23.522 --> 00:04:27.410
This is becoming kind of
this larger social phenomenon

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.909
and there start to be
not just more state-level

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.987
or community-level
societies against drinking,

00:04:32.987 --> 00:04:35.891
you see the first ever
national organization.

00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:40.615
So, the first national
temperance society was in 1826,

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:45.545
down here, with the American
Temperance Society, so the ATS.

00:04:45.545 --> 00:04:47.152
And I'll talk more about the ATS

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:49.279
and the kind of nationalization

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.964
of the temperance movement
in the next video.
