00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.370
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Good
morning and welcome to our seventh

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.480
of eight talks in our NASA
lecture series this year.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.120
I am Stephanie Marcus from
the science technology

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.740
and business division.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.130
And, today I think we can say,
Houston we don't have a problem,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.520
because Houston is world
champions in baseball, hooray!

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.820
[ laughs ]

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.330 position:56%
And I did see someone from NASA
from the Johnson Space Center who is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.350
in an orange space suit and had
all kinds of things hung on him.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.650
Go Astros!

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.770
So, exoplanet.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.030
Everyone seems to love them, it's
not enough to love our own planet,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.770
we have to love that which
we know very little about.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.080
And today we have the perfect
person to tell us about exoplanets.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.650
Our speaker is Dr. Padi Boyd,
and she's chief of the exoplanets

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.780
and stellar astrophysics
laboratory at NASA Goddard.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.480
She has her B.S. in
astronomy from Villanova.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.080
And she was originally more of
a music, artsy kind of person

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.650
and then she turned
towards astronomy later

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.250
in high school and look her now!

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.180
And then she went to Drexel
and got a M.S. and PhD

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.440
in physics and atmospheric science.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.430
She's been involved with exoplanets
way back because she has worked

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.400
with the Kepler Mission and
the Hubble Space telescope.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.420
And now she is also the director
of the Guest Investigator Program

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.040
for the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite mission,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.760
which we like to call TESS.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.690
And we did have a speaker in 2015,
almost two years ago in October,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.170
Steven Reinhert, who
talked about TESS.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.030
And at that time, it was
supposed to launch in 2017

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:22.510
but Dr. Boyd says March 2018
is the expected launch date.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.450
We do have a webcast of the TESS
program if you don't learn enough

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.990
about exoplanets today,
but I'm sure you will.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.510
So, please join me in
welcoming Dr. Padi Boyd.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.580
[ Applause ]

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.390
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Well, thank
you very much Stephanie.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.350
Can you all her me okay?

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.380
It was a real pleasure to be
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.530
I am really excited to visit the
building and the people and to talk

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.780
to you about the very exciting
field of extra solar planets,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.230
or exoplanets, as we call them.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.530
Planets around other stars.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.610
So I thought I was start off with
a very thought invoking engraving

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.890
that most people have seen in some
time or another in their lives.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.230
It's from the late 1880s.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.420
And it was an engraving that
first appeared in a textbook

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.550
about meteorology, the
study of the atmosphere.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.150
But it's so thought provoking and
it really has so many things going

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.820
on in it that many people can
read a lot into this engraving.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.480
It's someone who's peering
beyond what is known around them

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.210
and the world around them.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.750
The sun, the moon, the stars.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.080
And they are peeking through
and they are catching a glimpse

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.930
of what's going on beyond.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.660 position:56%
In this particular image you can see
the familiar, trees on the earth,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.490
the sun setting, moon
and stars in the sky.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.950
And then beyond that, a picture
of a mechanistic solar system.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.080
So some people associate
this image with the birth

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.500
of the scientific revolution
because human beings,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.990
ever since we've been able to
sit around a campfire and talk

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.050 position:56%
to each other and share ideas, we've
known that some stars are the same

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.690
in relation to each
other every night

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.070
and that others were wanderers.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.670
The wanderers were the planets,
been known about for centuries,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.340
but it was only during
the scientific revolution

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.600
where scientists like Kepler and
Galileo put the picture together,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.650 position:56%
and Isaac Newton, of what was
really going on in our solar system.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.710
So that's a moment that shows
you a kind of transformation,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.760
someone seeing the world in
a new way for the first time.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.470
And this has happened
so many times in science

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.180
and I think it's happening
right now in astrophysics

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.660
as we're exploring the
planets close to earth now.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.080
Oops, don't know what that musical
signal was, but we're still seeing.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.460
I think this was a very
transformational moment

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.760
for many of us too.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.000
Many of us who are old enough
to remember that picture

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.470
which is called Earth Rise.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.780
I'm just barely old enough to
remember when it first appeared

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.130
and it made an impact to
everyone on planet earth.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.750
It was really the first time
that the human race could think

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.490
about what the planet earth
looks like from a distance.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.100 position:56%
These were the Apollo astronauts and
as they were orbiting the moon one

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.380
of them turned around and took
that beautiful shot of the earth.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.240
The sun is eliminating both
the moon and the earth.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.630
And you get that sense of a pale,
small, blue dot that is floating

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.500
in a dark, dark universe.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.040
It really gave us a sense of our
perspective of the solar system.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.600
But, up until -- even at that time,
the solar system was the only set

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.800
of planets that we knew
for a fact existed.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.830
We'd known about them
for thousands of years.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.630
We'd put them together in a picture
of how the solar system works

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.290 position:56%
over the last several hundred years.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.790
So we know that the planets in
our solar system orbit the sun,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.900
which is a typical star compared
to the other stars in the sky.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.960
And the planets are on orbits
that are defined by their distance

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.200
from the star, the closer
they are, the faster they go.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.740
And we knew a lot about
our solar system.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.090 position:56%
We could study it, we sent probes
to it in the 60s and 70s and beyond.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.430
We learned a lot about the
planets that orbited our star,

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.010
but for so long it was
the only solar system

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.150
that we really knew anything about.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.670
And I've picked this picture
from an Issue Asimov book,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.090
because Isaac Asimov was
so amazingly talented

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.200
at marrying the science and
his science fiction ideas.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.750
So he really brought
science to humanity

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.550
through his science fiction stories

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.540
and he also embedded
them with great science.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.650
Of course, science fiction knew

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.880
of many planets beyond
our solar system.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.060 position:56%
There are so many examples of
stories that are so important to all

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.000
of us that really depend
on this idea that planets

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.200
like earth are plentiful
throughout the galaxy and even

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.680
in galaxies far, far away.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.950
So there are many scientists
who are interested in exoplanets

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.730
who can tie their first
moment of really thinking

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.850
about planets beyond our solar
system to some moments in Star Trek

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.190 position:56%
or Star Wars or something where they
were exploring planets beyond our

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.050
solar system.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.900
But for so long, those were
just dreams and stories.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.640
When we'd look up at the night
sky, this is a picture actually

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.450
from Joshua Tree, of
a beautiful dark sky.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.040
And you can see the band
of the Milky Way there.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.360
The sun is one of hundreds
of billions

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.700
of stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.150
And some lucky nights
we're lucky to really look

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.530
at a huge swath of stars.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.110
And for generations all we
could do is look at those stars

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.360
and wonder, is the sun unique?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.550
Are we the only star out there
out of hundreds of billions

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.850
that have planets around them?

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.650
And that was the only
they we knew for sure.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.690
But scientists are persistent.

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:48.180
Our technology develops
and allows us to learn more

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.320
and more as time goes on.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.640
So one of the reasons we
didn't know about stars

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.880
that had other planets was because
they're very, very hard to detect.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.350
The stars light vastly
outshines a planets light.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.020
Planets are just little specks
compared to giant stars.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.190
Ten billion times brighter
typically.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.670
But our technology got
better and better so instead

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.500 position:56%
of seeing our planets we could allow
ourselves to detect them indirectly.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.690
One method is called the
radial velocity method.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.760
And what this relies on are
just simple Newtonian mechanics,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.710
you remember Isaac Newton
put together a picture

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.110
of how the solar system works
and it's based on gravity.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.880
And we know that all stars
are obeying these laws.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.140
So if a star has a planet
orbiting it, we know from Newton

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.990
that they're orbiting a
common center of mass.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.760
It's not the star being
completely static

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.930
and the planets orbiting
around the star.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.750
They're actually both in orbit.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.610
The planets orbit is bigger
because the center of mass,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.170
where most of the mass is,
is inside the star typically

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.470
for a small planet.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.380
But that doesn't mean the
start doesn't move at all.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.130
If our technology gets good enough
we can detect that tiny wobble

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.130
from a star that's telling us

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.340
that a planet is imparting
that wobble on it.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.120
It's called the Radial
Velocity Method.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.240
And the was really getting
going in the mid 90s.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.990 position:56%
Of course we were looking for solar
systems that looked a lot like ours.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.440
We knew big planets were going
to be the ones that imparted

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.240
that signal strongest on the stars.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.260
But the big planets in our solar
system are Jupiter, Saturn,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.600
they are way, way far
beyond where the earth is.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.240
They take years to go around the
sun, 5, 10 maybe even longer years.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.530
So people were looking for signals
in their data from big planets

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.070
that they thought would be
like Jupiter and Saturn.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.410
They were so focused on what
they were expecting to see

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.790
from our solar system that
many of the scientists

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.940
who were working this area
missed the first signals.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.640
This is actually the
discovery image.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.150
It's actually the confirmation
image by a group, Jeff Marcy

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:55.110
and Paul Butler, who confirmed
a planet call 51 Peg b,

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.080
orbiting the star 51 in
the constellation Pegasus.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.110
So what you see there is going
up and down is the velocity

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.550
of the star coming towards
us and moving away from us.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:11.350
Towards and away, in a perfectly
periodic way that's telling us what

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.920
the orbit of that planet was.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.790
It was actually on a few
days orbit, less than 5 days.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.770 position:56%
Much, much closer than any planet in
our solar system and quite massive,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.820
almost the mass of Jupiter, to
be able to impart that signal.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.450
This was a watershed event.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.620
It was like the earth
rise image for scientists

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.380
because we now had evidence
that there were planets

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.620
around other stars and that first
planet was so surprising compared

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.390
to what our solar system
has that we had

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.220
to rethink how we were
looking for exoplanets.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.540
So it's hard to read
this in the light,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.060
but this is artists impression
of what 51 Peg b looks like.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:52.520
Its orbital period is
about four or so days.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.980
It has a very hot temperature
because it's so,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.460
so close to the sun,
1800 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.330
That's really hot you
don't want to live there.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.800
We don't think it's
a habitable planet.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.320
And then as we start
thinking about what that means

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.440
to be habitable we start to get
a sense that planets like earth,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.660
maybe Venus, maybe Mars, are

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.090
in a region near our star
called the Goldilocks zone,

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.140
where they're not too hot for
water to exist on the surface

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.320
and they're not too cold for
all the water to be frozen.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.930
So we started to find planets but
they were not in the habitable.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.440
And exoplanet discovery
started to take off.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.450
There are several different methods
you can use to discover exoplanets.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.530
And so in 2009 NASA finally
completed a mission called Kepler.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:43.480
Kepler was actually dreamed
of decades before it was built

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.000
and launched by principal
investigator Bill Borucki.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.290
He knew theoretically,
he wrote a paper,

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.430
that said if you were very
careful with your photometry,

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:56.720 position:56%
how you measure your light, that you
could detect a tiny dip in the light

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.000
as a planet passed in front of
a star, that's called a transit.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.570
So finally, Kepler was launched
in 2009 by NASA with one goal

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.850
and one goal alone, to answer the
question, how common is a planet

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.450
like the earth -- so a small
rocky planet like we live on,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:16.330
how common are those planets
around stars like the sun

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:19.800
at a distance that's
in the Goldilocks zone?

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.470
In other words, how common are we?

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.670
Here's a transit, many of you may
have actually seen this transit.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.330
It's the transit of Venus.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.630
Did you see it?

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.930
Did you see it?

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.340
Anyone? It was visible
in the morning sky,

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.910
I think that was the one
that was in the morning.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.920
You could get up on your
roof with the right equipment

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.700
and watch the transit of Venus.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.450
They happen very, very
rarely but they happen

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.460
in pairs a few years apart.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.940 position:56%
Venus is about the size of the earth

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:46.730
and that's going right
across our sun.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.200
So you could see all kinds
of things in that movie.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.330
Let's see if I can start it over.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.420
So you see that the sun actually
looks darker on the edges

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.080
and gets brighter as we go in.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.880
You can start to see
some granulation

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.180
on the surface of the sun.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.350
Stars are actually pretty
active, they're not super quiet.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.740
Our star is actually
very quiet as stars go.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.700
And you can start to see that
haze around Venus, the atmosphere.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.690
Venus has a very thick atmosphere.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.370 position:56%
Some of the suns rays are getting --

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:14.450
they're not passing
through the atmosphere,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.750
it's actually dimmer around there.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.010
And then as it comes off you can
get a sense of the size of Venus.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.400
It's covering just a
little piece of the sun,

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.240
so it's light is going
to dim just a bit.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.190
Here's an example of
what Jupiter would look

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.050
like if it passed in
front of the sun.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.450
It would cover up about a
hundredth the size of the sun.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.870
And you'd see a dip that you could
measure and you could get a sense

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.220
of that size if you knew
the star size very well.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.020
Here's what the earth
would look like.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.080
That's hard.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.290
Maybe you can't even see it but
it's there on the right side.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.720
If they were a bit more high
definition or darker you'd be able

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.010
to see some features on the sun,
sun spots, that are the same size

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.150
or even bigger than the planet.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.690
So it's a real challenge to
try to disentangle the signal

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.520
from the stars from the
signal of the transit.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.930
But Kepler was meant to do this.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:07.600
How did it do it?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.900
Well we launched Kepler

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.490
into a really interesting
orbit called an Earth Trailing

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:12.830
Heliocentric Orbit.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.000
So it's almost on the
same orbit as the earth

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.570
but it was a little bit further
out, so it lags behind us.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.630 position:56%
And that orbit was a very good orbit
for us to stare without blinking

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.460
at this patch right above
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.750
It's near the Cygnus and
Lyra region of our Milky Way.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.270
If you're familiar with the
constellations you'll know to look

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.120
out in the summer time near the
summer triangle and if you were

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.260
to stare there without
blinking for four

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.350
and a half years you would be
doing what Kepler was doing.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.970
[laughs] Why is it so important
that it's stared without blinking?

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:46.140
Well a transit like I showed
you of Venus, I said only occurs

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.190
from where we can see
every 200 years or so

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.010
and it only lasts a
very short while.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.660
Well the same thing is true, a
planet like the earth is only going

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.940
to transit it's star once a
year, once every 365 days.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.560
We have to be perfectly aligned
in order that that planet passes

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.710
in front of the star
as we're viewing it

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.920
from our vantage point
in the Milky Way.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.900
It turns out that we
expect only about one

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:11.310
in a hundred stars are
going to be aligned with us

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.070
so that we would see transits.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.880
So you have to look
at a lot of them.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.330
So we looked at 150,000 stars,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.070
getting a brightness reading
every 30 minutes for four

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:24.900
and a half years pausing only to
turn around and dump the data back

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.080
to earth so that we could
detect these tiny transits in 1%

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.060
of those stars, if
planets were plentiful.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.240
Of course one of the
questions Kepler wanted

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.440
to answer was how plentiful
are they?

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.980
What I told you is that one in
a hundred stars would be aligned

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.280
so that we could see the planets.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.040
But if only one in a hundred stars
has a planetary system well then

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.500
your statistics go way down.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.800
You have to look at a lot

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.810
to get some meaningful
number if planets are rare.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:52.530
So we didn't know before Kepler
launched what the situation was.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:55.250
So here's a graph that
gives you our picture

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:59.500
of exoplanets before Kepler
launched, on the eve of our launch.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.040
And there up at the
top are several methods

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.830
that we can use to detect planets.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.170
There's the radial velocity
method and the transit method

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:07.470
that we've just talked about.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.930 position:56%
You can also imagine if you're close
enough you could see the planet

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.790 position:56%
if you had the right technology and
there's a couple blue ones on there.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.110
Eclipse timing is something where
if you have some very precise way

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.510
of timing a system like
neutron stars that are

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.460
like rock solid clocks, you
could see difference in the times

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.510
that you expect versus the times
that you measure and you can infer

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.390
that a planet is there from that.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.270
No Kepler points on this yet
because Kepler didn't launch yet.

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:36.250
So what we see there are a
bunch of massive planets.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.800
Planets bigger than Neptune
and Jupiter, up near the top.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.270
And we see a whole bunch of
planets that are very short orbits.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.800
So at the bottom we're look at
how long is the orbit in days,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.350
and you see that pink chunk of
pink ones from the transit method.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.070
They're all like on a
week or shorter orbit.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.990
So we see a lot of massive
planets, we see a lot of planets

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.810
that are very close to their stars.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.810
None of those are planets
like the earth orbiting

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.110
in the Goldilocks zone.

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:07.130
So let me show you what the first
few years of Kepler taught us.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.260
&gt;&gt; Whoa!

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.750
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: There's
another transformative moment

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.930
in our understanding of what
planets are like in our galaxy.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.070
So remember that's just a
little patch of our galaxy,

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:18.530
it's actually 10 degree
by 10 degrees,

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.020
so it's a fairly large
patch of the sky compared

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.210
to something that Hubble can see.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.970
But you can see what's
happening is that we're going

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.770
down to much smaller sizes and in
fact, if you look at where most

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.830
of those yellow dots are collecting
they're collecting near the

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.130
small planets.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.070
We're not picking up those big
Jupiter's, they're the easy ones

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.640
to find, that's why we found them
when we first started looking

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.940
because you can't miss them.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.460
They're in plain sight.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.230
And you can also see
that we're pushing

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.070
out a little bit towards
longer periods and there's

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:50.230
of course still some Jupiter's up
there and still some hot Jupiter's.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.130
Let me show you the newest
catalog of Kepler planets.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.540
You may have seen a press
release related to this

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.930
within the last few months.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:01.740
The Kepler team, the
Kepler mission is done now.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.040
It's on a new mission called K2

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.830
and what the team is doing is
they're compiling all their

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.700
statistics and really improving
their pipeline software

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.700
that finds the planets to give
us a sense of what Kepler found.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.610
So the little yellow ones are the
newest planets and you can see

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.500
that the improved processing
it really, really pushing us

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:23.800
down towards those smaller
planets and towards longer orbits.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.030
You see where the earth is there,
we're really starting to fill

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.650
in that region of planets
that are on earth like orbits.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.510
We're still only talking
about a couple dozen planets.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.800
But remember, Kepler
looked for four or so years,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.140
you've got to see several transits
before you know you have a planet.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.230
So really, finding
something at around an earth

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:47.970
or a Mars orbital period is at
the limits of what Kepler can do.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.960
We found that planets
were everywhere.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.300
This is an image that shows
you that region of the sky

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.400
but now plotting some of those
planets down on it as a function

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.230
of how big the planets were.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.980
So there's big planets and small
planets, they're everywhere

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.280
in the region that we looked.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.020
There's no preferential treatment.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.990
There's no stars that have
them and don't have them.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.350
But one of the really key points
that we found when we found

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.840
so many transiting
planetary star systems was

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.540
that planets are everywhere.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.850
You can take what Kepler found and
you can extract that to determine

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.350 position:56%
that pretty much every star out
there should have a planetary system

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.650
and that one in five probably has a
planet about the size of the earth

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.830
in an orbit where you
could have liquid water,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.370
a habitable zone planet,
one in five.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.740
So when you look up at the
sky next time, count ten star,

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.870
two of them probably have an
earth like planet in orbit.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.130 position:56%
Earth like is a tricky thing to say.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:45.360
I'll say earth size instead.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.560 position:56%
Here's the distribution of
planets, of the planetary candidates

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.860
as of a couple of years ago.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.250
So here's some surprises.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.540
So you see Jupiter sized planets

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.590
and larger are actually fairly
rare in the Kepler haul.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.070
We've got a couple
in our solar system

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:01.620
but most solar system
that we interrogated

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:05.130
with Kepler really didn't
have a huge planet like that.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.960
Also, we see a bunch of earth size
planets and a huge number of things

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.340
that are bigger than
earth, but not too much.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:13.490
One and a half to two times
the size of the earth,

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.010
we call those Super Earths.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:19.840
And then you see this big, big
peak at around Neptune or so,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.640
they're actually a little
bit smaller than Neptune

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.250
up to Neptune size and we
call those Sub-Neptune's.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.930
And as the data got better, this is
actually from that recent catalog

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.290
that I was talking about before.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.940
You could get much better
statistical insight into the sizes

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.670
of the planets, we actually see
something we call the Fulton Gap.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.720
What it tells us is in
those small planets that are

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.630
so numerous they appear to come
in two separate categories,

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.380
two separate populations.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.190
One that we think are
probably very similar

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.940
to the earth like Kepler-452b.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.160
And by similar, I mean
a small rocky planet

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.240
with just a little
big of an atmosphere.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.280
Because believe it or not the earth
has kind of a tenuous atmosphere.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.600
And then we think the other
population are planets

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.650
that are probably right around
the same size in their core

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.390
but for some reason
they have attracted

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.430
and retained a huge atmosphere,

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.090
bigger than Venus,
maybe close to Neptune.

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:19.350
The atmosphere being so big that
you can't really have life there,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.070
it would be way too dense.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.950
Two populations of small
planets and a gap in the middle

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.640
that may be telling us about two
different formation mechanisms

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.200
for the same kind of planets
or the similar sized planets.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.350 position:56%
But what's really surprising about
this type of result to me is that --

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.240
remember we were learning
so much about planets before

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.160
by studying our solar system.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.440
Now what we're finding
out from Kepler is

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.570
that the two most common type of
planets out there, Super Earths

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.620
and Mini Neptune's, we don't
have one in our solar system.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.290
That's interesting.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.590
Were they here?

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.890
Did they go somewhere?

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.190
Did our solar system
form in a different way?

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.610
Or is it just small
number statistics?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.980
Wee know a lot about one.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:05.890
This is a really thought provoking
animation that I love to show,

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:08.940
it's called the Kepler
Digital Orrery.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.190
When scientists first figured
out the solar system they love

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.140
to build things call orreries,
where you could turn a crank,

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.210
you can see it on [inaudible]
cover there

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.440
and the planets would
start to go around.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.690
They're like little
mechanical systems.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:24.110
This is basically that idea applied

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.040
to the Kepler multiplanetary
systems,

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.430 position:56%
because something else we didn't
know for sure until Kepler launched,

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.610
is whether solar systems,
systems of planets with more

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:37.240 position:56%
than one planet were common or rare.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.980
Now what we're finding from Kepler
is that they are incredibly common,

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.950
it's very common to
find systems of planets.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.080
And when you find systems of
planets around a single star,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.440
it's much more powerful
because each one

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.600
of those planets can tell you
something about the same star.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.180
And since the planets interact

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.480 position:56%
with each other gravitationally they
can even tell you about the masses

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.750
of the planets themselves.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.020
So you may have seen as it
zoomed out and zoomed back in,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.350
that you started to see our
solar system on the same scale.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.240
So again, just another
graphical reminder

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.510
that Kepler was really studying
those tight, tight solar systems

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.320
where the planets are going around
weeks, months, out to a year or so.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.420 position:56%
Whereas our solar system, we know
of things on very, very long orbits.

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.640
So, you may have also noticed
that there is a difference

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.900
in the star type, the star type
then planet temperature up there.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.770
Well that's because Kepler was
looking in one region of space

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.750 position:56%
at about 150,000 pre-selected stars.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.790
We selected most of them to be very
similar to the sun but it turns

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.290
out that there are just a whole
bunch of starts that are much,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.520
much smaller than the sun.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.330
There's a distribution
of stellar sized.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.300
And the sun, while it's a
normal star in some ways,

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.510
the most typical star in the milky
way is actually a low mass star,

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.090
what we call a M star.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.230
It's just a way of
categorizing stars.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.760
Some of them are only
10% the mass of the sun.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.010
What that means is that if an earth
sized planet is transiting a much

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.800
smaller, much dimmer star, then
the transit signal is a lot deeper.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.080
So you see on the right, a
transit signal around Kepler 186,

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.120
which was one of the
first earth sized planet

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.050
in a habitable zone
announced by Kepler.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.000
Compared to what the earth
transiting the sun looks like.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.530
Much, much easier to find
those earth sized planets

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:29.490
around the smaller stars.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:35.520
Here's a gallery of some of the
small, hopefully earth like,

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.880
but certainly close to earth sized
planets the Kepler has found.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.930
Showing you their size
by how big the circle is.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.180
There's earth up there, sort of
towards the top and the middle.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.850
And giving you a sense
of the habitable zone.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.210
We're sort of right
smack in the middle

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.640
of the habitable zone we thinking.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.880
Wee could live, we
could exist closer in.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.820
We'd have a completely
different climate,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.730
we'd probably be a
different species.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.250 position:56%
We could also be pushed out, we
would have different characteristics

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.760
as well but we believe liquid
water could have formed and existed

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.530
on the surface and life
could have flourished.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.150
And we can set that Goldilocks
zone, or habitable zone

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.850
by how much radiation planets
are receiving from their stars.

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:17.720
So on the top axis there
you're getting a sense

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.020
of what type of star.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.320
Are these planets round?

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.920
And how much sunlight they're
getting from their star.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.660
How is that habitable zone defined.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.660
So you see we've got a
lot of smaller planets

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.750
around the smaller stars for the
reason we talked about before

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.630
and even in the earths region there
are a number of planets there.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.270
So they are still very hard to
detect but we are finding them,

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:41.190
dozens of habitable zone
planets found by Kepler.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.900
This is again an update
from that latest catalog.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.620
The yellow ones are the new ones.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.180
So you can see that last run

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.960
of the Kepler data found habitable
zone planets and small planets

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.300
that were getting closer
to earth analogs

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.310
which is exactly what we were
expecting would happen with Kepler.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.220
That as the data came
down and we got more data

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.180
and we refined our methods that
we would be able to really push

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.770
down into habitable zone
around a star like the sun.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.690
So I mentioned that the M stars
are abundant in our galaxy.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.810
Seven out of ten stars in the
milky way are thought to be M stars

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.570
and the stars closest
to us are small stars.

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.870
So they're important.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.560
They're becoming increasingly
important as we think

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.430
about finding planets,
because what Kepler told us is

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.000
that planets are everywhere and
we saw that a lot of M stars seem

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.340
to have a lot of smaller
planets around them.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.650
That it's common to make smaller
planets around smaller stars.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.640
And the other thing that's
really exciting about them is

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.470 position:56%
that the habitable zone is really
crunched in around these small stars

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.710
and that means that that
transit that you're looking for,

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.010
or anything that you're
looking for on

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.350
that periodic signal,
happens much more often.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.780
Weeks typically.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.020
So if you want to observe something
over and over again for a planet,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.730
a small planet around
an M star is going

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:57.960 position:56%
to give you a lot more opportunities
in a given say, observing season

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.450
at a telescope, than something
like earth around the sun.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.910
So a lot of our attention is being
turned towards the smaller M stars

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.430
in the galaxy now when we
think about how we're going

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.320
to take the next steps from Kepler

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.860
and find those really
earth like planets.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:18.500
But there are some problems and
some challenges with M stars.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.960
It turns out that M stars
are incredibly active.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:25.210
So sometimes you're probably
hearing about solar flares

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.520
that they're predicting are going
to perhaps impact your cable signal

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.260 position:56%
or maybe the GPS for a little while.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.860
Or maybe you're going to be
able to see an aurora down here

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.020
in southern latitudes
because of the suns activity.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.860
Remember I told you the sun is
a very calm, low activity star.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.920
M stars are hundreds
of times more active.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.250
They give out huge flares
that dwarf solar flares

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:51.050
and they do it much more typical.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.670
So much more often.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.310
This means that any planet that's
really close to that M star

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.610
and going around really
quickly, could be bombarded,

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.770
probably is bombarded with high
energy radiation all the time.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.050 position:56%
So even if they're in that habitable
zone it could be a trick for it

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.390
to really be something where you
could get habitability happening.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.480
Also, planets that are
close to stars tend

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.710
to synchronize their
orbit and their spin,

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.570
just like the moon has
synchronized its orbit and spin

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:18.930
with respect to the earth.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.570
So we always see the same face
of the moon facing the earth.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.020
A planet would always see
the same part of the sun.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:28.320
I should say it the
other way around.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.620
If you're on a planet that's in one

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.260
of these M star orbits you're quick
likely to have got tidally locked

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.860
and you could either be
on that side of the planet

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.370
that always faces the
sun or maybe on the side

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:39.430
that never faces the sun.

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:42.630
Or maybe lucky enough to
be on that Terminator area.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.560
Maybe the planet would
wobble a little bit

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.060
and you would get something
like a day/night cycle.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:49.910
But typically we expect
these to be tidally locked

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.180
which gives you all kinds
of habitability issues.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.570
But we're still working hard to
study these phenomena and figure

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.870
out what could really be
going on in these systems

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.170
that are so different from ours.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.700 position:56%
And the thing that I think is really
exciting about this particular area

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.490
of research is it really
joins together all the areas

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:10.800
of astrophysics.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.480
So you have to understand our
sun very well, the flare dynamics

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.600
and time variability, to have
some sense of other stars that are

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.820
like it and to be able to compare
what's happening on other stars

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:24.740
as far as their flares go with
what we know so well about the sun.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.050
The sun is very well studied.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:28.500 position:56%
We have reams of data about the sun.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.530
Also, we're learning about
what happens to these planets

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:35.440
around other stars by studying
the planets in our own system.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:39.720
Getting better refinements of
how our own solar system formed.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.400
Why is there water in some
places and not others?

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.000
Was there water that
escaped, for example in Mars?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.750
And we have a lot of
information about the atmospheres

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.870
on the other planets in our solar
systems because we've sent probes

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.470
and we keep sending probes

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:55.250
and the probes get better
and better all the time.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:58.470
So we're able to take the
earths scientists ability

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:00.140
to model the earths atmosphere

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.160
and apply it to planetary
atmospheric modeling and then tying

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.620
that with the suns variability,
getting a picture or a model

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.460
of what the exoplanet
atmospheres could really be like.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.080
So it's just a very exciting time
to be in any area of astrophysics

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.200
because anything that
you do has some tie

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.830
in to understanding the
atmosphere's around these planets.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:25.770 position:56%
So we know the planets are there and
our next step is how are we going

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.520
to find out about the
atmospheres of these planets?

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.820
What's in the atmosphere?

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.120
How big is the atmosphere?

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.550
Do they even have an atmosphere?

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.210
I'm going to take a little bit
of a detour now to a system

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:39.310
that got a lot of attention
earlier this year.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.660
And this is called
the Trapeus system.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:44.260
Has anybody heard of the
Trappist system before?

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.900
Yeah! It was very exciting, it was
one of NASA's biggest days as far

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.160
as like communicating
a message goes.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.490
A lot of people heard
about the Trappist result,

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.870
downloaded the images and
watched the press conference

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.590
and read articles online.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.010
What's Trappist?

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.750
Trappist is a really small star,
like we were talking about,

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.980
that was discovered with a ground
based telescope to transit.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:09.440
And the team that discovered
it convinced the Spitzer Space

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.360
Telescope to stare at it
for a very, very long time.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.150
This is 500 hours of Spitzer
data, again uninterrupted.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.470
Because they knew that there
were a couple of systems

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.820
that were transiting
and if they looked

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.190
for a long time maybe
they'd find more.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.910
So this is the discovery
image of many

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:26.690
of the planets in the
Trappist system.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.110
There are actually seven
earth sized planets --

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.020
earth size-is planets
in this system.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.730
They're small planets around
a small star and they're

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.200
about 40 light years away.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.690
It's actually really
close in the milky way.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:42.790
It would take us about 800,000
years to get there if we were going

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:44.110
at the new horizon speed,

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.890
the fastest thing we've
ever sent away from earth.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.210
But it's still close.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.590
Relatively speaking it's close.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.870
Some people actually think of the
Trappist system as more analogous

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.730
to Jupiter and it's moons.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.010
Jupiter has moons that are
about the size of the earth too.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.030 position:56%
And Trappist is a really small star.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.720
You could fit the Trappist system
well within our solar systems.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.810
Those planets orbit Trappist on
orbits of days, weeks and months.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:13.040
So they're transiting all the time.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.640
Sometimes you can see two of
them transiting at the same time

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.420
and if they're really a lot
alike you can boost the signal

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.560
of what you're detecting by looking
at the two planets passing in front

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.980
of the sun instead of one.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.510
So there's a lot of
interest in Trappist.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.490
That we know that they're
small, we saw them interacting

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.320
with each other gravitationally
so we can measure their masses.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.520 position:56%
They are so close that it's a fairly
bright target even though it's a dim

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.020
star absolutely, it's
still close enough

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.420
that we can observe it very well.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.990
It's going to be observed
for decades,

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:47.460
it's going to be a touchstone
system in our exoplanet studies.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.510
This is just another example of the
Trappist planets on top compared

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:53.850
to some of the smaller bodies

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.390
in our solar system,
the terrestrial bodies.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.510 position:56%
And you can see where it says
planet radius there, the third down,

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.300
that they're all pretty darn
close to one earth radius.

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.330
So they're a really good size.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.110
And some of them are
in the habitable zone.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.120
They should have formed in a place
around that star where they had ice

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.000
and water and as they
migrated in kept some

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.300
of that water on their surface.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.160
So they're also excellent
candidates for looking

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.310
for life signs or at
least water signs.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:27.670
How are we going to do
this and how are we going

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.400
to find more systems like Trappist?

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.580
Well, we're going to launch
something called TESS;

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:35.620
Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.130
as Stephanie mentioned earlier.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.450
It's actually a fairly small
telescope, it's four cameras

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:42.750
that are pointed in a row.

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:48.810
And it's going to launch in 2018
March and it has one purpose.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:53.580
It's going to do an all sky survey
of the stars near us to look

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.270
for planets transiting
nearby bright stars.

00:33:57.270 --> 00:34:00.060
So Kepler wanted a
statistical answer and it looked

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.870
at stars that were very far away.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.260
TESS is going to look for
those transiting planets now

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.650
around our nearest neighbors.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:08.800
We know they're out there,
we're going to find them.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.230
Here's an overview of the mission.

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.280
It's what we call a
NASA Explorer mission.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:17.040
NASA has big missions like Hubble
and medium missions like Explorers

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.090
where you launch balloons
and sounding rockets as well.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.390
It's managed at Goddard.

00:34:21.390 --> 00:34:24.980 position:56%
The lead institution and science
team is led by George Ricker at MIT.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.140
Being built down in
Virginia at Orbital Now.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.070
The beautiful picture of
it all coming together.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:31.030
It's going to take two
years to survey the sky.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.370
It's going to do the southern
hemisphere first for one year

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.400
and then it's going to turn over
and do the northern hemisphere.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.990 position:56%
And they've designed it so that they
can detect enough exoplanets this

00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:43.390 position:56%
way that they can then go to the
ground based follow up observatories

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:46.130
to confirm them and
measure their masses;

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.850
fifty small planets
at the end of this.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.580
These cameras are really wide
field compared even to Kepler.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.060
So one camera, you could
actually put the entire Orion

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.760
constellation into.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.370
Go out some night when it's
clear and look at Orion,

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:02.310
it is a huge constellation.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.720
That's one of four cameras.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:06.910
So it's really looking
at a huge swath

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.830
of the nearby stellar neighborhood.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.310
Here's a comparison of
the Kepler search space.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.480
So Kepler was looking at
one region, basically a cone

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.700
where the average distance of
the stars was 3,000 light years.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.370
And it only looked at
less than 1% of the sky.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.220
That is TESS's search space.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.590
Going to look at virtually
the entire sky.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.590
There are definitely some
gaps, but those stars are more

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:34.770
like 200 light years near us.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:36.910
Lots, lots, closer.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.210
They're going to be brighter

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.510
and they're going to
be all over the sky.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.290
There it is.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:45.830
It's taken a long time to take
a picture like this of TESS.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:50.770 position:56%
But that's the solar array test that
the space craft is all put together.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.380
That's the antenna you're
seeing looking at you,

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.680
that's going to beam our data

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:57.370
down every 13.7 days once
we go around that orbit.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:01.880
You can't really see the
cameras but they're on top.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.820
So we're really excited for TESS.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.910
We know it's going to
find transiting planets.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:07.920
We can't wait to get to
the telescopes and find

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.400
out what their masses are and
maybe have another few Trappist

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.830
like systems where we can
really start to figure

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.720
out what's going on
in the atmospheres.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.590
But all of these missions I've
been talking about so far,

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.770
really what they're doing
is discovering exoplanets.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.370
They're collecting where
the exoplanets are.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.800
And we're learning about
the sizes of the exoplanets,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:33.350 position:56%
that there's a wide variety of sizes
but we don't know very much more.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.010
There's more than 4,000
exoplanets known right now,

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:40.390
more than 4,000 just from
Kepler alone as candidates.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.820
We're not sure what any of
them really look like the way

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.910
that our own solar
system planets are known.

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.210
So how are we going to get there?

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.970 position:56%
Well we have to turn to the most
powerful telescopes that exist today

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:54.110
and that we're launching soon and
that we're planning for the future

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.210
in order to really get these
answers, we've got enough data now

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.020
that we can really design
these experiments well

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.320
to take these next steps.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.270
So I'm going to take a few minutes
to just talk at what direction --

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:08.200
one of the directions
that we're going in.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.850
This is an artist's concept
of some work that's being done

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.910
with the Hubble Space
Telescope right now.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.170
It's been going on
for the last few years

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.630 position:56%
and there are several large programs

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.880
that are devoting Hubble
space telescope time

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.640
to measuring the spectra of what
we call those "Hot Jupiter's",

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.630
those very massive planets.

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:29.750
To look for spectral signatures,
little parts of the light

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:35.100
that are missing, where elements
have been absorbed by the light.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.470 position:56%
So what we see here is a signature
of methane in a planet's atmosphere.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:43.100
Methane is one of the gases that
we think could be a biosignature.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.430
A lot of biological
material makes methane.

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:50.490
It's not easy to keep methane in
an atmosphere if there's no source

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.390
for it in certain conditions.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.280
So methane is exciting.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.570
We can actually see it
in a Hubble spectrum.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.310
These are just really the baby
steps that we're taking here.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.360
That doesn't tell you where
the methane came from.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.120
It doesn't tell you a lot
about the atmosphere other

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:08.470
than that you've seen a
methane line in absorption.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:12.530
But we do know that the James
Webb Space Telescope is going

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.540
to be able to take the next step.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.590
So James Webb Space Telescope
is launching in 2019.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:20.550
You can see it's quite a bit bigger
than the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:25.380
Hubble Space Telescope mirrors
2.4 mirrors, JWST dwarfs it.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:27.270
It has hexagonal mirrors
that come together

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.440
and can reposition themselves.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.720
It has a sun shield there at
the bottom that's the size

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.970 position:56%
of a tennis court that's going to
keep it very cold because it's going

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.770
to make measurements
in the infrared,

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.120
so beyond the red part
of the visible spectrum.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.160
That's where a lot of exciting
stuff happens in astrophysics both

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.770
for exoplanets and for
the distant universe.

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.340
That's actually a picture of
the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.370
It was put together at Goddard
in a clean room and that was one

00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:55.100
of the days that it
was facing the window.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.710
So it really is huge.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.530
It really is ready to roll.

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:00.370
They're down testing it in Johnson.

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.120
It's actually out of testing
now, they're warming it

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.590
up in the big chamber where they
did a lot of the Apollo testing.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:09.700
Next it'll go off to get the sun
should mated to it and it'll launch

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:13.500
from French Guiana in 2019.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.620
We're so excited about
what it's going to find.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.530
And there's also been a lot
of interesting work done

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:21.360
in our own solar system
studying the earth.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.220
There are a lot of planetary
missions that you can turn around

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.710
and have them look at the earth.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.730
The picture on the left
is actually an image

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.240
that was taken I believe
from Cassini.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.150
You see that little blue
dot in there is the earth

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:35.510
from the distance of Saturn.

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.850
And that's better than we're
going to see exoplanets

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.240
around other stars,
but it's still so tiny.

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.260 position:56%
But there were efforts made to
tease out the spectrum of the earth,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.370
both in the light that's coming
right towards you and also

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.800
as a transmission spectrum
so that when we're looking

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.970 position:56%
at a lunar eclipse, where the sun is
behind the earth and we're looking

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.520
at the moon that's red because
the earth is blocking the light

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.650
on the moon, but some of the light
is passing through the atmosphere

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.660
and bouncing off the moon so you
can get some spectral signatures

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.330
of the earth in these ways that are
not directly looking at the earth.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:09.180
And we know that we can see some
signs in those earth spectra

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.220
that tell us that biosignatures
are on the earth.

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.560
So that's a really exciting
prospect for the future.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:17.850 position:56%
If we can do this same kind of thing

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.020
with nearby exoplanets can
we see evidence of water,

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:27.660
evidence of clouds, evidence
of tectonic activity.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:31.440
We also know that it's possible
if you were to say be looking

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.080
at the solar system and you
had a really good telescope

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.610
in your alien universe or galaxy,
if you could see the earth and mars

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:43.360
and Venus we know that you
could tell those spectra apart.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.660
They're all small planets.

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:46.700
They're all class to
the habitable zone,

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:50.110
but they have specific
features in their atmosphere

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:52.970
that differentiate them
and particularly as you go

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.610
out towards the right of that curve
that's a spectrum and it's going

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:00.350
into the infrared, we can see
that the carbon dioxide feature is

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:04.160
so strong in the earth compared
to Mars, other features in Venus,

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.010 position:56%
all that carbon dioxide in the Venus
atmosphere causing those deep lines.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.270
So this is again exciting
evidence that we may be able

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:15.200
to disentangle features of planets
that tell us if they're earth like

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.350
or maybe more like Venus.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.890
There's some really
exciting work going on now

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:21.690
as we plan the telescope
that is going

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.970
to be the next generation JWST.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.260
So while we're excited about
launching this huge JWST telescope

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:31.000
in two years we're also thinking
about what have we learned

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.650
from building JWST that will
let us take the next step?

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.680
Let us build an even larger mirror.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.320
Let us take even more
sensitive measurements.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.990 position:56%
This is a really exciting simulation
that has just come out recently

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.540
by a group at Goddard
led by Aki Roberge.

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:50.390
She's a scientist that's working
on a mission concept called LUVOIR,

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:55.020
the Large Ultraviolet
Optical Infrared telescope.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.790
One of the things they need to know

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:02.120
to build LUVOIR correctly is
what could you expect to see

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:06.720
if you were looking at the solar
system from about 12 parsecs away?

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.430
Could you even be able
to disentangle all

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.350
that stuff around the sun?

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:14.330
We know there's a lot of
dust in the solar system,

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.710
we know that when you're looking
at a star there's all kinds

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.010
of stuff in the background.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:20.490
Background stars, even
background galaxies.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:24.350
This group has put together an
extremely sophisticated simulation

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:28.000
to help us understand what we would
see if we could look at the earth

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.330
from a distance with
something called a coronagraph.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.180
And the coronagraph is
being designed again

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.110
to be optimized for LUVOIR.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:39.770
There's the Hubble mirror, there's
the JWST mirror, look at LUVOIR,

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:43.380
it's going to get yet again
huge but achievable now.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.300
We know we can do something
like this.

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.510
Let me show you a little movie
of what a coronagraph does.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:43:06.480
[ Music ]

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.460
&gt;&gt; A distant star is
orbited by two planets.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.520
One looks similar to the earth,
the other is a gas giant.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.500
When viewed from a distance
the two planets disappear

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.700
into the glare of their sun.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:22.520
How could we ever find these
planets all the way from the earth?

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.330
By using a space telescope
with the coronagraph

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.590
to separate star light
from planet light.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:32.590
As the stars light passes through
the telescopes large mirrors,

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:35.060
it picks up small distortions.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.130
Diffraction adds concentric
rings to the image we see.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.670
To reveal the planets, first
a coronagraph uses a mask

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.650
to block much of the stars light

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:48.390
and redirect the remaining
light to the outer edges.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:53.700 position:56%
A washer shaped device can now block
most of the rest of the stars light.

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:58.000
Because the planets light comes
in at an angle, it misses the mask

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.440
and passes through the
center of the washer.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.160
But when we turn up the image
signal by collecting more light,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.880
we can see that the
planets are still hidden

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:09.980
under blobs of leftover star light.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.680 position:56%
To remove these blobs the
coronagraph has a special deformable

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.590
mirror that can change shape by
using hundreds of tiny pistons.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.510
This can correct distortions
in the light beam.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.640
As the mirror deforms,
the blobs of light as seen

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.230
in the monitor slowly
begin disappearing,

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:31.250
finally revealing the
brighter of the two planets.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:35.860
Afterwards, the fainter
planet also comes into view.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:41.320 position:56%
We can now see objects more than a
billion times fainter than the star.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.480
And if the light from
these planets is passed

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:48.070
through a prism we can spread
it out into rainbows of color.

00:44:48.070 --> 00:44:50.450
But some colors are missing.

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:54.300
They were absorbed by gases
in each planet's atmosphere,

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.840
giving us important clues
about their composition.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.510
The search for life in the universe
has taken a new step forward.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:10.030
[ Music ]

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.570
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: So that's hopefully
a pretty good explanation

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:18.720 position:56%
of what a coronagraph does, it's
really exciting engineering and math

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.380
and science and software and we
believe is going to be able to cut

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:27.190
down so much of the stars
light that we would be able

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:32.020
to differentiate earth,
Venus and certainly Jupiter

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.050
if we had a telescope like
LUVOIR at the right distance.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:39.000
So this is extremely exciting,
it's definitely our next steps

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.550
that we would like to take.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.120
LUVOIR is just one of many large
missions that NASA is studying.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.790
There's four large mission
studies happening right now.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.650
There are two that are
focused on exoplanets.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.140
LUVOIR is one and another
one that is called HAB-X

00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.890
for Habitable Exoplanets.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.050
They share a lot of
similar characteristics.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.980 position:56%
They want to have a big mirror, they
want to have a coronagraph on board

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.160
so that you can block out
that star light and start

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.220
to see the planets light and
take spectra of it and find

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:05.740
out what's in the atmosphere.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.690
But they just have slightly
different mission characteristics.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.690
LUVOIR is meant to do as much in
the distant universe as it is to do

00:46:12.690 --> 00:46:16.380 position:56%
in exoplanets whereas HAB-X is a bit
more focused in it's science case.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.760
But it can also of course do
lots of astrophysics as well.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.100
And we're waiting to see what
the community directs NASA to do.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.760
Every 10 years the country
takes part in a decadal survey

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.940
of astrophysics and this directs
the government science centers

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.800
about what they should focus
on in the next 10 years.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.180
So we're gearing up for
the next decadal survey,

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.660 position:56%
it'll be happening in 2019 and 2020.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.790
Those four mission studies
I was talking about,

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.690
they will be going into
the decadal survey.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.930
We're waiting to hear what
the community of scientists

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.700 position:56%
that are involved in that recommend.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.720
We're certainly hoping LUVOIR
and HAB-X are very highly ranked

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.500 position:56%
so that we can start to really tease

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.860
out these exoplanet
atmospheric signatures.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.390
This sort of just does
the sweep of NASA

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:01.470
and ground based astrophysics
missions

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.590
that are focused on
exoplanets right now.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:06.580
I showed you some Hubble
results, some Spitzer results,

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.840
we talked about some
ground based results.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.240
We looked at a lot
of Kepler data here.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.950
I told you how excited
we are for TESS

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:16.310
to find those nearby transiting
exoplanets we know we're going

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:19.140
to find and be able to
follow up with Hubble

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.800
and the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.230
I didn't even get a chance to talk

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:25.860
about the wide field infrared
survey telescope and I can't

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.510
because I don't have time, but
it's going to launch as well.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:29.930
And then that last mission

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.920
around the bottom there
is this future mission

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:37.080
that the decadal survey will
tell us what it will be like.

00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:41.280
So I hope I have convinced you
that we really are standing

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:45.770 position:56%
on the edge here of our knowledge of
what we know about our solar system

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:50.380 position:56%
and extra solar systems and that
we've started to peer back that vail

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:55.310
and put together a much bigger
picture of how planets exist

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:59.110 position:56%
around stars and we'll take the next
step to determine how they formed

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.020
around stars and around our sun and
we are soon to take the next steps

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.190
in determining what
those atmospheres

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:06.490
around those planets look like.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.170
And whether or not they have
elements in them that we can tie

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:14.930
to biospheres life or
compatible with life.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:19.180 position:56%
So I hope that the next time you
look up in the sky at the milky way,

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:22.550
instead of seeing something that
shows you that there are billions

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:26.750
of stars in just our galaxy
and so any galaxies out there,

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:28.580
that you'll also think
about the planets

00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:30.530
that are there that you can't see.

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:32.680
The ones that we didn't
know about when I was a kid

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.900
and that we know now are everywhere
and think about what we're going

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:40.400
to find out when your
kids are my age.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.980
It's a great explosive time.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:44.570
So this is a picture
of Galileo's telescope.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:45.940
It's a scale model.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.890
And it was brought up on the Hubble
Space Telescope servicing mission,

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.920
the last one, by astronaut
John Grunsfeld,

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.580
who's also an astrophysicist.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.950 position:56%
He is known as the Hubble repairman.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:58.510
He is the last person to teach the
Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:02.010
If you can squint your eyes you
can see both telescopes there.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.780
Galileo's telescope and
the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.820
408 years between the two.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.190
And I think we're just
at a very exciting time

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.080
where knowledge is
explosive in this area.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.530
So, buckle up and please
keep reading about it.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.330
Thank you.

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:21.050
[ Applause ]

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:23.290
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Thank you so much.

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:26.930
And if anyone has questions we'll
take them now and repeat them.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.210
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Okay.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.460
Let's start in the
front and go around.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.850
&gt;&gt; So, just maybe two
questions if I can cheat.

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:39.070
Can we not get a pretty good
idea of the composition of --

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.650
particularly the smaller planets?

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:44.020
Or is that what we're most
interested in perhaps.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.710
If we know their density and we
know the mass, we know the size,

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:49.690
can't we tell if there's
perhaps water there

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.250
from the density of the planet?

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:55.770
And are we at a point
sometime in the near future

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:57.740
where we might be able
to in fact move

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:02.050
around these larger gas
planets that we've been finding?

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.930
So those are great questions.

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.330
The first question is about whether
the density gives you everything

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.330
that you would need to
know about the planet

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.490
and the second question is
whether we can see exomoons,

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:15.530
moons around exoplanets.

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.250
So the first one you're
exactly right,

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:19.650
you've hit the nail on the head.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:23.060
And that's why when I was talking
about TESS I focused on the fact

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.310 position:56%
that we are going to detect a lot of
exoplanets but that we're expecting

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.260
that 50 of those we'll
be able to follow

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.940
up with ground based
measurements to measure the masses.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.150
So they Kepler and the
transit method in general do,

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.960
just gives you the size
of the planet, the radius.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.730
We don't know the mass
until we've measured it

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:42.070
through a different method
usually radial velocity.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:44.980
And the test targets are going
to be so close and so bright

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.060
that we're expecting several
dozen will be amenable

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.730
to really accurately
measuring the mass.

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:54.100
And so that if you know the star
very well, the size of the star,

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.130
then you know the size of
the planet from the transit.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:58.580
And once you've got its
mass, you've got its density.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:02.180
And that gives you a huge amount of
information about the composition

00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.250
of the planet, it's
bulk composition.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.640 position:56%
But there's a whole bunch of ways
that you can make an average density

00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.920 position:56%
out of, you know, either a
differentiated planet like the earth

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.640
where we've got a lot
of iron in the center

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:16.700
and then the crust is a different
density and a slight atmosphere.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.910 position:56%
You can imagine putting that
together in a slightly different way

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:21.020
where you would still have
the same common density.

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:22.910
So it's a really important step

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.580
but it's not enough to
tell you everything.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.410
Yes. Oh, there's a second question.

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:29.730
Exomoons, sorry.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.980
And yes, we do think that the
Kepler telescope was precise enough

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.880
that it could have
measured exomoons.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.930
It's a little bit trickier to
do that because it's not --

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:42.340
so the pipeline for Kepler is just
meant to find transiting planets.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:46.360
Finding transiting exomoons around
a planet requires another level

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.950
of effort in the pipeline.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:50.210
There's a huge amount
of data in the archive.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:54.090
I wouldn't be surprised if someone
were to try to attack that problem

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:55.510
in the next few years
but to the best

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.930
of my knowledge they have not
announced any exomoons yet.

00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:00.750
They have announced some
exotrojan asteroids.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:03.330
So we have the trojan asteroids
in our solar system that are

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:06.000
in very special orbits
compared to the planets.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.770
So they make a triangle, for
example, with the sun, Jupiter

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:10.150
and an equilateral triangle.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.900
There's two areas where
asteroids can be stable

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.680
and collect and coagulate.

00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.090
So if you scale a lot of
the Kepler planetary systems

00:52:18.090 --> 00:52:22.300 position:56%
onto the same scale you can start to
see signs that look very consistent

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.440
with trojan asteroids, which
is exactly what you'd expect

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.220
because gravity is
the same everywhere.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.520
Yes.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.820
&gt;&gt; You talk a little bit
about the time factor,

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.270
Kepler looked at one point and
stays there for a long time

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:36.880
and collects data, but doesn't
make a decision on its own.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.760 position:56%
The data comes back and decisions
are made once the data is collected.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.210
Is there something that's
coming in like a hound dog idea?

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.260
Where you talked about you're
pointing back at the earth

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:51.430 position:56%
and collecting data [inaudible] that
Goldilocks type of scenario would be

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:55.260
for the earth and then speeding
up the process of changing sectors

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.560
and saying, alright,
we were in this area,

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.570
we decided this was long enough
to determine the transits,

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:03.790
move to the next area and look for
that type of Goldilocks prospective

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:08.980
of an earth, of whatever that is
from perspective of oxygen or water

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.550
or whatever consideration
we're looking

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:12.220 position:56%
for that we would consider for life.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.630
Is there something like that?

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:15.680
Versus, you don't want
to miss anything

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.130
but so much time is
spending on the majority

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.950 position:56%
of things not being the right thing.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:22.250
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Right.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.550
So the question is
to talk a little bit

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:29.780
about how the time axis impacts
your ability to detect planets

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.850
and Kepler pointing
in one direction meant

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:35.480
that while we were really
interrogating one patch

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.280
of the sky very intensely,
we were missing almost all

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.580
of the sky during that time.

00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:41.970
I think that was the point, right?

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.430
And so for TESS, so no,
nothing so sophisticated is

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:48.380
in the near term plans like that.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:52.310
But you can imagine putting
together two simpler missions

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:55.100
to get where you're going.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.250
So, TESS's main difference
from Kepler is that it stares

00:53:58.250 --> 00:54:01.700
in one region of the sky with those
four cameras for 27 days only.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.800
And then it's going to rotate
to like a next slice of the sky.

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:10.390
The camera that's at the bottom
or top is basically just rotating

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:12.290
but looking at the same stars.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:15.900
So those stars would be monitored
continuously for about a year,

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.820
whereas the other parts of
the sky we're only going

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:20.270
to have 27 days worth
of data on those stars.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:23.440
So we're going to be -- it's
a preferentially red filter

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.760
so we're going to be preferentially
finding transits around those dim,

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:29.710
low mass stars where you can
see habitable zone planets

00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:32.290
in a short amount of time.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.170
But, currently there's no effort

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:38.390
to dynamically change
your time length based

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.560
on what you've found so far.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.930
You can use the TESS results
to then go to telescopes

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:45.390 position:56%
and do the more sophisticated stuff.

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:46.690
Yes.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:47.990
&gt;&gt; When you [inaudible]
biosignatures

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:51.080
of the [inaudible] that you will.

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:54.560
What's the degree of
certainty will you have

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.990
that you've found something
that might signify life?

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:59.140
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Oh that's
a really great question.

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.450
And there's actually a lot
of people that are working

00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.210
on that particular question.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.550
As I was talking about earlier,

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:08.820
exoplanets has become
extremely multidisciplinary.

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:11.740
So you know the astrophysicists
are capable

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.320
of developing these amazing
telescopes with the ability,

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.820
you know, to really detect
signatures in a spectra.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.100
But we also need atmospheric
scientists to do modeling

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.030
that tells us what are
the possible sources

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.140
of that feature in an atmosphere.

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:30.960
What could be tricking us?

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.540
You know, what could look like
a biosignature that isn't?

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.770
And so we're using all kinds
of information that we have

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.360
from earth science and from
planetary science and just

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.800
from modeling to start to
answer those questions.

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.690
So I think it's going to be very
similar to the answer about like,

00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:45.950
once you've got the mass does
that nail down everything

00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:47.250
that the planet is made of?

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:51.170
If we're going to have a
similar answer for spectral lines

00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:52.810
and potential biosignatures.

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:55.880 position:56%
I think when we find something we'll
know it as a potential biosignature,

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.460
they we're going to have to do an
awful lot of work modeling theory

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.510
and just measuring many other
systems before we have a sense

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:03.810
of how secure we are in that.

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:06.170
&gt;&gt; Just a follow up, and then
what would be the next step

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.050
in what's [inaudible]
on that modeling.

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:11.550
What would be the hope like you
said when our kids at your age?

00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.710
Or each generations.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.220
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: So I actually
-- so I have a seven year old

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.520
and I am fairly confident that when
he's my age he's going to be able

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.190
to go outside with his kids and
point to a couple stars in the sky

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:26.990
and say, that one right over there
has a planet a lot like earth.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.580
We know it's about the right size,

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:31.970
we know that liquid water
does exist there and we think

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:36.090
that there could be life
because we know of these things.

00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:40.210
The next step is not
up to my generation.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.160
Keep going this way
and then come back.

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.460
Yes.

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.050
&gt;&gt; I know there was an
earlier mission proposed

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:53.270
that hasn't been launched
yet or planned

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:55.320
to track terrestrial planet finder.

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:59.890
Is there an upcoming mission
that's analogous to that

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:05.270
or how far off will the terrestrial
planet finder type mission be

00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:07.480
in the [inaudible]?

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.880
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: So, some elements

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:15.620
of the terrestrial planet
finder the LUVOIR concept.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.470
But you can think of LUVOIR
as a reengineered version

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.070
of the terrestrial planet finder.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:23.660
So the question was,
how soon will something

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:26.210
like the terrestrial
planet finder be realized?

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:28.850
So, LUVOIR takes some
of the best ideas

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.160
of the terrestrial planet finder
and it takes all the information

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.790
that we have right now about the
exoplanet populations we know

00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:36.670
of to design a mission that
can really tell us something

00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:38.720
about what we know
we're going to see.

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:43.420
When the terrestrial planet finder
was first being designed we didn't

00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:46.140
really know that much about the
exoplanet population out there

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.510
and then some of the other things

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.090
that might have made it very
challenging to visually see planets

00:57:51.090 --> 00:57:52.690
like how much dust
was in the system.

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.120
But we're taking what we're
learning now about systems

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.310
to make LUVOIR even
stronger and better.

00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:00.690 position:56%
There's always a next step though
and there's people that are thinking

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.680
about what do we do
even beyond the LUVOIR?

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:07.390
And so there are some ideas about
building super large mirrors

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:10.440
in space using astronauts or
robots near the space station,

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.690
where you could launch pieces of
it and put it together like a Lego.

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.130
And then of course, very
much more sophisticated

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.770
coronagraph technology.

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:20.490
The movie that I showed
you about where we're going

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:23.860 position:56%
in coronagraphs now, we've made huge
strides there in the past decade

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:27.660
but we've got a long way to go
there too and you can see some kind

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:31.290
of transformative technology there
for direct imaging that you'd want

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:33.810
to fold into the next
mission as well.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:35.190
Yes.

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:39.600
&gt;&gt; Ages ago I remember reading
that we shouldn't get too excited

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.370
about exoplanets because there's
so many double stars out there

00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:45.850
and double stars were less
likely to have planets.

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:48.430
I didn't hear you mention
double stars at all.

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:49.730
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: You are right,

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:51.150
I didn't have time to
mention them at all.

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:54.240
So you may remember
that scene in Star Wars

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:57.090
where Luke Skywalker goes
back to his childhood home

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:00.730
and he sees something terrible
and he goes out on a hill

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:04.930 position:56%
and he watches the sunset and it's
two stars that are setting, not one.

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:08.430
And people said at the time George
Lucas, that was fantastical.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:11.350
You're not going to have any stable
planets around binary star systems.

00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:13.860
There are actually planets
around binary star systems

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:15.430
when we found them with Kepler.

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:18.060
The first concubinary planets
were found just a few years

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.740
after the mission launched and
there's quite a collection of them.

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.870
So that opens up a whole
new set of questions

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:25.870
about the stability
of planetary systems.

00:59:25.870 --> 00:59:27.170
Where did they form?

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.980
Do they form somewhere
else and migrate in?

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:30.470
Do they form around one star

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:32.420
or did the whole system
form, you know, as one?

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.280
And have they interacted,
have then been around one star

00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.580
for a while and the other?

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:37.610
It's fun, it's a lot of
fun dynamics in that one.

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:38.910
Yes?

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:42.760
&gt;&gt; Actually yeah, my question
was sort of based on that.

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:46.760 position:56%
How does binary or even tertiary
that has ever been in the situation,

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:51.240
how does it affect the means for
Kepler and maybe future tests

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.910
to elaborate on these
exoplanet findings?

00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:58.330
Have they impeded or
have they, I guess,

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:00.720
lead to more fascinating
[inaudible].

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.820
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: So the question
is, how does the binarity

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.150
of many stars impact the
results that we're talking

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:06.450
about with Kepler and TESS?

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:09.620
So we know that about half the
stars in our galaxy are found

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.330
in binaries and half are single.

01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:17.860
And lots of what I talked about
was sort of implicitly suggesting

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.370
that they are single stars.

01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:21.820
And in fact we know that
about half of them aren't.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.320
So there's a great effort that goes

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.530
into taking a Kepler planet
candidate and turning it

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:30.070
into a Kepler confirmed planet.

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:31.850
And one of the things
we have to watch

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:37.130
out for the most is whether
a binary star is tricking us.

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:41.970
Because if you see a planet that's
going around one star you're going

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:44.640
to get a certain size estimate.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.950
But if it's actually two stars
that are giving you the flux

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:49.330
from the star, then the transits
going to look much smaller

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.810 position:56%
and you're going to make the mistake

01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:53.250
that the planet is
smaller than it really is.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.070 position:56%
So there are efforts that go into
like direct imaging of these systems

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.050
to see if we can get very
high resolution imaging

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:00.350
and look for binary pairs.

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.870
If they're very far away
that's also very challenging.

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:04.560
So there's also some
statistical arguments

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.830
about whether this is a
single star or a binary

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.620
and then also we can
look at the data itself

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.600
and see how the light moves
on the detector to determine

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.710
if there's something fooling us.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:18.460
Yes? Should I take
one more question?

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:20.130
It's 12:31.

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:21.430
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Yeah.

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:22.730
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Okay.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.030
&gt;&gt; Can you speak at all --

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.010
you didn't mention if there was
any significance to the location

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:28.600
of where these missions
were looking.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.410
Like Kepler seemed like it was
kind of a somewhat arbitrary area.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:35.190
This spot and this distance away.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:39.070
And then the next mission is
looking 200 light years away.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.370
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Mmm-hmm.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.440
&gt;&gt; They're both, with
Kepler the location

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:44.800
but also the distance
of the two of those.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.650
Is there a reason why they matter?

01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.950
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Sure.

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.110
So the question is say
something a little bit about,

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.610
basically the mission design.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:53.920
Why was Kepler chosen
to look where it looked?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.090
And why is TESS looking at the 200
light year sphere around the earth?

01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.820
So, yes, there are good reasons.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.040
And there was a lot of debate
and discussion and collaboration

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.260
that went into deciding what
the final Kepler field would be.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:10.370
We knew in order to do the
mission it has to be staring,

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:13.310
so it had to be somewhere where it
could look for four years straight.

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:16.710
We wanted to have lots and
lots of stars like the sun,

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:20.410
so you needed a relatively
dense patch of the sky.

01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:22.660
But you didn't want to be
so close to the milky way

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.450
that you had a lot of crowding.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:27.140
That your typical star would
have other stars nearby

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.440
that would dilute the signal.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:30.780
So you wanted to get far
enough off the milky way plane

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.330
that you would have about
150,000 sun like stars

01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:36.110
that you could put little
postage stamp patches

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:37.820
to get the light curves.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:40.460
And another reason that
that position was chosen was

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.440
because there were a lot of ground
based telescopes that could get

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:49.410
on the part of the sky pretty
quickly to confirm the planets.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:52.940
For TESS, once TESS was being
finalized we of course knew

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:54.900
from Kepler that planets
were everywhere and so

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.460
that made the choice
of looking close,

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.180
looking nearby, much, much better.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:01.760
You know, we know they're
going to be there.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.960
So now you can design TESS in
a way that's a lot different

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.630
than we designed most astrophysics
missions where we're trying

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.990
to look at really dim things.

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:12.230
TESS is really meant to
look at bright stars.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:15.860
Most telescopes saturate when
you look at bright stars.

01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.160
But TESS won't.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.030 position:56%
So, it was intentionally designed to
be shallow so that it's only going

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.070
out to 200 light years
because we know there are more

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:26.030
than enough stars in that
area that it is sensitive

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.350
to that we expect thousands
of planets and hundreds

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:32.500
to be with measured masses.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.860
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Well, thank you very much.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:35.160
&gt;&gt; Padi Boyd: Thank you.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.060
Thanks for all your good questions.
