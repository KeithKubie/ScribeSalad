00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.059
As one of the most popular franchises in all
of pop culture, fans spend a lot of time dissecting

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.750
each frame of a Star Wars film.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.830
The saga is a touchstone for generations of
moviegoers, meaning that many people are well

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.160
versed in each of their secrets.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.500
But even the most die-hard supporters can
get stumped every now and then.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.200
There are aspects of the movies that have
yet to be revealed.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.400
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Star Wars mysteries
that were never answered.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.970
Anakin’s Conception

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.120
In Episode I, it’s said that Anakin was
born without a father, and his mother Shmi

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.210
can’t explain what happened.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.160
It’s a subject that’s not really touched
upon again until Revenge of the Sith, when

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.350
Chancellor Palpatine tells Anakin the story
of Darth Plageuis.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.640
Sidious’ old master, Plageuis could manipulate
the midichlorians to create life, but the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.220
film stops short of saying this is how Skywalker
was conceived.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.290
It’s a reveal George Lucas had planned in
the original script, but he cut it – and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.260
now the answer may never be known, making
one wonder why the miracle birth angle was

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.990
introduced in the first place.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.809
Vader Doesn’t Sense Leia

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.900
Darth Vader is one of the most powerful Force
users in the galaxy, so why couldn’t he

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.969
sense his own daughter?

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:11.600
In Return of the Jedi, viewers learn that
Leia is Luke’s twin sister, and therefore

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.999
one of Vader’s children.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.899
It retroactively creates a plot hole, since
Vader never felt something in the Force that

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:17.899
hinted at that.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.689
During the Death Star trench run, he was very
aware that Luke was strong with the Force,

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.740
and Leia, while no Jedi, was still able to
use it.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.329
Vader should have been able to sense the presence
of another Force sensitive being, especially

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.810
when he’s standing right in front of her.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.979
Yoda’s Species

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.639
Every alien and creature that shows up in
the Star Wars films has a name.

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:39.999
Many of them, like Wookies, Ewoks, and Hutts,
go down in history and become memorable parts

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.189
of the zeitgeist.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.700
But ask anyone what Yoda’s species is, and
there will be no reply.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.029
The wise old Jedi master is just shown as
a small green alien with pointy ears, with

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.569
no mention of what kind he is being made.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.789
Even when another of Yoda’s people, Yaddle,
was shown in the prequels, the answer was

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.789
never revealed.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.599
It’s one that will puzzle Star Wars fans
forever, and is unlikely to ever be solved.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.969
Luke’s Dagobah Training

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.319
In The Empire Strikes Back, Luke heads to
Dagobah to train with Yoda, while his friends

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.710
fly in the Millennium Falcon trying to avoid
the Imperials.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.220
The way the film is edited, it seems like
Luke was with Yoda for just a few days learning

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.170
the ways of the Force, but that hardly seems
like enough time to become a Jedi Knight.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.070
That’s a process that should take months,
but it’s hard to believe Han, Leia, and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.459
Chewie spent that much time cooped up in the
Falcon evading their enemies.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.019
Fans will just have to use their imagination
to come up with a proper answer, since this

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.769
topic won’t be covered again.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.019
Maker of the Prophecy

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.459
When he discovers Anakin, Qui-Gon determines
that the boy is the Chosen One a Jedi prophecy

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.219
speaks of – one who will bring balance to
the Force.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.689
It’s a way to underscore Anakin’s importance
to galactic events, but the prophecy is one

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.049
of the more mysterious elements of the whole
saga.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.469
Nobody mentions where it came from or who
wrote it, or why it was so important to bring

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.469
the Force back into balance.

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.850
And given that there are Dark Side users in
The Force Awakens, it seems like a hopeless

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.850
cause anyway.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.609
The Chosen One trope can work sometimes, but
the case can be made it should be left out

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:04.609
of Star Wars.

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.609
Is Boba Fett Alive?

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.790
Fans were very disappointed when bounty hunter
Boba Fett met a less-than-noble end at the

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.269
Sarlaac pit, wishing that the villain could
have stayed longer, or died with more dignity.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.959
His lack of screen time in the original trilogy
has contributed to his rise in popularity,

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.780
and viewers want to see more of him.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.819
The debate rages on that Boba could still
be alive, having escaped the Sarlaac.

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.730
The new Star Wars canon has yet to answer
this, with the only clue being the appearance

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.409
of Mandalorian armor in the novel Aftermath.

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.540
If a Boba spinoff movie is in the works, fans
may discover the truth.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.329
Who Discovered the Force?

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.400
The Star Wars films present only a snippet
of the universe’s vast history, leaving

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.379
much more left to be explored.

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.879
Obi-Wan mentions that the Jedi were the guardians
of the Old Republic for over 1,000 generations,

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.950
meaning the Force had to have been discovered
a long, long time ago.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.310
It would be an interesting story to see unfold,
since the Force is such a unique and fascinating

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.310
concept.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.450
Learning that you can control objects with
your mind and sense people’s presences is

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.319
a monumental, life-changing event – and
it’s something that had huge ramifications

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.319
on the galaxy.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.620
Who’s Funding the Rebels?

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.360
The Empire has plenty of resources at their
disposal to wage a war, since their reach

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.749
covers several areas of the galaxy, but what
about their opponents?

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:18.930
A ragtag bunch struggling to make ends meet,
the Rebels have a number of ships and supplies

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.520
they need for the conflict, and that stuff
probably doesn’t come cheap.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.600
It’s hinted that certain sympathizing systems
like Alderaan may supply some funds, but it’s

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.330
something fans never know for sure.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.990
Since the Rebel Alliance emerges victorious,
their financial sources are the real heroes

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.830
of the saga who never get a moment in the
spotlight.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.590
Obi-Wan’s Tatooine Vacation

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.849
After the fall of the Jedi Order, Obi-Wan
Kenobi goes into exile on Tatooine, so he

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.460
can keep a close eye on young Luke.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.000
But with 19 years taking place between Episodes
III and IV, it’s hard to believe that all

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.449
Obi-Wan did was baby sit.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.690
While he probably remained low key to avoid
attention, Kenobi probably found some adventures

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.009
to be had on the desert world as he waited
for Luke to get old enough to start Jedi training.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.099
With rumors of an Obi-Wan standalone film
refusing to go away, fans may just get to

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.990
see what he was up to before the original
movie began.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.979
Where’s Lando?

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.919
Introduced in The Empire Strikes Back, Lando
Calrissian is a major player in the final

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.780
two installments of the original trilogy,
even helping destroy the second Death Star.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.170
It’s odd, then, that he seems to have no
presence in the new films.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.670
Lando does not appear in The Force Awakens
and isn’t even mentioned.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.139
To some fans, Lando is as important to the
franchise as Luke, Han, and Leia, and with

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.040
Episode VII playing catch up, it would have
been nice to know Lando’s state.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.910
Billy Dee Williams was not part of the recently
announced Episode 8 cast, so unless there’s

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.830
a surprise, his time in the war may be over
– without anyone knowing why.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.360

Wars mysteries.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.990
