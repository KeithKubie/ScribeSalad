00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.434
Langen: My name is Casey Langen.

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:03.601
I'm a software engineer
for amazon.com,

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.534
and I wrote the Amazon MP3
Store App for Android.

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.534
Let me show you how it works.

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:10.934
So you'll notice
on the home screen

00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.701
there's easy access
to all the major features.

00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:16.334
There are the Top 100 Albums,
Top 100 Songs.

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:17.634
These are updated hourly.

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.200
You can Browse by Genre
or you can Search,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.868
and Search is what I'll demo
for you today.

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:23.934
So I'm gonna tap
the Search button,

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.100
and I'm gonna select Hendrix.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.801
I wanna look at some
Jimi Hendrix albums.

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.567
I'm interested in purchasing
this Blues album,

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.000
so I'm going to tap it.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.567
I'll be presented with...

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.000
an album detail page

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.801
which contains all the tracks
on the album.

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:43.567
I can scroll around in here
and preview tracks in place.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.767
So I can just tap
Voodoo Chile Blues.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.467
[song playing]

00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:53.334
Okay, I like this song,

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:54.934
so I'm gonna go ahead
and purchase it.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:57.734
So I'm going to press
this price button.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:59.634
I will tap again to confirm.

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.133
As soon as the purchase
completes,

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.968
my downloads will be cued,

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:10.534
and I'll be presented
with this download screen.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:16.067
And as soon as this track
finishes downloading,

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:19.834
it'll be automatically added
to the music app.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.667
So...

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:31.067
Select Albums.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:32.934
Notice here's the Blues Album.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.901
And here's Voodoo Chile Blues.

00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:39.934
[song playing]

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.667
So that's how you use
the Amazon MP3 Store App.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.801
Amazon is really interested
in reaching as many people

00:01:47.801 --> 00:01:49.667
on as many different platforms
as possible,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.634
so the move to the mobile market
seemed very logical.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:54.234
Android made that really easy.

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:56.667
We used the Apache HTTP client

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.567
to download metadata
from our web services.

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:02.634
We use--make extensive use
of the ListView.

00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:04.567
In fact, I think
we use the ListView

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.501
in every activity
in our application.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.467
And we also use
the MediaPlayer quite a bit

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:12.167
for song previews.
