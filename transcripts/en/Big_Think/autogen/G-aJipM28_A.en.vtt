in these troubled times I hear well we
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779
in these troubled times I hear well we
need to educate the children we need to

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
need to educate the children we need to
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.610
need to educate the children we need to
get the young people interested in

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
get the young people interested in
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.850
get the young people interested in
global warming and in overpopulation and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
global warming and in overpopulation and
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.099
global warming and in overpopulation and
then in the troubling things in the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
then in the troubling things in the
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.830
then in the troubling things in the
world and then they'll fix it in their

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840
world and then they'll fix it in their
 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.820
world and then they'll fix it in their
time I don't believe that I believe that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
time I don't believe that I believe that
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.010
time I don't believe that I believe that
action needs to be taken now and the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
action needs to be taken now and the
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.270
action needs to be taken now and the
only thing stopping us from acting is

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280
only thing stopping us from acting is
 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.810
only thing stopping us from acting is
our basically we've given up on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
our basically we've given up on
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.719
our basically we've given up on
ourselves and we feel our time is over

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
ourselves and we feel our time is over
 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.380
ourselves and we feel our time is over
well it's not over the change could be

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
well it's not over the change could be
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.920
well it's not over the change could be
instantaneous and that is my philosophy

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
instantaneous and that is my philosophy
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.560
instantaneous and that is my philosophy
I I believe that I felt the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
I I believe that I felt the
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.770
I I believe that I felt the
instantaneous change that is that just

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
instantaneous change that is that just
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.130
instantaneous change that is that just
changing your mind and that's that's

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
changing your mind and that's that's
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.980
changing your mind and that's that's
what I try to do I try to change my mind

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
what I try to do I try to change my mind
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.789
what I try to do I try to change my mind
a lot and I try to change it back to its

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
a lot and I try to change it back to its
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.880
a lot and I try to change it back to its
original nature not a not a covering

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
original nature not a not a covering
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.600
original nature not a not a covering
over with reaction

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610
 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.730
sure I mean faith is an essential

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
sure I mean faith is an essential
 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.389
sure I mean faith is an essential
element of the yogic path since we are

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399
element of the yogic path since we are
 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.910
element of the yogic path since we are
dealing with a realm that is unseen

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920
dealing with a realm that is unseen
 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.990
dealing with a realm that is unseen
it depends to a large extent on faith on

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000
it depends to a large extent on faith on
 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.570
it depends to a large extent on faith on
the other hand the yogic techniques do

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580
the other hand the yogic techniques do
 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.809
the other hand the yogic techniques do
give you experiences that verify the

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819
give you experiences that verify the
 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.640
give you experiences that verify the
existence of these these unseen realms

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650
existence of these these unseen realms
 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.880
existence of these these unseen realms
so faith is important maybe at some

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890
so faith is important maybe at some
 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.190
so faith is important maybe at some
point religions have done well in the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200
point religions have done well in the
 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.100
point religions have done well in the
world but I think that that today

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110
 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.660
they've lost their usefulness and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670
they've lost their usefulness and
 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.240
they've lost their usefulness and
they've created many wars and

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250
they've created many wars and
 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.809
they've created many wars and
disturbances in the world and we need to

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819
disturbances in the world and we need to
 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.390
disturbances in the world and we need to
get back to the basics and that's why

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
get back to the basics and that's why
 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.160
get back to the basics and that's why
religions were created in the first

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
religions were created in the first
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.460
religions were created in the first
place not to control people but to give

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470
place not to control people but to give
 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.440
place not to control people but to give
people a way to exercise they their

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
people a way to exercise they their
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.830
people a way to exercise they their
inspiration and to become inspired to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840
inspiration and to become inspired to
 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.729
inspiration and to become inspired to
connect to each other to gather together

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
connect to each other to gather together
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.410
connect to each other to gather together
and to form political action groups and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420
and to form political action groups and
 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.140
and to form political action groups and
and community service groups I think

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
and community service groups I think
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.539
and community service groups I think
these are the good parts of organized

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549
these are the good parts of organized
 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.240
these are the good parts of organized
religions the bad parts are are the many

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250
religions the bad parts are are the many
 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.340
religions the bad parts are are the many
wars that are fought over religion and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350
wars that are fought over religion and
 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.610
wars that are fought over religion and
the and the disagreements that people

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620
the and the disagreements that people
 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.850
the and the disagreements that people
have over
