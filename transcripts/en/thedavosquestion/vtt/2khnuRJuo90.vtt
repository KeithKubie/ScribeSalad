00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.910
JULIA: The business day is coming to an end
at Davos and it's been

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.020
remarkable.
A few highlights:

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.460
"President Clinton, I'm campaigning against
female genital mutilation."

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.919
&gt;&gt;It's a great cause.
I'll follow up.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.150
Bless you.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.529
JULIA: My heart is going.
That was fantastic.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.180
He's promised to follow up.
He said it's a fantastic cause.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
And if I can get into the Clinton Initiative
that would be wonderful

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.470
and I think he will follow up, so that's great.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.470

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.230
JULIA: I had ten minutes with Klaus Schwab,
who is the founder of the

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.900
World Economic Forum.
Again, he was very much behind me bringing

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.619
this cause here.

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:59.019
&gt;&gt; First, I think in order to -- to solve
those issues, you need to

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:06.330
really to engage all statehoods.
And it's, of course, and your community, it's

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.110
business, it's politics,
it's the young global leaders, so that's one

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.620
necessity to really make
progress.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:22.050
JULIA: I met [INAUDIBLE] who is a personal
guru for me.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.310
And just to see him in the flesh, have him
shake my hand so warmly,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.470
it's amazing.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.490
&gt;&gt;So I am so glad when I saw the result.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.710
JULIA: A really inspirational meeting with
Jody Williams, who has won

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.030
the Noble Peace Price for her work on landmine
campaigns.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.550
&gt;&gt;If you are consistent and transparent, which
I never say anything in

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.070
secret.
I say whatever the hell I want.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.190
If people don't like it, tough.
Don't come listen to me, right?

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.080
But always transparent, always follow through
with what I said I was

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.550
going to do.
And even if they didn't like me, the opposition

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.590
in the military, they
respect me because they knew that I was a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.750
a person of my word.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.709
JULIA: Anthony Bell and the talked about global
health research just

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.570
how little data there is.
But also how little is known about the real

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.860
health impacts of FGM.
And lastly a couple of media interviews.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.870
CNN, Associated Press TV.
I spoke with the BBC, the Sunday Times.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.980
So a lot of coverage going on hopefully just
getting the word out and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.980
spreading it widely.
