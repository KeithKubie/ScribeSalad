whether project marble is having an
 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.770
whether project marble is having an
impact and it's also how we're gonna

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
impact and it's also how we're gonna
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.810

basically make sure that after project
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.640
basically make sure that after project
marble ends we're gonna hold the bar

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
marble ends we're gonna hold the bar
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.910
marble ends we're gonna hold the bar
really high and last but not least we

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
really high and last but not least we

used analytics to report problems to
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.449
used analytics to report problems to
ourselves so for example if Andra studio

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459
ourselves so for example if Andra studio

throws an exception if you've opted into
 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.670
throws an exception if you've opted into
analytics we will send that exception up

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680
analytics we will send that exception up
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.070
analytics we will send that exception up
to our server and then we have a

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080
to our server and then we have a
 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.199

these exceptions sort them such that we

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
these exceptions sort them such that we
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.090
these exceptions sort them such that we
not only fix the most important issues

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100
not only fix the most important issues
 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.590
not only fix the most important issues
but we can also spot if there's a

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600
but we can also spot if there's a
 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.190
but we can also spot if there's a
problem in a rollout of a new canary so

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200
problem in a rollout of a new canary so
 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.040
problem in a rollout of a new canary so
another issue with exceptions let's say

will grab a whole thread dump and upload

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770
will grab a whole thread dump and upload
 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.250
will grab a whole thread dump and upload
it to our server and then we can put in

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260
it to our server and then we can put in
 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.529
it to our server and then we can put in
this dashboard so here's an example when

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539
this dashboard so here's an example when
 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.230

I grab this the top freeze was on

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240
I grab this the top freeze was on
 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.560
I grab this the top freeze was on
average 14 seconds long and we have over

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570
average 14 seconds long and we have over
 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.800
average 14 seconds long and we have over
50,000 reports of that right so what we

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810
50,000 reports of that right so what we
 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.330
50,000 reports of that right so what we
could do now is to multiply those two

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340
could do now is to multiply those two
 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.029
could do now is to multiply those two
numbers together sort them and then we

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039
numbers together sort them and then we
 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.010
numbers together sort them and then we
can prioritize which UI freezes are

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020
can prioritize which UI freezes are
 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.260
can prioritize which UI freezes are
causing the most total wait time for our

causing the most total wait time for our
 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.830
causing the most total wait time for our
usage population so here's the little

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
usage population so here's the little
 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.439

this used to be extremely slow and we

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099
this used to be extremely slow and we
 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.159
this used to be extremely slow and we
fix that among with many other freezes

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169
fix that among with many other freezes
 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.730
fix that among with many other freezes
and we're not just spot fixing the UI

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740

of freezes we also built a JVM agent

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550
of freezes we also built a JVM agent
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.760

have a dashboard so whenever the IDE

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710
have a dashboard so whenever the IDE

runs out of memory we grab some

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199
runs out of memory we grab some
 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.260

is that studio requires a lot of it we

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300
is that studio requires a lot of it we

and so if you have a massive project it

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740
and so if you have a massive project it
 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.620
and so if you have a massive project it
might not fit but what if you have 32

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630

gigabytes of RAM that should be enough

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130
gigabytes of RAM that should be enough
 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.030
gigabytes of RAM that should be enough
right well it turns out that when studio

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040
right well it turns out that when studio
 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.910
right well it turns out that when studio
runs on the JVM its heap size is limited

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920
runs on the JVM its heap size is limited
 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.790
runs on the JVM its heap size is limited
to 1.2 gigabytes it does not

not how the JVM works so even on a 32

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380
not how the JVM works so even on a 32

we pick 1.2 we were afraid to make it
 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.990
we pick 1.2 we were afraid to make it
bigger because in that case studio won't

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000
bigger because in that case studio won't
 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.760

size project so a pro tip is that you
 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.300
size project so a pro tip is that you
can actually change the size of the heap

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310
can actually change the size of the heap
 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.850
can actually change the size of the heap
to give studio more memory where it'll

enough it will run out of memory

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580
enough it will run out of memory
 

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.960
enough it will run out of memory
eventually so it's been a top priority

out of memory how do we actually track

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060
out of memory how do we actually track
 

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.890
out of memory how do we actually track
down the culprit and we built a really

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:42.900
down the culprit and we built a really
 

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.650
down the culprit and we built a really
cool mechanism for that so if we can

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660
cool mechanism for that so if we can
 

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.570
cool mechanism for that so if we can
look at your heap we can find the leaks

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:47.580
look at your heap we can find the leaks
 

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.940
look at your heap we can find the leaks
but obviously we're not going to ask you

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:49.950
but obviously we're not going to ask you
 

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.820
but obviously we're not going to ask you
to send your whole heaps to us because

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:52.830
to send your whole heaps to us because
 

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.820
to send your whole heaps to us because
they're massive and B they contain a lot

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:55.830
they're massive and B they contain a lot
 

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.160
they're massive and B they contain a lot
of personal information think about it

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.170

it that's in the heap right so we don't

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420
it that's in the heap right so we don't
 

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.380
it that's in the heap right so we don't
want the heat so what we do instead is

nearly running out of memory and it's
 

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.710
nearly running out of memory and it's
not functional anymore well then we grab

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720
not functional anymore well then we grab
 

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.900
not functional anymore well then we grab
a heap dump and we store it on your

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:14.910
a heap dump and we store it on your
 

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.530
a heap dump and we store it on your
machine then next time you start studio

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:18.540

we optionally run an analysis on that

00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:21.089
we optionally run an analysis on that
 

00:09:21.089 --> 00:09:23.420
we optionally run an analysis on that
heat file we generate a report and then

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:23.430
heat file we generate a report and then
 

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.699
heat file we generate a report and then
we delete the heat file and so the

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:25.709
we delete the heat file and so the
 

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:27.740
we delete the heat file and so the
report file does not have anything

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:27.750
report file does not have anything
 

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.840
report file does not have anything
personal in it it's just a plain text

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:29.850
personal in it it's just a plain text
 

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.410
personal in it it's just a plain text
file which lists likely leaks that we've

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420

found now you can scroll through the

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339
found now you can scroll through the
 

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:36.620
found now you can scroll through the
whole thing and convince yourself

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:36.630
whole thing and convince yourself
 

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.230
whole thing and convince yourself
there's nothing personal there and

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240
there's nothing personal there and
 

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.400
there's nothing personal there and
hopefully you'll click the send button

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.410
hopefully you'll click the send button
 

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.740
hopefully you'll click the send button
at the end to upload it to our servers

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:42.750
at the end to upload it to our servers
 

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.199
at the end to upload it to our servers
and so we shipped this facility in 3-5

00:09:45.199 --> 00:09:45.209
and so we shipped this facility in 3-5
 

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:48.230
and so we shipped this facility in 3-5
canary and it's been incredibly valuable

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240
canary and it's been incredibly valuable
 

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.870
canary and it's been incredibly valuable
we have found tons of leaks that way

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880
we have found tons of leaks that way
 

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.150
we have found tons of leaks that way
that we have fixed and actually the

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160
that we have fixed and actually the
 

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.190
that we have fixed and actually the
first couple of leaked reports we got

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200
first couple of leaked reports we got
 

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.410
first couple of leaked reports we got
had a big leak from a popular

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420
had a big leak from a popular
 

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.650
had a big leak from a popular
third-party plugin and so we grabbed the

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660
third-party plugin and so we grabbed the
 

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.780
third-party plugin and so we grabbed the
details and we sent it as a bug report

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:02.790
details and we sent it as a bug report
 

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.819
details and we sent it as a bug report
to that plugin developer and they let us

00:10:04.819 --> 00:10:04.829
to that plugin developer and they let us
 

00:10:04.829 --> 00:10:06.170
to that plugin developer and they let us
know that they had heard about this leak

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180
know that they had heard about this leak
 

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.490
know that they had heard about this leak
for years but had never tracked it down

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500
for years but had never tracked it down
 

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.220
for years but had never tracked it down
but armed with our bug report they fixed

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:10.230
but armed with our bug report they fixed
 

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.240
but armed with our bug report they fixed
it within 24 hours

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.250
it within 24 hours
 

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.420
it within 24 hours
so having Clyde side leak analysis is

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.430
so having Clyde side leak analysis is
 

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.980
so having Clyde side leak analysis is
incredibly valuable because it doesn't

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:15.990
incredibly valuable because it doesn't
 

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.019
incredibly valuable because it doesn't
just find leaks in our code that we test

00:10:18.019 --> 00:10:18.029
just find leaks in our code that we test
 

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:19.940
just find leaks in our code that we test
and ship it finds it in all the plugins

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:19.950
and ship it finds it in all the plugins
 

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.050
and ship it finds it in all the plugins
you're using so it brings the whole

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060
you're using so it brings the whole
 

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:27.079
you're using so it brings the whole
plug-in ecosystem forward but so while

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:27.089
plug-in ecosystem forward but so while
 

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:29.990
plug-in ecosystem forward but so while
reacting to leak reports is great it's

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000
reacting to leak reports is great it's
 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.090
reacting to leak reports is great it's
not awesome because that means that

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100
not awesome because that means that
 

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.040
not awesome because that means that
we've already shipped a leak and

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.050
we've already shipped a leak and
 

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.680
we've already shipped a leak and
negatively affected many of you so

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:36.690
negatively affected many of you so
 

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.000
negatively affected many of you so
another thing we've done recently which

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.010
another thing we've done recently which
 

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.650
another thing we've done recently which
is really promising is we've implemented

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:39.660
is really promising is we've implemented
 

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.550
is really promising is we've implemented
a new test runner this runs our test in

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560
a new test runner this runs our test in
 

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.069
a new test runner this runs our test in
a special way iteratively and it grabs

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079
a special way iteratively and it grabs
 

00:10:46.079 --> 00:10:48.889
a special way iteratively and it grabs
heap snapshots between each run and then

00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:48.899
heap snapshots between each run and then
 

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:50.449
heap snapshots between each run and then
it does some comparisons and it can

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459
it does some comparisons and it can
 

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:53.480
it does some comparisons and it can
automatically find leaks so this

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:53.490
automatically find leaks so this
 

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.630
automatically find leaks so this
recently caught a massive memory leak

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640
recently caught a massive memory leak
 

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.490
recently caught a massive memory leak
this is a real screen shot from our

00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500
this is a real screen shot from our
 

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.880
this is a real screen shot from our
build server it found this leak

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:01.890
build server it found this leak
 

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.040
build server it found this leak
automatically and it was a really tricky

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:04.050
automatically and it was a really tricky
 

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.540
automatically and it was a really tricky
leak so this would have

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:05.550
leak so this would have
 

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.460
leak so this would have
if we haven't had this but thankfully

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.470
if we haven't had this but thankfully
 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.970
if we haven't had this but thankfully

you're on battery when the system image
is on battery it turns off most

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:45.970
is on battery it turns off most

fix but that made the screen saver kick

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:49.780
fix but that made the screen saver kick
 

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.180
fix but that made the screen saver kick

so we had to fix that as well a second

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000
so we had to fix that as well a second
 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.390

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.590
the next word but it turns out that
actually worked in the emulator and

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600
actually worked in the emulator and
 

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.850
actually worked in the emulator and
there's no hardware support for

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:08.860
there's no hardware support for
 

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.470
there's no hardware support for
listening to the hot word there so the

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480
listening to the hot word there so the
 

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.320
listening to the hot word there so the
the CPU was busy listening for the hot

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:13.330
the CPU was busy listening for the hot
 

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.320
the CPU was busy listening for the hot
word that was expensive and it's I think

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:16.330
word that was expensive and it's I think
 

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.880
word that was expensive and it's I think
it's kind of cool that it worked but

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:17.890
it's kind of cool that it worked but
 

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.900
it's kind of cool that it worked but
that was not on purpose

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:18.910
that was not on purpose
 

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.320
that was not on purpose
so you know we fixed this by turning off

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:22.330
so you know we fixed this by turning off
 

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.940
so you know we fixed this by turning off
the microphone by default if your app

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:23.950
the microphone by default if your app
 

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.300
the microphone by default if your app
needs it you could turn it back on so a

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:27.310
needs it you could turn it back on so a
 

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.880
needs it you could turn it back on so a
big part of project marble was fixing

the second area we work on was fixing
 

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.639
the second area we work on was fixing
features that aren't working so well so

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:36.649
features that aren't working so well so
 

00:15:36.649 --> 00:15:39.100
features that aren't working so well so
we're calling that polish on this slide

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:39.110
we're calling that polish on this slide
 

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.569
we're calling that polish on this slide
but that might give you the wrong

also limited it to work for Android Oreo

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.290
also limited it to work for Android Oreo
 

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.980
also limited it to work for Android Oreo
and above and that led us remove a bunch

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:26.990
and above and that led us remove a bunch
 

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.050

of hacks that we have added that we had

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:29.060
of hacks that we have added that we had
 

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.150
of hacks that we have added that we had
added an instant run to work on dalvik

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160
added an instant run to work on dalvik
 

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.879
added an instant run to work on dalvik

hot-swap code so before we would rewrite

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:42.410
hot-swap code so before we would rewrite

all your bytecode up front we would you

00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839
all your bytecode up front we would you
 

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:47.019
all your bytecode up front we would you
know have to insert hooks into your byte

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:47.029

that made clean builds much slower if
 

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.170
that made clean builds much slower if
you got instant run on and worse it

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.180
you got instant run on and worse it
 

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.120

so some users would turn on instant run

00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:02.209
so some users would turn on instant run
 

00:17:02.209 --> 00:17:04.090
so some users would turn on instant run
and they couldn't build anymore well

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:04.100

to what you would do without apply
 

00:17:13.459 --> 00:17:18.640
to what you would do without apply
changes and so now we use hot swap

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:18.650
changes and so now we use hot swap
 

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.110

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.580
next thing to talk about is around
resources so and I know for many of you

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:50.590
resources so and I know for many of you
 

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.990
resources so and I know for many of you
you have a lot of a lot of resources in

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000
you have a lot of a lot of resources in
 

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.670
you have a lot of a lot of resources in
your app projects and the problem today

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:53.680
your app projects and the problem today
 

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.140
your app projects and the problem today
is that if you want to understand what

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:55.150
is that if you want to understand what
 

00:29:55.150 --> 00:29:56.460
is that if you want to understand what
these assets are get that double-click

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:56.470
these assets are get that double-click
 

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.320
these assets are get that double-click
on all of these assets which is not that

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:58.330
on all of these assets which is not that
 

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.800
on all of these assets which is not that
great so we added in Android studio 3.4

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:01.810
great so we added in Android studio 3.4
 

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.210
great so we added in Android studio 3.4
is a new resource manager so by the

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:06.220
is a new resource manager so by the
 

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.280
is a new resource manager so by the
module type actually now I can see

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:08.290
module type actually now I can see
 

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.630
module type actually now I can see
visualizations of all the different

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640
visualizations of all the different
 

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.760
visualizations of all the different
assets both in a list view and a grid

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:11.770
assets both in a list view and a grid
 

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.509
assets both in a list view and a grid
view and see how they all work and

00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519
view and see how they all work and
 

00:30:14.519 --> 00:30:16.159
view and see how they all work and
and of course if you had a MIT map for

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:16.169
and of course if you had a MIT map for
 

00:30:16.169 --> 00:30:18.740
and of course if you had a MIT map for
instance I can look at the MIT map drill

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:18.750
instance I can look at the MIT map drill
 

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.330
instance I can look at the MIT map drill
into the assets and see all the various

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340
into the assets and see all the various
 

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.129
into the assets and see all the various
densities of my application so one other

00:30:25.129 --> 00:30:25.139
densities of my application so one other
 

00:30:25.139 --> 00:30:27.169
densities of my application so one other
pain point we're addressing is that many

00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179
pain point we're addressing is that many
 

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:28.580
pain point we're addressing is that many
times you have a design team giving you

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:28.590
times you have a design team giving you
 

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.649
times you have a design team giving you
updates to your application me times

00:30:30.649 --> 00:30:30.659
updates to your application me times
 

00:30:30.659 --> 00:30:33.379
updates to your application me times
let's say a bulk file of SDG files so in

00:30:33.379 --> 00:30:33.389
let's say a bulk file of SDG files so in
 

00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:35.450
let's say a bulk file of SDG files so in
the past would have to individually

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460
the past would have to individually
 

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.639
the past would have to individually
update each s e-g file and convert them

00:30:37.639 --> 00:30:37.649
update each s e-g file and convert them
 

00:30:37.649 --> 00:30:39.529
update each s e-g file and convert them
to a vector drawable you solved that

00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539
to a vector drawable you solved that
 

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:41.509
to a vector drawable you solved that
problem so now if you click this plus

00:30:41.509 --> 00:30:41.519
problem so now if you click this plus
 

00:30:41.519 --> 00:30:43.879
problem so now if you click this plus
button here and go to import drawables

00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:43.889
button here and go to import drawables
 

00:30:43.889 --> 00:30:47.240
button here and go to import drawables
and here I have a folder of s s e-g

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:47.250
and here I have a folder of s s e-g
 

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.659
and here I have a folder of s s e-g
assets let me come to this parent folder

00:30:49.659 --> 00:30:49.669
assets let me come to this parent folder
 

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:51.620
assets let me come to this parent folder
and we just let the folder here and

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:51.630
and we just let the folder here and
 

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.409
and we just let the folder here and
import this entire folder and boom and

00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419
import this entire folder and boom and
 

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.419
import this entire folder and boom and
here we have this asset wizard allows

00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:56.429
here we have this asset wizard allows
 

00:30:56.429 --> 00:30:58.850
here we have this asset wizard allows
you to import all these assets and as

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860
you to import all these assets and as
 

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.889
you to import all these assets and as
does a couple different things it checks

00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899
does a couple different things it checks
 

00:31:00.899 --> 00:31:03.980
does a couple different things it checks
for syntax of all the file assets so for

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:03.990
for syntax of all the file assets so for
 

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:09.169
for syntax of all the file assets so for
example here it looks like we have the

00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:09.179
example here it looks like we have the
 

00:31:09.179 --> 00:31:11.240
example here it looks like we have the
extra import asset here so this one has

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:11.250
extra import asset here so this one has
 

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.919
extra import asset here so this one has
an extra input import so we can actually

00:31:12.919 --> 00:31:12.929
an extra input import so we can actually
 

00:31:12.929 --> 00:31:15.560
an extra input import so we can actually
move this one and it looks we can also

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:15.570
move this one and it looks we can also
 

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.299
move this one and it looks we can also
have a syntax error here so connection

00:31:17.299 --> 00:31:17.309
have a syntax error here so connection
 

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:18.919
have a syntax error here so connection
with this from a uppercase G to

00:31:18.919 --> 00:31:18.929
with this from a uppercase G to
 

00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:22.940
with this from a uppercase G to
lowercase G I press the import and boom

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:22.950
lowercase G I press the import and boom
 

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.500
lowercase G I press the import and boom
here all the assets convert it from

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:24.510
here all the assets convert it from
 

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:27.200
here all the assets convert it from

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.760
 
now another great thing about this is

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:34.770
now another great thing about this is
 

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.350
now another great thing about this is
the panel is actually pretty interactive

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360
the panel is actually pretty interactive
 

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.420
the panel is actually pretty interactive
so actually you can I can drag and drop

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:38.430
so actually you can I can drag and drop
 

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.240
so actually you can I can drag and drop
these assets onto any arbitrary XML file

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.250
these assets onto any arbitrary XML file
 

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.480
these assets onto any arbitrary XML file
and see it visualized here as well now

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:44.490
and see it visualized here as well now
 

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:45.620
and see it visualized here as well now
let's say if you actually want to want

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:45.630
let's say if you actually want to want
 

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.720
let's say if you actually want to want
to edit these files in XML no problem

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:47.730
to edit these files in XML no problem
 

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.840
to edit these files in XML no problem
all I got to do is go back to the XML

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:50.850
all I got to do is go back to the XML
 

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:52.580
all I got to do is go back to the XML
view of this application go back to my

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:52.590
view of this application go back to my
 

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:55.670
view of this application go back to my
assets I can highlight the asset move it

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:55.680
assets I can highlight the asset move it
 

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.380
assets I can highlight the asset move it
right over to the XML attribute I want

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:57.390
right over to the XML attribute I want
 

00:31:57.390 --> 00:31:59.690
right over to the XML attribute I want
to update drop it on there it updates

00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700
to update drop it on there it updates
 

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:04.580
to update drop it on there it updates
that and there's the asset updated the

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:04.590
that and there's the asset updated the
 

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:13.450
that and there's the asset updated the
asset updated in real time there we go

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:13.460
 
 

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.620
 
alright the last I talked about in in

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:15.630
alright the last I talked about in in
 

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.720
alright the last I talked about in in
this version is an update to the project

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:17.730
this version is an update to the project
 

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.790
this version is an update to the project
structure dialog box so this is sort

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:19.800
structure dialog box so this is sort
 

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.260
structure dialog box so this is sort
people who do not like editing Grado

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:21.270
people who do not like editing Grado
 

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:24.170
people who do not like editing Grado
files so what you can see here is a list

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:24.180
files so what you can see here is a list
 

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.210
files so what you can see here is a list
of all your dependencies and modules and

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220
of all your dependencies and modules and
 

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.410
of all your dependencies and modules and
what's pretty cool about this is I can

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:27.420
what's pretty cool about this is I can
 

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.480
what's pretty cool about this is I can
click on all different modules see all

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:29.490
click on all different modules see all
 

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.040
click on all different modules see all
resolve dependencies and find any

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.050
resolve dependencies and find any
 

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.290
resolve dependencies and find any
conflicts and lastly we have a

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:33.300
conflicts and lastly we have a
 

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.510
conflicts and lastly we have a
suggestions panel so if there's any sort

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:35.520
suggestions panel so if there's any sort
 

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.160
suggestions panel so if there's any sort
of updates or any kind of insert

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.170
of updates or any kind of insert
 

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:38.960
of updates or any kind of insert
conflicts we have it all consolidated

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:38.970
conflicts we have it all consolidated
 

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.210
conflicts we have it all consolidated
into one view and so it's a few clicks I

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:41.220
into one view and so it's a few clicks I
 

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.860
into one view and so it's a few clicks I
can update my Gradle file without ever

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:42.870
can update my Gradle file without ever
 

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.960
can update my Gradle file without ever
having to update and manually edit my

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:44.970
having to update and manually edit my
 

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:51.580
having to update and manually edit my
build our Gradle file so pretty cool

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:51.590
 
 

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.170
 
so next I want to talk about is motion

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:54.180
so next I want to talk about is motion
 

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.960
so next I want to talk about is motion
layout so motion layout is actually

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:55.970
layout so motion layout is actually
 

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.480
layout so motion layout is actually
reaching beta status say this week but

00:32:59.480 --> 00:32:59.490
reaching beta status say this week but
 

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.250
reaching beta status say this week but
motion and elet layout is a pretty cool

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260
motion and elet layout is a pretty cool
 

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.390
motion and elet layout is a pretty cool
feature if you have not used it

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:02.400
feature if you have not used it
 

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.610
feature if you have not used it
basically it builds on top of constraint

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620
basically it builds on top of constraint
 

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.800
basically it builds on top of constraint
layout in motion layout allows you to

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:06.810
layout in motion layout allows you to
 

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.630
layout in motion layout allows you to
have motion and move elements on the

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640
have motion and move elements on the
 

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.820
have motion and move elements on the
screen and it contains two components

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:10.830
screen and it contains two components
 

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.070
screen and it contains two components
one you have this motion layout file

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:13.080
one you have this motion layout file
 

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.290
one you have this motion layout file
that describes how all the elements are

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:15.300
that describes how all the elements are
 

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.600
that describes how all the elements are
described in a layout the next style you

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:17.610
described in a layout the next style you
 

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:19.370
described in a layout the next style you
have is called a scene file and the

00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380
have is called a scene file and the
 

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.020
have is called a scene file and the
scene file describes how all the

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.030
scene file describes how all the
 

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.120
scene file describes how all the
elements move across the screen over

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:23.130
elements move across the screen over
 

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.150
elements move across the screen over
time now it's not too difficult to edit

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:26.160
time now it's not too difficult to edit
 

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.100
time now it's not too difficult to edit
these files in XML but it's not the

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.110
these files in XML but it's not the
 

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.950
these files in XML but it's not the
simplest thing so we're working on after

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960
simplest thing so we're working on after
 

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.700
simplest thing so we're working on after
project marble after is a editor for

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:34.710
project marble after is a editor for
 

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:36.410
project marble after is a editor for
this so here's my app that I'm working

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:36.420
this so here's my app that I'm working
 

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.180
this so here's my app that I'm working
on and if I can click on one of the

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:38.190
on and if I can click on one of the
 

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.100
on and if I can click on one of the
components in the tree here we now open

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:40.110
components in the tree here we now open
 

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:42.710
components in the tree here we now open
up a new timeline view and so what's

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720
up a new timeline view and so what's
 

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.330
up a new timeline view and so what's
cool about this is I can see both my

cool about this is I can see both my
 

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.960
cool about this is I can see both my
start state my in state but also I can

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:47.970
start state my in state but also I can
 

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.400
start state my in state but also I can
scrub through all the various states of

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:49.410
scrub through all the various states of
 

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.920

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:53.130
to see how the animations going to work
 

00:33:53.130 --> 00:34:01.060
to see how the animations going to work
over time so pretty cool

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.070
 
 

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.680
