00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.509
Angel: Hi, YouTube. This is Angel Gurria,
Secretary-General of the Organization for

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.529
Economic Co-operation and Development the
OECE.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.529
[Pause]

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:19.441
&gt;&gt; Ok, so the question is do you feel that
the environment will lose out to the economy

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.441
in 2009.

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:26.039
Angel: The environment should not, must not,
and I'm doing everything that I can so that

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.740
it will not lose to the recession, to the
economy.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.590
There are some things we have to tackle immediately.
We have to tackle the banks, the stability.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.730
They have to lend again those packages of
stimulus in order to get the economy working

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.890
again.
But we cannot forget the medium and the long

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.080
term issues.
The climate change, the poverty, the [inaudible]

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.300
round, we have to close that.
And by the way, we may be in better shape

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.260
than we think, because many of these stimulus
packages have a big content that is supposed

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.590
to be a green.
That creates jobs, but also green jobs, green

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.979
investments.
So we should make sure that the green content

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.380
is as much as we can get in it.
