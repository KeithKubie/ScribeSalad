00:00:08.786 --> 00:00:12.646
With his harebrained schemes 
and asinine dealings with the gods,

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:18.938
King Midas ruled the ancient kingdom 
of Phrygia with an uneven hand.

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:22.546
He was known in Greek mythology 
as a rogue ruler

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:27.127
whose antics bemused his people 
and distracted the gods.

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:30.357
Midas spent his days 
in a stupor of splendor,

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:37.477
spoiling himself and his beloved daughter
and gorging himself on feasts and wine.

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:40.856
Unsurprisingly, he felt 
an affinity with Dionysus,

00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:48.166
god of wine, carnival, and performance.

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:51.032
One day, Midas discovered a satyr

00:00:51.032 --> 00:00:56.274
dozing in his rose garden and drunk 
on more than the scent of flowers.

00:00:56.274 --> 00:01:00.313
Midas recognized the satyr 
as one of Dionysus’s followers

00:01:00.313 --> 00:01:04.922
and let him nurse 
his hangover at the palace.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:10.083
Pleased with the king’s hospitality,
Dionysus offered to grant him one wish.

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:13.442
Midas cast a greedy eye 
over his surroundings.

00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:15.781
Despite the luxury in which he lived,

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:22.302
no amount of precious jewels, finest silk 
or splendid decor felt like enough.

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:28.333
His life, he thought, was lacking luster;
what he needed was more gold.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:32.773
The god sent the power to turn anything
the king touched to gold

00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:34.833
surging through Midas.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.714
Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions.

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:41.954
At his lightest touch, 
the palace walls transformed,

00:01:41.954 --> 00:01:44.352
stone statues shone,

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:47.292
and goblets glittered.

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.652
He galloped through his home in a frenzy,

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:54.628
handling each item until 
it took on a lustrous sheen.

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:56.693
Soon the palace heaved with gold,

00:01:56.693 --> 00:02:02.192
and Midas’s delirious
laughter echoed off the walls.

00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:04.500
Exhausted and hungry from his rampage,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.251
Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from 
his newly gilded fruit bowl.

00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:11.362
But he nearly shattered his teeth,

00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:14.850
for the fruit had turned 
to metal in his mouth.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.292
When he picked up a loaf of bread, 
the crumbs hardened in his hand.

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:22.063
Flinging himself onto 
his bed in frustration,

00:02:22.063 --> 00:02:27.721
Midas discovered his plush pillows 
had morphed into solid gold.

00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:32.044
Hearing his cries of frustration, 
his daughter entered the room.

00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:33.934
But when Midas reached out to her,

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:39.103
he saw with horror that he had frozen her 
into a golden statue.

00:02:39.103 --> 00:02:40.942
Horrified at what he had done,

00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:45.152
Midas begged the gods 
to rid him of his power.

00:02:45.152 --> 00:02:47.032
Taking pity on the foolish king,

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:51.883
Dionysus told Midas to wash 
his hands in the River Pactolus.

00:02:51.883 --> 00:02:57.165
When Midas reached into the river, 
the gold drained from his fingertips.

00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:00.353
Midas returned home 
to find his daughter alive

00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:04.693
and his palace back to normal, 
and he rejoiced.

00:03:04.693 --> 00:03:06.742
You’d think he would’ve learned 
his lesson,

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:10.773
but just a few weeks later,
Midas blundered again,

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:17.122
insulting the music and sun god Apollo 
when he declared Pan a greater musician.

00:03:17.122 --> 00:03:21.172
Apollo scornfully declared that the king 
must have the ears of an ass

00:03:21.172 --> 00:03:27.114
to make such a misjudgment,
and transformed Midas accordingly.

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:29.092
Once again regretting his behavior,

00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:33.201
Midas kept his hairy ears 
hidden in public.

00:03:33.201 --> 00:03:35.341
They were seen only by his barber,

00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:40.392
who was sworn to secrecy during 
a very awkward grooming session.

00:03:40.392 --> 00:03:44.093
The barber stifled his laughter 
and fought the desire to tell someone,

00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:47.522
yet the secret consumed him.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:52.223
One day, he walked outside the city 
and dug a hole in the ground.

00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:54.064
Plunging his head into the earth,

00:03:54.064 --> 00:04:00.391
the desperate barber whispered,
“Midas has ass’s ears.”

00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:03.061
Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:06.171
in the spot where the barber 
had buried his words.

00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:10.982
When the wind blew, they carried the 
echoes of his whisper through the breeze:

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:16.482
"Midas has ass’s ears."

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:20.691
At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised
their heads in recognition

00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:25.423
and people chuckled to themselves 
at the follies of their king.

00:04:25.423 --> 00:04:31.333
With his golden touch and ass’s ears, 
Midas was not the most respected ruler.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:34.821
And where other leaders were honored 
through statues and temples,

00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:38.510
his people remembered him 
a little differently:

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.312
in the depths of the glittering river 
and the rustle of the Phrygian wind.
