uh but what the more popular one seems
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100
uh but what the more popular one seems
to be blind because I do think of why I

to be blind because I do think of why I
 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.560
to be blind because I do think of why I
think of daredevil I think of quest for

twice do you see him wave the stick
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160
twice do you see him wave the stick
around as if he can't see but other than

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
around as if he can't see but other than
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749
around as if he can't see but other than
that if no one ever told you he was

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
that if no one ever told you he was
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.760
that if no one ever told you he was
blind you wouldn't even connect that he

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
blind you wouldn't even connect that he
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.270

that's my bed sorry um so what I like
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300
that's my bed sorry um so what I like
about this is that actually gives an

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
about this is that actually gives an
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.910
about this is that actually gives an
explanation of how she can accommodate

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
explanation of how she can accommodate
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550
explanation of how she can accommodate
for this that the earthbending she's so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
for this that the earthbending she's so
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.290
for this that the earthbending she's so
good at earthbending that she can

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
good at earthbending that she can
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.559
actually sense where people are where
things

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
things
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.410
things
are and the blindness actually helps

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
are and the blindness actually helps
 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.379
are and the blindness actually helps
advance her earthbending skill so they

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:19.389
advance her earthbending skill so they
 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.030
advance her earthbending skill so they
feed into each other I thought that was

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040
feed into each other I thought that was
 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.270
feed into each other I thought that was
very smart um and a lot of these other I

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
very smart um and a lot of these other I
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.160
very smart um and a lot of these other I
think like daredevil you know does

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170
think like daredevil you know does
 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.739
think like daredevil you know does
explain how he can see better and such

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:28.749
explain how he can see better and such
 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:33.330
explain how he can see better and such
but I really like how they do give an

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340
but I really like how they do give an
 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.619
but I really like how they do give an
explanation cuz I have seen other

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629
explanation cuz I have seen other
 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.910
explanation cuz I have seen other
examples they're not coming to my head

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920
examples they're not coming to my head
 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.500
examples they're not coming to my head
but I have seen other examples where

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510
but I have seen other examples where
 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.270
but I have seen other examples where
they make them blind but it's almost

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280
they make them blind but it's almost
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.179
they make them blind but it's almost
pointless because they're so good at not

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189
pointless because they're so good at not
 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.050
pointless because they're so good at not
being blind

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060
being blind
 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.300
being blind
you know and I've known blind people and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310
you know and I've known blind people and
 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.580
you know and I've known blind people and
I mean I've seen them do stuff that you

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
I mean I've seen them do stuff that you
 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.500
I mean I've seen them do stuff that you
just won normally think of blind person

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510
just won normally think of blind person
 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.080
just won normally think of blind person
can do it but they're still blind so I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
can do it but they're still blind so I
 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.580
can do it but they're still blind so I
really like the fact that they do

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590
really like the fact that they do
 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.770
really like the fact that they do
account for that for example at the end

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780
account for that for example at the end
 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.140
account for that for example at the end
I think Sokka throws the belt at her and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150
I think Sokka throws the belt at her and
 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.959
I think Sokka throws the belt at her and
because it's not on the ground she

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969
because it's not on the ground she
 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.939
because it's not on the ground she
doesn't see it in it or on the head you

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:02.949
doesn't see it in it or on the head you
 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.099
doesn't see it in it or on the head you
know that's and that's okay because

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109
know that's and that's okay because
 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.220
know that's and that's okay because
obviously she accommodates for that in

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
obviously she accommodates for that in
 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.020
obviously she accommodates for that in
up in Chile another way she's like the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030
up in Chile another way she's like the
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.759
up in Chile another way she's like the
best earthbenders on the show so uh so

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769
best earthbenders on the show so uh so
 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.009
best earthbenders on the show so uh so
that's good I like to see I guess here

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019
that's good I like to see I guess here
 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.780
that's good I like to see I guess here
we go with the character because as of

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790
we go with the character because as of
 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.229
we go with the character because as of
now it's it's not a bad character but I

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239
now it's it's not a bad character but I
 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.860
now it's it's not a bad character but I
mean so far it's just one episode in but

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870
mean so far it's just one episode in but
 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.309
mean so far it's just one episode in but
I don't see her as good as say Katara or

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319
I don't see her as good as say Katara or
 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.330
I don't see her as good as say Katara or
soccer or Zuko or Azula uh so I'd like

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
soccer or Zuko or Azula uh so I'd like
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.099
soccer or Zuko or Azula uh so I'd like
to see what they do with her because

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109
to see what they do with her because
 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.740
to see what they do with her because
right now it's they obviously got her

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750
right now it's they obviously got her
 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.159
right now it's they obviously got her
backstory and that she's a little

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.169
backstory and that she's a little
 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.119
backstory and that she's a little
resistant to wanting to leave she

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129
resistant to wanting to leave she
