00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.279
Your brain needs a LOT of energy to function.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:08.050
Despite the fact that the average adult brain
is only about 2% of your total body mass,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.269
it uses a full 20% of the energy you spend
while at rest.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.109
To keep all your brain functions going, neurons
-- the cells that make up the brain -- have

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.660
to constantly be at the ready, and that’s
no easy task.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.010
Your brain has about 86 billion neurons that
are interconnected at a hundred trillion to

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.550
a quadrillion synapses.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.009
When you’re thinking, your neurons are shooting
messages back and forth across your brain…

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.690
the cells are “firing.”

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.130
And because someone could jump out and scare
you at any time, they have to be ready to

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.320
fire at a moment’s notice.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.469
One study found that the firing of neurons
uses about two thirds of your brain’s energy.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.420
And now scientists have found out how brain
cells recharge and fire!

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.270
Turns out they operate much the same way your
muscle cells do when you’re exercising.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.039
Both neurons and muscles need glucose, a simple
form of sugar, to function.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.310
In order to get more glucose, they activate
a protein called Glut4 which lives inside

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.310
our cells.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.189
As you start thinking hard, extra Glut4 moves
to the surface of the cell membranes.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.609
As I understand it, the Glut4 is sort of like
a neuron is sticking little fishing nets into

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.369
the bloodstream to grab glucose.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.340
Once the nets are out there, they just keep
grabbing more fuel allowing our brain cells

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.079
to burn the midnight oil.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.789
Once it grabs onto the glucose, it can use
it to send messages and keep you thinking.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.920
The common misconception that your neurons
are firing electricity from one cell to the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.509
next is a bit misleading.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.040
It’s not like the electricity in your home.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.719
Instead, your brain’s electrical signals
come from charged molecules, called ions.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.200
The charge propagates down the length of a
nerve cell membrane, like doing the wave at

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.429
a hockey game.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.489
When it reaches the end of the cell, the electrical
signal is converted into a chemical signal.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:53.850
The chemicals are collectively called neurotransmitters,
which allow the cells to talk to each other.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.829
The neurotransmitters are stored in little
containers across the neuron called vesicles.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.430
Neurons can have hundreds, to hundreds of
thousands, of vesicles… all to make sure

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.590
the messages it wants to send get out safely.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.179
Okay, so, this is the cool part.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.819
Once a neuron is ready to talk to it’s neighbor,
it releases an ion via these chemicals,* and

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.740
throws it into the synaptic gap -- the space
between neurons.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.939
And then BAM.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:35.879
The ion is grabbed by the next neuron in the
chain, and the game of brain telephone continues.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.480
All of this activity is powered by a molecule
called Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP, which

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.019
is generated by mitochondria, the powerhouse
of the cell.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.049
And what does mitochondria burn?

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.510
GLUCOSE, baby.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.299
So, Glut4 grabs some glucose, pulls it into
the cell, gives it to the mitochondria, which

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.160
converts it to ATP so that we can send charged
ions through neurotransmitters to the next

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160
cell.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.180
And this happens again and again and again.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.879
It’s happening in your brain right now while
you’re watching this.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.430
Or, if that’s confusing, just remember.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.499
Our brain runs on basically sugar, just like
muscles.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.609
And also like muscles, if you’re low on
sugar, it makes it hard for your brain to

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:14.640
work.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.330
It seems like the optimal amount of sugar
for your brain is about 25 grams of glucose

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.060
floating in the bloodstream.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.499
For scale, that’s about as much as you find
in a banana.

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:28.810
So if you’re ever in a fog, take a break,
have a bite, and let your thinky meat recover.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.239
So more glucose doesn’t mean more better,
but what about electricity?

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.079
Would giving my brain a little jolt kick things
into overdrive?

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.599
Julia tackles that super insane idea here.

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.339
Have you noticed your brain runs differently
when you haven’t eaten?

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.969
I've definitely noticed this.

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.629
