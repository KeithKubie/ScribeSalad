00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.370
&gt;&gt; Nicole Chung: Good afternoon.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm Nicole Chung with the
"Washington Post" Book World,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.270
and the "Washington Post"

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.740
First a word of thanks to the
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.370
David Rubenstein and other
generous sponsors who've made

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.250
this event possible.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.210

and I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.650
who is an amazing
lovely wonderful author

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.150
who writes primarily
young adult fantasy

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.250
and historical fiction novels.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.620

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.190
the "Mark of the Thief" series,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.370
and her historical
fiction "Resistance."

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.860
Without much further
ado, Jennifer Nielsen.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
All right.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.070
How is everybody today?

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.370
All right.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.120
If you're enjoying the
festival, then yeah.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.510
This is incredible.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.810
This is incredible.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.110
Thank you for being here.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.650
I am here too.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.090
My name is Jennifer Nielsen.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.490
I'm going to talk a
little bit about --

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.360
These are some of the books
that I've done, but I'm going

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.100
to talk specifically
about "Resistance" here.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.510
This is my newest book.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.220
It's also here, but
that's bigger.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.990
So for "Resistance" let me start

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.370
with where I discovered
this story.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.840
A couple of years ago I
took a trip to Poland,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.350
and we visited the Jewish
cemetery which is here.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.830
The Jewish cemetery
was a very profound,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.730
very sacred feeling sort
of space, but there was one

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.460
of the gravestones in
particular that caught my eye.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580
It was this one.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.660
Now as you look at it
carefully, you're going to see

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.530
that one thing is
different from the others.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.930
Do you see it?

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.330
Let me point it out.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.630
Right here.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.930
All right?

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.520
Do you see a different
death date there?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.150
Rafael Goldberg [assumed
spelling] went by the name

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.030
of Eugenis [assumed spelling]
[inaudible] which I'm going

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.500
to slaughter the pronunciation.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.860
I'm very sorry.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.090
He was the oldest
child in the family.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.080
Rafael was Jewish, but
forged papers to pass

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.310
as a Polish Christian in
order to survive the war.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.950
He was the only survivor
of his family.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.920
And this gravestone
captured my attention

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.270
so much it simply just
ignited this curiosity in me

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.050
to know more about someone
who would be the one

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.960
to change his name, and
pass as a Polish citizen.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.500
But it didn't end there.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.350
We went on a tour of
Krakow in the ghetto.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.280
And I found this picture.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.700
This is not cropped in.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.150
This is the actual picture I
took which was a huge mistake.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.990
And it talks about the
underground theaters.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.970
I'm a theater major so I
thought I wanted to know more

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.840
about these underground
theaters.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.780
So I snapped the photo for
the only reason to go home

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.080
and research it later.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.380
That was the mistake.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.680
I went home.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.750
I could not find
one single thing

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.530
about the underground theaters.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.290
And the more I searched,
so I would search terms

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.620
as Polish underground,
Jewish underground,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:55.370
Jewish underground Krakow,
and then I found my story.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.950
In doing the research for
"Resistance" it started

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.370
with me reading as many books
as I could get my hands on,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.610
reading websites,
watching videos,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.100
looking at interviews
and diaries.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.010
And I came up with this.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.310
Just pages.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.910
I have 60 pages just of notes.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.210
Not the printouts.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:15.510
Just notes.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.070
And I thought there's
no way I can compile all

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.370
of that information.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.070
So I thought, "I'm going
to make a timeline."

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.430
So on the wall of my office you
see these six poster boards.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.180
They're color coded because
it turns out I'm super OCD.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.050
Didn't know that.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.380
But I started color coding
these just to give me a timeline

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.690
of the highlights of the event.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.050
And that wasn't enough because
I was missing one thing.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.140
And the thing I was missing,
these were the dates.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.930
These were the facts.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.260
It wasn't the people.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.440
I needed the people.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.880
This poster board
sits very closest

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.160
to where I would do my writing.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.470
These are the faces or those
who actually did the thing

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.010
that I am writing about.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.510
These are the true heroes

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.490
of the Jewish resistance
movement in Krakow, Poland.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.590
So let me tell you the story

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.230
of the resistance
movement of Krakow, Poland.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.250
This is the history of the war.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.620
We have Poland.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.750
When the Germans invaded,
that was September 1, 1939.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.850
That was the start of the war.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.330
Germany floods across the
border in a blitzkrieg.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.250
It was an attack so massive that
the country of Poland collapsed.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.980
In 25 days, they
had surrendered.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.280
When the Germans moved
in, they said, "All right.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.380
Warsaw is the traditional
capital, but not for us.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.400
We're going to make
Krakow the capital

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.700
of the general government."

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.810
So to the Nazi empire
it will be Krakow.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.570
Because Krakow was the new
capital, they didn't want

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.570
as many Jewish people in it.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.750
So they said, "15,000
can remain,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.480
and the rest have to leave."

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.840
So who are you going
to keep in Krakow?

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.930
Well, you can keep your
adults, and the children

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.280
who are dependent upon them.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.780
There was one demographic
you didn't need there.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.890
Your teenagers.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.000
Teenagers largely
were sent away.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.890
Now these teenagers
who were sent away,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.380
they'd never lived on their own.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.040
They were city kids
all of a sudden thrust

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.360
in to the Polish countryside.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.030
But these were kids who --

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.720
It wasn't just a
Polish countryside.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.610
It was full of Nazis,
and Polish citizens

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.980
who were not sympathetic
to them.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.510
And these kids thought,
"Where will we go?"

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.870
Well, they remembered,
"We have scout leaders."

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.110
In the Jewish organizations
the scout was

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.740
for the boys and the girls.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.020
And they remembered, "We
have these scout leaders,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.110
the Draengers [assumed
spelling].

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.470
Shimshon Draenger [assumed
spelling] is a newspaper editor.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.990
He's 21 years old.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.570
His wife, Gusta,
is 20 years old.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.080
She's a housewife.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.860
And one by one these teenagers
show up at their home,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.540
and they say, "Can we
come in to your farm?"

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.470
And the Draengers said, "Yes.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.330
Of course."

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.210
For a while, the Draengers
were isolated from the war

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.540
with the teenagers there,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.420
but bit by bit they started
hearing what's happening

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.600
to their families
back in the ghettos.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.050
They hear about the actions.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.560
They hear about the deportments.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.210
They hear about the
lineups in the streets.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:38.190
And these teenagers realize
that they have to make a choice.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.460
Choice number one.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.400
They do nothing.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.520
If they do nothing,
it is only a matter

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.230
of time before they will die
on their knees to the Nazis.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.530
Choice number two.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.140
They will almost
certainly die as well,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.300
but they will die fighting back.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.290
In actual history one night
these teenagers sat around,

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.450
and the Draengers
called for a vote.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.750
Who is in?

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.340
And, one by one, these
teenagers' hands went up.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.170
Now one of the jobs they
needed these teenagers

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.480
to do was the job of a courier.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.630
The job of a courier was
to go to the ghetto gates.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:16.930
The ghettos were sealed.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.650
No Jewish people in or out.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.300
And so it was a way
of isolating them.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.740
They needed a teenager to
go to the ghetto gates,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.870
look that Nazi officer
in the eye,

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.800
and convince him
that she is Jewish.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.160
On her back she is
smuggling food,

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.850
information, money, and weapons.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.870
She knows it is likely that
one day she will be caught,

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.420
and if she is, she has
sworn never to give

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.180
up any information
about the resistance.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.680
Who are you going
to use to do that?

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.930
No males. Because of
circumcision, you cannot do it.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.380
No mothers.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.360
They have children or
they have work duty.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.160
It only gives you
one demographic,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.580
and that was your teenage girls.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.240
In actual history, girls
15, 16, 17 years old,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.930
that is what they would
do, face that Nazi officer,

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:16.980
talk her way inside the ghetto.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.300
Once she gets inside,
it is her job

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.030
to convince the Jewish
people she is one of them

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.070
because most likely she
will be smuggling someone

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.150
out to a safe house.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:33.120
This resistance movement
that grew from the couriers

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.520
in Krakow was known as Akiba,

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.100
named after a Jewish
rabbi from biblical times.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:48.010
And Akiba conducted a raid
that was all across Krakow.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.130
As a result of the
raid, the Draengers --

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.550
Shimshon was arrested.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.410
His wife gave herself up.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.730
That was a pact they had made.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.160
Whatever happens to one of us,
the other of us will follow.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.720
The Draengers were sent
to Montelupich prison.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.010
Montelupich was the
worst of the worst.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.060
The Nazis started
with her, with Gusta.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.550
And this is why it's important.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:21.700
This book right here is -- It
is called "Justyna's Narrative."

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.050
Justyna is Gusta's code name.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.330
That's the name she went by.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.170
This book isn't in
print anymore.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.820
If you were to see this
in a used bookstore,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.780
most likely you'd pass this up.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.980
Nothing interesting about this.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.820
I'm going to tell you about this
book's importance in history.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.470
The Nazis started with Gusta.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.750
They absolutely tortured her.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.970
And when they had done it,
and Gusta refused to give

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.630
up a single word
about the resistance,

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.200
then they bring her husband in.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.830
They brought Shimshon in.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:57.930
Now those of you
who are husbands,

00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:01.210
or if you have a
husband, you know how far

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.770
that man will go to
protect his wife.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.270
And he comes in, and he sees
what the Nazis have done to her.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.350
And he's ready to do whatever
he needs to save his wife,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.720
but Gusta looks at her husband
and she says, "Look at this.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.990
They did their worst
to me, and I'm fine.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.590
Don't tell them anything."

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.310
And she is the one who upholds
the secret of the resistance.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.770
They take her back to her
cell in Montelupich prison.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.630
There's other women there also
from Akiba who were arrested.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:38.840
Gusta, they'd broken
the bones of her hands.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.670
So she cannot write.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:43.520
But she starts to
dictate her story.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.460
Five women are taking
the dictation.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.840
They're writing it down
on strips of toilet paper.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.230
They sew the strips of
toilet paper together

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.220
with a thread from
their dresses.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.750
They had one needle in the
cell, and they would share it

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.480
to sew these toilet
paper pieces together.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.810
They then smuggled
out as much --

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.380
They smuggled out
all five copies,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.810
hoping that at least something
would safely get through.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:13.120
This book is what
Gusta Draenger narrated

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.800
from Montelupich prison.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.690
We have all but one
and a half chapters

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.820
of her record of
this resistance.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.960
This is the reason we
know it even existed.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.290
This is the only reason we
know what these teenagers

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.760
accomplished here is
because of Gusta Draenger.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.660
Now in this book, in
"Resistance," I'm going

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:41.140
to follow two Jewish
couriers from Krakow ghettos.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.900
I'm going to follow them up to
Lodz [assumed spelling] ghetto

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.540
in the center of Poland.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.230
Lodz was the worst of
the worst of the ghettos.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.630
It was a horrible,
horrible place.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.260
And then by spring
of 1943 I'm going

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.090
to bring these two
couriers in to Warsaw.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.610
Warsaw ghetto was the
largest of the ghettos.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:07.340
In January of 1943, the Nazis
entered with a plan to remove

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:12.570
as many as 300,000 Jewish
people in to the death camps.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.800
The Jewish people fought back.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.550
And, in fact, chased the
Nazis out of the ghettos.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.510
But they knew it was
only a matter of time

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:22.990
that the Nazis would come back.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.630
And, when they came back,
they would come back in force.

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.850
So they began to prepare.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:34.360
By spring of 1943, this man, his
name is Mordechai Anielewicz.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.780
He was 21 years old at
the beginning of the war.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:39.940
He was a career counselor.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.900
No military background.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:47.450
This man organized Jewish
civilians in an uprising

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.690
against the Nazi army.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:52.760
On the night before Passover,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.500
an announcement went throughout
the Jewish population trapped

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.120
inside the ghetto, and it said,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.620
"The Nazis have our
ghetto surrounded."

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:07.810
And on Passover morning
it would begin.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.930
Mordechai Anielewicz would
lead Jewish civilians,

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.820
about 450 of them, against
the entire Nazi army.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.120
This is a picture of one

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.240
of the Jewish fighters
from the rooftops.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.800
They survived longer
against the Nazi army

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.740
than the entire country of
Poland lasted against the Nazis.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.330
It was always clear how
the story was going to end,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:36.470
but for the Jewish people,
this was their victory

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.200
because in this moment
they said,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.430
"It doesn't matter
what our end is.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.410
It matters that we
chose our end.

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:45.750
We chose this.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.690
And we did not go
down on our knees."

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.450
The theme of resistance
is best stated this way.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.980
This comes from the
afterward of the book.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.840
It says, "May we never forget.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.510
May we live with
honor at all times,

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:06.500
regardless of our circumstances.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.590
And may we choose love, a weapon

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.540
that will defeat hate
every single time

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.700
because love is the resistance."

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.540
This book deals with what
the Nazis decided to do

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.900
about the so-called
Jewish problem.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.180
And we live in a world right now
where you can see the recyclings

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:33.870
of hate and anger and name
calling and isolation.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.840
And if we respond to that
with hate, and anger,

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.310
and name calling, and isolation,

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.220
we are feeding in
to the problem.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:51.180
If we wish to be a solution,
the resistance is love.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.430
I've got some time, I believe,
to take any questions about any

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.770
of my books or Holocaust
related questions

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.870
or about "Resistance"
specifically

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.290
if someone has a question.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.590
Wonderful.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.890
You stepped right up.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.930
Excellent.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.230
Yes.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yes.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:10.830
Okay. Sorry.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.800
I read your book
"The Night Divided."

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.100
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen: Yes.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What
was your inspiration

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.090
for the main character's friend?

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.390
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen: Oh.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.280
Okay. So "Night Divided"
is the --

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.120
is a Berlin Wall escape story.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.520
The main character is Gerta.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.200
Her friend is Anna.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.050
To understand Anna, you have

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.790
to understand what East
Germany was like in 1964.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.310
This is the best way
to understand it.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.710
At the height of its
power, the secret police

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.130
and the Soviet Union,
that was the KGB,

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:51.590
they had one secret agent
for every 5,600 citizens.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.510
So every 5,600 people,
1 secret police.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.690
At the height of the
power for the Gestapo.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.620
That's the secret
police of the Nazis.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.330
1 secret policeman
for 2,000 citizens.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:11.180
In 1964 the secret
police were the Stasi.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:18.120
They had 1 secret police
for every 166 individuals.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.820
But that wasn't good
enough for them.

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.430
Every apartment building
has a spy.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:24.660
Your bus driver was
probably a spy.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.980
Your postman was a spy.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.820
Your teacher was a spy.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.420
And then Anna, her best friend
in the story, became recruited.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.260
Right? If you take the total
number of spies and informants

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.890
that the Stasi used, the number
went to 1 in 12 which means,

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:46.340
in this room, every
section of the carpet,

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.450
every row in this
room, at least 1 person

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.020
on that row would be
here to spy on you.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.430
Anna is there as a best friend

00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.510
because she was positively
representing that part

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.690
of East Germany which
means trust no one

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.940
because you could
not trust anyone.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.650
That was an awesome question.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:10.950
Thank you.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:13.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So my school is
doing a battle of the books,

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.770
and your book "False
Prince" is in it.

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:20.570
And I was wondering what
gave you the inspiration

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.870
for "False Prince."

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:23.170
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
For "False Prince."

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.470
Thank you.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:25.830
"False Prince" is the
story of a boy who's forced

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:30.000
to impersonate royalty, and he
wants nothing to do with it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.180
But if he doesn't, he's
going to be killed.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.250
And so there's very high stakes.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:39.510
I knew I wanted to write a
story about someone being forced

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:40.860
to impersonate a prince.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.080
I didn't have Sage.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.340
Sage was found in a song by
a guy named Eddie Vedder.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.430
Any Pearl Jam fans
in the audience?

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.150
Yes. Absolutely.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.170
The lead singer of the Pearl
Jam group is Eddie Vedder.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.350
He did a solo album.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.470
One song was called
"Guaranteed."

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.590
This is the line of the song.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.080
"I knew all the rules, but
the rules did not know me."

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.830
Sound like Sage?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.630
I found Sage in the song,
and once I had Sage,

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.700
I had the whole story.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.270
So it came from a song.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.390
Thank you.

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How did
you decide to make "Mark

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.780
of the Thief" take
place in Rome?

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:23.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
"Mark of the Thief" always.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.410
"Mark of the Thief" is
ancient Rome with magic.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.040
It always had to take place.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.470
And it's because of
two facts I knew.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.770
Number one.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:34.230
That every Roman child who was a
citizen would have worn a bulla,

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.530
that amulet.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.270
And I just thought
that was kind of cool,

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.990
but I knew fact number
two, that Julius Caesar

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:44.280
in actual history used to
tell the people he had come

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.580
from the gods.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.980
So he would be like, "Oh,
Venus, that you all worship?

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.700
Yeah. That's my grandma."

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.330
Right? And I thought, "Well,

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.940
what if Caesar was
telling the truth?"

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.820
If he really had
come from the gods,

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.380
Julius Caesar would
have been a demigod.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:03.770
And what if his magic was kept
in his bulla that becomes lost

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.930
after his death and
remains lost for 200 years?

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.060
So it always had
to be ancient Rome

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.910
because of Caesar and the bulla.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.210
Fantastic.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.510
Thank you.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: In
the "Runaway King,"

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:21.270
what was your inspiration
for Harlowe?

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.570
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen: Okay.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:24.700
In the "False Prince"
series Sage is trying

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.110
to rebuild a family.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.950
Correct? He needed a dad figure.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.690
And Mott kind of plays the
dad figure, but not enough

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.710
because Mott's more like
an older brother to him.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.850
He needed a dad, and
he needed a dad figure

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.930
who would love him despite
how difficult he is,

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:46.640
and troublesome he is.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.420
And so Harlowe became that
person who would just love him.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.610
I love Harlowe.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.910
Thank you.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You've
written a lot

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.890
of Holocaust books,
like themed books.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.940
So I was wondering what
inspired you to write all

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.800
of those Holocaust themed books.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.100
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
Do you know,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.490
for Holocaust I've written
two of the German books.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.430
This is the first Holocaust.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well, like
the German and the --

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.150
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
The Germans, certainly.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.600
I don't know.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.530
Germany calls me.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.180
It calls me from both ends.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.500
What Germany has done right
in the world, and mistakes

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.410
that Germany has
made in the world,

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.790
which they fully acknowledge.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.510
There's a piece of my heart

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.190
that belongs there,
and I don't know why.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.030
It just does.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.330
But thank you.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.630
Thank you for asking.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:41.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Why do you write
books about European history?

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.710
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
You know what?

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:46.010
I don't search for European
history for my books.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.710
For an author, stories
will come to you.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.010
All right?

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.330
I don't necessarily
go looking for them.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.630
But I know.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.500
And I -- Do you ever
write stories?

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.800
All right.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.750
Do you ever get an idea,
and all of a sudden it feels

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.720
like there's magic in your head?

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.420
You know what I'm talking about?

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.560
I look for that magic
in my head,

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.740
and then I know that's
the story I have to write.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.280
I would never limit myself
and say I can't write

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.220
about this part of the world.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.270
I just look for when
I feel magic

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.050
in my head, and I
start to write.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.420
Same as you.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.720
Wonderful.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.020
Wonderful.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Which
characters do you

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.160
like in your books
that you wrote?

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.460
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.490
I need help with that
question one more time.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Which books --

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:41.040
I mean which books do
have the characters

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.910
that you [inaudible]
in your books?

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.210
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen: Which --

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:51.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Characters,
I think [inaudible].

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:56.590
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen: Which
characters are my favorite?

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.890
That's what we're asking?

00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.450
Is that your question?

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.750
About the characters?

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.170
Do you know what?

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.420
Every character I write
becomes my friend.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.240
So you have friends.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.740
Right? My characters
are my friends.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.740
And they talk to me in my head

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.610
which sounds super
crazy, but they do.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:21.380
And I feel like my characters,
if I saw them on the street,

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.840
I would recognize them.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.550
I could never choose a favorite

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.300
because I could never
choose a favorite friend.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.170
I love all my characters,

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.290
and I want to know them
for a very long time.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.720
Does that help?

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.020
Wonderful.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.320
Thank you for your
patience with me.

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: In your book

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.960
"Resistance" how long did
you spend on the research,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.950
and how long did it
take you to write it?

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.250
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:49.540
The research was nearly
a year of research.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.250
And I was writing
at the same time,

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.310
but it was very intense
focused research,

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:56.000
and I continued to do it.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.870
It was very important to
me to get this story right.

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.490
There are Holocaust
deniers in the world,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.790
and people who say, "No.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.090
That never happened."

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:09.690
And I know if I get a fact
incorrect that somebody can use

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:12.630
that to say, "Well, if
that fact is incorrect,

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.100
then it's all fiction."

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.500
And so it was very important
to me to get it correct.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.130
So like when I'm describing
a Warsaw ghetto uprising,

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.430
there's a point where
Chaya [assumed spelling],

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.430
my main character, is
in a building fighting,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.600
and she thinks this might have
been a furniture store once.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.740
That building was a
furniture store once.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.480
Like I get down to that level
of detail because I don't want

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.620
to put something in there
that did not happen.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: And how
long did it take you

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.220
to write it once the --

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:44.290
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen: Writing
it was around six months

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.100
which is about my average
because I'm super obsessive.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.780
So I just write.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.920
Thank you very much.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Where do you get
your inspiration for your books?

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:55.190
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:56.630
Inspiration for books
happens this way.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:25:00.510
Okay. Everybody can play this
for inspiration for books.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:05.650
So let's say that right
now all the lights go

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.450
out in the whole room.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.450
And they're out for
exactly three seconds,

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:14.080
and the end of three seconds
there are only five people

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.650
in this entire room left.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.600
And you are one of them.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.180
All right?

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.050
Now where did everybody go?

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.360
Why were you kept?

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.660
Where is everybody?

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:27.960
Can you find them?

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.530
These sorts of questions
happen to me all the time.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.390
So everything and everywhere
I am, I just ask questions.

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.840
And then you start
to see story emerge.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:41.650
So your goal for today,
before you leave this room,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.920
I want you to come
up with an answer.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.460
There's five people left.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:47.090
You're one of them.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:51.080
Where did they go, and
why were you left here?

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.380
All right?

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:54.270
You answer that,
you've got a story.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.940
That's all I do.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.830
Excellent.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: How do
you get your information

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.340
on your historical fiction?

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer A Nielsen:
Information.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.840
There's two kinds
of ways to research.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.900
The first is primary sources.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.900
That's someone who says,
"It happened to me."

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.770
Secondary sources is
a researcher says,

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.640
"This happened to her."

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.070
I'm not a big fan of
secondary resources

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.430
because it passes
through a filter.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.990
Right? I want to
know as much primary.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:26.930
So I will search out
diaries, interviews,

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.760
any first person records.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.120
Photographs become a
first person source

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.780
because I'm seeing it as it was.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.920
So my research is always
going to focus first.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.570
That's why this book
is so valuable

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.960
because it's first person.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.290
It's her saying,
"This is what we did."

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:47.590
Excellent question.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.890
Thank you.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:50.190
All right.

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.490
Thank you all so very much.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:53.650
I'm going to turn the time
back here, but thank you.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.510
Thank you all.

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.540
[ Applause ]

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.050
&gt;&gt; Nicole Chung: Thank
you all for coming.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.660
If you have any questions
you'd like to ask Jennifer,

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.630
her book signing will be
at 3:30 just over there.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:09.110
There's a sign hanging
in the ceiling saying

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.690
"Signing" in case you get lost.

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.650
Thank you again.
