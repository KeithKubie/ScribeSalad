BEN MORRIS: Hey, I'm Ben
Morris from the AMP team

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.220
live here in Amsterdam
at AMP Conf 2018.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.230
We've seen talks today
from a wide variety

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.520
of people using AMP
for a whole bunch

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.230
of different applications.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.364
Let's see some highlights.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:13.780
SPEAKER 1: In the
last year or so,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.840
we've seen that
sites everywhere have

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.700
seen great success with AMP.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.360
Sites across verticals
and across the world

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.812
have been able to boost
their revenue by using AMP.

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:26.145
SPEAKER 2 : This is just
numbers based on DoubleClick Ad

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:27.555
Exchange and AdSense.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:32.324
And we're seeing an increase
of 318% in terms of impressions

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:34.926
and 3x increase in ad revenue.

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:36.334
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.375
SPEAKER 3: With AMP, we
have to talk about, like,

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:40.160
what should we actually AMP?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.160
And to do that, there are
a couple of challenges

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.339
that we needed to figure
out about which pages

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:45.130
we should consider.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.595
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:07.002
But we were left with the
question, to AMP or not to AMP?

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:08.460
SPEAKER 4: Reddit
has been growing,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.580
which makes Google SEO, and
especially AMP, very, very

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.255
important for us.

00:01:13.255 --> 00:01:16.050
SPEAKER 3: We wanted to reap
all the benefits that AMP

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.810
had to offer, but
we wanted to ensure

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.085
that our tracking remained
accurate and insightful.

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:25.740
SPEAKER 5: Maybe you are one
of our ecosystem providers,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.390
and you do ads, analytics, or
you produce embeddable content.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.190
You want to make sure your
products are AMP-enabled.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.060
Well, it's really
easy to do that too.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.450
SPEAKER 6: I do love [? house ?]
pages, and when AMP came up,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.030
I thought, OK, let's just
try this for e-commerce,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.175
see where we are going.

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:46.550
You start your
journey and think,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.350
OK, where should
I start with AMP?

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.238

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:59.240
SPEAKER 7: Thank you very much.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.302
Hopefully it's time to
maximize your own results.

00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:04.260
