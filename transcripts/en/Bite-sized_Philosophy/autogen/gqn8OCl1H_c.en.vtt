does that right things change the world
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830
does that right things change the world
changes the environment changes and the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
changes the environment changes and the
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.510
changes the environment changes and the
culture doesn't keep up very well and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
culture doesn't keep up very well and
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400
culture doesn't keep up very well and
then of course it has corrupt elements

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
then of course it has corrupt elements
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250
then of course it has corrupt elements
and so it's an enduring eternal story

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
and so it's an enduring eternal story
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.490
and so it's an enduring eternal story
the individual is always placed in

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
the individual is always placed in
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440
the individual is always placed in
relationship to a culture that's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
relationship to a culture that's
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.170
relationship to a culture that's
somewhat corrupt and then the question

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
somewhat corrupt and then the question
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560
somewhat corrupt and then the question
is well what you do about it and if the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570
is well what you do about it and if the
 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.959
is well what you do about it and if the
answer is nothing well then it'll just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
answer is nothing well then it'll just
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.569
answer is nothing well then it'll just
get more corrupt and if the answer is be

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
get more corrupt and if the answer is be
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549
get more corrupt and if the answer is be
corrupt - then it will just get more

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
corrupt - then it will just get more
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.349
corrupt - then it will just get more
corrupt so the answer has to be to

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359
corrupt so the answer has to be to
 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.980
corrupt so the answer has to be to
oppose the corruption because that's the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
oppose the corruption because that's the
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.160
oppose the corruption because that's the
only way it's going to stop now god

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
only way it's going to stop now god
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.130
only way it's going to stop now god
threatens to destroy this city because

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
threatens to destroy this city because
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.030
threatens to destroy this city because
of its corruption and I don't think you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
of its corruption and I don't think you
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.179
of its corruption and I don't think you
need to presume anything particularly

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
need to presume anything particularly
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.570
need to presume anything particularly
metaphysical about that to understand it

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580
metaphysical about that to understand it
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.240
metaphysical about that to understand it
it's very straight forward that the more

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
it's very straight forward that the more
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710
it's very straight forward that the more
corrupt the culture is and the less

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
corrupt the culture is and the less
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.990
corrupt the culture is and the less
Trust is possible between individuals

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
Trust is possible between individuals
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149
Trust is possible between individuals
the less productive the culture is going

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
the less productive the culture is going
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700
the less productive the culture is going
to be because why do anything if some

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
to be because why do anything if some
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230
to be because why do anything if some
corrupt person is just don't come and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
corrupt person is just don't come and
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.480
corrupt person is just don't come and
take it you know it might even be me

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
take it you know it might even be me
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.010
take it you know it might even be me
that the culture is so corrupt that if

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
that the culture is so corrupt that if
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.639
that the culture is so corrupt that if
you are good for something and you

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649
you are good for something and you
 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.230
you are good for something and you
produce resources you're actually more

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
produce resources you're actually more
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030
produce resources you're actually more
likely to get killed because you have

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
likely to get killed because you have
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.429
likely to get killed because you have
something of value so it like this just

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439
something of value so it like this just
 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.139
something of value so it like this just
you're just not going anywhere with that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
you're just not going anywhere with that
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999
you're just not going anywhere with that
and why would you work if you didn't

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
and why would you work if you didn't
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.670
and why would you work if you didn't
have any sense that you know you could

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680
have any sense that you know you could
 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.859
have any sense that you know you could
store up the value of your work for some

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869
store up the value of your work for some
 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.740
store up the value of your work for some
reasonable time in the future so if the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
reasonable time in the future so if the
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.630
reasonable time in the future so if the
society is corrupted there's no trust

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
society is corrupted there's no trust
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.730
society is corrupted there's no trust
it's degenerating and you know it might

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
it's degenerating and you know it might
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.920
it's degenerating and you know it might
live for a while but isn't gonna last

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
live for a while but isn't gonna last
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869
live for a while but isn't gonna last
very long and so that's the idea corrupt

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
very long and so that's the idea corrupt
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.070
very long and so that's the idea corrupt
societies collapse

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
 
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.530
 
that leaves open what corruption means

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
that leaves open what corruption means
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.390
that leaves open what corruption means
anyways

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400

don't like it and you know it's crooked
and so then the question is well what

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330
and so then the question is well what
 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.270
and so then the question is well what
should you do about it well if you know

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
should you do about it well if you know
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.640
should you do about it well if you know
your crimp know it's crooked it's not so

good to play along with it I mean we'll
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.850
good to play along with it I mean we'll
say that you know it's crooked by your

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860
say that you know it's crooked by your
 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.490
say that you know it's crooked by your

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500
own standards of values it D degrades
 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.810
own standards of values it D degrades
you to play along with it

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820
you to play along with it
 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.110
you to play along with it
you're going to stand up and oppose it

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120
you're going to stand up and oppose it
 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.370
you're going to stand up and oppose it
well no probably not you're probably

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380
well no probably not you're probably
 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.590
well no probably not you're probably
going to do what Jonah did jump on a

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600
going to do what Jonah did jump on a
 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.680
going to do what Jonah did jump on a
ship and get the hell out of there and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690
ship and get the hell out of there and
 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.810
ship and get the hell out of there and
you know that's a logical thing to do

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820
you know that's a logical thing to do
 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.479
you know that's a logical thing to do
but it doesn't solve the problem and I

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
but it doesn't solve the problem and I
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.830
but it doesn't solve the problem and I
think this has something to do with

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
think this has something to do with
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.290
think this has something to do with
human ethical responsibility because

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
human ethical responsibility because
 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.040
human ethical responsibility because

the chaos for a good amount of time and
maybe you never get out

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
maybe you never get out
 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.830
maybe you never get out
but maybe you learn something down there

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840
but maybe you learn something down there
 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.660

being overly optimistic about this I

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400
being overly optimistic about this I
 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.700
being overly optimistic about this I
know perfectly well that people

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710

that they find almost impossible to
 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.750
that they find almost impossible to
recover from but it's the best shot you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760
recover from but it's the best shot you
 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.480

have so anyways Jonah runs away but God

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490
have so anyways Jonah runs away but God
 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.160
have so anyways Jonah runs away but God
isn't very happy about that because it's

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170
isn't very happy about that because it's
 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.710
isn't very happy about that because it's
actually Jonah's destiny it's necessary

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720
actually Jonah's destiny it's necessary
 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.400
actually Jonah's destiny it's necessary
for Jonah to repair the city so God

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410
for Jonah to repair the city so God

sends a storm and you know the waves are

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830
sends a storm and you know the waves are
 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.430
sends a storm and you know the waves are
high and and and I think what that means

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440
high and and and I think what that means
 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.470
high and and and I think what that means
is because the water is often a symbol

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480
is because the water is often a symbol
 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.360
is because the water is often a symbol
for the unconscious and that's because

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370
for the unconscious and that's because
 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.070
for the unconscious and that's because
things lurk down there in the water and

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080
things lurk down there in the water and
 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.750
things lurk down there in the water and
that you could pull up that that are

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760
that you could pull up that that are
 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.880
that you could pull up that that are
useful monstrous things but you can pull

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890
useful monstrous things but you can pull
 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.560
useful monstrous things but you can pull
up they're useful you can fish for them

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570
up they're useful you can fish for them
 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.260
up they're useful you can fish for them
you can go fishing in your own being for

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270
you can go fishing in your own being for
 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.030
you can go fishing in your own being for
answers which is what you do when you

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040
answers which is what you do when you
 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.650
answers which is what you do when you
try to think all right you ask yourself

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660
try to think all right you ask yourself
 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.710
try to think all right you ask yourself
a question and you wait maybe an answer

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720
a question and you wait maybe an answer
 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.080
a question and you wait maybe an answer
appears it's like where'd that come from

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090
appears it's like where'd that come from
 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.700
appears it's like where'd that come from
you didn't know what the answer was

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710
you didn't know what the answer was
 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.070
you didn't know what the answer was
before it appeared but it just popped

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080
before it appeared but it just popped
 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.630
before it appeared but it just popped
into being out of nowhere who knows so

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640
into being out of nowhere who knows so

you fish so anyways the waves come and

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620
you fish so anyways the waves come and
 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.530
you fish so anyways the waves come and
the boats going to be knocked over it

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540
the boats going to be knocked over it
 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.540
the boats going to be knocked over it
and that's what happens I think when you

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550
and that's what happens I think when you
 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.620
and that's what happens I think when you
know when you know you should do

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630
know when you know you should do
 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.560
know when you know you should do
something I mean everyone has the

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570
something I mean everyone has the
 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.930
something I mean everyone has the
Disick's perience I believe perhaps you

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940
Disick's perience I believe perhaps you
 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.400
Disick's perience I believe perhaps you
would be willing to put up your hands if

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410
would be willing to put up your hands if
 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.260
would be willing to put up your hands if
this experience is foreign to you okay

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270
this experience is foreign to you okay
 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.030
this experience is foreign to you okay
this party are telling you you should do

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040
this party are telling you you should do
 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.760
this party are telling you you should do
something and it's hard to do it

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770
something and it's hard to do it
 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.800
something and it's hard to do it
effortful and maybe you're afraid of it

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810
effortful and maybe you're afraid of it
 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.060
effortful and maybe you're afraid of it
and so you don't do it you just

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070
and so you don't do it you just
 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.670
and so you don't do it you just
procrastinate right and so how do you

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680
procrastinate right and so how do you
 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.570
procrastinate right and so how do you
feel about that

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580
feel about that
 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.700
feel about that
good I mean so what you feel that you're

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710
good I mean so what you feel that you're
 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.430
good I mean so what you feel that you're
betraying yourself your anxiety actually

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440
betraying yourself your anxiety actually
 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.470
betraying yourself your anxiety actually
gets worse not better even though you

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480
gets worse not better even though you
 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.920
gets worse not better even though you
know you can

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930
know you can
 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.960
know you can
moment-to-moment but that doesn't help

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970
moment-to-moment but that doesn't help
 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.430
moment-to-moment but that doesn't help
because every time you put it off the

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440
because every time you put it off the
 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.020

that you're making things more chaotic
 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:54.360
that you're making things more chaotic
than they should be you know and if you

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370

what'd he just throw me over to
 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.770
what'd he just throw me over to
