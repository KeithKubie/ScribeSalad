00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:09.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is I/O
Live, and I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.380
And we're here in the
Google Assistant Sandbox.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.920
I'm going to go
find Wayne, who's

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.211
going to give us a little tour.

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:16.830
What do you say?

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.929
Hey, Wayne, that was convenient.

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.970
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: I was
just here waiting for you.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
glad that you were.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.300
So there's a lot going
on in the sandbox,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.966
and you're just going to take us
around and tell us what's what.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.200
Give us all the new stuff.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.430
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So we have
a look going on right now.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.870
I mean, one of
the biggest things

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.635
we announced at CES this year
was these new smart displays

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:34.260
that we've got.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.504
So the Assistant
is now no longer

00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:37.545
just an audio experience.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.800
It's now a display experience.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.700
It runs on these smart displays.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.841
It runs on phones, Android
Wear, Android TV, Android Auto.

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:46.840
It's kind of everywhere.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.900
So there's a lot of
new possibilities

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.140
for the Assistant, and there's
over 500 million devices that

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.590
now have the Assistant on it.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.990
So it's definitely a
platform that everyone

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.880
should be building for.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.380
And, yeah, we've got a
bunch of cool demos here.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.320
We've got my friend
Kenny over here,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.920
who's an expert in this demo.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.220
So let's see what we
can do with this tablet.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.940
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey,
how are you doing.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.010
KENNY LAI: Good, how are you?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm doing
very well, thank you.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.060
Do you want to show us a demo?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.601
KENNY LAI: Yeah, so
today we're going

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:11.100
to show how users can interact
with our new smart displays

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.740
to do something cool,
such as a cooking app.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.640
Hey, Google, ask Tasty how to
bake brownie cheesecake cookie.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.480
So you can see, this is very
similar to a tablet experience,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.230
except we consider this
voice-first in that we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.980
want users to always interact
with this using their voice.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.100
You can interact by
tapping on the display.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.050
But as a user, you're cooking.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.111
Your hands are dirty.

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:42.110
You don't want to be
getting your devices dirty.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.920
So you can also interact with
this completely hands-free.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.540
Hey, Google, skip to step 10.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.590
So as you can see,
this gives the user

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.340
another option of
interacting with their Google

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.592
Assistant They can be
busy with their hands.

00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:01.050
They do not have to use their
hands at all to control this.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.870
And they can still get all the
information that they need.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.879
Thank you.

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:06.400
KENNY LAI: Yeah, you're welcome.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, Wayne what's next?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.336
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah, so here
we've got our website here,

00:02:10.336 --> 00:02:12.900
which is our Actions Discovery
Area, where consumers

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.820
can find out more about
the kinds of things

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.280
that they can do with
Actions on Google.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.200
There's over a million
different actions that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.750
are made by Google or by
third party developers,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.640
just like everyone
watching this show,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.160
that they can make and
then make available on here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.277
so their consumers can
find out what's available.

00:02:28.277 --> 00:02:30.360
So you see, you can do
things like buying tickets,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.469
ordering flowers, all kinds
of things appearing here.

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.760
There's this huge directory
of all different categories

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.372
that people can
look in to find out

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:38.580
about the things they can do.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.400
So there's lots of
different things.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.734
I have a suspicion you probably
could live in your house

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:45.316
and just do everything
with your voice

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:47.350
now without even having
to lift a finger to eat,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.180
and do things, and
order, and whatever.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.380
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It let's
you do other things, too.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.310
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK,
what else is next?

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.000
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So here
we've got Android Wear,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
which you mentioned earlier.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.749
And then also we have
our Google Home Max,

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:59.790
which is a big subwoofer-based
speaker that's really loud

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.957
booming audio for big rooms.

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:01.956
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:02.730
What's next?

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.438
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Say
hello to Dialogflow.

00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:06.270
This is our tool
that allows people

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.360
to build conversational actions
and experiences for the Google

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.110
Assistant.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.810
It makes it really easy
to use machine learning.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.060
So basically you train it
with some example sentences.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.601
And then the next thing you know
you've built a conversation.

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:20.010
We've actually been giving
talks where in five minutes

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.860
we build a booking
action, and show you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.080
how to build an
appointment system,

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.352
and how to extract dates
and times from people.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.310
It makes it really easy
to build conversations.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.512
This is probably one of
the most important tools

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:32.970
when it comes to
building fractions

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.620
on Google and the
Google Assistant.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.619
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:36.976
Let's check out one more area.

00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:39.600
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So now I've got
Glen from Google Assistant SDK

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.360
team to show us some really
cool demos they're working on.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.760
GLEN SHIRES: Yeah, so with
the Google Assistant SDK,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.680
we can put the Google Assistant
into any device with a speaker

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.044
and a microphone.

00:03:49.044 --> 00:03:51.210
For example, you may want
to put it into a microwave

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.844
oven or a set-top box.

00:03:52.844 --> 00:03:55.260
We decided that for the show
we'd have a little bit of fun

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.790
and put it into a plotter.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.897
PLOTTER: Hey, Google,
let's make some art.

00:03:58.897 --> 00:04:00.480
GLEN SHIRES: So what
we're seeing here

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.040
is a couple of different things.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.850
First of all, we have
the plotter talking

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.410
to the Google Assistant.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.320
And everything this
guest is saying

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.770
is going up to the
cloud, being processed,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.690
and it can answer regular
commands, such as,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:17.800
tell me the weather.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.130
But in addition to that,
we've layered custom commands

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.245
on top of it, such as
draw purple triangle.

00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:25.920
It makes it a lot easier
and a lot more customizable

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.100
for people to build
applications that

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.050
are built into appliances,
set-top boxes, cars,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.717
almost anything.

00:04:34.717 --> 00:04:35.716
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:35.716 --> 00:04:36.730
Thank you so much, Glen.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.689
GLEN SHIRES: Thank you.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:39.271
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Wayne, thanks so much.

00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:41.710
If developers want to get
started, where do they go?

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.126
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
Yeah, no worries.

00:04:43.126 --> 00:04:45.460
So the best place to go is
developers.google.com/actions

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.917
and get started with Actions
on Google built for the Google

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:48.580
Assistant.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.319
If you'd like to check out
some more videos like this,

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.540
go to g.co/io/guide.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.310
And if you'd like to catch
any of the sessions from I/O,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.494
g.co/io/videos.

00:04:59.494 --> 00:05:00.410
Let's get out of here.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.660
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Let's go, man

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.216
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
See you all later.
