party support did terrifically within
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.929
party support did terrifically within
the Republican Party and so I guess I

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939
the Republican Party and so I guess I
 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.729
the Republican Party and so I guess I
think within the party structure you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739

be dictated top-down are now being
 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.420
be dictated top-down are now being
dictated bottom-up and we are I think we

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
dictated bottom-up and we are I think we
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.550
dictated bottom-up and we are I think we
are seeing a groundswell of the bottom

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
are seeing a groundswell of the bottom
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.110

across the entertainment a political
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.210
across the entertainment a political
landscape that because of the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
landscape that because of the
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.839
landscape that because of the
distribution of media channels it is too

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849
distribution of media channels it is too
 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.720
distribution of media channels it is too
difficult now for any gatekeeper to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
difficult now for any gatekeeper to
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.690
difficult now for any gatekeeper to
control the flow of information from a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
control the flow of information from a
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.330
control the flow of information from a
group of elite people to the masses

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340
group of elite people to the masses
 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.099

instead everybody has a bullhorn

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109
instead everybody has a bullhorn
 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.619

everybody can be a broadcaster and as a

everybody can be a broadcaster and as a

everybody can be a broadcaster and as a
result what you have instead is chaos

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329
result what you have instead is chaos
 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.780
result what you have instead is chaos
and so I think that that is one of the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
and so I think that that is one of the
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.520
and so I think that that is one of the
more important phenomena that we're

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530
more important phenomena that we're
 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.219
more important phenomena that we're
seeing is this revolution of bottom-up

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:19.229
seeing is this revolution of bottom-up
 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:24.140
seeing is this revolution of bottom-up
that is powered by a technological

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150
that is powered by a technological
 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.140
that is powered by a technological
revolution in distribution
