00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:09.316
&gt;&gt; Dude: Hey Sally.

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:10.226
&gt;&gt; Sally: Hmmm?

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:12.546
&gt;&gt; Dude: How come Buddy is green and I'm not?

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:13.356
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well Dude.

00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:16.786
Your parents aren't green and I'm
guessing that Buddy's parent was.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:20.206
&gt;&gt; Dude: That's not what I
mean...like, what makes him green?

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:20.966
&gt;&gt; Sally: Envy?

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.796
&gt;&gt; Dude: Fine, I'll figure it out myself.

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.526
Alright! Here it is.

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.046
Hey Sally, check this out.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.876
All of Buddy's DNA is online.

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:34.516
Now all I have to do is find
the part that makes him green.

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:38.636
What a nightmare.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.036
It all looks the same.

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:39.846
Just Gs, As, Ts, and Cs.

00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:42.026
How am I suppose to know what's what?

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.656
Someone needs to write a manual.

00:00:44.926 --> 00:00:47.376
&gt;&gt; Sally: We are writing one,
but it's a work in progress.

00:00:47.676 --> 00:00:48.876
Why is Buddy green?

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.266
Well, it's probably because he makes
a protein or two that turn him green.

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:57.336
We can figure that out, because sequences that
code for proteins have a few things in common.

00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:59.626
&gt;&gt; Dude: Oh I remember now.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:05.046
They all start with ATG then call out for
amino acids using three bases at a time.

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.676
&gt;&gt; Sally: Those 3 bases are
called triplet codons.

00:01:08.016 --> 00:01:10.916
Here's a look up table with
the genetic code for Buddy.

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:14.836
It tells you which amino acids
are encoded by each triplet codon.

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:16.436
&gt;&gt; Dude: OK I got it now.

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:22.366
Here's an ATG for the methionine start, then
I see a TAT, that translates to tyrosine,

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:25.696
then TAG that will make a ...stop?

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:27.606
That's only two amino acids.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:29.876
That seems too short to do anything in the cell.

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:32.536
&gt;&gt; Sally: You've just figured
out something really important.

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.496
Not every ORF will make a protein.

00:01:34.946 --> 00:01:39.956
As a rule of thumb, people consider 100
amino acids the minimum to produce a protein,

00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:43.265
even though there are lots of
proteins we know that contain fewer.

00:01:43.556 --> 00:01:47.436
&gt;&gt; Dude: Did you say ORF or did you just burp?

00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:49.056
&gt;&gt; Sally: didn't burp!

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:51.246
ORF stands for open reading frame.

00:01:51.376 --> 00:01:57.406
It's a register for reading the section of DNA
that starts with ATG, uses 3 letters at a time

00:01:57.406 --> 00:02:02.776
to call for amino acids and then uses one or
more of the stop codons to close the reading.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.746
&gt;&gt; Dude: So in this DNA sequence there are 3
reading frames that I have to look through?

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:08.386
That will take me forever.

00:02:08.756 --> 00:02:13.506
&gt;&gt; Sally: Actually it will take you forever
times two since there are 6 reading frames.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:18.036
Remember DNA is double stranded and the
bottom strand, the one you're not seeing here,

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:20.076
might also have ORFs that make proteins.

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:23.076
&gt;&gt; Dude: Please tell me there are
computer programs to help me with this.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:26.776
&gt;&gt; Sally: There are lots of good ones, but
once you find all the ORFs what will you do?

00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:29.046
&gt;&gt; Dude: Yeah...then what?

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.786
How will I know which of the
ORFs really make proteins?

00:02:31.786 --> 00:02:32.866
And what if I've missed a bunch?

00:02:32.976 --> 00:02:36.766
Maybe some proteins that turn Buddy
green are only a few amino acids long.

00:02:36.836 --> 00:02:37.526
&gt;&gt; Sally: Nice!

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:40.166
You've got the start of a
really interesting project here.

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:44.146
But remember that discovering important
proteins is only part of your job.

00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:48.536
If you really want to engineer biology
you'll have to refine the genetic material

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.305
so you and others can build with it.

00:02:50.626 --> 00:02:53.436
Before Buddy wakes up, can I
show you one great example?
