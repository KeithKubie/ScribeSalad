TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, world.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.420
I'm Timothy Jordan, reporting
for "The Developer Show"

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.270
here at the Firebase
Dev Summit in Amsterdam.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.820
And I'm standing with
Francis Ma, the lead product

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.900
manager for Firebase.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.470
Hi, Francis.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.270
FRANCIS MA: Hey, Timothy.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: How
are you doing today?

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.230
FRANCIS MA: Excellent.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.970
Super excited to be
in Amsterdam today.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.844
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:17.220
This summit is way cool.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.530
And my favorite
part is the keynote,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.930
where we get to learn
all the cool new stuff

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.220
happening with Firebase.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.630
And you talked
about two things I

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.370
was hoping that we could
get a few more details on.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.660
Is that OK?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.630
FRANCIS MA: Yeah, absolutely.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.650
Would love to talk about it.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: The
first is Firestore.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.880
Now, we know a little
bit about Firestore.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.088
You talked about it a little
bit more in the keynote.

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:35.160
Just lay it out for us.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.322
What is Firestore, and why
is it great for developers?

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:39.030
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.720
Firestore is our next
generation's Firebase database.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.190
And the really
cool part about it

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.490
is that it's a NoSQL
document-based database that

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.925
scales automatically.

00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:51.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And what
is it that it solves now

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.269
that we couldn't do before
with other solutions?

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:55.810
FRANCIS MA: So there
were two things.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.570
First off, we built
Firestore based

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.030
on the learnings from
the Realtime Database,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.400
and have done so building
on Google's powerful cloud

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.510
infrastructure.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.810
And so with that, the first key
part is the scalability of it.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.790
And as I mentioned
earlier that Firestore

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.296
is an auto-managed
database-- what that means is

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:13.920
as a developer, you
don't have to worry

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.961
about the infrastructure.

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.070
It just scales
effortlessly, whether you're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.320
building a prototype,
running a startup,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.440
or even scaling up to,
say, a billion users.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.480
It will just automatically
work for you.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.060
And the second part that's
really cool about Firestore

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.150
is that its data
structure is now

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.090
based on a collections
document model, which

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.450
is a change from the
Firebase Realtime Database.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.310
And with this new
model, it allows

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.160
you to structure your data a
little bit more intuitively

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.720
and also be able to run
efficient queries on it as

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.220
well.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.305
Let's talk about
one other thing,

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.290
and that's Firebase
Predictions, which you announced

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.695
for the first time today.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:51.570
Tell us-- what is it?

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.278
FRANCIS MA: Yeah.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.290
We're super excited
about Predictions.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.510
It's our first step of bringing
Google's machine learning

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.990
into Firebase.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.050
And we have created
this to help developers

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.080
apply machine learning on
their own analytics data

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.220
and predict what their
users are likely to do.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.040
And so the power in
there is that now they

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.950
can take more proactive
actions to create a more

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.970
engaging experience
for their users.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.150
So, for example, if
you're building a game,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.600
we can help you predict
how likely users are going

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.460
to leave your game because
they may find it too difficult.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.660
And so now, as a
game developer, you

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.250
will be able to use it to
say whether you give them

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.020
some promotion up front or lower
the difficulty of the level

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.100
to continue to drive
that engagement.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.180
And the cool part
about Predictions

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.140
is that you can also set up
your own custom predictions.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.722
So it not only works
well for game developers,

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:48.180
but, say, if you're building
an e-commerce app or a fitness

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.466
app, you can set up
your own predictions

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:51.590
that are important for you.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.048
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.290
I think my favorite thing
about Firebase Predictions

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.410
is that all of that machine
learning is under the hood.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.840
We did all the hard work,
and developers can just

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.115
use the value of it.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.210
FRANCIS MA: Absolutely.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.100
And that's really the
spirit of Firebase,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.370
where our focus is to
help developers focus

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.130
on creating value
for their users

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.410
and us doing the heavy
lifting for them.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.780
And in this instance,
for machine learning,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.420
a lot of developers
that we've heard from

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.400
are finding some of
the tools on the market

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.640
difficult for the fact that
it requires advanced machine

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.450
learning knowledge.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.390
And so here, following
the Firebase spirit,

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.510
we have packaged a lot
of it under the hood,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.010
as you had said,
such that there is

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.920
no need for them to have any
machine learning knowledge

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.040
whatsoever.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.910
All they need to do is
enable this feature.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.490
As long as they have
analytics enabled,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.767
the machine will just work
and automatically set up

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:44.600
Predictions for you.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Francis, thanks
so much for joining us today.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.490
FRANCIS MA: Always my pleasure.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.867
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:49.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thanks

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.400
at the Firebase Dev
Summit 2017 in Amsterdam.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.590

videos, look in the description

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.240
