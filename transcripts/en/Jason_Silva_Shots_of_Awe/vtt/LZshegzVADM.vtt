JASON SILVA: So there's
a fantastic interview

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.660
with George Carlin,
when he's talking

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.260
about how he gets some
of his greatest ideas

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.850
and how he achieved
such brilliance

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.002
in his comedy and such success.

00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:14.460
And so we talked
about this concept

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.871
known as psycho-cybernetics.

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.370
And psycho-cybernetics has to
do with the way of programming

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.830
your brain to exploit its
pattern recognizing capacities.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.605
In other words, the brain
is a goal seeking mechanism,

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:25.830
he says.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.110
And so he talks about
creating a set of impressions

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.202
in your brain, sort
pre-decide the kind

00:00:31.202 --> 00:00:33.410
of patterns that's going to
be on the lookout for us.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.900
So the first idea,
of course, is come up

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.880
with an idea, think of a
joke, come up with an insight.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.700
There's the initial impression,
the initial creative thought.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.950
So impression number one
is the moment you of it.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.380
impression number two
is to write it down.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.880
Record it.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.080
Transcribe it.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.910
That's impression number two.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.330
Impression number three
is review your notes later

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.124
in the day.

00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:57.790
Go through the things
you thought about.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.330
Look at the digital paper trail
of everything you wrote down

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.600
and everything you thought of.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.311
And then after those
three impressions,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.019
the initial thought,
the writing it down,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.712
and the reflecting
upon later, you've

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.420
imprinted in your
brain that metapattern.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.480
And the later on, that day,
that week, that whatever,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.230
you're going to start
connecting the dots.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.370
Everywhere you go,
you're going to have

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.260
serendipitous encounters
with things that are

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.610
connected to that initial idea.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.270
Go to a bookstore and every
book you open to any single page

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.212
will review a clue.

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:24.670
And it's essentially,
again, you're

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.307
essentially priming
your brain to find

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:29.390
patterns and connections
to this particular thing.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.870
It's a way of cultivating
curiosity and cultivating

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.870
sort of mind maps and
neural networks in a way.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.740
And then again, you find
that the world is indeed

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.870
full of clues and you can
read your way through it.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.330
You have to figure out
what you're looking for.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.260
And you've got a program
that into your subconscious.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.306
So that's the
psycho-cybernetics.
