00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.176
3x+2 is an algebraic expression.

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:08.320
An algebraic expression has terms that
include numbers and variables that

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.672
are connected by addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.

00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:17.951
In 3x+2, 3x is a term, and 2 is a term.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:21.530
They're separated by
the operation of addition.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.552
Remember that a variable is a letter or
symbol that we use in an equation or

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:30.544
expression to represent
an unknown value.

00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:33.723
X is a very common letter to use for
a variable, but

00:00:33.723 --> 00:00:36.388
you could use any
letter in the alphabet.

00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:41.217
In the algebraic expression 3x+2,
we have not been given a value

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:45.040
that we can substitute in for
x, so x can be anything.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.349
For now, let's say that x=4.

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:51.801
If x=4, what is the value of 3x+2?

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:54.150
Please pick one.
