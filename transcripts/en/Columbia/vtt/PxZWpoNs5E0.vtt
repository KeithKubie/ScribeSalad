00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.700
Lisa Anderson: The optimism and generosity

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.280
of your remarks were very

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.940
compelling and you talked very briefly
at the end about the notion that there may

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.900
be a few obstacles or a few impediments

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.910
in a few places. And yet there are vast

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.910
swathes of this earth that have yet to
become stable democratic countries. So I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.329
wondered whether you'd be willing to expand

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.980
a little bit on the kinds of things that

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.440
from your experience represented surmountable
obstacles, in other words, things

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.500
that people would say, "Well, this is

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.030
really an impediment; Georgia will never

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.870
become democratic," and yet questions
of corruption, questions of development,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.860
so forth and so on, how exportable is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.989
the Georgian experience?

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.009
Mikheil Saakashvili: I think first of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.610
all I mean, all of these are universal, I
mean,

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.299
accountable government, transparency,

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.939
control by the people, I mean, daily

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.729
control, checks and balances, these are
the things that you cannot invent the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.420
bicycle. I mean, that's how it is. You

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.840
have independent media. You have civil

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.499
society. You have checks and balances
within government. You have

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.909
transparency and accountability and you

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.020
have the result. Now, of course there is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.789
always, I mean, there are all different
models that could be, I mean, for instance,

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.749
if you have too many special interests

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:48.179
(inaudible) purely parliamentary

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:53.950
government where parliamentary groups
have to come together and help to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.869
make a coalition government can be detrimental

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.579
at the initial stage.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.439
I mean, U.S. model is much more adjustable

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.859
to such situations with strong

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:07.499
executive but a strong parliament, a strong
legislature because what it brings, it

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.640
brings the system of checks and balances

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.020
where executive within its functions is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.790
less limited but the legislature can have
strong oversight. I think for societies in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.379
transition this model is better from many

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.819
points of view because special interests

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.709
will not prevail and basically swallow
all the resources of the society, because

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.680
direct rule of the people can often be

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.989
kind of overshadowed with the special

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.840
interests that do exist and we know it
from ourselves. You know, how we pulled

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.140
ourselves from month to month with our

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.069
old shoestrings was initially I came in.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.430
We didn't have cash to pay any salaries.
I mean, I came into my office and two

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.159
weeks after being President they brought

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.700
me my paycheck in an envelope and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.489
guess how much the President of Georgia
was making before me?

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.250
It was 20 U.S. dollars per two weeks,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.230
so 40 dollars per month. And when they

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.980
brought me I didn't know what it was and
when they told me it was my salary I

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.340
thought they were making fun of me because

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.799
my predecessor was very rich. He

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:28.379
is still one of the richest men in our
country. His ministers, who used to get even

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.870
less, their houses are the biggest ones

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.310
still in the capital and they enjoyed nice

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.409
lifestyles, I mean, with all these meager
salaries. But there of course was

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.170
nothing left to the government and to

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.999
the people so for 15 years nobody thought

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.769
about paving roads, nobody thought about
constructing schools, nobody thought

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.540
about, I mean, propping up at least some

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.879
kind of a military. Nobody thought

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.909
about, I mean, like, the way how police
functioned in our case was that the police

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.530
were told, "We are not going to pay you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.280
any salaries.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.379
You have to earn your own living with

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.480
bribes. We are not going to put gasoline

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.439
into your cars but you need to have some
kind of cars, which we are not going to

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.450
provide. You need to wear some kind of

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.030
uniform, which we are not going to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.890
provide but you should buy it from your
corrupt income. And not only we are not

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.000
going to pay you anything but you have

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.890
to bring us back monthly payments for

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.310
what you get from your poor population."
Of course in such a system everybody

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.730
was corrupt. But the point is that there

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.110
are many countries in the world where

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.140
there is such a system in different forms
and when basically the government is

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.760
licensed to live at the expense of their

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.290
people. Now, when we came in we said

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.730
we needed initial cash to pay salaries.
So we asked money from the United

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.480
Nations Development Program to pay initial

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.440
money for salaries to a few dozen

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.490
anti-corruption investigators and a few
hundred tax collectors.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.450
It enabled us to basically double our

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.060
tax collection within a very short period.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.450
And then we started to pay to the others.
Now, no official in Georgia gets lower

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.360
than minimum survival rate and some of

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.530
the salaries are rather high, I mean,

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.440
considering the (inaudible) per capita.
I think one of the high--highest in some

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.720
cases in Eastern Europe, I mean, in terms

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.890
of salaries, because this is essential.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.720
The first stage was to fix the government,
the bureaucracy. The second stage is

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.050
to do wider projects. Now, because we

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.720
have higher tax collection then people

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.050
should see the difference. They were tolerant
for the first year. I mean,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.820
somebody who has been getting $20 as a

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.740
pension was tolerant to see that some

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.930
minister is getting three to four to five
thousand dollars a month. But they are

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.800
tolerant. We explained to them that it's

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.760
necessary to improve their life (inaudible)

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.230
later. Later we have to show the results
and we are now building roads.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.710
The whole country is under reconstruction.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.290
We are building new power stations

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.400
to curb power shortages and this something
very visible already. People can

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.450
touch it, I mean, it's there. We are building

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.640
schools, we are building hospitals

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.680
and this is something else. At the same
time, by liberalizing the system and

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.250
moving the government away from the way

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.900
of business, because I don't believe

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.290
in any government interference in business
frankly. I mean, there was this

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.750
temptation among some of my friends as

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.910
well with noble intentions to say, "You

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.670
know, now we are going to go and get them.
We are going to get all these

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.710
greedy oligarchs. We are re-privatize,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.140
we are going to, you know, change things,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.520
you know, take over the business community.
Well, this is the worst thing you

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.370
can do because it's none of government's

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.960
business.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.140
What freedom means that you should leave

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.740
them alone and you should give

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.560
them guarantees that they will be left
alone except that you should keep

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.840
guarantees that if they have debates with

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.570
each other, if they have disputes to be

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.550
settled, judiciary will be efficient enough
to help them, to provide remedy. So

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.780
these are the stages of the way we are

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.930
working. And again, it's extremely

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.190
important to have assertive, efficient
government with strong cultural (inaudible)

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.460
legislature and from the media. But on

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.600
the other hand it's very important to

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.340
understand that there are some cases where
government should stay behind,

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.720
should not intervene in order for the

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.110
country to be successful. And that's another

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.560
lesson we learn. This is a very tough
lesson by the way. If you are coming from

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.810
Soviet past you always have this temptation

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.220
to go into the micromanagement of

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.180
private citizens' activities.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:59.000
And even the most noble intentions usually

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.680
bring us to very bad results. I think if

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.090
you look at our experience we had 8.7
percent growth last year. This year we

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.910
are expecting 10 percent growth. But the

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.820
main thing that happened is that the

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.680
income got re-stabled and the middle class
emerged. And that's my main result I

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.900
would say because, I mean, it's not so

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.060
much the increase of GDP per capita as

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:30.420
the increase of people who can already
be well off. I mean, 45 percent of our

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.490
population described in the polls themselves

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.630
identified their condition as fair

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.930
economically. Ten percent said that they
are doing very well. Now, two years

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:45.500
ago it was only five percent, and this

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.750
is self-identification. I am not saying that.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.900
They are saying this. Which means that
people have got some economic

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.210
optimism and middle class is emerging.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:55.390
And I think the middle class in the long

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:00.220
run is the main stability force for democracy
and for sustainable democratic free

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.250
development for every society where it

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:02.500
emerges.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.620
And I think this is another thing that's

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.440
coming in the world in general. Middle

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.160
class is getting larger and larger. I
mean, you can see it, you can see by

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.380
consumer spending. And the higher class

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:20.090
has been shrinking. I mean, really the

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:25.010
wealthiest ones their number is not growing
anymore and it's even shrinking.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.740
And this is a very important process.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.970
That's what makes the whole thing

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.840
universal.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:35.020
Lisa Anderson: I must say this is a fascinating

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.410
lesson in how one constructs a

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:42.410
democracy and not entirely consistent
with some of the platitudes, in any event,

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.860
that the democracy promoters often argue.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.080
Because you are insistent on actually

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.120
building government capacity and then
saying that there is a distinction between

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.200
the government and the private sector

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.670
is a fairly sophisticated way of

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:06.670
approaching this and clearly reasonably
successful. In a way you are playing

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.200
two roles right now. On the one hand it's

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.540
called the Rose Revolution. You are a

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:22.540
revolutionary. On the other hand you want
to sort of institutionalize this and

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.350
become merely a democratic leader. Is

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.620
that a difficult tension?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.490
Mikheil Saakashvili: Yes, yes, it is.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.960
Because what I am saying is that on the

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.670
one hand revolution itself was just the
initial stage. I mean, what followed was

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.590
cultural revolution, and the cultural

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.870
revolution is the continued changing

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:43.130
perceptions. And for that we need to constantly
be creating framework. I mean,

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.800
we are a small country of a little bit

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.010
less than 5 million people but it's still
a

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.690
country where we basically have this role

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.529
of framers. And when you are framing

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:58.990
something you also want to be part of
that system. And of course this is always

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.830
a tough challenge because on the other

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.330
hand it's just a regular democratic

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.670
process. You get elections, you get criticism,
you respond to criticism and you

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.650
cannot play really, I mean, the founding

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.660
father role. No. You are just down on

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.660
the ground and it's like it's not being
part of great gallery of historic heroes.\

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.960
I mean, at least for the time being. I

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.440
mean, this is something that is business as

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.690
usual, right? But on the other hand, yeah,
I think the main thing that will stay

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.990
behind us is Cultural Revolution and this

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.710
will make the whole process irreversible

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:44.980
and I think this is happening in Georgia,
this is happening in Ukraine but also in

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.930
the former Soviet Union. Even if there

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.940
was no regime change in other places,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.940
attitudes and perceptions also ruling
(inaudible) is changing. I mean, the first

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.520
reaction was that of fear and panic, I

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.400
mean, "What's going on? It's going to come

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:13.400
also to our countries. We are going to
have Mass." But I think now people

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.150
started to understand that first of all,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.180
revolutions and upheavals cannot be

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.380
provoked by opposition only.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.370
I mean, it's a both-way street. If the

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.970
government is stupid enough to all the time

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.820
make mistakes and basically respond to
even provocations from the opposition

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:33.620
then it's doomed. But if government is

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.000
smart enough to pre-empt and to adjust

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.960
and to make changes then, I mean, why
should somebody be changing regimes

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.370
taking hundreds of thousands of people

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.190
to the streets and standing there in

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.320
freezing rain for many weeks or months?
No. I mean, so what's really

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.670
happening, we are seeing that reform process

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.870
I am sure will become universal in

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.190
many places. And I have been meeting with
four other (inaudible) leaders and

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.730
they have been very realistic about it.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.290
You look what happened in Egypt. I

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:08.890
mean, people are critical about some aspects
of Egyptian political system but for

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.290
the first time the reality is that for

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.710
the first time there was an open debate there.
I

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.770
mean, there were candidates. They could

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.740
speak on television. They could get

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:24.630
their views known and that was normal.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.170
I mean, and even nobody was so much surprised

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.310
by this. We were, like, normal.

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.380
Three, four, five years ago it was unimaginable.
What happened in Lebanon, I

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.480
mean, the way they conducted (inaudible)

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480
campaign it was unimaginable a few

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.940
years ago. So what I am seeing is that
people everywhere started to understand

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.910
that, you know, it's not so simple anymore.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.740
Life will never be the same anymore.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:53.220
And those that don't understand that,
they are on their way out.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.330
Lisa Anderson: Well, I certainly hope

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.190
so. I have one more set of questions, so

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.760
those of you who are beginning to think
of your questions should prepare

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:07.640
yourselves. You have talked in your introductory

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.460
remarks about the role that the

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:14.680
democracy promotion of the Bush Administration
has played and even now you

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.230
have talked about the notion that Georgia

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.270
represents something of a model or an

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.550
example to other countries. What is the
role that outsiders can play promoting

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:24.310
democracy?

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.300
Mikheil Saakashvili: I think the main

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:34.300
outsider that helps us a lot was CNN and

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:41.600
television in general and media exposure
and the moral support that it generates

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.380
among other people. I don't think you

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.260
can artificially provoke anything. You

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.850
cannot pay for people to be in the street.
It's not possible. You can sometimes, I

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:51.339
guess, but, you know, those people to

00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:53.230
whom you pay whatever amount you pay,

00:14:53.230 --> 00:15:00.230
they won't stay there for a long time.
I mean, if people don't feel like being very

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.950
desperate even if you pay them like $100

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.460
an hour will stay there for a couple of

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.360
hours in the rain and they'll say they
had enough and they'll go home, I mean, be

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.500
happy with the money that they got. And

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.250
so the whole idea is that, you know,

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:25.210
they were paying the money, they were
trained in special camps. I think even

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.310
people who kind of circulated those ideas

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.899
no longer believe in that.

00:15:30.899 --> 00:15:33.390
They themselves understood that it's a

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.100
much more profound process and the

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:43.100
process is based in natural human longing
for freedom and for alternatives and

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:47.700
for debates and for their own participation

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.430
and empowerment. No matter how

00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:55.880
prosperous societies are, no matter what's
the GDP per capita, no matter what's

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.310
the level of retirement benefits, pensions,

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.500
you know, unemployment benefits, if

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:06.320
people don't feel that they are asked
they are going to revolt in protest. That's

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:11.459
the rule. And even in the poorest societies

00:16:11.459 --> 00:16:14.440
if people feel that they can express

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.850
themselves, their views can be heard,
that their views do matter, revolutions are

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.470
not going to happen. Even (inaudible)

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.390
or mass protests are not going to be that

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:31.350
often because people feel that they are
being...

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:37.120
Recently I met some young person from

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:41.899
a very well-off country, I mean, in Asia

00:16:41.899 --> 00:16:46.800
that's doing very well. I mean, like,
when I heard that he was from there I told

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.029
him, "Well, good for you. I mean, the

00:16:49.029 --> 00:16:52.470
country is doing very well. I mean, I have

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.550
seen on television nice new skyscrapers
(inaudible)." He said, "Who cares? We

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.790
want democracy. I mean, we want more democracy.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.060
I mean, it's not about all

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.539
these things." And this is true. I mean,
if you are a young person it's not all

00:17:06.539 --> 00:17:10.669
about the benefits you get. You want to

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:12.589
be part of it. You want to have

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:17.089
ownership in it, not to be just some kind
of personnel hired by somebody else.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.899
And I think that's the main driving force

00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:22.199
behind the change.

00:17:22.199 --> 00:17:26.239
Lisa Anderson: Can other governments support

00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:27.850
democracy? Are there things

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:32.659
that governments should or should not
do to say, "Yes, we want to help the

00:17:32.659 --> 00:17:33.940
democratic forces"?

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.769
Mikheil Saakashvili: Well, of course,

00:17:36.769 --> 00:17:40.249
it is always important to express position.

00:17:40.249 --> 00:17:47.249
I think what counts is moral support and
political position. And I don't believe, I

00:17:49.369 --> 00:17:49.980
mean, some people were saying the fact

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.360
that Secretary Rice said something in

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.869
support of democracy in the Middle East.
Some democrats in the Middle East

00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:57.239
were damaged as a result. I don't think

00:17:57.239 --> 00:18:00.470
it's true. I don't believe it's true. I mean,

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:07.470
yes, those people who thought that they
were damaged, I mean, they are the

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.600
enemies of freedom anyway. I mean, they

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.129
would look for any reasons to think

00:18:12.129 --> 00:18:18.289
that way. But otherwise, I mean, any kind
of disposition is also always very

00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:19.580
helpful.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.179
Lisa Anderson: Okay. Wonderful. There

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:25.610
are microphones in both the aisles so

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:28.899
those of you who would like to ask questions
should prepare yourselves. Sir, you

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:29.149
were there first.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.330
Unknown: Thank you. Mr. President, thanks

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.230
so much for your presentation.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:38.230
My name is (inaudible). I am a student
here at school of international affairs from

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:40.580
Kyrgyzstan.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.249
Mikheil Saakashvili: Sure.

00:18:41.249 --> 00:18:42.460
Unknown: I know Kyrgyzstan was the country

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.139
that following the example of

00:18:44.139 --> 00:18:47.330
Georgia had also such a revolution. But
the problem I think now with our

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.460
government is that if you get rid of the

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.820
old corrupt government you have new

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:58.230
corrupt officials that are apparently
coming to the power. How is Georgia fighting

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.960
this problem of corruption and how sustainable

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.169
are your reforms? For example,

00:19:02.169 --> 00:19:09.169
if you get to all the officials like the
police you have to find jobs for these people

00:19:09.409 --> 00:19:11.499
who are fired and how do you make sure

00:19:11.499 --> 00:19:13.879
that the new people are not taking

00:19:13.879 --> 00:19:15.460
bribes and are honest?

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.299
Mikheil Saakashvili: Very simple. I mean,

00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:20.080
first of all the main recipe here is not

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:27.080
to be afraid. Because we fired the whole
traffic police. Now, most of them had

00:19:29.539 --> 00:19:35.519
savings because they were corrupt and,

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:39.210
you know, like, my ideal is a policeman

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:45.100
opening a grocery store in the streets
and taking off his uniform. Now, the

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.360
problem is that we had a police officer

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.809
having a grocery store or controlling a

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:55.289
grocery store and being a policeman. Now,
we separated those two. I don't

00:19:55.289 --> 00:19:58.129
think to become a police officer you need

00:19:58.129 --> 00:19:59.679
ten years of extensive training at

00:19:59.679 --> 00:20:03.840
Columbia (inaudible) or somewhere. No.
Two months of police academy would

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.379
do in a proper system. And I think there

00:20:06.379 --> 00:20:08.190
are many checks and balances. First of

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.749
all, their salaries were increased 12
times at least, in some cases, 40 times, 50

00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:15.460
times in terms of high-level officials.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.739
Second, the whole climate in society changed.

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:21.950
Every night we have a show like

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:28.940
Cops on Georgian television. Police love
it because they are heroes. They are

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.690
covered on television. People know about

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.259
them and it's really becoming

00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:39.259
shameful to be corrupt because you are
out of system. I mean, it's no longer

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.070
fashionable. This is important. I mean,

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.850
no matter how much you pay, unless you

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:50.850
create this climate it's not going to
work. So this is the issue and in terms of

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.169
corruption it's not only about, like,

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:55.669
hearsay, like, I am saying, we have no

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:58.259
corruptions. Someone said maybe they are
corrupt. There are lots of people

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:00.600
who are saying in Georgia, "I'm from the

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.840
opposition. No, this government is ten

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.840
times more corrupt than the previous."
However, Georgia's overall aggregate

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:09.749
budget for the last two years grew eight

00:21:09.749 --> 00:21:11.749
times, eight times.

00:21:11.749 --> 00:21:15.759
This is the figure of index of reduction

00:21:15.759 --> 00:21:18.239
of corruption, local budgets and central

00:21:18.239 --> 00:21:22.200
budgets together. No matter who says what
that's the reality, eight times more

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.499
money is going to the government instead

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:26.570
of going into the pockets. And of

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.259
course we are a free country. There are
people who say that, I mean,

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:33.559
"Saakashvili is worse than anybody else

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:35.850
(inaudible), I mean, everything is

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:41.129
corrupt," but the results are here. We
for the 15 years of rule of my predecessor,

00:21:41.129 --> 00:21:44.309
seven kilometers of roads were built in

00:21:44.309 --> 00:21:47.379
Georgia, seven kilometers. This year only

00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:54.379
we are building 350, next year we'll build
600 to 800. This is the difference. I

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.619
mean, this is the first year where Georgia,

00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:58.840
theoretically at least, will not have any

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.210
shortages.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.350
We had huge shortages. This was a country,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.359
you know, in darkness for many,

00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:09.980
many years. And this is the result and
many, many others and many, many other

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:15.859
things. And it's just, the reality is

00:22:15.859 --> 00:22:17.470
if you are a\'85and I don't believe that,
you know,

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.109
like, if we don't get experienced officials

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:21.710
from previous government the country is

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:25.210
going to collapse. I think there are enough
knowledgeable people in societies.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.690
You just need to find them. I mean, you

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.600
go back and they should take you and

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.769
appoint as some minister, or maybe prime
minister. I don't know. I mean, we

00:22:35.769 --> 00:22:37.200
have been doing some experiments like

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.710
this. Sometimes they were good,

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:45.139
sometimes not. I am one of these experiments.
So I think Kyrgyzstan has some

00:22:45.139 --> 00:22:49.369
good prospects. I just spoke to your President,

00:22:49.369 --> 00:22:51.049
by the way. I think he

00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:52.419
understands what should be done.

00:22:52.419 --> 00:22:56.690
Zicanda Biari: My name is Zicanda Biari.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:00.539
I am a doctoral student in economics

00:23:00.539 --> 00:23:04.070
and education here and I am Albanian,
so I know a little thing or two about the

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.989
evilness of the communist regime. I was

00:23:07.989 --> 00:23:10.559
in Georgia the summer of 2004, and I

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:15.399
really want to congratulate you because
I already witnessed Georgian people

00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:17.249
being a lot more enthusiastic about their

00:23:17.249 --> 00:23:19.889
future and the country had already

00:23:19.889 --> 00:23:23.909
started to reconstruct. My question is
about China, one of the last strongholds of

00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:29.359
communism in the world right now. And

00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:33.539
there has been an editorial piece by a

00:23:33.539 --> 00:23:38.710
newspaper. It's called (Inaudible) Times
and its Chinese edition actually

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:42.239
published a piece called "Nine Commentaries

00:23:42.239 --> 00:23:45.249
on the Communist Party." In brief,

00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:50.539
what this is is an uncensored account
of the violence and deception the Chinese

00:23:50.539 --> 00:23:54.869
communist party has used to keep itself

00:23:54.869 --> 00:23:55.479
in power.

00:23:55.479 --> 00:24:00.729
And inspired by this article, to date

00:24:00.729 --> 00:24:04.039
there are 4.2 million Chinese people inside

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:09.269
and outside China renouncing their membership
to the communist party or other

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:11.889
communist organizations. And a lot of

00:24:11.889 --> 00:24:13.759
China observers think that this is the

00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:18.580
beginning of the end of the communism
in China and the Chinese communist

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.059
party will dissolve soon. And it seems

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:23.100
like you were optimistic about that in

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:28.279
general. So I have two questions. One
is about what is your prediction about

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:31.210
communism in the world today, particular

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:33.379
with reference to China, a country

00:24:33.379 --> 00:24:40.119
which is also supporting oppressive regimes
in I believe it was Kyrgyzstan there

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:42.159
were reports that they were trying to

00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:45.419
help the government there escape the

00:24:45.419 --> 00:24:45.999
(inaudible).

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:48.879
Lisa Anderson: We have long lines of questioners

00:24:48.879 --> 00:24:49.129
so--

00:24:49.019 --> 00:24:50.379
Zicanda Biari: Okay. I'll cut it short.

00:24:50.379 --> 00:24:53.149
And restating actually the question of

00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:58.359
Dean Anderson about what can the government
of democratic countries do to

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:00.489
support these democratic movements in

00:25:00.489 --> 00:25:03.470
these countries? It seems like we have

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.220
double standards. We have embargo for
Cuba but we have foreign investment

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.570
for China, and it seems that suddenly

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.159
foreign investment seems like a way to

00:25:13.159 --> 00:25:17.570
help the democracy in a country like China
but not in other countries. And

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.580
looking at the history of eastern communist

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.059
countries it was that economic

00:25:22.059 --> 00:25:26.570
isolation that really brought down these
communist governments. So what is

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.460
your comment on that?

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.139
Mikheil Saakashvili: Well, thank you.

00:25:30.139 --> 00:25:32.399
I mean, first of all I don't believe that

00:25:32.399 --> 00:25:38.210
communism has any future. I don't believe
in it in general. I mean, I grew up in a

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.359
family where communists were always hated

00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:44.960
but because of that most of that

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.200
family has been destroyed in communist
purges. And my great-grandfather who

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.070
died when I was 17 years old and I grew

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.720
basically his home, spent 12 years in

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:03.619
Siberia, his brother was 20 years there,
all brothers of my grandmother were shot

00:26:03.619 --> 00:26:06.509
and her father was killed. So, I mean,

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:10.109
we know it first-hand. I mean, and you

00:26:10.109 --> 00:26:14.789
know that last year there was the poll.
I don't know whether it's I mean, the poll

00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:17.330
is right whether you share the same experience

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:18.289
but Georgians were second most

00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:23.080
optimistic people in Europe but the Albanians
were first most optimistic people in

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.580
Europe. I mean, if you are coming out

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.379
of the country of (inaudible) it's no wonder

00:26:30.379 --> 00:26:32.419
that you might be optimistic.

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:35.830
Nothing can be worse or everything looks

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.820
better than under (inaudible), that's

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:44.929
obvious, I mean, and but the reality is
that I don't think communism has any

00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:48.739
future because it kills competition, it

00:26:48.739 --> 00:26:52.690
kills freedom (inaudible) and what it really

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:59.690
brings is that mediocre people succeed.
It kills talent because the way it is, you

00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:02.269
know, when I was first year student at

00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:04.769
the University they put me on the blacklist

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:10.720
of KGB and I was finished. I would have
never got a job. Maybe I wouldn't have

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.399
been arrested but I would be unemployed.

00:27:13.399 --> 00:27:16.100
I would be always under the watchful

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:22.850
eye of the communist party or KGB and,
you know, if they notice that you are

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.919
kind of out of mainstream, I mean, you

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:30.409
were finished. And normally educated

00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:33.239
and talented people that's how they normally
are, right?

00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:37.580
Communism cultivates these mediocre personalities.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.690
That's the reality. And

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:45.169
that's something that was proved many
times in examples of many countries.

00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:50.700
Now, how to treat concrete countries,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.710
it's very hard to say, I don't believe in,
say,

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.210
isolating China, I don't believe in it.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.349
How can you isolate China? I mean, China

00:27:59.349 --> 00:28:03.999
can isolate anybody else if it wants to.
This is a huge economy, very rapidly

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:08.669
growing one, very dynamic, I mean, and

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:11.190
I would say that I wouldn't agree on

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.289
assessment of Chinese foreign policy.
My understanding is China has been

00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:18.179
behaving in foreign policy in a very moderate

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:20.409
way in many respects, unlike some

00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:24.330
other countries. I don't really know anything
about Kyrgyzstan. Now, talking

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.450
about views about general political systems

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.229
I already told you. I mean, I believe

00:28:30.229 --> 00:28:36.659
that still liberal democracy has no alternative
for anybody in the world. And as I

00:28:36.659 --> 00:28:41.049
told you, you'll witness that every country

00:28:41.049 --> 00:28:43.139
will live within such system in the

00:28:43.139 --> 00:28:43.940
foreseeable future.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.019
Lisa Anderson: Sir.

00:28:45.019 --> 00:28:46.649
Chris Baldwin: Sir, Chris Baldwin, graduate

00:28:46.649 --> 00:28:50.960
school of journalism, sir, the

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.779
(inaudible), the international research
and exchange board, an NGO instrumental

00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:56.769
in cultivating democracy in the Former

00:28:56.769 --> 00:28:58.690
Soviet Union by providing educational

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.629
opportunities for outstanding scholars
from these countries among other things,

00:29:01.629 --> 00:29:04.960
including yourself here at Columbia with

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.190
the Muskie Fellowship, has been kicked

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.450
out of Uzbekistan. Systematically the
(inaudible) regime is eliminating the very

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.309
institutions that were key in Georgia

00:29:13.309 --> 00:29:16.239
and Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. What options are

00:29:16.239 --> 00:29:20.460
left to the Uzbek people and how important
are these civil society and

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.369
democracy-building institutions?

00:29:21.369 --> 00:29:27.679
Mikheil Saakashvili: Well, I mean, first

00:29:27.679 --> 00:29:33.820
of all, I'd really agree about on the

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:39.269
important role to be played by actors
like (inaudible) especially educational

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:45.489
institutions because without them I would

00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:47.879
have stood no chance to come here,

00:29:47.879 --> 00:29:54.879
no chance, I mean, I came here and I kept
complaining in the beginning of my

00:29:56.279 --> 00:29:59.529
speech about, you know, toughness of the

00:29:59.529 --> 00:30:02.359
New York environment but on the

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:07.389
other hand (inaudible) in absolutely exclusive
environment. I mean, the name of

00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:09.720
my professors included not only for instance,

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.139
Kofi Annan, who is the present

00:30:12.139 --> 00:30:16.179
secretary general of the U.N., but also
Oscar Schachter who wrote the charter of

00:30:16.179 --> 00:30:19.509
the U.N. who just died two years ago unfortunately

00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:23.979
but, I mean, people who

00:30:23.979 --> 00:30:29.529
made history, who were historians themselves.

00:30:29.529 --> 00:30:35.139
And I remember (inaudible) was teaching

00:30:35.139 --> 00:30:37.539
me international law and he was also

00:30:37.539 --> 00:30:40.909
himself a living memory of everything
that happened here. I mean, it was '93 and

00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:47.539
he would go talk about some topic, say

00:30:47.539 --> 00:30:51.690
about '50s. And he would say, "But the

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.979
fact that this convention was not signed
then was their fault," and point at me like

00:30:56.979 --> 00:31:03.719
I was former Soviet student. Why should

00:31:03.719 --> 00:31:06.059
I take the blame for Kruschev,

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:11.909
Brezhnev and Stalin? Sorry, I mean, I
was (inaudible) and I said, "Professor, I

00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:14.029
mean, please leave me alone. I mean, I

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:18.590
have nothing to do with that." But the

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:23.629
reality is that education is the key and
what's happening now for instance in

00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:26.200
(inaudible) they set up a university for

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.229
students from Belarus, and lots of young

00:31:29.229 --> 00:31:31.450
activists from (inaudible) are coming
there to study.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.690
And I think this is the thing, we should

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:35.969
spread information. We should give them

00:31:35.969 --> 00:31:41.469
the education. We should cultivate civil
society. We should talk more about this.

00:31:41.469 --> 00:31:43.590
I mean, all international channels are

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.539
available everywhere else. I mean, BBC

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:50.039
World can be seen everywhere, CNN is everywhere,
you know, Voice of America

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:52.989
is everywhere. You just talk about that,

00:31:52.989 --> 00:31:55.889
you know. There might be that we were

00:31:55.889 --> 00:32:00.659
desperate when in Georgia for some days.
Georgia was covered better. I'll tell

00:32:00.659 --> 00:32:02.159
you why, because when Georgia things were

00:32:02.159 --> 00:32:04.729
happening people were expecting

00:32:04.729 --> 00:32:09.090
violence. So CNN immediately arrived on
the spot, BBC was on the spot,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.539
everybody was on the spot waiting when

00:32:10.539 --> 00:32:13.969
we would start to kill each other. In

00:32:13.969 --> 00:32:20.969
case of Ukraine, I mean, for weeks nobody
would show up except the Georgians

00:32:22.129 --> 00:32:26.099
who cashed in on renting out their equipment

00:32:26.099 --> 00:32:28.029
later because when the Westerners

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:31.219
finally understood that something is happening
they came in with one suitcase

00:32:31.219 --> 00:32:32.549
without any special equipment.

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:35.559
And Georgian equipment was already there.

00:32:35.559 --> 00:32:37.529
But we were desperate because

00:32:37.529 --> 00:32:40.619
things are happening, they are faking
elections and nobody speaks about it.

00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:43.659
"What's going on?" So in this, things

00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:46.559
really do matter about this specific situation

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:53.200
there should be more discussion and I
am sure that will inevitable, did such a

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.479
moral thing value that I mean, you sit

00:32:55.479 --> 00:32:57.729
somewhere you think the world has

00:32:57.729 --> 00:33:02.989
forgotten about you and suddenly somebody
comes out, some expert like you

00:33:02.989 --> 00:33:05.349
from Columbia and speaks about the situation

00:33:05.349 --> 00:33:08.340
in their ex-country. I mean, every

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:13.469
freedom-loving person in that country
would immediately cheer up and say, "We

00:33:13.469 --> 00:33:15.639
have hope." So that's the things that

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:17.859
should be done. I will take only one last

00:33:17.859 --> 00:33:18.109
question.

00:33:17.889 --> 00:33:18.139
Lisa Anderson: I am sorry to all the rest

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:18.489
of you.

00:33:18.489 --> 00:33:21.830
Mikheil Saakashvili: I am really sorry.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.960
Lisa Anderson: He has things to do, as

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.969
you can well imagine. You have the

00:33:26.969 --> 00:33:27.219
opportunity here.

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:27.570
Andrew Carter: My name's Andrew Carter.

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:32.609
I am a student at the school of

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:36.289
international public affairs. You already
eluded to this earlier in your remarks but

00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:39.559
I am curious if you can elaborate on what

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:42.279
you would like your own legacy to be

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:48.109
and specifically, I mean, to what extent
does your ideal legacy involve a re-

00:33:48.109 --> 00:33:49.409
imagining of Georgia's international policy,

00:33:49.409 --> 00:33:50.229
perhaps reorientation towards

00:33:50.229 --> 00:33:52.200
Europe, perhaps eventual membership in
the European Union, many years off,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.349
but in general just a more independent

00:33:54.349 --> 00:33:57.840
international personality for your country

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:04.840
and then how are you hoping to go about
doing that over the coming years?

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.270
Mikheil Saakashvili: Well, we don't have

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.020
global ambitions. We are a small

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.960
country trying to survive in a very complicated
geopolitical environment.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.679
However, I mean, Georgian example inspired

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:22.319
lots of people all around the world,

00:34:22.319 --> 00:34:27.839
 and that's inspiring for us as well. I
mean, President Bush came to Georgia and

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:30.470
spoke about Georgia like it was beacon

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.039
of liberty. He said for the whole world

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:36.679
and, "You Georgia," he told us, "created
one of the most important moments of

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:39.299
history." I mean, what small nation would

00:34:39.299 --> 00:34:42.529
not be proud of such remarks? I

00:34:42.529 --> 00:34:48.379
mean, we were proud. We are still very
proud. So this is one thing. The other is

00:34:48.379 --> 00:34:50.720
Georgia is a European country. Now, it's

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:54.010
a matter of recognizing it, it's a matter

00:34:54.010 --> 00:35:01.010
of getting there. I believe that there
is a realistic chance within my presidential

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:03.880
term, I mean, under constitution I might

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.730
have two terms, I'm talking about first

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:11.230
term that ends by the end of 2008 to speak
about Georgia's integration into

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:12.220
NATO.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.940
I mean, we are speaking about it. We have

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.220
realistic expectations about it. And I

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:22.130
think things are going to move much faster
than people would imagine. Now,

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:26.220
once we solve the problem with NATO we

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.079
also regard this as entry ticket to other

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:32.680
European institutions because it's a guarantee
for further economic development,

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:36.520
for democratic development, for further

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:41.740
empowerment of our people and for more

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:48.740
enthusiasm and hope. And I think today
many things appear to be very bleak

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:59.160
and unresolved, of course. But a few years

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:01.079
ago when they started to speak

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:07.569
about extension of Baltic countries to
NATO people thought that it was a joke.

00:36:07.569 --> 00:36:10.549
Former Soviet countries in NATO, it was

00:36:10.549 --> 00:36:12.650
inconceivable for 90 percent of the

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:13.349
Europeans.

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:16.260
It happened, not only to NATO but then

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.619
the European Union it happened.

00:36:18.619 --> 00:36:22.930
Nobody thought about Romania and Bulgaria
just a few years ago. It's

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:26.210
happening, it's happening and no matter

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:27.690
what it's going to matter. They are

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:34.690
already in NATO and they will also join
the European Union and so are we. We

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.119
are in the region of whom most of the

00:36:39.119 --> 00:36:42.190
people have never heard before, right? As

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:49.190
I told you, when I was here we were fighting
bloody war with forces that came

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.960
into Georgia from Russia, basically Russian

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.559
troops. Nobody cared about it

00:36:55.559 --> 00:37:02.559
because I remember very well Gary Hart
whom you might remember, I mean, I

00:37:02.839 --> 00:37:05.260
certainly remember him very well because

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.279
when I was a child he was a big

00:37:09.279 --> 00:37:11.359
superstar in American politics.

00:37:11.359 --> 00:37:14.520
And he came to speak to this\'85not to

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.549
this hall, to the other one, the other building

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:24.549
it was. He was invited by the school of
political science. And it was '93 and of

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:26.470
course he was kind of very critical of

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.240
Clinton at that time, you know, like, it was

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.039
visible that he was saying that Clinton
basically took his role. He said Clinton

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:36.760
was junior aide (inaudible) my campaign.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.279
This guy has no brains. I mean, his

00:37:39.279 --> 00:37:46.279
wife is guiding him, things like that.
I mean, he was pretty nasty. And this was

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.619
like my hero. I always thought he was

00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:53.549
a big charismatic figure. At certain

00:37:53.549 --> 00:37:57.680
moment by criticizing Clinton he went
so far as to say this was the moment when

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.349
Georgia is fighting war and I'm nervous

00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:03.099
and nobody cares. And Clinton made

00:38:03.099 --> 00:38:06.510
some statement about us a few days before.
He was the only one even then that

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.359
made a statement. No European leader cared

00:38:09.359 --> 00:38:10.750
about Georgia at that moment.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:17.260
And he said he went he is so unserious

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.380
that he even made this stupid statement

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.539
and he said, "Why in the world should
we care about territorial integrity of some

00:38:23.539 --> 00:38:29.359
Republic of Georgia?" And this was, like,

00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:32.859
I mean, the very second he died for me

00:38:32.859 --> 00:38:38.260
as a person. I mean, he got totally destroyed.
He committed political suicide in

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:43.180
my eyes. And I was like, what? I mean,

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.539
we are some certain country that

00:38:45.539 --> 00:38:52.539
nobody should care about? That's what
he said. By the way, when I met Clinton

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.559
I wanted to thank him but I was like,

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:02.579
"Thank you for making that statement that

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:09.579
Gary Hart didn't like." But the reality
was such that 12 years ago saying that one

00:39:09.619 --> 00:39:11.109
day the President of the United States

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:13.210
will go to this certain country of Georgia

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:18.099
and proclaim that it's example for the
whole world is unimaginable. So after that

00:39:18.099 --> 00:39:24.710
nothing is unimaginable anymore. I mean,

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:26.559
definitely we'll get to the European

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:31.819
union faster than people will go to Mars.
And they are going to go to Mars quite

00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:34.180
soon. Okay. Thank you very much for seeing

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:34.430
me.
