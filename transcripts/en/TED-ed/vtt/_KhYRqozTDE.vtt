00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.106
On March 3, 1913,

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:12.175
protesters parted for the woman in white:

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:15.566
dressed in a flowing cape and 
sitting astride a white horse,

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.077
the activist Inez Milholland was 
hard to miss.

00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:22.096
She was riding at the helm of the 
Women’s Suffrage Parade-

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:26.556
the first mass protest for a woman’s 
right to vote on a national scale.

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:29.545
After months of strategic planning 
and controversy,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.420
thousands of women gathered 
in Washington D.C.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.559
Here, they called for a constitutional 
amendment granting them the right to vote.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
By 1913, women’s rights activists had 
been campaigning for decades.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.114
As a disenfranchised group,

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:48.853
women had no voice in the laws that 
affected their– or anyone else’s– lives.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:53.770
However, they were struggling to secure 
broader support for political equality.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.127
They’d achieved no major victories 
since 1896,

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.352
when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women.

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:04.191
That brought the total number of states
which recognized a women’s right to vote

00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:05.490
to four.

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.271
A new, media-savvy spirit arrived 
in the form of Alice Paul.

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.863
She was inspired by the British 
suffragettes,

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:16.253
who went on hunger strikes and endured
imprisonment in the early 1900s.

00:01:16.253 --> 00:01:19.934
Rather than conduct costly campaigns 
on a state-by-state basis,

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:24.027
Paul sought the long-lasting impact 
of a constitutional amendment,

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:27.213
which would protect women’s voting 
rights nationwide.

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:30.760
As a member of the National American 
Women Suffrage Association,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.228
Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip 
up support and rejuvenate the movement.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.835
Washington authorities initially 
rejected her plan-

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:41.201
and then tried to relegate the march 
to side streets.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.651
But Paul got those decisions overturned

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.112
and confirmed a parade for the day 
before the presidential inauguration

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:48.668
of Woodrow Wilson.

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:50.714
This would maximize media coverage

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:53.850
and grab the attention of the 
crowds who would be in town.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.087
However, in planning the parade,

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:59.731
Paul mainly focused on appealing to 
white women from all backgrounds,

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.773
including those who were racist.

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:04.477
She actively discouraged African 
American activists

00:02:04.477 --> 00:02:06.567
and organizations from participating-

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:09.942
and stated that those who did so 
should march in the back.

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:13.133
But black women would not be 
made invisible in a national movement

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:14.476
they helped shape.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:15.626
On the day of the march,

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:17.072
Ida B. Wells-Barnett,

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:20.807
a ground-breaking investigative journalist
and anti-lynching advocate,

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:25.789
refused to move to the back and 
proudly marched under the Illinois banner.

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:29.337
The co-founder of the NAACP, 
Mary Church Terrell,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:33.675
joined the parade with the 22 founders 
of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority,

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.677
an organization created by female 
students from Howard University.

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.020
In these ways and more,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.604
black women persevered 
despite deep hostility

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:43.253
from white women in the movement,

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:46.068
and at great political and physical risk.

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:47.516
On the day of the parade,

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:50.519
suffragists assembled to create a 
powerful exhibition.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.204
The surging sections of the procession 
included international suffragists,

00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:57.373
artists, performers and business-owners.

00:02:57.373 --> 00:02:59.909
Floats came in the form of golden 
chariots;

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.059
an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map 
of enfranchised countries.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:05.910
On the steps of the Treasury Building,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.680
performers acted out the historical 
achievements of women to a live orchestra.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.191
The marchers carried on even as a 
mob blocked the route,

00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:16.683
hurling insults and spitting at women, 

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:20.202
tossing cigars, and physically 
assaulting participants.

00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:21.795
The police did not intervene,

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:25.316
and in the end, 
over 100 women were hospitalized.

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:28.234
Their mistreatment, widely reported 
throughout the country,

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:30.654
catapulted the parade into the public eye—

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:33.439
and garnered suffragists greater sympathy.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.793
National newspapers lambasted the police,

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:39.224
and Congressional hearings investigated 
their actions during the parade.

00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:42.277
After the protest, the "Women’s Journal" 
declared,

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:47.220
“Washington has been disgraced. Equal 
suffrage has scored a great victory."

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.127
In this way,

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.148
the march initiated a surge
of support for women’s voting rights

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.228
that endured in the coming years.

00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:56.290
Suffragists kept up steady pressure 
on their representatives,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.617
attended rallies, and petitioned 
the White House.

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:02.413
Inez Milholland, the woman on 
the white horse,

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:05.142
campaigned constantly throughout 
the United States,

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:07.803
despite suffering from chronic 
health problems.

00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:10.669
She did not live to see her efforts 
come to fruition.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.064
In 1916,

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:16.561
she collapsed while giving a 
suffrage speech and died soon after.

00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:18.197
According to popular reports,

00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:19.818
her last words were,

00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:23.834
“Mr. President, how long must women 
wait for liberty?”

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.467
Though full voting inclusion 
would take decades,

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:29.959
in 1920, Congress ratified the 
19th amendment,

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:34.189
finally granting women the right to vote.
