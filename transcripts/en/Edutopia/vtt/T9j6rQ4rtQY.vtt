00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.606
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: Research shows that if
the student's in the right mindset

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:11.246
and they get their sensory needs met,

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:12.976
they're going to be much
better learners.

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:18.926
&gt;&gt;Heather: Hands to your heart space.

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:20.426
Take a deep breath in.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:22.626
[ inhale, exhale ]

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.716
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: The sensory room is probably
my most important piece of the day.

00:00:29.976 --> 00:00:33.096
Students go to the sensory room
in order to calm their bodies

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:36.686
and get all the emotions out and
stabilize themselves, so they're ready

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:37.896
to learn and they're happy.

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:40.736
&gt;&gt;Heather: When we designed
the sensory room,

00:00:40.736 --> 00:00:42.586
we actually took the entire room apart.

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:46.956
We carpeted the floor so that we
could absorb some of the sound.

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:52.376
We put the shades on the ceiling to
change the light, so when they walk

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:55.196
in that room, they feel the change.

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:57.296
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: My class specifically,

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:00.456
we utilize the room once a
day for a thirty minute break.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.926
&gt;&gt;Heather: First thing that
they do is go on the ball

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.306
and they bounce to a metronome.

00:01:05.486 --> 00:01:05.776
&gt;&gt;Clap.

00:01:06.176 --> 00:01:08.966
&gt;&gt;It's really a way to
ground them into the space

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:12.986
and give them some sensory input, before
we have them go out into the room.

00:01:13.586 --> 00:01:16.036
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: We're going to
do our rotation now, okay?

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:18.586
&gt;&gt;So there's different
stations in the sensory room,

00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:21.326
and some of my students
love specific stations.

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:25.886
One in particular loves the
punching bags and the ropes.

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:30.886
He's able to get all that anger and
frustration out, so that calms him down.

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:33.966
Whereas another student, I know
he needs calming movements,

00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:36.376
so he's on the swing
going back and forth.

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:40.946
&gt;&gt;Heather: Another area in
the room is the crash pad.

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:45.686
You will see students that have sensory
issues bump into walls, bang their head.

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:49.836
So what we've created is a
safe space to crash into.

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.746
And then there's the light wall.

00:01:52.246 --> 00:01:54.366
You could use your hands,
you could use your feet.

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:56.656
There's different games that
are programmed on there.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:57.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, good girl.

00:01:58.976 --> 00:02:01.886
&gt;&gt;Heather: We also work on
balance and coordination.

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:06.426
The walking path works on all of those,
and they have to right themselves,

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:08.346
correct their body in space.

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:10.576
We have ten pound slam balls.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:16.106
Some students just need to come in,
pick something heavy up and throw it.

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:18.566
That's the essence of a sensory room.

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:21.636
You're putting materials in
there that are appropriate,

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.196
so a student's not throwing a chair.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.706
And at the end when they
finish with their stations,

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:29.826
they lay on the floor
and they're squished.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:34.176
So everything that we do in there is
predictable, there's a set sequence.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:35.776
&gt;&gt;Cheryl: We're all done
with sensory room.

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:38.116
We're going to walk back to our class.

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:41.126
&gt;&gt;So after the sensory room,
they're able to focus more.

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:44.916
They're quieter and their hands
are to themselves, and they're able

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:46.386
to listen to my directions.

00:02:46.386 --> 00:02:49.546
We're here, we came from the
sensory room, we're ready to learn.

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:51.806
&gt;&gt;How does the sensory
room make you feel?

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:52.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Happy.
