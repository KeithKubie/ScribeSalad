00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.220
We are on number 11.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.570
Sonia customized her bicycle by
exchanging the front wheel

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.330
for a wheel that had 1/2 the
diameter of the back wheel.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.140
So this'll be a weird
looking bicycle.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.510
We're going to have a small
wheel in front, and then--

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.830
let's see if I can
draw a bicycle.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.610
Oh, it looks like it.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.510
I don't know.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.300
Then you have a huge wheel
in the back, right?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.490
Because the diameter of this
wheel is 1/2 of the diameter

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.940
of that wheel.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.030
Now when Sonia rides the
bicycle, how many revolutions

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.550
does the front wheel
make for each

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.210
revolution of the back wheel?

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.030
All right.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.550
When you do this problem, how
many revolutions does the

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.920
front wheel make for each
revolution of the back wheel?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.140
And let me just make sure it
says that the front wheel has

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.402
1.2 the diameter of
the back wheel.

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:56.410
So let me ask you a question.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.620
If the back wheel goes
around-- well, that's

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.550
essentially what it
was just asking.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.260
Let's make up numbers.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.260
Let's say that the back wheel's
diameter-- or let's

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.900
say it's radius.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380
Let's say the back wheel
has a radius of 2.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.666
So then, what's its
circumference?

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.670
Its circumference, for the back
wheel, would be 2 pi r.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.000
So it would be, 2 times
pi times 2, which is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.220
equal to 4 pi, right?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.920
The circumference of this has
1/2 the diameter, so it would

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.930
also have 1/2 the radius.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.010
So the circumference will
just be 2 pi r,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.420
which would be 2 pi.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.980
So this one, if you have 1/2
the diameter, you also have

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.540
1/2 the circumference.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.840
And so when this wheel does 1
revolution, how far has the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.350
bicycle traveled, assuming
the wheel

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.080
hasn't skidded or anything?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.355
Well, when this back wheel does
1 revolution, the bicycle

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:56.850
would have traveled 4 pi,
whatever our units.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.480
4 pi feet, if that's
our units, right?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.900
So if the bicycle's traveled
the 4 pi units.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.460
It's going to travel 4 pi units
on the front of the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.720
bicycle as well.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.600
So if we've traveled 4 pi units,
how many times does

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.290
this wheel have to turn around
to travel 4 pi units?

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.440
Well, in one revolution,
this wheel, it's 2 pi.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.760
So this wheel actually has
to turn around twice.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.770
It turns around twice
for every 1

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.170
revolution of the big wheel.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.130
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.340
You just realize that 1
revolution of the big wheel is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.800
going to be twice the
circumference

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.830
of the front wheel.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.130
And so the front wheel has to
turn around twice when the

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.660
bike goes over that
same distance.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.510
So the answer to their
question is, how many

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.490
revolutions does the front wheel
make for each revolution

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.410
of the back wheel?

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.090
Well, the answer is, C.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.270
That looks like an E, but
the answer is C, 2.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:57.090
Problem number 12.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.270
All right.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.940
A list of numbers contains
p positive

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.290
and n negative numbers.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.870
So p pos, n negative.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.970
If a number is picked at random
from the list, the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.090
probability that the number
is positive is 3/5.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.180
What is the value of n/p?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:31.920
OK, so the probability of
getting a positive is 3/5.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.360
So what is the probability
of getting a positive?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.190
Our probability of getting
a positive is going

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.440
to be equal to p/n?

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.150
That's the probability of the
number of positive numbers we

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.630
have over the total numbers
we have, right?

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.720
That's the probability
of getting a

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.050
positive number, right?

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.460
If this was red marbles and blue
marbles, the probability

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.850
of getting a red marble would be
the number of red over the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.890
total number of marbles,
right?

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.620
So similar here.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.540
It's the number of
positive numbers

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.700
over the total numbers.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.630
And the total numbers are the
positive numbers plus the

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.130
negative numbers.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.770
And now, they are asking us for
what is the value-- Well

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.070
OK, I just want to make sure
I'm doing it right.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.725
If the number is picked at
random from the list, the

00:04:15.725 --> 00:04:17.900
probability that the number is
positive-- right, this is the

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.959
probability that's positive
is 3/5-- what is

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.640
the value of n/p?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.000
So now I'll solve for n/p.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.510
So we could cross multiply
here, right?

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.820
So we could say 5p is equal
to 3 times this, is

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.790
equal to 3p plus 3n.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.610
I just cross multiplied.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.320
And then, let's see, subtract
p from both sides.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.050
You get 2p is equal to 3n.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.560
And we want to figure
out n/p, right?

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.320
So let's divide both
sides by p.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.530
So you get 2 is equal to 3n/p.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.750
And let's divide both
sides by 3.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.160
And you get 2/3 is
equal to n/p.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.550
And we are done.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.390
n/p is equal to 2/3,
which is choice C.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.840
Wasn't too bad.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.390
Problem 13.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.420
Clear image, invert colors.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.640
And I will do it in
this tacky green.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.220
Problem 13.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.060
The total daily cost, c, in
dollars, of producing x units

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.920
of a certain product is
given by the function.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.380
All right, we've got a cost
function right here. c of x is

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:56.150
equal to 600x minus
200 over x plus k.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.640
And they're telling us
k is a constant.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.710
And x is less than,
or equal to, 100.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.520
Fair enough.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.790
If 20 units were produced
yesterday for a total cost of

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.970
$640, what is the value of k?

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.430
So 20 units.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.910
So they're essentially saying
that c of 20, the cost of

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.930
producing 20 units,
is equal to $640.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.660
So we can just use this
information to

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.660
now solve for k.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.950
So c of 20 is going to be
equal-- put in 20 to this

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:37.520
equation-- so it's 600
times 20 minus 200.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.870
All of that over 20, right?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.150
C of 20, right?

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.120
All of that over 20.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.810
Plus k.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.400
I can't forget the plus k-- plus
k is equal to-- we know

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.870
that equals to 640, right?

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.150
And what is this equal to?

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.920
Well, we actually don't even
have to multiply it, right?

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.880
Because this is 600 times 20.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.060
And what's 200?

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.880
200 is 10 times 20, right?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.390
So you can divide the top
and the bottom by 20.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.950
So you have 20, 20, 20.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.850
So you're just left with 600.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.290
I mean, you could multiply it
out if you don't understand

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.710
what I just did.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:20.770
But you get 600 minus 10
plus k is equal to 640.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.600
So you get 590 plus
k is equal to 640.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.970
Subtract 590 from both sides.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.732
You get k is equal to 50.

00:07:29.732 --> 00:07:33.476
And that is choice B.

00:07:33.476 --> 00:07:41.210
So you really just have
to substitute the x

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.850
into our cost function.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.120
And then set that
equal to $640.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.930
And you've solved for k.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:54.830
Problem 14.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:04.740
For how many ordered pairs of
positive integers x, y is 2x

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:11.270
plus 3y less than 6?

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.340
So these are positive
integers, right?

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.160
We could figure them out.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.640
The 0, we can't use 0.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.060
If x is 1, what can y equal?

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.970
So then we have 2 plus
3y is less than 6.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.990
This is a case of
x is equal to 1.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.460
So then we'd have 3y
is less than 4.

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.470
So we'd have y would have
to be less than 4/3.

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.200
So the only situation where y
is less than 4/3 is y would

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.510
have to be 1, right?

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.440
Because that's the
only positive

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.900
integer less than 4/3.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:54.440
If x is 2, then we have
4 plus 3y, right?

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.040
2 times 2 is less than 6.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.770
And so you have 3y
is less than 2.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.330
y is less than 2/3.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.170
Well, I don't see any positive
integers that

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.030
are less than 2/3.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.910
So x can't even be equal
to 2, right?

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.040
So neither of these numbers
can get any

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.410
bigger than 1 or 1.

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.800
So there's only 1 ordered pair
of positive integers that--

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.680
positive integers, and that's
the trick-- that satisfy this

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.280
equation, 1 and 1.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.660
And we know, because
immediately, when we just

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.920
raise one of them above 2, we
get above 6, no matter what.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.340
We can't find a positive integer
that satisfies it.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:34.890
So that's it.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.210
It's just choice A.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.320
Not too bad.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.000
And I will see you in
the next video.
