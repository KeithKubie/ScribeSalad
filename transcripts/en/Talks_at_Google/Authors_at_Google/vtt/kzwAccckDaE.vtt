SUSANNAH GIBSON: Well, thank
you very much, Christina.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.110
And thank you, everyone.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.235
I'm just going to move
this, because I can't really

00:00:09.235 --> 00:00:10.410
see your faces.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.720
Thank you so much for
coming along today.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.310
Right, so my talk
today is titled

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.518
"Animal, Vegetable, Mineral."

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:18.230
And let's start
off with a picture.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.124
Does anyone know what these are?

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:21.130
AUDIENCE: Corals.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.380
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Yeah, corals.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.245
Exactly.

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:26.850
And do you know if coral
is an animal, a vegetable,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.592
or a mineral?

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:29.900
AUDIENCE: Animal.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.900
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Wow,
you guys are good.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.100
But how did you know that?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.534
What is it that makes
coral an animal?

00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:39.200
There aren't any right
or wrong answers.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.930
It's history.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.327
It's not science,
so just shout out.

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:44.130
AUDIENCE: It's
made up of polyps.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.130
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Uh-huh.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.044
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:47.044 --> 00:00:49.460
SUSANNAH GIBSON: So you're
just taking that one step back.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.045
So what makes a polyp an
animal, would you say?

00:00:52.045 --> 00:00:53.584
AUDIENCE: Sense of smell.

00:00:53.584 --> 00:00:54.500
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Yeah.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.916
Again, there are
no wrong answers.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.460
So anything you can think
of, just shout it out.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.010
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
photosynthesize.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.111
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Yeah,
that's a good one.

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.569
So you guys have given quite
a few different reasons there,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.130
involving cells, photosynthesis,
and the polyp-y nature

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.990
of things, for saying that
something is an animal rather

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.500
than a plant or a mineral.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.460
Now, the scientists
today are indeed

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.270
pretty certain,
pretty confident,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.554
about saying that
corals are animals.

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:21.220
They're pretty certain
about classifying

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.540
lots of different things today.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.600
But I want to talk about the
long and convoluted history

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.150
of that certainty, how
we got to that part,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.010
and more interestingly,
I think, the fact

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.670
that when you start to pick
apart the certainty, things

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.860
become much more
tenuous, more uncertain,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.040
there are more questions.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.460
So I'm going to look at
some of the questions that

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.370
have been raised over
the history of people

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.080
asking questions like animal,
vegetable, or mineral.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.340
These are questions like, how
do we know something's alive?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.300
How do we know that an
animal really is an animal?

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.620
Does an animal have a soul?

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.240
Or, how is life created?

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.572
Now, this talk comes
with a slight disclaimer.

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:04.030
As Cristina mentioned,
I'm actually

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.586
a historian nowadays
rather than a scientist.

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:08.960
So I'm more interested in
seeing how people have answered

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.710
these questions
over the centuries

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.124
rather than in looking for
just one definitive answer.

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.290
So if you came here today
to find out whether or not

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.500
animals really have
souls and so on,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.030
I may not be able to help you.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.130
Put that out there.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.130
OK, no one's left,
so that's excellent.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.030
OK, so the first
question is, how do we

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.120
know something's alive?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.646
Well, it's a good question.

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:32.270
Does anyone remember
the kind of things

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.740
you learned in school
when you covered

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.020
this in biology classes?

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.895
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.260
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Exactly, yeah.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.580
The mnemonic we had at
school was Mrs. Gren.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.680
So Mrs. Gren refers to movement,
respiration, sensation, growth,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.060
reproduction, excretion,
and nutrition.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.774
Now, those seven
things are said to be

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:54.940
the characteristics of life.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.360
You probably all learned
about them in school.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.900
But actually, a very
small percentage of life

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.579
forms exhibit all seven.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.120
The system is a little bit crude
in that you can sort of pick

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.340
and choose how many
of the characteristics

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.790
must be displayed before
you decide that something

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.200
is or isn't alive.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.500
So a crystal can grow, but
obviously it isn't alive.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.780
A virus is really interesting.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.988
It appears to be able to do
quite a lot of the things

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:18.760
on the list, but
it can't do them

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.690
without some help from a host,
so we don't really classify it

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.390
as being alive, either.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.704
On the flip side, some things
exhibit fewer than seven

00:03:26.704 --> 00:03:29.120
of the signs of life, but we
do consider them to be alive.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.170
So most plants, for example,
don't display a huge amount

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.410
of sensitivity or motion--
locomotion, especially--

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.090
but we still classify
them as living beings.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.890
So this system isn't perfect,
but it works reasonably well

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.905
for a lot of everyday purposes.

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.530
One of the reasons
that it works really

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.720
well is that it's been
perfected over many centuries.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.560
In fact, this method
of distinguishing life

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.830
from non-life can be traced back
at least as far as Aristotle.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.402
Now, Aristotle is known as a
great philosopher, obviously.

00:03:56.402 --> 00:03:58.610
But nowadays, a lot of people
forget that he was also

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.340
a really great zoologist.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.900
And actually, 25% of
his surviving writings

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.560
are about zoology.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.990
We know that he wrote at least
five books about zoology,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.680
covering the history of
animals, parts of animals,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.625
generation of animals,
reproduction of animals--

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:14.420
I said that already--
movement of animals,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.700
and progression of animals.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.670
And we know from
references that he

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.969
himself made and contemporaries
made that Aristotle also

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.260
wrote books about plants,
although sadly, none of those

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.730
have survived.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.700
But the animal books
talk about the qualities

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.040
that make animals animals.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.380
So in order for something
to be classed as an animal,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.580
Aristotle said that it
had to be able to move.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.440
It had to be able to feel.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.210
It had to be able to reproduce.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.470
It needed some
sort of nutrition.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.220
And it had to have blood or
something similar to blood,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.420
and vessels to
contain that blood.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.170
So you can see,
looking at this list,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.000
that the first four of these
correspond pretty closely

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.505
to the modern requirement for
something to be called living.

00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:57.130
So the definition of
life that I talked

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.230
about earlier with Mrs. Gren is
pretty close to the definition

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.090
of animal.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.112
That's fair enough.

00:05:02.112 --> 00:05:04.320
If something is moving
around, if it's having babies,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.020
if it's eating, it's pretty easy
for us to say that it's alive.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.130
But what about slightly
less lively entities?

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:11.860
What about things like plants?

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.840
Now interestingly, I
think, the word "vegetable"

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.410
comes from the Latin
"vegetus," or "way-ge-tus,"

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.360
as the cool kids in
Cambridge pronounce it--

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.950
which means there really
is a cool way in Cambridge

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.075
to pronounce Latin words.

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:26.190
It's true.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.920
"Vegetus."

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.057
Let's say it that way, which
means "lively" or "vigorous."

00:05:32.057 --> 00:05:34.640
Nowadays, they're not words we
apply to plants terribly often,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.920
especially "lively."

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.700
But in a literal sense,
plant really is lively.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.940
Plants clearly
exhibit at least three

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.190
of the seven signs of life.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.070
You can easily see
that they grow.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.940
They reproduce.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.440
They need nourishment.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.370
They also all respire,
although that wasn't known

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.430
about until the 18th century.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.675
Some of them can feel,
and some of them can move.

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:56.750
Most biologists today
take it for granted

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.290
that plants are in fact alive.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.170
In fact, that notion was built
into the definition of animal,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:03.670
vegetable, or mineral
that dominated

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.630
the 18th- and 19th-century
life sciences,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.020
and that same definition has
informed the list of seven

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.040
signs that we use today.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:21.060
The definition runs [LATIN]
So it means that stones grow,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.485
plants grow and live, and
animals grow, live, and feel.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:27.110
Like I said, this
definition is the one

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.382
that really dominated the
18th- and 19th-centuries.

00:06:30.382 --> 00:06:31.840
This particular
way of phrasing was

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.770
coined by Carl Linnaeus,
who you may have heard of.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.390
He was famous for his biological
classification systems,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.415
as well as for inventing
the binomial nomenclature

00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:43.040
that people still
use today-- so things

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.240
like home sapiens
and boa constrictor,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.940
those sort of two-part names.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.290
So Linnaeus defined life as
being a particular property

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.030
of plants and animals.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.010
So does this mean that you have
to define an animal or plant

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.364
before you know what life is?

00:06:57.364 --> 00:06:59.030
Which kind of leads
to another question,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.290
which is, how do we know
that something actually

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.600
is an animal or a plant?

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.610
So that brings us onto
the next question.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.930
How do we know that an
animal really is an animal?

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.465
Well, sure, it's pretty easy
to distinguish between, say,

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:13.080
an elephant and a tree.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.780
That's straightforward enough.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.630
But how do you decide
about something that's

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.580
a bit more ambiguous, something
like a sponge or a coral,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.290
or an oyster, even?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.930
These things don't look like
they do much moving around.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.141
They don't seem
terribly sensitive.

00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:28.390
And it's tricky, at least
with naked-eye observations,

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.320
to tell whether they
really eat or excrete.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.535
So now we consider
all of these things

00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:35.660
I just mentioned to be
animals-- sponges and corals

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.820
and oysters-- but at
different periods of history,

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.050
they've also been classed
as vegetables or minerals.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.870
Or commonly, they're classed
as a member of a fourth group,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.280
the zoophytes.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.410
And zoophyte is a Greek word
that means "animal-plant."

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.565
And this was going to be
sort of an intermediary place

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:54.440
where you could put
things between the animal

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.840
and the plant kingdoms when they
didn't really fit into either.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.700
So the sea sponge
is a really good--

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.210
that yellow thing over
there is a sea sponge.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.260
That's a really good
example of a zoophyte.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.130
Now, one of the earliest written
descriptions of the sea sponge

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.135
comes from Aristotle's book,
"The History of Animals."

00:08:12.135 --> 00:08:13.970
Now, Aristotle wasn't
just a theorist.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.780
He actually spent
an awful lot of time

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.200
doing zoological research.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.165
In the 340s BC, he left Athens
and he spent about two decades

00:08:22.165 --> 00:08:24.130
on the cost of what
we now call Turkey

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.190
and on the island of Lesbos
studying marine creatures,

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:28.244
especially.

00:08:28.244 --> 00:08:30.660
Now, marine life is one of the
most difficult to classify,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.201
because a lot of these creatures
display some properties that

00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.360
seem like they belong
to a plant and some

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.929
that seem like they should
belong to an animal.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:40.980
So in the case of the
sponge, because of the way

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.639
sponges anchor themselves
to rocks or to surfaces,

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.430
they were believed for
an awfully long time

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.500
to have roots like
a planet does.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.600
But Aristotle noticed
one significant way

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.000
in which sponges were
a lot like animals.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.170
He said that if you tried to
pluck a sponge off a rock,

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.880
it will cling more
tightly to the rock

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.730
if it senses you coming.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.720
But if you sneak up on the
sponge, said Aristotle,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.400
you can more easily
remove it from its perch.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.920
So as far as our
Aristotle was concerned,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.340
the sponge could experience
some kind of sensation,

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.430
and so it was maybe
an intermediate life

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.400
form between the plant kingdom
and the animal kingdom.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.510
Now, a huge number of organisms
fall into this category--

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.220
things like corals,
which we saw earlier,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.130
all those green things,
sponges, starfish,

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.000
sea urchins, earthworms,
just to name a couple.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.820
Because of their strange
nature, zoophytes

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.820
raise an awful lot of
important questions.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.980
How do we define a plant?

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.580
How do we define an animal?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.287
What's the relationship
between the two kingdoms?

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:40.870
Is there maybe some
kind of chain that

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.790
connects all living things?

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.700
Now, for centuries
after Aristotle

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.100
wrote about sneaking
up on sponges.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.790
Naturalists debated where the
boundary between the kingdoms

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.910
lay.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.980
And the debate really
peaked in the 18th century,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.510
which is what I'm mostly
going to talk about today.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.974
Why the 18th century?

00:09:56.974 --> 00:09:58.890
Well, there's a couple
of significant factors.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.340
First, the Enlightenment culture
that was sweeping across Europe

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.170
at this time really promoted
an interest in science

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.570
and encouraged people to try
out scientific experiments

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.903
and observations for themselves.

00:10:09.903 --> 00:10:12.310
It was a very hands-on movement.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.940
And second,
improvements in things

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.170
like the manufacture of
scientific instruments

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.847
like microscopes meant that they
were becoming better and more

00:10:19.847 --> 00:10:22.180
affordable, so more people
could get their hands on them

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.396
and use them.

00:10:23.396 --> 00:10:25.020
So it was in this
enlightenment culture

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.480
that a man named Abraham
Trembley-- there he is--

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.670
began studying a little creature
known as the freshwater polyp,

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.485
or nowadays more often
called the hydra.

00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:38.810
In 1741, Trembley
published his findings

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.250
about this polyp, which
you can see on your right.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:45.930
And his results
caused consternation

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.015
all across the scientific
circles of Europe.

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:51.140
There is a little bit of
background about Trembley.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.440
So he was born in the
Republic of Geneva.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.390
He was educated
there before moving

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.530
to Leiden in the
Netherlands to continue

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.110
studying at the university.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.910
But after a little
while in Leiden,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.840
he was offered a
position as tutor

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.590
to the sons of a local
count who happened

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.365
to live near the Hague.

00:11:07.365 --> 00:11:09.490
He lived at the count's
estate for almost a decade,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.910
and it was there in the
1730s, but in the second half

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.770
of the 1730s, that he
began to research polyps.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.692
Now, what's a polyp,
I hear you all cry.

00:11:21.692 --> 00:11:23.970
I'm sure at least one
person was thinking that.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.710
So a polyp is a little creature.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.190
You can see one
there on the right.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.140
It's generally less than
a centimeter in length.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.170
They're often shaped like
bells, or in the description

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.060
more often used by
18th-century naturalists,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.250
like the severed
finger of a glove.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.830
So it has a single opening which
is surrounded by tentacles,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.732
and that opening leads
to a central cavity.

00:11:46.732 --> 00:11:48.440
They're usually found
in stagnant ditches

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.257
or similar locations.

00:11:50.257 --> 00:11:52.090
And for Trembley, living
in the Netherlands,

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.140
there were an
awful lot of canals

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.810
and stagnant water
around him, so he

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.060
was able to find an awful lot.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.490
In fact, this is a picture from
a book he published in 1744.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.115
You can see him down
in the bottom left

00:12:01.115 --> 00:12:04.870
of the picture looking for
polyps in one of the ponds

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.240
at the count's estate.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.870
And the two little
children there

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.440
are the children
he was a tutor to,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.940
Jean and Antoine,
who accompanied him

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.347
on an awful lot of his
polyp-hunting expeditions,

00:12:14.347 --> 00:12:16.555
and actually helped him do
a lot of his observations,

00:12:16.555 --> 00:12:19.210
which is quite sweet.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.310
So with a little bit of help
from these two young boys,

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.010
Trembley became really
expert at finding polyps,

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.077
but more importantly, keeping
them alive in captivity.

00:12:28.077 --> 00:12:29.660
So he spent a lot
of time figuring out

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.540
what they liked to eat
and what kind of water

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.748
they like to live in, and
whether they liked sunshine

00:12:33.748 --> 00:12:34.960
or darkness, and so on.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.335
It was quite difficult to keep
them alive for long enough

00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:39.086
to do what he needed to do.

00:12:39.086 --> 00:12:40.460
But once he had
figured this out,

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.900
he would spend hours observing
them and performing experiments

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.440
on them.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.550
And from his observations
and his experiments

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.410
came his most famous
finding, the one

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.530
I mentioned earlier
that shocked Europe.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:55.495
This resulted from a very simple
experiment in which Trembley

00:12:55.495 --> 00:12:58.260
just cut a polyp in
two and then watched

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.440
as each half regenerated into
a perfect and fully functioning

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.580
replica of the parent.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.160
So again, that
picture on the right,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.725
which is marked Figure 13, is
one of his drawings of a polyp

00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:10.630
that he's just cut.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.494
And from that cup
will bud out-- I

00:13:12.494 --> 00:13:14.160
guess you could argue
I put these slides

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.618
in the wrong order-- will bud
out lots of new polyps, which

00:13:16.618 --> 00:13:18.130
will each grow
into perfect, fully

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.660
functioning, grownup adult
polyp and become independent

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.120
of its parent.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:28.180
Now, part of Trembley's reason
for undertaking this experiment

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.187
was to determine whether polyps
were animal or vegetable.

00:13:32.187 --> 00:13:34.270
Differences in the way
that animals and vegetables

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.030
reproduced meant that, according
to the definition of the time,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.320
plants could regrow from
cuttings but animals could not.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.100
So when the cut polyps
regenerated their lost parts,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.200
that should have allowed
Trembley to place them

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.514
in the vegetable kingdom.

00:13:48.514 --> 00:13:49.930
But some of their
other properties

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.790
marked them out as
animal, at least

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.020
according to Aristotle's
definition, which was still

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.280
pretty standard at this time.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.360
So the first animal-like
property that polyps displayed

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.310
was movement of their tentacles.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.440
In water, their tentacles
moved independently

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.070
of any motion in the liquid.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.300
The second animal-like
property was that they

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.030
were sensitive to the touch.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.570
So if you touched a polyp
or shook the jar it was in,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.470
it would contract its tentacles.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.810
Third, Aristotle had
suggested that the presence

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.220
of a mouth and a stomach were
central to the definition

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.320
of an animal.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.760
And Trembley had seen
polyps grasping food

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.070
with their tentacles and placing
it in their central cavity,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.640
so he could prove, according
to Aristotle's definition,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.800
that the polyp was
probably an animal.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.350
Another reason to
view polyps as animals

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.200
was their power of locomotion.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.890
So polyps were
capable of traveling

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.470
in two different ways.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.260
So this picture on the
top, Figures 1 to 4,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.990
you can see a sort
of inchworm-like way

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.690
they have of moving.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.410
So they lie on their bellies,
they scrunch themselves out

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.640
and they flatten
themselves out again,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.610
and they can move
themselves along that way.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.660
The lower one is one of
the most fantastic forms

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:59.570
of transport in the animal
kingdom in the world.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.700
They somersault. They stand
up, they put their tentacle end

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.260
down, they put their
non-tentacle end up,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.580
and they flip themselves
over like that, which I

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.830
think is absolutely wonderful.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.288
And when Trembley saw this, he
also thought it was amazing.

00:15:12.288 --> 00:15:14.155
He spent hours
watching them do this.

00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:16.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.055
And that was one of the things
that really convinced him

00:15:20.055 --> 00:15:21.430
that the polyp
must be an animal.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.680
That just didn't seem like
something a plant would do.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.480
On Aristotle's final definition
of an animal, which was about

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.690
whether or not they have
blood, Trembley's results

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:30.927
were inconclusive.

00:15:30.927 --> 00:15:32.510
He did find some
green liquid in them,

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.000
but he wasn't sure if
it was really blood.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.320
But according to
Aristotle's five criteria,

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.050
the polyp was an animal in
the way it took nutrition,

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.350
in the way it moved, and
in the way it could feel.

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.183
It was a vegetable in
the way it reproduced,

00:15:45.183 --> 00:15:49.230
and it was sort of ambivalent
with the question about blood.

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.630
So Trembley didn't know what to
make of this strange creature,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.327
so he just kept repeating
his experiments over and over

00:15:55.327 --> 00:15:57.410
until he convinced himself
that all of his results

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.071
were in fact true.

00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:00.570
When he was sure
and when he finally

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.590
had enough proof as he thought
to convince other people,

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:08.002
he sent a report of his findings
to a Frenchman called Reaumur.

00:16:08.002 --> 00:16:09.710
And Reaumur was a
really important figure

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.729
at Paris's prestigious
Academy of Sciences,

00:16:12.729 --> 00:16:14.770
and he would later go on
to become its president,

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:18.300
and he was also an
expert on insect biology.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.100
Now, Reaumur, like Trembley,
was completely astonished.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:24.020
And in true
Enlightenment spirit,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.800
he decided to
investigate for himself.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.490
So Trembley sent some live
specimens of polyps to Reaumur.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.460
He hadn't yet figured out a good
way to transport them alive,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.520
so they had to be
carried at walking pace

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.140
from Leiden to Paris on
horseback in an open container,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.470
obviously going no faster
than a slow walk, which

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.550
took quite a while.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.220
But once they
arrived, Reaumur was

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.810
able to have a go at
Trembley's experiments

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.410
and fully replicated
all of his results.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.330
So having finally confirmed
Trembley's results,

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.765
Reaumur published an account
of Trembley's experiment

00:16:56.765 --> 00:16:59.530
and his findings in the
scientific journal, "Histoire

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.260
de l'Academie des
Sciences," which

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.369
was the big French science
journal of the day.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.082
And that account,
which was perhaps

00:17:07.082 --> 00:17:08.540
a little bit over
the top, compared

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.200
the polyp to a phoenix
being reborn from the ashes,

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.630
caused a huge, huge
stir in Europe.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.290
It was read by
thousands of people,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.760
and almost overnight, everyone,
not just elite scientists,

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.640
began talking about this.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.390
And as soon as the
results were out there,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.859
Trembley was inundated
with letters demanding

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.910
clarifications and
proofs and live specimens

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.150
to be carried by
very slow horses.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.550
He did later get better
at transporting specimens

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.370
in little sealed boxes.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.380
But it wasn't just
the scientific elite

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.090
that were reading
about Trembley's works.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.516
The initial account, along with
passages from Trembley's book,

00:17:43.516 --> 00:17:45.140
which came out a
couple of years later,

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:46.840
was reprinted in
the popular press.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.670
It was translated into a
bunch of different languages.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.840
It was pirated and
plagiarized, which

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.220
are two really good signs
of how popular it was.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.520
Being plagiarized or
pirated is actually

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.170
a good mark of success.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.760
But people weren't just
reading about Trembley's work.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.840
They were also replicating it.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.640
Trembley was really
generous with his polyps,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.520
and once he got better
at transporting them

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.080
he sent an awful lot of
specimens to other naturalists

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.060
all across Europe.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.770
But polyps and
zoophytes were pretty

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.350
easy to find, actually, like
I said, in ponds and ditches,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.440
by the seashore.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.970
So even if you
didn't know Trembley,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.036
you could try out these sorts
of experiments for yourself.

00:18:23.036 --> 00:18:25.160
And because it was the
height of the Enlightenment,

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.940
an awful lot of
people actually did.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.560
You can see the impact
of Trembley's work

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.410
in scientific journals,
but also in pop culture.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.575
Polyps are always showing up
in poems and songs and satires

00:18:36.575 --> 00:18:37.200
in this period.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.930
All across society,
they're popping up.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.080
But I suppose the question is,
why were they such a big deal?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.600
There were huge.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.220
So it's pretty cool,
sure, that something might

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.720
be half-animal and half-plant.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.250
There is a picture of some cool
things that are half-animal,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:53.750
half-plant.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.722
That's Animal-Vegetable-Mineral
Man from DC Comics,

00:18:56.722 --> 00:18:59.250
and that's that guy from
"The Little Shop of Horrors."

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.202
Did he have a name?

00:19:00.202 --> 00:19:02.585
I'm not sure if he did.

00:19:02.585 --> 00:19:05.090
But there's more to it, really,
than some creatures that

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.760
just have interesting biology.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.810
Once you start studying
things like polyps,

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.930
you go pretty quickly from
asking questions like,

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.080
can it sense, can it
move, to questions like,

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.630
if I cut an animal in two
and if each half becomes

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.540
an individual animal, is that
some kind of creation event?

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.925
Is God involved?

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:26.080
And actually, how
is life generated?

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.470
Now, Trembley
himself didn't want

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.760
to get too involved in
the philosophical debates,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.740
but lots of other people did.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.490
And that brings us to a
third question, which is,

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.990
does an animal have a soul?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.670
Now, when Reaumur had
published Trembley's results,

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.330
he ended his account by saying
that those results might

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.834
be used to answer questions
about how animals reproduce

00:19:45.834 --> 00:19:47.250
and how they're
related to plants.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.110
But then he sort of trailed
off with a suggestion

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:52.270
that they may also tell
us something about what

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.190
he called higher matters.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.300
Now, a lot of
readers at the time

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.194
would have known exactly what
Reaumur was referring to.

00:19:59.194 --> 00:20:01.485
He was talking about one of
the key ideological clashes

00:20:01.485 --> 00:20:03.340
of the Enlightenment,
and that was

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:07.610
a standoff between
materialism and vitalism.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:12.130
So materialism
essentially is the belief

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.197
that all that exists in the
world is matter or more energy.

00:20:15.197 --> 00:20:17.530
This is a philosophy that
goes back as far as the Greeks

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.710
and the Romans, people like
Epicurious and Lucretius.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.360
Lucretius especially
is associated

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.440
with the idea of
atomism, which is

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.340
the belief that
the world contains

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:29.786
only atoms and the
spaces between them.

00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:32.110
And on the other
side of the debate

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:35.504
stirred vitalism, which
says that there's something

00:20:35.504 --> 00:20:36.670
special about living matter.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.390
You can't just
reduce it to atoms

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.650
and the spaces between them.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.010
But I'll come back
to vitalism later.

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.070
Now, in the 17th
and 18th centuries,

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.370
materialism was a really big
idea in the life sciences,

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.650
thanks especially to the work
of one man, Rene Descartes.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.380
Now, Descartes had proposed
idea of the animal machine.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.160
The animal machine
was a living-- I mean,

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.620
according to Descartes' theory,
we're all animal machines.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.320
Every animal is a mini-machine.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.200
They conform to a
particular pattern.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.820
They function just
like clockwork

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.070
or any other mechanical system.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.569
According to Descartes, it
had been designed by God.

00:21:13.569 --> 00:21:16.110
And one final thing you need to
know about the animal machine

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:18.820
is that, although the
physical body worked just

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.660
like a machine, there was
a nonmaterial soul which

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.220
could act independently
of the laws of nature.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.499
This separation of body and
soul was called dualism,

00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:29.540
and it allowed Descartes
fit the theory in better

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.550
with the religious
orthodoxy of the day.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.730
But suddenly, with
Trembley's polyp experiments,

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.280
there were some problems
for the theory of the animal

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.460
as a machine made by God.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.490
First, the matter
within the polyp

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:44.370
could regrow itself
when it was cut.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.630
So did that mean that it had
some kind of active property,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.110
something independent of God?

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.310
Second, if material itself had
the power to create new life,

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.540
did polyp generation
count as a creation event

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.200
without any input from God?

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.910
Third, if God was
dispensable here,

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.380
was he dispensable elsewhere?

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.200
And in the 18th century, that's
quite a dangerous question

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.100
to find yourself asking.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.360
And fourth, if you
cut a polyp in two,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.730
and if each part regrows into
a fully functioning individual,

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.550
was the soul split in two?

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.581
Did the soul then regrow
in each new polyp?

00:22:19.581 --> 00:22:21.080
There were some
pretty big questions

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.090
that come from just one
really simple experiment.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.789
But some of the hardcore
materialists had a solution.

00:22:27.789 --> 00:22:29.330
There was a French
philosopher called

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.040
La Mettrie who believed
that the soul was not

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.620
distinct from the matter
that made up a living being.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.700
So if that was the
case, then it was

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.930
impossible to separate
matter and the soul.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.962
The division of the polyp
into two or more parts

00:22:41.962 --> 00:22:43.420
but without the
loss of life seemed

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.890
to prove that the soul was
actually inherent in matter,

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.638
and furthermore, that
the soul was divisible.

00:22:49.638 --> 00:22:51.096
Just think about
that for a second.

00:22:51.096 --> 00:22:54.360
It's a little bit
Harry Potter, actually.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.500
So La Mettrie took this
idea one step further

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.260
in a book which he published in
1748, called "L'homme Machine,"

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.751
"The Man as Machine."

00:23:01.751 --> 00:23:04.125
This was published just a few
years after Trembley's book

00:23:04.125 --> 00:23:07.480
on polyps, and it suggested that
not only was the animal's soul

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.730
a function of matter,
but that this also might

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.624
be true of the human soul.

00:23:11.624 --> 00:23:13.790
Now, needless to say, this
wasn't a terribly popular

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.780
position with the Christian
churches, which pointed out

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:18.530
that it was dangerous
to try and determine

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.130
the nature of the soul
from scientific experiments

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.920
rather than through the words of
scripture or divine revelation.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.780
But despite some
religious objection,

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.760
materialism really was
flourishing at this time.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.890
And it was especially
popular in the salons

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.610
of Enlightenment Paris.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:35.290
And one salon in
particular stood out

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.190
as a hotbed of materialism,
that of a man named the Baron

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.560
d'Holbach.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.745
In 1770, he
published anonymously

00:23:42.745 --> 00:23:46.456
a treatise that used scientific
findings from previous decades

00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:48.330
to argue that there was
no such thing as God,

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.730
no such things as a soul, just
matter obeying physical laws.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:56.120
So from Trembley's experiment
where he cut up a polyp,

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.490
people were saying there
was no such thing as god.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:01.550
So materialists are making
pretty big arguments

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:02.680
from something small.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:08.860
But on the other side, people
were arguing in favor-- sorry,

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.950
ignore that-- of a vitalism,
which I mentioned earlier.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.040
So vitalism is
another philosophy

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.420
with very ancient
roots, and it states

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.650
that there is something
special about living matter.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:21.702
It has some kind of
quality that makes

00:24:21.702 --> 00:24:23.160
it different from
nonliving matter.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.130
And a living being was
not, no matter what

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.420
the materialists said--
and the French materialists

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.440
in particular, who
were the worst-

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.120
just a collection of particles.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.436
Life wasn't just
something that obeyed

00:24:36.436 --> 00:24:37.560
physical and chemical laws.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.185
It was special.

00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:41.410
It had a spirit, or it had a
vital force, that distinguished

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:43.870
it from inanimate objects.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.430
Now, vitalism had been
around for a long time,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.090
but it also became
a little bit more

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.480
visible in the 17th and 18th
centuries as a direct response

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.320
to the views of
people like Descartes.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.140
And while materialists
like La Mettrie

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.470
argued that the
regeneration of the polyps

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.050
showed that the soul was not
an ethereal spirit but just

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.720
a function of matter, vitalists
like the German scientist

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.870
Blumenbach disagreed.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.750
At the end of the 18th
century, Blumenbach,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.390
who was familiar
with Trembley's work,

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:14.424
cut up polyps himself and
watched as they regenerated.

00:25:14.424 --> 00:25:16.090
And from his work,
he developed a theory

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.759
of formative drive
and vital forces.

00:25:18.759 --> 00:25:20.550
He believed that the
regeneration of polyps

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.300
showed that there really was a
vital force in living tissues.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.390
But like a lot of
other vitalists,

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:29.179
he was a little bit cagey about
exactly what that force was.

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:30.970
So you can see that
using the same results,

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.770
naturalists were
arguing both for

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.261
and against the
existence of the soul.

00:25:35.261 --> 00:25:37.010
It hadn't really been
Trembley's intention

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.030
to raise such big
questions, he just

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:43.047
wanted to know whether polyps
were animals or plants.

00:25:43.047 --> 00:25:44.505
In case anyone's
wondering, polyps,

00:25:44.505 --> 00:25:47.980
as I think you mentioned,
are now classed as animals.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.450
They're pretty
cool, because they

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.960
contain absolutely enormous
numbers of stem cells, which

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.200
basically make them immortal.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.260
So they're pretty popular
lab animals these days

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.970
for people working
on stem cells.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:00.260
But back to the 18th century.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.190
So we've seen how
looking at pond slime

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.860
and asking the question, animal,
vegetable, or mineral leads

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:07.490
to some difficult questions.

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.480
But where else can it take us?

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480
So we've seen that one
of the interesting things

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.280
about the polyp was
the way it reproduced.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.192
Unlike most animals, which
needed a mother and a father

00:26:17.192 --> 00:26:19.275
to create offspring, a
polyp could just regenerate

00:26:19.275 --> 00:26:21.250
from cuttings from its parent.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.220
Which leads us to the
next question, which

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.000
is, how is life generated.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So people have been asking
that question for a long time.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.880
There are a lot of
different answers.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.180
Aristotle said that
when animals reproduced,

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.740
the mother supplied the matter
while the father supplied

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:39.540
the form, or the soul.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.350
But when it came to things that
were less obviously animal,

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.780
like shellfish for
example, Aristotle

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.290
said that they
were spontaneously

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:49.339
generated by the earth
in which they lived.

00:26:49.339 --> 00:26:51.880
And he said, depending on the
kind of soil that spawned them,

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.463
different creatures
would be produced.

00:26:53.463 --> 00:26:57.130
So oysters grew from slimy mud,
cockles grew from sandy mud,

00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.920
limpets grew from
rocks, and so on.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.760
Now, since the cells involved
in animal reproduction

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.982
can be pretty small and
pretty difficult to see,

00:27:04.982 --> 00:27:06.940
believing in things like
spontaneous generation

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.110
actually made a lot of
sense for a very long time.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.800
Mammal eggs weren't discovered
until the 19th century.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.520
The human egg wasn't seen
until the 20th century.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.390
So again, back to
the 18th century,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:21.270
the polyp reinforced the idea
that spontaneous generation

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.760
might just be possible
and prompted people

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.670
to ask questions about
how reproduction worked.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.580
People wanted to know
what kind of forces

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.140
drove the creation of life.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.130
They wanted to know how
matter became alive.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:36.090
They wanted to know what role
God played in reproduction,

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:38.390
and they wanted to know
how features passed down

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.670
the generations of a family.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:44.080
Now, at this time, there
were two particularly

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.440
common explanations for
how reproduction worked.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.620
The first was a system
called preformation.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:59.680
Preformation held that
all living creatures

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.730
had been created by God at
the beginning of the world.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.310
Everything that would ever
live through all ages of time

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.770
was created at the same
time, thousands and thousands

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.590
of years ago, then each being
was folded up in serial order

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.410
and nested inside its parent.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.790
So God sort of created a
series of Russian dolls.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.400
The original parent contained
the germ of every single child

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.850
that would ever be produced
in the family line,

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:24.990
and at the appointed
time, each germ

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.010
would develop into
a seed or a fetus

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.915
and would then grow
into its mature form.

00:28:29.915 --> 00:28:31.290
Now, this theory
obviously raised

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.230
some logistical questions,
but it dealt kind of neatly

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.710
with two of the
big problems posed

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.160
by the science of reproduction.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.710
First, it allowed God to keep
his central role in creation.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.390
Each being was made
directly by his hand.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.130
And second, it fitted with
a popular 18th-century view

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:49.725
of God, which saw
him as a creator who

00:28:49.725 --> 00:28:51.837
had set the whole
universe in motion

00:28:51.837 --> 00:28:54.420
and was now sort of happy to sit
back and let it run according

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.190
to the laws that he had made
for it-- sort of like clockwork,

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.654
which was quite a popular
analogy in the 18th century.

00:29:02.654 --> 00:29:04.070
And if that was
the case, it meant

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.004
that God didn't have to
oversee every single individual

00:29:07.004 --> 00:29:09.170
creation event that happened
in the plant and animal

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.280
kingdoms, which would be
pretty time-consuming.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.010
In stark contrast to
preformation theory, which

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:17.510
fitted quite well with orthodox
Christian views of the time,

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.640
stirred something
called epigenesis.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.370
Epigenesis said
that all new life

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.360
was generated from the
gradual development

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.030
of disorganized matter.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:29.420
Each embryo received
was created uniquely

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.920
due to the laws of chemistry and
physics acting on inert matter.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.800
Unlike preformation theory,
epigenesis did not necessarily

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.990
require any input from God.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.530
It was a materialist, and
therefore quite radical,

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.050
theory, which could be
used to say that there

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:46.830
was no such thing
as a soul-- again,

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.140
just material obeying
physical laws.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:52.020
So the theories drew
supporters or detractors

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.119
not just because of
their scientific content,

00:29:54.119 --> 00:29:56.410
but also because of their
theological and philosophical

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.551
implications.

00:29:57.551 --> 00:29:59.300
And one of the best
known examples of this

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:05.160
is a dispute between two
naturalists called Albrecht von

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.020
Haller, Caspar Friedrich
Wolff, who I'm going

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.330
to talk about a little bit now.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.560
So the dispute
between these two men

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.400
illustrates that scientific
results can be just as much

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.480
about people's
agendas as they are

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.590
about finding the right
answer, which is still

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.710
true today, as anyone who has
ever worked in lab will know.

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.897
Haller-- he's on
the left-- was one

00:30:29.897 --> 00:30:31.730
of the most impressive
polymaths of his day.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:34.930
He was an anatomist, a
physiologist, a physician,

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.260
a botanist, a university
professor, a poet, a novelist,

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.275
a political and theological
author, a bibliographer,

00:30:41.275 --> 00:30:44.110
a reviewer, an academician,
a civil servant,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.429
and a politician.

00:30:46.429 --> 00:30:48.470
Like Trembley, he was
Swiss, although he actually

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.190
worked in Germany as a
professor of anatomy, surgery,

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.270
and medicine.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:55.610
When he was young, Haller had
studied in the Netherlands,

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.650
and he learned about
preformation theory

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.340
and accepted it as true.

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.250
But in the 1740s, when
he began to hear reports

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.264
of Trembley's
experiments, he thought

00:31:05.264 --> 00:31:06.680
that perhaps the
ability of polyps

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.580
to regenerate missing
or injured parts

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.920
might mean that
generation occurred

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.260
in a way that could not be
explained by preformation

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:14.900
theory.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.740
And so he began to
consider epigenesis.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.950
But although Trembley's
polyps piqued his interest

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.680
in epigenesis, Haller couldn't
really accept the theory.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.356
It was just too
atheistic for him.

00:31:24.356 --> 00:31:25.730
He was a devout
Christian, and he

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.479
believed that science
was best carried out

00:31:27.479 --> 00:31:28.890
within a religious framework.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:30.850
For him, any
scientific theory that

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.780
could form a basis for
materialism or atheism

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.480
had to be rejected.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.360
So he turned back to
preformation theory,

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.160
but a slightly modified
version of preformation theory

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.940
in which a force
called irritability

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.040
could take a minuscule,
preformed person

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.957
or plant or animal and set
its development in motion.

00:31:47.957 --> 00:31:49.540
And this irritable
force, Haller said,

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.190
was bestowed upon matter by God.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.660
He gave the example of a
preformed embryo contained

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.640
within its mother's body, which
was stimulated when it came

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.750
into contact with male semen.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.710
In response, its
inherent irritability

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.274
caused the heart
to begin beating

00:32:03.274 --> 00:32:04.690
and allowed the
rest of the embryo

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.350
to develop according
to God's design.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.930
To add some credibility
to his new theory,

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.990
Haller began to observe the
development of chick eggs.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.520
You can see some pictures on
the right there of dissections

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.020
of chick embryos, which
are actually by Wolff.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.380
But as I'll say in a
minute, they basically

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.250
found the exact same thing.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:24.770
So when Haller
looked at chick eggs,

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.070
he observed that, for the first
few days after fertilization,

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.150
the contents of an egg
appear to be entirely liquid,

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.230
and only later do solid
structures start to appear.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.030
Now, a lot of people saw that
as evidence for epigenesis,

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:39.980
saying that out of the
liquid formed structures.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.554
But Haller argued
that within the fluids

00:32:42.554 --> 00:32:44.220
there actually were
structures, but they

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.840
were transparent, and therefore
invisible to the human eye.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.070
He continued his observations
all through the 1750s,

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:52.820
and at the end of that
decade he published

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.350
a book containing all of his
observations, which he hoped

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.100
would proceed people to believe
in his version of preformation

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.970
theory.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:01.300
But not everyone was convinced.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.430
The following year, a
young German scholar--

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.690
he was a quite radical
man, called Wolff,

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:09.070
in the middle there-- published
his doctoral dissertation,

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.360
which was all about different
theories of generation.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.180
Now, he made almost identical
observations on chick eggs

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.770
to Haller's, but he interpreted
his results very differently.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:20.510
Wolff saw the development of
the chick in epigenetic terms.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.920
He thought that there was
an essential force driving

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:26.050
the secretion of new matter,
which then solidified

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.820
a process which occurred
in serial order,

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.460
so that once one
organ was formed

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.980
it could secrete the matter
for the next organ, and so on.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.420
He just relied on
physical and chemical laws

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.830
to show how liquid can
form into a tiny bird.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.730
Haller and Wolff each made
careful, very detailed studies

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.302
of the chick embryo.

00:33:45.302 --> 00:33:47.010
Their notebooks and
their published works

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.880
reveal that they're pretty much
exactly the same things when

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.750
they looked at blood
vessels and the heart

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.125
and the lungs and
the intestines.

00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:54.930
So like I said, these
are some drawings

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:57.050
of the kinds of things they saw.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.840
But where Haller
saw the work of God,

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.740
Wolff saw simple
mechanical, physical,

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.730
and chemical processes.

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.510
To convince Haller to try
and reconsider epigenesis,

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.810
Wolff sent him a copy
of his doctoral thesis,

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.250
which was a huge mistake.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:15.325
It sparked a 10-year feud
between the two men, took up

00:34:15.325 --> 00:34:17.199
a huge amount of time
on both of their parts,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.400
resulted in both of them
publishing and writing

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.987
huge numbers of letters and
reviews and publications,

00:34:21.987 --> 00:34:23.820
and of course, the
result was that each just

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.380
became more entranched in
their own belief anyway.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.310
The feud never really was
successfully resolved.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.719
Wolff moved to Russia
eventually, and it kind of just

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.489
petered out a little bit.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:38.320
But although the correspondence
between these two men stopped,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.400
the debate between
preformationists

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.690
and epigenesists continued
for the rest of the century.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:47.389
And that high-profile feud,
along with general interest

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:49.389
in zoophytes and
things like polyps,

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.750
and improving technology
like microscopes,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.530
meant that reproduction
became a really hot research

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.332
topic in the 18th century.

00:34:56.332 --> 00:34:58.040
So let's look at a
couple of other things

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.915
that were going on in
the field at this time.

00:34:59.915 --> 00:35:03.240
So earlier, I mentioned
two related topics.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.850
One was spontaneous
generation, and the other

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:09.621
was the necessity of having
a mother and a father.

00:35:09.621 --> 00:35:11.620
So I'm just going to talk
a little bit about how

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.310
one particular 18th-century
naturalist tried

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.820
to study those two topics.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:19.100
This is Lazzaro Spallanzani.

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.880
He was an Italian priest
and a physiologist

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.295
who-- this is a statue of him
in his hometown, with a frog.

00:35:25.295 --> 00:35:28.480
Frogs feature in this story,
as you've probably guessed.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.850
So he was working at
the University of Pavia

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:34.460
in the 1760s when he got
really interested in questions

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.780
about how reproduction worked.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.000
So he began a series
of experiments

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.920
to investigate spontaneous
generation [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.440
Spontaneous generation,
which as I mentioned

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.360
was a theory at least
as old as Aristotle,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.070
was still pretty popular
in the 18th century.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.210
One of the most famous
naturalists of the age,

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.580
who was a French
count called Buffon,

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.320
had conducted a
series of experiments

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.720
in which he made up a broth
containing wheat or gravy.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.940
He boiled it up.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.420
He cooled it.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.170
He sealed the container.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.620
He left it sit for a few
days, and as if by magic,

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:09.760
new microscopic life
would spontaneously

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.540
appear in the beaker.

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.540
Because Buffon was such
a well-respected figure,

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.289
a lot of people took
his results seriously

00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:18.680
and thought they were evidence
for spontaneous generation.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.410
But Spallanzani was
curious about this supposed

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.780
spontaneous generation, so he
set out to test those results.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.220
He conducted
similar experiments,

00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.580
but crucially, he boiled
the mixture for longer.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.730
He took greater care to exclude
any possible contaminants.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:36.230
He sealed the containers
more tightly and sooner.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.940
And his samples didn't show
any signs of microscopic life.

00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.000
So it turned out that
Buffon's method had just

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.375
been slightly flawed,
and a lot of people

00:36:44.375 --> 00:36:46.250
believed Spallanzani's
results and considered

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.800
the matter settled.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.930
But if life didn't
generate spontaneously,

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:51.130
where did it come from?

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.630
So the most common version
of preformation theory

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.674
at this time said that
the preformed germ

00:36:57.674 --> 00:36:59.090
of a person, a
plant, or an animal

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:01.270
was held within
its mothers ovum.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.380
And Spallanzani
wanted to test this.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.710
If it was true, it meant
that male semen either

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.830
played no role at
all in conception

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.630
or that it was just
a catalyst to start

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.920
the developmental process.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.740
So Spallanzani, in order to
test whether this was true,

00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.270
designed an experiment
using frogs.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.410
So testing reproductive theories
on humans or other animals

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.920
isn't particularly easy.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.642
He picked the frog
because first, they

00:37:29.642 --> 00:37:31.600
fertilize their eggs
outside the mother's body,

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.724
so you don't have to do a
huge amount of dissection

00:37:33.724 --> 00:37:34.630
to get at their eggs.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:36.900
And second, because their
eggs are large enough

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.880
to see without a
microscope quite easily.

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.100
You've probably all seen
frog spawn hanging around.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.700
Once he had his
frogs, Spallanzani

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.400
set about making them some
tight-fitting, waterproof

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.270
trousers, which you can see.

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.910
The picture obviously
is a modern reproduction

00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:56.554
of the experiment.

00:37:56.554 --> 00:37:58.220
So he made some
waterproof trousers just

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.850
for the male frogs, and then
he allowed the male and female

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:01.830
to mate.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.910
So the male courted
the female as usual.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:07.570
He attempted to fertilize the
eggs as the mother laid them.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.910
But due to the trousers,
none of the male frogs' semen

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:11.840
could reach the eggs.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.660
So you can probably
guess what happened.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:15.550
The eggs failed to
develop into tadpoles

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.480
and just withered away.

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.810
Next, undressing
his little frogs,

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.750
Spallanzani took a
couple of drops of semen

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.500
from inside their
trousers and used it

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.410
to fertilize some fresh eggs.

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.930
Now, some of these eggs grew
into healthy young tadpoles

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:31.446
and successfully developed
into adult frogs.

00:38:31.446 --> 00:38:33.070
So using these
experiments, Spallanzani

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:36.380
was the first to show that
actually, male and female were

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.850
necessary for
animal reproduction.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:43.940
And this result was used to
undermine preformation theory.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.630
So those are a
couple of highlights

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:50.310
from 18th century experiments
on reproduction, all of which

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:53.520
originated either directly or
indirectly by people trying

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.980
to find out whether something
was an animal, a vegetable,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.150
or a mineral.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.284
Now, of these seven
so-called signs of life,

00:39:00.284 --> 00:39:02.950
reproduction has been one of the
most controversial and the most

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.074
studied over the centuries.

00:39:04.074 --> 00:39:07.050
And obviously, it's
still true today.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.282
But just getting back to
the seven signs of life--

00:39:09.282 --> 00:39:11.740
I started this talk with them,
and I've talked a little bit

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.870
about where they come
from, what they mean,

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.680
and how studying them can
lead to some tricky questions.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.410
But how about today?

00:39:19.410 --> 00:39:21.820
Well, like I said, the list
of seven characteristics

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.200
is still pretty useful for
defining those life forms

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.740
that we think about most, things
that are big enough to see,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.990
things that kind of fall
into those classic categories

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.527
of animal or plant.

00:39:31.527 --> 00:39:33.110
But in the last few
generations, we've

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.070
come to realize that
animals and plants make up

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:39.640
only really a tiny percentage
of life on this planet.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.060
So you can see,
animals and plants

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:44.380
are too tiny little branches
of the phylogenetic tree

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:45.220
of life over there.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.050
And bacteria is probably
the biggest group

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.670
and make up the largest amount
of biomass on the planet.

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.576
And obviously,
when you're talking

00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:55.450
about things like
bacteria, it doesn't really

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.380
fit with the seven
characteristics of life model.

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.530
So how do you decide
that a bacteria is alive?

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:03.466
How do you decide that any of
those things apart from animals

00:40:03.466 --> 00:40:05.430
and plants are alive?

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:09.970
So there are a couple of
modern ways of talking

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.776
about life versus non-life.

00:40:13.776 --> 00:40:15.650
So living things, we
now say, can metabolize.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.730
So that means that they
can use chemical reactions

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.500
to break down substances
to create energy

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.850
and to synthesize
other substances which

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.280
facilitate life.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.680
Nowadays, we say that living
things can display homeostasis,

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.144
which means that they have a
sort of internal equilibrium

00:40:33.144 --> 00:40:34.560
that they can
maintain themselves.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.480
They can self-regulate
their own cells.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.130
We say that living things can
pass on genetic information.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:44.560
We say that living
things can evolve.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.300
We say that living things
have negative entropy.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:50.340
And that comes from the
laws of thermodynamics.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.000
The second law of
thermodynamics states

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.320
that entropy tends to
increase over time,

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.440
which means that systems become
more chaotic, more disordered.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.090
But that's not the
case living things.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.880
They can maintain
their internal order,

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:05.930
and so they're said to
have negative entropy.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.520
But a few of the classic
seven signs of life

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.890
are still pretty central
to the definition, growth

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.054
and reproduction especially.

00:41:13.054 --> 00:41:14.720
But now, a lot of
people are of the view

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.240
that it's not possible to give
just one definition of life

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.749
or to give one a definitive
list of characteristics.

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:23.040
Life is much more likely to
be seen as a process rather

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.727
than a substance.

00:41:24.727 --> 00:41:27.310
But it's still quite good fun
to ask those kinds of questions,

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.500
and I can't imagine people are
going to stop asking questions

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.250
anytime soon.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:33.780
And as, I think, hopefully,
have shown today,

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.750
from very simple
questions can come

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.420
really complicated answers.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.425
And I'll end there,
if that's all right.

00:41:40.425 --> 00:41:43.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.539
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:41:46.539 --> 00:41:48.330
So we do have some time
for some questions.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:49.946
I've got some microphones here.

00:41:52.898 --> 00:41:56.834
Any questions for Ms. Susannah?

00:41:56.834 --> 00:42:03.230
AUDIENCE: So you were
talking about [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.674
Do you think there was more of
a culture of [INAUDIBLE] back

00:42:06.674 --> 00:42:10.074
then, or do you
think [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:10.074 --> 00:42:12.240
MALE SPEAKER: Susannah, can
you repeat the question?

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.330
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Oh, yes.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.496
The question was talking
about Enlightenment culture

00:42:15.496 --> 00:42:18.235
and people replicating
experiments themselves.

00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.610
The question was, do you think
citizen science was bigger

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.195
in the 18th century or today?

00:42:23.195 --> 00:42:25.570
Certainly, you can see with
something like the experiment

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:27.622
of the polyp, it's really easy.

00:42:27.622 --> 00:42:29.580
You go to your local
pond, you pick up a polyp,

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.210
you cut it in two.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.210
You don't even need a
microscope to see a polyp.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.030
A magnifying glass
might be helpful,

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:36.760
but you don't even need that.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.490
So it's incredibly
simple, whereas today,

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.980
the kind of experiments that
you hear about in the news--

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:43.520
the Large Hadron
Collider and things

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.950
like that-- they are a lot
more difficult to recreate.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:51.553
I think today,
education policy is

00:42:51.553 --> 00:42:57.370
sort of pushing kids
into much more sort

00:42:57.370 --> 00:42:59.530
of systematic ways of learning.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.030
You're less encouraged
to run around

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.550
ponds gathering up slime and
seeing what happens with it.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.090
Or those chemistry sets we
used to have as kids-- really

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.700
dangerous things in them.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.419
I think they're a lot more
closely regulated nowadays.

00:43:12.419 --> 00:43:14.210
But certainly,
Enlightenment culture really

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.590
encouraged people
to question things,

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.400
to try things out
for themselves.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:24.130
And a lot of the people
I've spoken about today

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.320
are quite elite scientists.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.986
A lot of them were
members of academies,

00:43:26.986 --> 00:43:29.059
like the World Society
in London or Paris.

00:43:29.059 --> 00:43:31.600
But actually, there were huge
numbers of working-class people

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.440
involved in this kind of thing.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.715
There were a lot of working
men forming botanical clubs.

00:43:36.715 --> 00:43:39.340
There were zoological clubs, who
would put their money together

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.990
and buy a library for
themselves and keep in the pub

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.740
or something like that.

00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.620
So all across society, a
lot of people were, I think,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.570
much more interested in
science and basic science

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.300
than they are today.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.411
Thank you for the question.

00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:56.452
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any other
questions for Susannah?

00:43:59.938 --> 00:44:03.424
AUDIENCE: If I could just make a
comment rather than a question,

00:44:03.424 --> 00:44:06.910
it's been really
interesting that you've

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:11.921
taught these
scientists' names to us

00:44:11.921 --> 00:44:17.040
today, because I'm really only
familiar with van Leeuwenhoek--

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.080
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Oh,
Leeuwenhoek, yeah.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:22.210
AUDIENCE: --who developed the
microscope in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:23.291
century, I think.

00:44:23.291 --> 00:44:24.540
SUSANNAH GIBSON: 17th century.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.660
AUDIENCE: Sorry, 1600s.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.380
And Robert Hooke was
his contemporary.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.476
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Yeah.

00:44:29.476 --> 00:44:31.184
AUDIENCE: So I really
appreciate the fact

00:44:31.184 --> 00:44:32.960
that you've introduced
these names that I

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.249
haven't known before today.

00:44:34.249 --> 00:44:36.040
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Well,
thank you very much.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.009
And I realized halfway
through the talk

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.050
I hadn't spelt a lot of
the names, which actually

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.160
is something I always get really
cross about when speakers don't

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:43.680
do that.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.640
So if you want to know any
of the spellings of names

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.660
or anything, just have
a flick through the book

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.360
or come and ask me later.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.554
But thank you very
much for the comment.

00:44:52.554 --> 00:44:55.922
MALE SPEAKER: There's
a question here.

00:44:55.922 --> 00:44:59.260
AUDIENCE: Is a piece of coral
considered an animal, or just

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:01.240
an individual polyp?

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.690
SUSANNAH GIBSON:
That's a good question.

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:04.760
I'll repeat the question.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.680
The question was, is a coral
considered an animal or just

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.910
a polyp?

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:14.330
So they're kind of
a colony of animals.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.400
So within one coral, you'll have
thousands of individual polyps.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.730
Each policy secretes-- they
kind of act like a snail.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.832
They make a hard shell
around themselves,

00:45:22.832 --> 00:45:25.040
and when you join thousands
of these things together,

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.230
they form what looks
like a coral to us.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.680
So it's quite a
difficult question

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.182
to answer, because
in a way a coral does

00:45:35.182 --> 00:45:37.390
act a bit like a plant,
because the colony of animals

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.410
all joins together and
support each other.

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:41.502
And if you just had
one living on its own,

00:45:41.502 --> 00:45:45.310
it probably wouldn't
fare that well.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.780
And also, to just get
back to my disclaimer,

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:50.210
I'm not a scientist.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.640
But it's a good question.

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.400
Does anyone else know
the answer to that?

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:57.214
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] similar
to an ant colony can't survive.

00:45:57.214 --> 00:45:58.880
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Yeah,
an individual ant

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.600
can't do that well on its own.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.148
Absolutely.

00:46:03.148 --> 00:46:06.052
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think we have
time for one more question,

00:46:06.052 --> 00:46:09.440
and then we're going to
have some [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.832
Any other questions?

00:46:10.832 --> 00:46:12.415
AUDIENCE: I have
[INAUDIBLE] question.

00:46:12.415 --> 00:46:16.195
Obviously you mentioned that-- I
forgot their names, Wolff and--

00:46:16.195 --> 00:46:17.195
SUSANNAH GIBSON: Haller.

00:46:17.195 --> 00:46:19.772
AUDIENCE: --both came with
identical observations,

00:46:19.772 --> 00:46:22.140
but came up with different
conclusions because

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.425
of their religious
background and what

00:46:24.425 --> 00:46:26.230
they brought [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:28.765
Is there an acknowledgement
within the science community,

00:46:28.765 --> 00:46:31.700
we'll call it the history
of science, as to what

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.965
people [INAUDIBLE] personally
and how that influences

00:46:33.965 --> 00:46:39.125
their results, and how to
get over that or around that?

00:46:39.125 --> 00:46:40.500
SUSANNAH GIBSON:
That probably is

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.557
one of the biggest topics that
comes up in history of science

00:46:43.557 --> 00:46:44.390
over and over again.

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:47.620
And the fact is, because
science is a human activity,

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.510
it's kind of inherently flawed.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.460
And everyone comes to
science with an agenda.

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:53.760
And there is the
idea that there is

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.260
such thing as the
scientific method

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.460
and it's completely impartial.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.527
And on paper it is,
but in reality, science

00:47:00.527 --> 00:47:02.110
is being done with
people, and they're

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:06.130
being funded by people who want
particular things from them.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:11.780
I know someone who is working
for a large and unnamed tobacco

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.800
company, working
out whether or not

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.830
tobacco plants have certain
concentrations of carcinogenic

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:19.070
chemicals in them.

00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:20.940
But her research is
being funded by someone

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.600
who wants a particular answer.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.200
And that's kind of an
extreme example of that case,

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.180
but even in the
most impartial lab,

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.000
people often approach
an experiment

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.820
with the result in mind.

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:33.770
People often start off
an experiment thinking,

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:36.247
oh, I think it's
probably a 90% chance

00:47:36.247 --> 00:47:37.330
that it will lead to this.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.362
And often, if that result
doesn't come about,

00:47:39.362 --> 00:47:41.070
people just try it
over and over and over

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:44.100
until-- it takes an
awfully long time,

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.390
I think, for people to give
up their preconceptions.

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.322
when

00:47:47.322 --> 00:47:49.530
I started off as a scientist
but now I'm a historian,

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:51.960
and it gives you such a
different view science,

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.060
seeing how, through
the last 2,000 years,

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:58.510
people have shaped their
answers to what society wanted

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.010
from them and to
their own religious

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:04.120
and social and
philosophical beliefs.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.320
I think it would be quite
hard as a working scientist.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:10.280
I think you have to be a
realist as a working scientist.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.410
There is a right answer.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.910
But when you take
time to step back,

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.615
you see it as a human activity.

00:48:14.615 --> 00:48:15.750
It's really interesting.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.480
And as a historian,
that makes work

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.725
much, much more interesting
on a day-to-day basis.

00:48:19.725 --> 00:48:21.100
It's much more
interesting seeing

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.780
people who came up with what
you might call a bad theory,

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:25.250
and why they wanted
to believe that

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:27.597
and what they got
out of it, I think.
