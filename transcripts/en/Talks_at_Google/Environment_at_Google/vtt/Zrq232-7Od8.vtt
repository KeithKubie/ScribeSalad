SPEAKER 1: We are lucky to
have Romain Trouble, Executive

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.990
Director of the Tara
Expedition Foundation

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.050
who will present
the full initiative

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.260
and come back on their
major explorations.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.230
And then, in the second
part, Colomban de Vargas,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.280
Director of the Station
Biologique de Roscoff,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.400
and coordinator of the
Tara Ocean Expedition.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.680
He will use his
scientist glasses

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.280
to present their past
discoveries and innovative way

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.600
of research.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.424
Let's watch a quick video now
to better know about Tara.

00:00:43.424 --> 00:00:44.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.590

[SOUND OF OCEAN WAVES]

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.090
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.470
So let's welcome on
stage Romain Trouble,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.060
Director of Tara Expedition.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.545
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.250
ROMAIN TROUBLE: Hi, everyone.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.970
I'm Romain.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.020
I'm a sailor.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.280
I sailed America's cup twice
in my life when I was younger.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.010
And I also studied biology
when I was younger.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.550
Now, I am old and 40 years old.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.800
But I'm heading
Tara since 15 years

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.960
now as Etienne Bourgois, the
President of the foundation.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.250
We study the ocean.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.970
I'm a sailor.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.810
We are sailors.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.770
We're also scientists,
as [? Johan ?] told you.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.320
We are all together on
the spaceship Earth,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.740
across the universe, at
millions of kilometers an hour.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.240
And we barely know a few
things about this planet.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.572
She's blue.

00:02:04.572 --> 00:02:07.030
When you ask all the astronauts,
and I asked Thomas Pesquet

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.329
recently, how's the
planet from the sky?

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.120
He said, it's blue.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.100
It's a blue planet.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.110
And 70% of the planet
is made of ocean--

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.740
huge, it will change with the
atmosphere, a huge playground

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.500
for sailors, of course.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.770
But if you take off all
the water of the planet,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.430
and you want to put
it in a sphere--

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.000
just to give you an
idea of the volume--

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.260
this is the air we breathe.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990
The atmosphere we
put in the sphere,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.830
the sphere is this size.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.260
And if you do the same with
all the water of the planet,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.290
this is the ocean water--

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.170
very, very tiny ball of
1,400 kilometers in diameter.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.630
The tiny dots here
is the fresh water,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.580
and the smaller dots
is drinkable water.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.310
And our life depends on
this small ball of ocean.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.630
When you breathe, when you
get proteins from the ocean,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.540
the CO2 is stored in
this ocean mainly.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.340
So this is really your
life support system.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.120
So on Tara, we try to take you
on a trip, take the planet,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.950
take humanity on a trip on
science, discover the planet,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.010
try to understand its
fates, where we go on this.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.340
We try to share that with
as many people as we can

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.110
through the media,
through the Google,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.780
through YouTube,
through the networks.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.250
In many places we
go in the world,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.650
we've been visiting about 65
countries over the last 10

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.370
years, which is a big trip.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.060
Of course, we share that
with kids in the schools,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.660
mainly French-speaking
schools today,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.345
but we are now developing
curricula for overseas.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.390
We also teach the
southern countries

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.820
how to go in the ocean, how
to set up scientific boats,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.040
how to understand, how to
use the richness of the ocean

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.420
for their behavior, for their
economy, for their development.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.270
And this is a very
strong commitment

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.730
we've got since two years now.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.320
And also, as
[? Johan ?] told you,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.370
we are putting some scientists
on ocean at the UN every three,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.530
four months to teach as well.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.950
The people, the kids,
the southern countries,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.050
and the states, and
the negotiators.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.330
So over the last 15 years--

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.840
soon 15 years-- we
did many projects.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.020
But we'll meet four of them.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.977
And I will try to explain
to you what we did

00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:43.810
and why we did that.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.460
We did one 10 years ago on
the climate in the Arctic.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.670
We did another one four
years in a row fishing

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.910
plankton, invisible animals.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.660
You fish.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.826
You don't see what you fish.

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:58.720
But you fish every
day for four years--

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.800
crazy, crazy, you think.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.470
You're really crazy guys.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.290
Of course, when you fish
plankton across the ocean,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.710
you fish a lot of plastic.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.720
And this is one of the main
disasters we're facing today.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.190
This is a reversible disaster.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.960
If we do something,
we will stop that.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.420
But this is a very
important disaster.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.870
And we also spent
a lot of time--

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.370
right now, the boat
is at the middle

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.130
of this two-year
expedition in the Pacific.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.540
She was this morning in Kimbe
Bay in Papua, New Guinea,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.400
getting ready for a new survey
in this part of the island.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.690
We study the coral
reef ecosystem

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.570
over all the Pacific for
two and a half years.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.830
This is now.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.560
Back, 10 years ago, we
studied the Arctic Ocean.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.330
This is North Pole.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.920
This is the Arctic region.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.620
And you can see the
North Pole here.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.090
And this was done
by a guy, crazy guy,

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.260
who wanted to be the first
guy at the North Pole

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.160
a century before called Nansen.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.680
He missed his goal, but we did
the same track, the only one

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.730
to do it, 10 years ago.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.611
And we drifted across the
Arctic Ocean doing science--

00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:08.860
now, we'll not go into
details-- but took measurements

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.310
everywhere, down in the water,
in the atmosphere, on the ice.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.240
We did six months of dark--
in the dark six months.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.120
This expedition lasted
a year and a half.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.230
Six months in the dark,
nonstop, pushed by the winds,

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.090
the ice is crossing
the ocean-- we did

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.150
5,000 kilometers doing nothing.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.090
The world of Tara, this
world that you see here,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.570
is drifting 10 kilometers
per day in the Arctic,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.670
pushed by the prevailing winds.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.960
And if you look at how it works,
it's like tectonic plates.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.770
We can have the sound
here maybe in the--

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.270
put up the volume, please.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.850
And the plates in the Arctic,
they move not the same speed.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.370
And sometimes, they
crush the boat.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.720
This is real time.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.340
And nothing we do in our
planet can stop that.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.389
The energy of the
Arctic is colossal.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:05.826
[CLICKING SOUNDS]

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.190
This world is drifting
10 kilometers per day.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.260
So you study that,
and you sit there.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.940
It is six months day, six months
dark, and six months day again.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.030
And this was 10 years ago.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.640
Big achievements-- we
changed crew members.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.370
We change scientists.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.920
We do rotation,
logistic rotation,

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.220
to get the press people
on board and to tell

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.450
the story of the Arctic--

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.640
and then, again, fun unites.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.050
This was done 10 years ago.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.780
And then, back from this
upper North Pole area,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.790
we said OK, what's
going to be the fate

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.629
of this ecosystem, the ocean
system, in a changing climate?

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:52.670
What would be the future?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.000
What can we understand?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.410
This is plankton.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.410
This is drifting
across the ocean

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:02.570
everywhere-- billions and
billions of organisms.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.370
Colomban will talk to
you more about that.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.150
So we went to study this
ecosystem across the planet

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.250
for four years on this track.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:12.200
And we collected.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.560
In every stop, we stopped and
we corrected fished plankton

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.210
ecosystem, the world ecosystem.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.360
In the same way,
repeating, always

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.880
the same kitchen on board,
the same infiltration--

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.690
very boring.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.410
But you cannot imagine the
enthusiasm you can see on board

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:32.700
of this voyage, because the
people believe that they were

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.100
doing something that
was completely new.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.809
Like Colomban says
very often, it's

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:42.659
like being in the
rainforest with the nets,

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.770
catching birds and new things.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.680
So this was a crazy project,
including the Arctic ocean.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.140
And Colomban will talk to
you more about this science

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.310
and this knowledge.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.290
We did study the
ecosystem completely--

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:01.200
bacteria, viruses,
organisms, algaes.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.130
We call it protist.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.940
He's a crazy protist
man, Colomban.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.644
Now, we are trying to
understand all this behavior.

00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:09.060
This is the fish
food that we talk

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.490
about-- fish food, the
fish they eat that,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.130
and they rely on that.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.270
So far, we did a lot of data.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.450
It's a big ocean data.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.540
We got ocean life data,
molecular data, genomics,

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.590
images, legal data
on every sample,

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.420
because we were many
times in countries

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.200
that owns these organisms.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.330
And we have other connectivity
with data centers.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.930
And this huge data is
one of the biggest,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:45.140
and the first time we describe
an ecosystem completely

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.250
as a whole--

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.250
the first time ever it is done.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.360
And Colomban will talk
to you about that.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.720
And these scientists we work
with across the world, 25

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.470
laboratories from 10 countries,
they did publish in "Science,"

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.770
did the cover of
"Science" two years ago.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.720
And this was the start of a
crazy adventure in science,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.630
and it's still ongoing
now even if we come back

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.460
from this trip six years ago.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.270
Doing that, you fish
all these organisms.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:19.320
But also you fish a lot
of plastic, plastic bits

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.020
that is degrading into
the ocean and that

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.280
is catching all the
life of the ocean.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.980
It's also sticking
to it like a rock.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.930
It's nice to be at the sun
for algaes, enjoy this sun,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:33.930
make their life.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.170
And they are drifting
across the ocean like that.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.620
This is a simulation for
the Mediterranean Sea.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.890
You drop on the
model of the Med,

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:47.027
you drop 10 particles in every
of these four main rivers.

00:10:47.027 --> 00:10:49.110
And you wait for a year
to see how are they going.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.430
This is a trimester.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.240
This is six months--

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.620
10 particles every day a year.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.160
This is about to be 3/4.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.340
You can see that
particles on the road

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.620
are going up to Alexandria at
the end of the year-- which

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.700
is completely crazy how what
we do on land, what we do

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.520
in our cities, in our
daily life, the impact

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.880
we can have on the
ocean and its life.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.290
And you can see different
patterns, different streams

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.080
across the Mediterranean Sea--

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.590
just to show you the impact.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.799
So we did a crazy
seven months journey

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.840
in the Mediterranean Sea.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.630
We collected these
plastic things

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.200
over seven months,
300 locations.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.810
And we are now
still studying them.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.420
Coming back from
this expedition,

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:50.670
one of the main ecosystems on
the planet besides plankton--

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.957
in terms of biodiversity
of the ocean,

00:11:52.957 --> 00:11:54.540
that is storing a
lot of biodiversity,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.580
30% of the biodiversity--

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.060
is linked to coral reefs.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.870
Very small places, but huge
diversity, huge ecosystem,

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.820
huge biomass as well.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.410
So we decided to put
Tara for 2 and 1/2 years

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.180
on an expedition to
study over the same,

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.610
over the same samples, repeated
work over the 2 and 1/2 years

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.690
to sample the reef,
its surrounding waters,

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.510
the organisms, the animals.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:28.790
And I can show you here
the video-- please--

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.920
a crazy video showing you
the super micro activity

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.610
of coral reef.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.520
You're going to
see it's beautiful.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.280
And you will understand the
issues with garbage today.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.610
We will talk a lot about
bleaching reefs to get white.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.930
But first, look at the
beauty of these organisms.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.331
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.490
So we have divers up top
diving in many, many places.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.080
So far, we did 20 states.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.750
These are states, small states.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:13.670
Now, if you look into details,
this is 10 centimeters.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.060
This is a millimeter.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:16.900
This is coral.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:17.990
This is an animal.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.740
It's like a jellyfish upside
down fixed on the rock,

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.050
and it's feeding,
and it's sleeping.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.400
They are like us.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.520
They have bones inside.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.040
Corals are incredible.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.782
You can see these guys
getting out at night usually.

00:13:37.782 --> 00:13:39.240
They like that you
do not see them.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.145
And so they feed--
this is the mouth.

00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:45.130
This is an animal.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.570
They feed.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:48.310
The color you see
here is an algae

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.770
they have in the body
that are giving them

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:57.090
90% of the sugar they need to
live, 10% of what they eat.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.150
And when there is too much
stress, too much temperature,

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.650
too high, they get white.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.140
The algae is going away.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.660
And if it lasts too
long, the animal

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.240
maybe is starving and dies.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:17.762
And then it's completely covered
by sea grass in the ocean.

00:14:17.762 --> 00:14:18.720
This is climate change.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.140
This is what we talk about
now everywhere, every year.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.680
Even in very remote places--

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.930
this is 4,000 kilometers
from any towns in the world.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:39.020
[INAUDIBLE] All white.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.470
So this is not a direct impact.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.530
This is really a global impact.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.530
And today, we have
very few understanding

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.480
of what's going on,
how the Scar Reef

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:56.350
is behaving, what other
mechanisms-- the process inside

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:00.058
to resist climate change,
to resist pollution.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.900
And we were used to
main El Nino events

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.650
of warming of the
Pacific every six,

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.730
seven years over
the last 50 years.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.580
And for the last three
years, every year,

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.670
we find we can see
bleaching events.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.290
Sometimes they
recover, and the reef

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.170
is getting back to its states.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.380
And sometimes it's too hard.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.400
And they don't recover.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.000
So this will not disappear.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.260
But the reef will change--

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.820
how they will change?

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.930
The system will change.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.450
The species will
adapt and change.

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.220
How it will change, what will be
the fate of this in the future,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.900
we don't know.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.000
And it's very important
for our states,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.190
because reef is tourism,
economy, fisheries, protection

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.140
against storms, et cetera.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.230
So the drawing now is like that.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.190
We are here now in
Kimbe Bay, this place.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.080
We have still a lot
to go and come back

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.730
in France in October,
in a year, October 2018.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:06.550
Kind of pictures of
working down below,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.720
another picture of a
very kind boy here.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.760
And there you can see that
we are sampling the reef.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.510
We are getting plankton
off of the reef

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.550
to see which are the
interactions of this.

00:16:23.805 --> 00:16:26.690
And this-- we are doing
that every day also.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.770
So it's a hard life.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.700
It's a hard life.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.780
They work a lot.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.850
They work a lot and a
lot every day on board.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.180
They complain a lot,
because they work too much.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.120
But they do an
amazing, amazing job.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.600
And policy-wise, this
project is enough,

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.730
both science, outreach,
public, easy to understand,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.630
kids are on board.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.090
That is very, kind
of, a bizarre project

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.360
that is attracting
Ban Ki-moon twice

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.840
on board Tara in
New York in 2012.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.810
And he come to talk
to anyone in Paris.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.240
The boat was in Paris, downtown.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.839
And he came again
on board with us.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:12.190
And this guy, Eric Karsenti, and
agnes b. was our main backers,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.920
but also, Eric Karsenti
was one of the main thinker

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.660
of this plankton project
that Colomban will talk

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.050
to you about it in a while.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.964
Education is key.

00:17:21.964 --> 00:17:23.380
And I will not go
long about that,

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.480
because I am short of time.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.610
But everywhere the boat
goes, we get people on board.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.830
When we came in Paris,
there were 10,000 kids

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.980
come on board with the schools.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.760
We do pitches.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.910
We do talks in the schools.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.630
We try to explain them what
we talk about, what we do,

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.520
give them the feel of the ocean.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.650
And everybody is doing it--

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.390
the scientist, the sailors--

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.660
everyone.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.440
This is really a great,
great time-- good energy,

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.150
good shot of energy.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.630
And the next is, of course,
the science going on.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.592
And Colomban will talk
to you about that.

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:01.300
So in the future,
we're going to go again

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:05.033
in the Arctic Ocean in 2020.

00:18:05.033 --> 00:18:07.690
We are developing
now a polar station,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.920
pretty big polar station, to
put some scientists on the ice,

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.570
and to understand how this
Arctic Ocean is affecting

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:17.200
our climate, to understand what
sleeps below the ocean, what

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.250
is the life there.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.140
Nobody knows about it.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.060
Nobody has a clue about it.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.580
And this will be in 2020.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.390
And this device should
drift across the Arctic

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:32.470
Ocean for the next 20
years as we plan to do it.

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.120
So it's going to
be a long journey

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.170
and will be the only manned
station in the Arctic then.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.030
Thank you very much.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.849
And I welcome Colomban
to come on board.

00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:45.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:49.820
So fasten your seat
belt, because you're

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.740
going to hear science now.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:52.702
So stay calm.

00:18:52.702 --> 00:18:53.660
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: OK.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.610
ROMAIN TROUBLE:
Breathe normally.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.300
And of course, I
would like thank

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.680
the backers of this project,
the scientific backers.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.270
Those are the
private backers that

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.621
is involved in these
projects since 10 years.

00:19:04.621 --> 00:19:05.120
Thank you.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.251
Colomban, the floor is yours.

00:19:06.251 --> 00:19:08.584
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: Thank you
for the nice introduction.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.800
OK, so I'm Colomban.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.250
I am not a sailor, but I
am a Swiss oceanographer.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.730
And I was very lucky to meet,
actually, Romain and also

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.410
this person that Romain
mentioned already,

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.286
Eric Karsenti.

00:19:25.286 --> 00:19:27.750
I'm not sure if this
is working or not.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.400
Yeah, it works.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.150
So Eric is an amazing cell
biologist from the EMBL.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.130
He spent, like, 30
years of his life trying

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.222
to understand how cell auto--

00:19:37.222 --> 00:19:38.180
you know, cell divides.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.160
And how all molecules
within the cell

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.570
take a shape and auto-organize.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.520
So it's the science
of self-organization

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.610
using statistics,
mechanics, you know,

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.040
and so it's really that
the shaping of life

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.550
with the element of life.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.060
And when I met Eric, he
showed me this movie,

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.050
which is a zebrafish.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.860
So you can see here all the
cell of a little fish dividing.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.900
So it's a real fish
under a spin microscope.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.260
And you can see this baby fish
taking shape under your eyes--

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.934
single-- all the cells.

00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:07.850
So it's just amazing,
and it was the beginning

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.495
of spin microscopy.

00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:11.120
And so this is really
self-organization

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.440
of an organism.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.890
And when Eric showed me this
in 2007, I was thinking, OK,

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.020
I should follow this guy.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.690
And I should-- and Eric,
besides being an amazing--

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.480
so he did all this in his lab.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.770
They developed the
best microscope.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.930
And Eric, he's a great sailor.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.569
He's an amazing sailor, but
he never looked in the ocean--

00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:31.610
of the life in the ocean.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.010
But he was brave
enough to think, OK,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:36.240
let's try to understand
the ocean that way.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.230
And that's always
what we had in mind.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.255
So basically, we are--

00:20:44.255 --> 00:20:47.300
today, we are really entering
this era of ecosystems.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.260
And we don't see any organisms
anymore as a single organism

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.870
but as an ecosystem and
mainly human body, right?

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.730
You know, there are millions
now of euros and dollars spent

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.352
to understand how many
microbial genes-- because we

00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:02.810
are many more microbial genes
in our body than human genes.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.930
We have only 25,000 human genes.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.670
We have many more
bacterial cells

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.510
than human cells in our body.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:13.210
So today, we really see
the human as an ecosystem.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:17.090
And so we start to want to
map all the cells of human.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.210
I don't know if you have heard
about this new project called

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:22.820
Human Cell Atlas, which is
actually funded, essentially,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.600
by Zuckerberg, by the
Facebook Foundation.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:31.117
Now we have the technology
to sequence single cell of--

00:21:31.117 --> 00:21:33.200
the genome of single cells,
of the expressed genes

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.160
of single cell.

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.261
And the idea here is
to map all the cells,

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:38.510
because we don't even know
how many different cells we

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:40.400
have in the human body.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.404
But each-- all the cells
take different shape.

00:21:42.404 --> 00:21:44.570
Based on the same genome,
they take different shape.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.000
And they make ourselves, right?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.470
So we really have this
ecosystemic vision of human.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.360
And in fact, what
we forget often--

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.340
and this is very interesting.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.350
This is a human cell.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:57.225
This is a macrophage.

00:21:57.225 --> 00:21:58.850
You have this cell
in your blood now.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.760
You have thousands of
these cells in your body

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:02.719
hunting for bacteria.

00:22:02.719 --> 00:22:03.885
You have here the leukocyte.

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.480
It's another type of cell.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.850
And this cell has just
eaten-- so it's cleaning

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:09.920
your body out of bacteria.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:12.050
So it's really your ecosystem.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:17.450
And what is fascinating--
sorry, I was too fast--

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.790
is that, in fact, if
you go to the ocean,

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.900
you can see this kind of
cell that's an amoeba,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.620
for instance, you know,
hunting for microalgae

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.650
here-- microalgae.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.970
And the resemblance is amazing.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.553
And in fact, you
know, the composition

00:22:31.553 --> 00:22:33.570
in salt between your
blood and the ocean

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.210
is strictly almost the same.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.020
The content of salt
is almost the same.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:39.030
The proportion is
different, but we are really

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.310
a walking piece of ocean.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.180
And so I think--

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:45.090
so the origin of life,
you know, is in the ocean.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.490
All these organisms have
invented all the genes we have

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.652
and all the shape we
have in our cells.

00:22:49.652 --> 00:22:51.110
And so we really
need to understand

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.820
these systems, which is much
more complex than human,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:54.910
of course.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.570
So what we decided
in 2008 was really

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:03.380
to jump into the big bath and
to go to this, like Romain said,

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.200
to this global ocean, which,
in every liter of seawater,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.720
you have between 10 and 100
billion organisms, including

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.910
viruses, in every liter.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.600
And the ocean
generates all this.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.060
It's actually not a blue planet.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.422
It's a blue-green planet.

00:23:16.422 --> 00:23:17.880
You have all this
green here, which

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.050
is photosynthetic
cells, like the tree,

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:25.290
but single-cell organisms,
which produce half of the oxygen

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.930
that we breathe on the planet.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.940
The ocean is also extremely
reactive to global change.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.180
So it will feedback
on climate very fast.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.700
So we really need to
understand how this feedback--

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.430
the resilience of
the system, and how

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:41.100
it will give us an answer to
what we pose to planet Earth.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.390
So we decided basically to, in
this era of ecosystems biology,

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.110
to--

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:52.870
so Eric spent 30 years on
this, billions of euros.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.620
Now there are many,
many projects on this.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.520
It's also billions of dollars.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:01.110
So we decided to go directly to
this one, to the full system--

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.460
planet Earth, the
biggest system.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.330
And the advantage of this system
over classical system that we

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.870
know, ecosystem that we
know better-- maybe as kids,

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.790
you know, because we
see these systems--

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.350
is that in these ecosystems,
organisms are very big.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:16.540
So it's very difficult
to sample these systems.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.590
A forest, it's impossible
to sample trees.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.310
And also the dynamic of these
ecosystems is very slow.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.900
The climax of-- the
life of a forest

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.960
is bigger than a human
life, while in the plankton,

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.400
you have a bit of everything.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.870
You have, you will see,
you have a bit of all life,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:32.620
but it's changing.

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:33.390
It's reorganizing.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.540
Like the fish, you know--

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.740
during the highlight I
showed the baby fish--

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.210
it's all the time reorganizing.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.950
So we think we can understand
fundamental principle

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.609
of ecosystemics.

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.150
So the beauty of
plankton, as I said,

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.860
is that you don't have the
10th orders of magnitude

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.900
across which life develop.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.360
It stops, basically,
at a few centimeters.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.550
And so we developed a
protocol to sample plankton

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.900
from viruses to bacteria,
to protists, to animals.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.030
And there is no plants,
because photosynthesis

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.220
is done by these protists.

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.900
We put on the boat--

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.960
so it was crazy,
because it was in 2008.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.520
We had very little
time to equip the boat.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.470
What was fantastic
that we started

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:19.210
was the flexibility, the
reactivity, which you can never

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.990
do in classical-- in academia.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.129
So we equipped the lab.

00:25:25.129 --> 00:25:26.920
And we were very lucky,
because it was just

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.780
the beginning of the high
throughput sequencing

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.940
with the Illumina method.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.390
So it was just the time
where the price of sequencing

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:36.820
was dropping terribly.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.900
And so we had different
nets and pumps

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.620
to sample this-- for plankton.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.230
We also had a very
nice rosette, which

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.560
is an instrument to measure all
kinds of underwater parameters.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.440
So I will tell you about
the data we collected.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:54.800
We collected data in omics,
so basically, DNA and RNA

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.790
expressed genes.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.080
Just for the people
who like data,

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.890
we collected about 900
billion Illumina DNA reads.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.520
That's more than 90
terabases raw DNA data

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.370
from seven
organismal-size fractions,

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:13.420
from viruses to animals, and
from about more than 4,000

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.760
plankton communities.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.520
Yeah, this is just again
the number of data,

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.310
the number of computing
time we have used for now,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:29.830
and the number of analyses
that we have done.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.010
And as you can see, it's--

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.700
by far, it's two-time-- twice--

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.600
100 times higher than the
next project in ocean systems

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.264
ecology.

00:26:40.264 --> 00:26:41.430
So it's really the biggest--

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:45.670
by far the biggest ecosystemic
project in the ocean.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.540
What is very hard in
ecology is to collect

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.710
homogeneous data,
standardized data

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.620
across sufficient
spatiotemporal scale.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.980
So this is for the DNA data.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.510
And then we-- this
is very original.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:59.580
We used a lot of instruments.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.411
Flow cytometry-- this
one, we developed.

00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:03.410
And I will tell you a few
words about this one--

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.930
FlowCAM, ZooScan, and UVP--

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.470
to image, as well, the plankton.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:09.345
So we took a lot of
images of those organisms

00:27:09.345 --> 00:27:12.540
at the same site at
a different depth.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.832
And so this was this--
we haven't almost

00:27:14.832 --> 00:27:15.540
touched the data.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.810
You know, it's very--

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:18.980
and so we got--

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.320
for now, we have six
million images of plankton.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.750
A lot of them are already
validated by experts.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.700
And we have-- yeah,
which represent more

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:28.710
than 330 terabytes of data.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.080
We also have done a
website, which I think--

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.800
an instrument on the web,
an online image platform

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.990
to basically share this
image project-by-project

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.310
with experts.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.040
Because we need a
semi-automated machine learning

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.300
processes to learn the machine
to recognize the images.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.100
And so there is
no, you know-- also

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.930
there is a gene bank for genes.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.300
There is international
banks for genes.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.840
There is nothing equivalent for
images in ecology in science.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.230
So it's really something
that we need to think about.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.480
OK, time-- now let's get
into the data itself.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.000
So it will be a bit harder.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.720
So we publish this wonderful
special issue in "Science."

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.980
And of course, we have now--

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.350
I think we have published
150 papers since 2009.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.060
It's hard to speak
about it in 10 minutes.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.640
But what we can
say from this data,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.470
I think, here the three
papers concerned viruses,

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.400
the bacteria, and eukaryotes.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:34.590
Eukaryotes are us--
cells with a nucleus.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.470
And what is amazing--

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.261
you don't need to look
at the detail, but--

00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:41.370
is that we saturate
many of these diversity.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:43.530
Meaning that the
more we sequence,

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.300
the less we find new things.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.079
And basically, we sampled
the ocean largely enough,

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:51.120
the surface of the ocean--
and this was just from

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.500
the surface--

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.540
to basically not see
anymore anything new.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.480
So we push the
diversity very far away.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.810
We sequenced 40 million
protein-coding genes

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:02.440
for bacteria.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.417
But we see most of them,
which is fantastic.

00:29:04.417 --> 00:29:06.000
So we see the limit
of this diversity.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.690
So we can start to think
in terms of ecosystemics.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.060
There is just one compartment
that we didn't saturate,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.880
and this is the eukaryotes,
eukaryotic cells,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.620
like ourselves.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.200
We sequence more and more,
and there is many more new.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.210
So we are now reaching 150
million eukaryotic genes

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.750
in this plankton.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.600
And it's endless.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.380
We are far from saturation.

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.260
In fact, most of these
genes are unknown.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:35.100
They don't look anything
that we have in the database.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.490
And the other one, we can't just
attach them to known things,

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.830
but it's very unsure yet.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.112
So this is really amazing.

00:29:42.112 --> 00:29:43.320
And in fact, I think we are--

00:29:45.942 --> 00:29:47.400
just to show you
an example of what

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.570
we can see now with image data
with using these instruments.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.105
We just take a picture
of the marine snow.

00:29:54.105 --> 00:29:56.010
The marine snow is
all these organisms

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.040
that fall down to the
bottom of the ocean,

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.360
and which is actually the
mechanism that maintains also

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.704
the atmosphere we breathe.

00:30:03.704 --> 00:30:05.120
With this instrument,
we learned--

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.210
we teach the instrument--

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:07.160
I mean, the data--

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.630
to recognize this
kind of shape, which

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.700
correspond to giant protists.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.760
And we realized that these
giant protists in fact

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.990
have a bigger biomass than
all animals in the plankton,

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.620
in the subtropical and
tropical regime here.

00:30:25.401 --> 00:30:26.400
And they look like that.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.394
No one knows these
Rhizaria, these [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:29.394 --> 00:30:30.810
I think there was,
like, something

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.310
like 90 species described.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.830
These guys are
running the world.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.950
If you dive in there in
the middle of the ocean,

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.150
you will see tons of these
little guys floating.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.630
They are beautiful creatures
in symbiosis with algae-like--

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.220
or they are a bit
like piece of corals

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.370
floating around the world.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:51.570
I think we are almost coming
to a new theory of life

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.340
of biological diversity.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.350
For a long time we
thought that life was--

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:59.070
for three centuries-- that
life was in animals and plants,

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:01.830
and the diversity was
decreasing toward microbes.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.359
Then over the last few years,
over the last three decades,

00:31:05.359 --> 00:31:06.900
because they started--
people started

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.050
to sequence the
small animals, we

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:13.800
saw that the diversity was
in the viruses and bacteria.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.690
And now that we have a real
ecosystemic view of our system,

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.850
we see that there is
a peak of diversity

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:22.270
of genes of organisms
in the middle,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.827
like, between a few
microns and 15 microns.

00:31:24.827 --> 00:31:26.660
That's where, really,
life has complexified.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.960
And no one has studied this
piece of life, you know?

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.710
So we speak about diversity.

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.740
Now we know that
diversity is there.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.730
And we actually have sequenced--
we went to the Amazon Forest.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:38.810
And it's the same.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.850
You find this peak
of life, which

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.270
I call life's middle class,
lower-middle class, in fact.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.730
So these organisms
look like that.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:48.490
They are my obsession a bit--

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.940
protists.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:52.760
So at least I want you
to remember this name.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.990
And so protists are beautiful
creatures, single-celled.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.870
So they have very
complex genomes.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:01.370
They can build
beautiful skeletons.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.130
Here you have some
coccolithophores.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.627
This is always one cell.

00:32:06.627 --> 00:32:07.710
This is one cell building.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.140
So the cell is living inside.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.850
And it's building up
these little plates

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.230
and assembling them
outside the cell.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.160
You can see how these
cells are powerful.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.600
This is actually
one of the cells

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.640
building the plate inside the--

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.660
inside some vesicle and
extruding the plates.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.310
This cell is the most
calcifying organism on Earth.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.240
You can see it--

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.980
the cell [INAUDIBLE] the
Black Sea here, in summer,

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:31.670
at some time of the year.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.650
And these cells-- so
for instance, this cell

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:35.780
is at the same time a
plant and an animal.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.870
It can eat.

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.410
It can photosynthesize.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:41.900
It can build this marvelous
nanotechnology pieces

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.850
and transform the Earth
system, as you can

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.990
see from the geological record.

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:53.780
The shore of Dover here is of
100% coccolithophore, almost.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.300
So they have an impact, a
major impact, probably stronger

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.640
than the one we have,
actually, today.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.730
So with protist,
a new world that

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:05.870
is now coming into the
game of global ecology--

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.602
and now what we want to try
also to do a lot is to assemble

00:33:08.602 --> 00:33:09.560
all these complex data.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.060
So we have different
layers of data.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.640
We have ecological data.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.800
We have genomes, genes,
organisms, and satellite data

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.300
as well.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.180
So we have different
heterogeneous complex data

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.649
that we try to put together
with graph-based methods.

00:33:25.649 --> 00:33:26.690
And so we did this paper.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.700
We built up the first
global plankton interactome.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.870
And what we saw is that biotic
interactions are more important

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.770
abiotic interactions, and
that there are much more

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.500
taxon-taxon interaction
in this network

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.320
rather than
taxon-environmental parameters.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.950
And that corporation,
positive relation,

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.770
are much more important
than exclusive relation,

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.620
which is kind of a nice
lesson, I think, of life.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.180
And now you can analyze this.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:56.660
It's going to take years
to understand really

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.700
what functions are
driving these networks,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.970
these big ecological networks.

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:04.665
What we have found for instance
is that, in fact, parasites

00:34:04.665 --> 00:34:07.720
are incredibly abundant
but nice parasites.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.860
These parasites try
not to kill their host,

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.350
because they need their host.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.600
So parasitism seems to be a
big driver of the stability

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.600
of the network.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.690
In fact, we know as
humans that we don't

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:19.150
have enough parasites probably.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:22.139
Now there is a medicine that
think that we should get back

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:26.460
our parasites to be healthier.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:33.739
We also started to
basically use this network,

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.870
because this network
is really the ecology

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.520
of a complex system-- plankton.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.520
Now we try also to mix it
to other complex systems,

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.350
like biogeochemical cycles,
like the carbon pump, which

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.949
is a very important fundamental
mechanism of the biosphere

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.400
or climate processes.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.540
So in this paper,
we try to extract

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.420
the most important component
of the network, which are not

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.790
often the most abundant.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.170
Often they are the
most connected.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.940
Two fundamental
processes of the carbon

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:05.030
flux that we measured with this
instrument I showed you before,

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.320
the UVP, Underwater
Video Profiler.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.030
And we found that specific
plankton communities correlate

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.804
with carbon export, in
particular, with radiolarians,

00:35:13.804 --> 00:35:15.220
dinoflagellates,
and synechococcus

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.880
is very important--
different species.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:20.040
And we can predict
actually the carbon export

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.620
with part of these networks
at a very high accuracy.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.026
So now where are we?

00:35:28.026 --> 00:35:32.220
I think we need to
have a job, I think.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.150
I think we had about--
because we sample, you know,

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:42.080
220 sites, three depths, and
so we have about, I think,

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.079
600 ecosystem in this
global body of the ocean.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.370
But the ocean is super complex.

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.440
It's super dynamic.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:51.410
You have a lot of connection.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:53.100
You have this big
gyre, who have, like,

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.420
300 kilometers large.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.555
And it take them three
years to cross the Atlantic.

00:35:57.555 --> 00:36:01.194
And so we need, of
course, more expedition.

00:36:01.194 --> 00:36:02.610
And we need to
expand the approach

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:08.899
we have on very clever
temporal and spatial scales.

00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:11.190
So Romain told you about--
so now we have a new project

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:15.640
today, which is called
TO-SEE, Tara Oceans Systems

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.970
Ecology and Evolution,
where we try to-- this

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:20.070
is the data I just showed you.

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.490
This is what I call now the
symbiome, made of bacteria,

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:27.030
of protists, and animals,
metabolists, shapes,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:28.065
and behavior.

00:36:31.626 --> 00:36:33.000
We have a new
project, basically,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.250
is to expand the
approach we have done

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.420
over different spatiotemporal
scales that will allow

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:42.910
us to understand the system.

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:49.270
One very important aspect is
there is an incredibly good

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.700
platform to develop
new protocols

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.270
and to do very, very
actually hardcore science.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.210
But there is also between
10 and 15,000 sailing boats

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.570
at any time in the ocean
crossing the ocean.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.710
And we started to transfer part
of the best protocol we have

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:09.490
done to these sailors, which
we call now the Plankton odes

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:11.890
in this Plankton Planet project.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:14.110
We have basically
extracted a little protocol

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:19.120
to collect plankton very
easily, and a little kit that

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.120
allows them to get
a little plankton,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.310
and send us through the--

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:26.350
actually, they dry the plankton.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.650
And they send us just
a galette of plankton

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.940
to the lab directly.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.310
And we could show--

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.770
it was just a test
phase as a case study,

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.560
but it was actually quite--
it was super-easy to find

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.550
enough sailors.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.440
I mean, we had too many people
that wanted to participate.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.060
We had 25 crews who sailed
the planet in one year.

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:50.130
And we could collect data
from all these dots here,

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:51.340
these regimes.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.510
Here is the number of samples,
different boats collecting

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.109
plankton.

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:58.150
And we got all this data.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.330
And we sequenced it for
barcoding-- for DNA barcode.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.570
And here you can see, in red,
the number of new plankton

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.420
genus that we never found in
our-- in this big data set

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.710
I showed you, showing
that, in fact, we

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.510
are reaching saturation, but
there is a lot to discover.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.080
And if we want to reach
a very fine granularity,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.090
we need these boat to help.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.890
Because there is
no automated way

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.950
yet of sampling the
complexity of the ocean.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.950
The last point I wanted
to say is that we

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.180
need to develop imaging.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.760
And we have developed
a fantastic approach

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.550
to automatically image,
thanks to Eric Karsenti,

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.000
and to come back to the
beginning of my talk.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.740
We developed these new methods--

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:41.740
this method that was
used in human biology--

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:47.230
to do automatic, 3D,
high resolution imaging,

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.347
confocal, of all the
cells that I showed you.

00:38:50.347 --> 00:38:52.680
And it's beautiful, because
you can really scan the cell

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.530
through it's three dimensions.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:58.570
See the chloroplast,
the nucleus, the shape,

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.600
the membrane systems.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.537
You can then print the
cells, which is beautiful,

00:39:04.537 --> 00:39:05.620
because you can show them.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.110
This is plankton
for blind people.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.160
You can really show them.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:09.970
It's very important.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.310
This cell, you know, it's one of
the most abundant on the planet

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:13.060
Earth, right?

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.950
And so it's so cool to
have it in your hand.

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:16.934
And actually, I will give you--

00:39:16.934 --> 00:39:18.100
you can pass it if you want.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.400
And now we need to--

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.890
and also, you can see
all this symbiosis

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:28.150
that these cells are made of.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.370
All the cells are congregates,
are little ecosystems.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.000
There are ecosystems
within the ecosystems.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.080
So we can study the--

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.900
here you can see
some cyanobacteria,

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.540
which are the cells that
give the chloroplasts, which

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:44.720
are living in symbiosis with
some of these organisms.

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:46.810
So we can start to understand
fundamental process

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:48.820
of evolution of this system.

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.940
The dream is this--

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:57.160
is to really understand the
rules of evolution, functioning

00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.939
ecology, of one biome
on earth, and basically

00:40:01.939 --> 00:40:03.730
to understand how
different models we have,

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.940
their stability,
their resilience.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.690
If we don't understand
this, we will never

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:13.330
be able to predict, accurately,
climate, or the future of our--

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.920
us human body.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.720
We totally depend
on the biosphere.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.720
And there is this guy at
MIT, Mick Follows, that

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.040
does some beautiful
modeling, including physics

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.650
and chemistry of the world.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:28.110
He's really a genius.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.160
But the problem is there
is no data, basically.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.130
We have the models.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.046
Everything is working.

00:40:32.046 --> 00:40:36.020
We just need to include
the complexity of life.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.800
So I think it's maybe
another 15, 20 years.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.870
And we will be there.

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:45.460
Since 50 years, we know that
we have to understand this one.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.670
This is really-- because, I
mean, it's stronger than Earth.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:52.810
The dynamics of the
Earth's community

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:56.250
will hit the dynamics
of the Earth system.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:58.750
And it will-- the Earth system
is much stronger than we are.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.100
That's for sure.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.610
So we have to learn how to live
in symbiosis with Mrs. Earth,

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:07.540
which contain all actually.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.880
So I want to thank
very much this little--

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.310
this was really a first,
very emotional, picture

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:14.610
of the beginning
of the crews, who

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.840
is Eric Karsenti,
of course, Romain.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.440
You have also Chris Bowler--

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.460
Etienne Bourgois, who used
to be the owner of Tara.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.780
Now it belong to
the Foundation--

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:26.440
and myself, and,
well, it was really

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.420
the little first nucleus.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.473
And thank you very much
to you for your attention.

00:41:32.473 --> 00:41:34.888
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:39.195 --> 00:41:41.070
SPEAKER 1: All right,
thanks very much, guys.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.460
It was an incredibly interesting
talk, some amazing information,

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.140
amazing visuals, amazing data.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.467
We're going to open up the
floor for some questions

00:41:49.467 --> 00:41:50.050
from Googlers.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.150
There is a couple of
mics at the back there.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.040
If you have any questions,
and you would like

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:57.670
to go up and bring them forth.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.267
I have a first question.

00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:00.910
ROMAIN TROUBLE: Are
you still on board?

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:01.409
Yes.

00:42:01.409 --> 00:42:02.140
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.540
ROMAIN TROUBLE: OK.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:09.370
SPEAKER 1: I'm going to open
it up with the first question.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:13.360
When I see the imagery
of all that amazing kind

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.310
of sea life, the plethora of all
these different kind of colors

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:19.820
and things, it's incredible.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.420
And then I see the imagery
of all the coral bleaching.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.900
And it's just really,
really impactful.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:31.570
What, in your opinion, can
me, as a person, and me,

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.784
as a Googler, do to
help with your cause?

00:42:35.784 --> 00:42:37.200
ROMAIN TROUBLE:
What you could do?

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.095
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:42:39.095 --> 00:42:41.220
ROMAIN TROUBLE: There is
a very simple thing to do.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.640
I think the problem with ecology
is that since decades we tell

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.380
people that we have no time.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:49.420
It's too late.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.440
The fate is over, or we have--

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.280
I think that we really
lose a lot of people

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.240
who don't want to see.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.220
If there is no time
to do something,

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.370
you better not want to see it,
because otherwise you panic.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.150
That's really the panic.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:10.420
And I believe that the change
we need in the society,

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.640
as a whole, is to
change behavior.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.380
And this will take generations.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.070
And that's, I believe--

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.085
OK, we have a lot of
stress on our planet now.

00:43:18.085 --> 00:43:19.460
We have a lot of,
as you can see,

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.580
a lot of stress
on the ecosystems.

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.460
I believe we have the
time to think ahead.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.970
As long as we plan, as
long as we know what to do,

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.970
as long as we do science
to understand this planet,

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.160
I believe that we
have time to change

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.670
in the future generation.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.230
What you buy every day--
when you buy something,

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.530
you have a huge power
on the future economy.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.580
The way you buy things,
good things, bad things,

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.950
healthy things, bad
for environment,

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.920
bad for the pollution--

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.670
really, a choice
is very important.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.650
The second thing you
can do is very cheap.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.270
It's free, actually.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:58.120
If you have kids,
you tell the kids--

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.400
you try to put them some
consciousness about all this--

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.400
not the details of course,
but this planet is our land,

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.050
is our home.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.660
How can we do things
better in the future?

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.070
It is easy.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:16.080
And this is, like, also a
trigger for questioning,

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:22.110
a trigger for innovating,
changing the way we did before,

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.790
change this way for what we
are going to do tomorrow.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:30.700
And of course, the third thing
you can do is when you vote.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.280
I don't ask you to
vote for ecologists,

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:38.461
but keeping in mind this, what
they have to say on ecology.

00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:40.460
But of course, don't vote
always for ecologists.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.810
I'm not really ecology's fan.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.550
But keep in mind what they
propose on this aspect.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:51.420
This is the way we're going to
change, slowly, the trajectory.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.735
And I think this is--

00:44:52.735 --> 00:44:53.010
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: The fifth.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.843
ROMAIN TROUBLE: The
ocean is very resilient.

00:44:54.843 --> 00:44:55.445
Colomban?

00:44:55.445 --> 00:44:57.940
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: The fifth
and very important thing,

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.250
as a Google engineer, you
can help us, basically.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.770
We have layers of complex
heterogeneous data--

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:07.050
global.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:10.584
We have genomes, expressed
genes, organisms, images.

00:45:10.584 --> 00:45:12.000
Then you have the
satellite images

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.300
also that you can connect.

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:16.060
So there is a lot
of-- it's big data.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.065
So our dream is
to have a Google--

00:45:19.065 --> 00:45:21.458
Tara Google ocean platform,
or something, in giant.

00:45:21.458 --> 00:45:24.000
ROMAIN TROUBLE: This is
due to Google networks--

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.540
the same.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:25.380
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: We really--

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:27.420
actually, we are
unable, us, to do that,

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.850
because we are too few people.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:34.350
And so if you can help us
to do that, and also to--

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:39.130
so there is big data--
exploring the big data first.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:43.520
And then there is artificial
intelligence for teaching,

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.900
for instance, the satellite
to recognize gene diversity,

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:46.577
or some--

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.910
you can imagine a lot of things.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.390
And I think this is a very good
use of artificial intelligence

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:54.390
for global ecology,
probably maybe the best

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.790
use of artificial intelligence.

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:56.940
ROMAIN TROUBLE: And if
you work really hard,

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.290
you may have a chance
to sail on board--

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.270
work really hard.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.728
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS:
So we need you.

00:46:01.728 --> 00:46:03.660
That's for sure.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:05.244
ROMAIN TROUBLE:
Another question?

00:46:05.244 --> 00:46:05.910
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:06.540
Hi.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.112
Over here on your right.

00:46:08.112 --> 00:46:08.820
Mark in the back.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:09.480
SPEAKER 1: Yes?

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:10.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:11.336
This was really fascinating.

00:46:11.336 --> 00:46:13.980
And it seems like
you're straddling lots

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.680
of world sailing and science.

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.150
I wanted to ask
about, generally,

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:20.430
how you're being supported.

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.670
It sounds like you have some
private support from companies

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.114
and individuals but
also public support.

00:46:26.114 --> 00:46:27.530
The French government,
especially,

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.490
seem very interested
to follow your work.

00:46:29.490 --> 00:46:32.070
Could you speak a little
bit about especially how

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:35.460
governments are helping you and
what they're doing to help you?

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.570
ROMAIN TROUBLE: Oh, it's
a real ecosystem as well.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.850
We have donators
like you and I giving

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:47.040
$10 a day per some time,
per month, or whatever.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040
We have big donors.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.250
We have corporate
foundations for French

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.330
corporate, Swedish, American,
and Japanese so far.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:57.750
Corporations who
contribute in sponsorship.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:59.250
They don't have any
clue what we do,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.800
don't have any rights
on what we collect.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.570
It's really sponsorship
for knowledge.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.590
We also work with
connectivities, cities,

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:10.420
like Lyons, Brittany.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:15.400
In France, we are pretty
well supported by the states.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.553
And over the last
10 years, since we

00:47:17.553 --> 00:47:20.320
are with Colomban
working on this project,

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.940
Colomban is working at the CNRS.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.369
It's a state laboratory.

00:47:24.369 --> 00:47:26.660
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: Like a
postier or, you know, I am--

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.242
ROMAIN TROUBLE: Like a postier,
like a-- yeah, a postman.

00:47:29.242 --> 00:47:31.700
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: No, this
the beauty of the CNRS system.

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.700
It's super stable.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.160
So we have a few people
totally fascinated

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.980
by this product in the CNRS,
in the French states, who

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.445
are going-- not going to stop.

00:47:39.445 --> 00:47:41.611
ROMAIN TROUBLE: So they are
supporting this project.

00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:45.930
They put already $20 million in
the research with the [FRENCH],,

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.390
with many, many, many
different aspects.

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.940
But we don't-- we
always need more.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.500
And we changed the way
we do science before.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:53.920
So this is innovation.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.320
Innovation is risky.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.539
And sometimes it is hard to get
funding for risky innovations.

00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:01.080
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: In a sense,
I think the beginning of this

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.830
started because we were
a few people with totally

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:04.630
stable work.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:11.986
You know, I cannot be
fired even if I don't work.

00:48:11.986 --> 00:48:14.650
And so there were
people like me.

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:17.660
And then the private
company, you know,

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:20.450
and Etienne Bourgois, and
agnes b., who were supporting.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:25.875
So this mix between hyper
stability and private funding

00:48:25.875 --> 00:48:29.929
founders make this
actually start.

00:48:29.929 --> 00:48:31.470
It would have been
very hard to start

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.100
this with classical academic--

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.847
ROMAIN TROUBLE: You know,
France took the leadership.

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.930
The French State took the
leadership at the COP 21

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.690
on climate.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.630
We did a lot.

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:45.760
France invested a lot
in diplomacy about that.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.300
And what we do now, we
started to also teach

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.850
that, OK, the planet,
the climate, we barely

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:52.662
understand it.

00:48:52.662 --> 00:48:54.370
What's going to be
the fate of the ocean?

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:55.680
How this would be a reaction?

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.406
What will be the future?

00:48:57.406 --> 00:48:59.030
And this is the next
step of the COP 21

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.260
is really to better
understand this ecosystem

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.010
that you see here.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:03.968
COLOMBAN DE VARGAS: In
2013, when we came back,

00:49:03.968 --> 00:49:10.470
we got French [FRENCH] funding,
which allowed us to organize,

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.580
to produce most of the
data, and organize it.

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.020
ROMAIN TROUBLE: And Cedric
Villani was here with us today,

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.510
because we are doing
now-- working now

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:20.940
is it artificial intelligence.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:25.142
We have so much data
that we need to dig into.

00:49:25.142 --> 00:49:26.850
And this is the
beginning of a new story.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:31.822
And I hope that Google will be
with us on that at some stage.

00:49:31.822 --> 00:49:32.655
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:32.655 --> 00:49:33.540
SPEAKER 1: All right,
guys, thanks very much.

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.510
I'm afraid we're--

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:35.040
ROMAIN TROUBLE: Good luck.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.331
SPEAKER 1: --we're out of time.

00:49:36.331 --> 00:49:39.230
Yeah, again, big round
of applause for Tara.

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:45.580
Thank you very much.
