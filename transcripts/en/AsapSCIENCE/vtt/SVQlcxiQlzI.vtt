00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.319
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.370
you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?"

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.800
And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.339
While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.539
necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.909
sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.489
by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.500
time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.210
issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.149
only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.699
concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.160
even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.899
function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off.

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.450
Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.170
After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.420
with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.240
of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.790
nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.500
brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.969
with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.549
off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.259
So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.020
average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.630
less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.420
not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.270
while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.320
increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality!

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.780
So too much sleep may also be a bad thing.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.790
But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.280
genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.420
gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.459
to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.819
have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.159
Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.690
your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.370
all. If you want to know how to get better quality sleep each night in order to conquer

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.560
the hurdles of sleep deprivation, we have some tips and research for you over on ASAPThought.
