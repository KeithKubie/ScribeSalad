00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.639
 (audience applause)

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:07.774
- Alright, guys.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.776
 So, it is our last
 episode of the season

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.078
 and right now we don't
 know when we're coming back

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.713
 or if we're ever coming back.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:15.581
You know, like your dad.

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.216
  (audience laughs)

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.085
I wanted to take
a minute tonight

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.453
 to talk about what drew me to

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.088
 Not Safe with Nikki
 Glaser, you know,

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:23.890
  besides the with
  Nikki Glaser part,

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.258
  it's really cool.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.927
 But in the past year I've
 talked to foot worshippers,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.229
 professional cuddlers,
 escorts, porn stars,

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.931
strippers, sugar
daddies, young couples,

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:34.267
 old couples, dudes on
 Tinder, pegging enthusiasts,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.903
  so many incredible
  comedians and guess what?

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.271
  Everybody has sex.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.606
 We're all doin' it.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:41.507
  That guy over there isn't,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.608
but the rest of us are.

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.410
  (audience laughs)

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:47.013
It's crazy to me that
we're all here right now

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:48.948
because some dude was just like.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:49.916
 (grunts forcefully)

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.684
 Like, that's crazy.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.987
  And by some dude,
  I mean your dad.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.456
  (audience laughs)

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.824
 Everyone of your dads.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.592
  Some of them even
  louder than that

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.194
and those are the ones
who aren't coming back.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.128
 But I know.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:06.966
  (audience laughs)

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:09.001
  I know that talking about
  sex is uncomfortable

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.336
 and it makes people all like,

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.472
like, how will I explain
this to my children?

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.173
 And it's like, your
 children, your kid

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.175
came out of your vagina
so the least you can do

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.778
is explain to them what one is.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.848
  And please don't tell them
  to call it a downstairs

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.117
  or a front bottom.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.986
  (audience laughs)

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:28.955
  I don't know, actually, I
  kinda like front bottom.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.623
  We can keep that.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.860
  But my parents, honestly,
  never gave me the sex talk

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:36.863
  which is why I talk about
  sex all the time now.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.898
 You made your bed,
 mom and dad, and now

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.968
I'm talking about banging in it.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.537
 Because sex was such a taboo
 subject in my household,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.906
 I didn't masterbate
 until my mid-20s.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.208
  So, like, like, yesterday.

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.210
  (audience laughs)

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.512
I'm 32.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.347
 So by the time I
 started masterbating,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.683
I felt like Billy
Madison of jacking off.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:02:00.853
 I felt stupid, left behind,
 and I could only do it

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.088
if I was staring at a
picture of Chris Farley

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.689
dressed as a bus driver.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.825
  (audience laughs)

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.760
 Don't do that to me, you guys.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:08.595
Stop it.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.897
  Here's the thing.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.665
  I think it's important
  that we all talk about sex

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:16.903
and here's why, because
he's talking about sex.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.337
Yeah, this guy.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.939
 And not just the
 adorable stuff he says

00:02:19.972 --> 00:02:22.909
 about wanting to date
 his own daughter.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:25.511
  Oh my god, I love
  engagement photos.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.613
  (audience groans)

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.549
It's disgusting.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.218
 Last week, Trump told
 young girls everywhere

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.853
that if they're sexually
harassed at work

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.888
 they should quit or
 find a new career.

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:39.425
 In other words, someone please
 sexually harass Donald Trump.

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:40.860
  I beg you, please.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:43.930
  (audience cheers)

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:49.735
 His VP, Mike Pence,
 is talking about sex.

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:50.937
He's also talking about
what kind of haircut

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.105
 he might get from the
 Lego factory next,

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:54.440
but mostly sex.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:56.976
 He said that if
 elected he and Trump

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.911
 will appoint Supreme
 Court justices

00:02:58.944 --> 00:03:01.047
  who will overturn
  Roe versus Wade.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.049
 You know, just like he
 overturns baby turtles

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.483
 in order to feel joy.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:06.285
  (audience laughs)

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:07.320
 Mikey likey.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:11.924
You need to talk about
sex because these states

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.160
 are talking about sex
 and they're all trying

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:15.761
 to pass legislation about it.

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:18.331
 Like, North Carolina and their
 trans-panic bathroom laws.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.901
  Or Mississippi with their
  Religious Freedom Act.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.803
  Even Indiana tried
  making it legal

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.905
to discriminate against
the LGBT community,

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.907
 but thankfully,
 people rebelled until

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.010
 their shit bag governor
 caved in and walked it back.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:32.845
 Wait, who is their governor?

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:36.115
 I for, oh, right,
 the turtle murderer.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.418
Guys, we have to talk about sex.

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.020
When we're quiet
and we treat sex

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.122
 like it's shameful or weird,

00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.757
 we leave a void that
 anyone could fill

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.293
 with their own personal
 hangups or religious beliefs

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.095
  and that's where
  shit hits the fan.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.530
 And I don't mean that in
 like a fetishy sort of way.

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:53.132
No offense, Jim.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:55.969
  (audience laughs)

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.505
Talk about sex.

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:01.107
 Be honest about it.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.175
Because look, I'm sure
last week not everybody

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:05.011
 wanted to hear the
 story about the time

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:07.313
I found a Monistat 7
cap lodged in my vagina

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:08.981
that had been there over a year.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.884
But isn't it better than
pretending that we don't

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.687
 lose Monistat 7
 caps in our vaginas?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.022
 Right?

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.523
If you're like I was and
are ashamed of yourself

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:20.459
 for what you're into, if
 you hate that you watch porn

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:22.662
 or that you like to
 lick feet or that you

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.998
 get turned on when milfs get
 hit in the face with pies,

00:04:26.031 --> 00:04:27.900
  you're not alone.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:32.305
The milf pie guy might
be because we broke up,

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:33.806
  but he dumped me.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.841
 He said I got too old.

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.677
 Sex is all around us.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.145
 In fact, sex is us.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.746
 It's how we got to be here.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:43.215
 It shouldn't be something
 we're ashamed to talk about.

00:04:43.248 --> 00:04:44.750
 So stop whispering.

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:45.685
Be loud.

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:46.552
  Be honest.

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:47.887
Be open.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.889
It should be celebrated
when we say like,

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:51.724
 I have sex, you know?

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.894
  (audience cheers)

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:56.529
 That's too much celebrating.

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.197
I mean, come on.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.099
  It's not like I
  won American Idol.

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:03.703
 I'm just a normal person who
 has sex sometimes, you know.

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:04.437
  (short sharp bang)

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:05.237
  (screams)

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.439
  (audience cheers)

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.407
  Guys, seriously, come on.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.777
 It's not New Year's Eve, okay.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.080
  ("Auld Lang Syne")

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.948
Is that Auld Lang Syne?

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:18.684
 Oh, Jesus, well maybe we
 should celebrate it this much.

00:05:18.717 --> 00:05:20.519
Guys, don't be quiet about sex.

00:05:20.552 --> 00:05:21.420
  Be loud about it.

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:22.221
 Talk about it.

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:23.356
 We'll be right back.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.655
  (audience cheers)
