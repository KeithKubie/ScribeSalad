00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.750
All right.
Today we're going to start on a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.146
topic, one of the harder topics
that we cover this semester.

00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:30.000
We're going to start talking
about molecular orbital theory.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.681
So this is a quantum mechanical
description of the wave

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.668
functions in a molecule.
And we're going to use

00:00:38.668 --> 00:00:43.696
molecular orbital theory to look
at the bonding in diatomic

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:47.250
molecules.
That is what we will do for the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.151
rest of today.
We will look solely at diatomic

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:56.092
molecules, and we will look
mostly at homonuclear diatomic

00:00:56.092 --> 00:01:00.695
molecules.
At the end we will look at one

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:05.278
heteronuclear diatomic molecule.
And then on Monday,

00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:10.489
we're actually going to use a
different kind of approach to

00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:15.971
look at the chemical bonding in
molecules that are larger than

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:19.565
diatomic.
So we're going to use molecular

00:01:19.565 --> 00:01:23.428
orbital theory for these
diatomic molecules,

00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:29.000
and then on Monday we will go a
little bit further.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.176
We will look at bigger
molecules.

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:33.761
And we are going to use
something else.

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:37.979
We're going to use valence bond
theory and hybridization ideas.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.925
But today we're going to deal
with these diatomic molecules

00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:44.306
with the molecular orbital
approach.

00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:46.074
All right?
So here it goes.

00:01:46.074 --> 00:01:49.000
We're going to start talking
about hydrogen,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.149
as we usually do when we start
talking about chemical bonding.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.687
I am going to represent my
hydrogen atom here by this

00:01:56.687 --> 00:01:59.000
nucleus here,
a.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.839
This is going to be hydrogen
atom a.

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:06.789
And I am going to represent the
wave function of that hydrogen

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.333
atom by a circle because,
after all, the 1s wave function

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.254
in hydrogen is spherically
symmetric.

00:02:14.254 --> 00:02:18.879
I am going to represent it by a
circle around the nucleus.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.936
So this is going to be 1sa.
And then I am going to,

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:27.317
of course, have a second
hydrogen atom represented here

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:31.942
by this nucleus b and a circle
around it because that wave

00:02:31.942 --> 00:02:36.000
function is spherically
symmetric.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.934
And what I am going to do in
this molecular orbital theory

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:46.041
approach is that I am going to
take these two wave functions

00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:50.976
and I am going to bring them a
distance of the bond length

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:52.794
apart.
In other words,

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:57.988
I am going to take those two
hydrogen atoms and I am going to

00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:02.402
put the two nuclei here,
a and b, at a distance of a

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:07.744
bond length apart.
And I am going to let these two

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:12.347
wave functions overlap.
And these are wave functions.

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:17.924
And what we learned a few weeks
ago is that waves constructively

00:03:17.924 --> 00:03:21.111
interfere or destructively
interfere.

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:26.422
What we're going to do first
here is we're going to let these

00:03:26.422 --> 00:03:32.000
two waves constructively
interfere where they overlap.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.752
When we do that,
this part of the wave function

00:03:36.752 --> 00:03:43.261
here is going to constructively
interfere with this part of this

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.704
wave function.
And then the sum of those two

00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:53.904
is going to look something like
this, where now there is this

00:03:53.904 --> 00:04:00.000
constructive interference
between these two nuclei.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.142
There is a lot of wave function
right here, because we

00:04:04.142 --> 00:04:08.129
superimposed those two wave
functions, each from one

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.412
hydrogen atom.
And so there is constructive

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:15.164
interference here,
there's a lot of wave function

00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:17.353
right there.
And in so doing,

00:04:17.353 --> 00:04:21.886
what we're going to call this
resultant wave function here,

00:04:21.886 --> 00:04:26.498
we are going to call that the
molecular wave function or the

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:29.000
molecular orbital.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.094
And how we got it was simply a
linear combination of atomic

00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:44.297
orbitals.
This is a linear combination of

00:04:44.297 --> 00:04:49.235
atomic orbitals.
We just brought those two atoms

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:54.699
close enough so that their wave
functions overlapped,

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:00.478
constructive interference,
and the result is a molecular

00:05:00.478 --> 00:05:05.268
wave function.
Now, we are going to give that

00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:09.882
molecular wave function a name.
We're going to call it a sigma

00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:12.756
wave function.
The sigma designates the

00:05:12.756 --> 00:05:17.294
symmetry of that wave function
with respect to the bond axis.

00:05:17.294 --> 00:05:19.714
This is the bond axis right
here.

00:05:19.714 --> 00:05:23.873
The sigma represents the fact
that this is cylindrically

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:26.823
symmetric about the molecular
bond axis.

00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:33.240
That's what that sigma means.
And we are going to call this a

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.257
sigma 1s orbital.
It's a sigma 1s orbital because

00:05:38.257 --> 00:05:44.006
this was a linear combination of
two 1s atomic orbitals.

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:49.965
But now what I want to do is I
want to remind you that the

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:56.341
physically significant part of
this wave function was actually

00:05:56.341 --> 00:06:01.228
the wave function squared.
Remember that?

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:05.877
We talked about taking the wave
function, squaring it.

00:06:05.877 --> 00:06:10.087
And that interpretation is a
probability density.

00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:15.263
That was what was critical to
our understanding of where the

00:06:15.263 --> 00:06:20.350
electrons are in a molecule.
So that is what we're going to

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.684
do here.
We're going to take this sigma

00:06:23.684 --> 00:06:30.000
1s molecular wave function now,
and we're going to square it.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.270
And that is then proportional
to, or interpreted as,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.644
a probability density.
I will just abbreviate that by

00:06:40.644 --> 00:06:45.398
P, but this is a probability
density, remember,

00:06:45.398 --> 00:06:49.945
not a probability.
Well, if that is the case,

00:06:49.945 --> 00:06:55.835
then I can multiply this out.
Because sigma 1s right here,

00:06:55.835 --> 00:07:01.829
that sigma 1s is really equal
to this linear combination of

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:05.947
1sa, 1sb.
That is sigma 1s.

00:07:05.947 --> 00:07:12.250
So let me take 1sa plus 1sb,
multiply it by 1sa plus 1sb.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:18.093
That's what sigma 1s is.

00:07:18.093 --> 00:07:22.104
I'm just going to multiply this
out.

00:07:22.104 --> 00:07:28.520
And when I do that I am going
to get 1sa squared plus 1sb

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.135
squared plus 2 times
1sa 1sb.

00:07:34.135 --> 00:07:39.946
That is my probability density.

00:07:39.946 --> 00:07:44.889
But now, to make this a little
bit more real for you,

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:48.311
let's plot it.
I am going to plot the

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:53.444
probability density as a
function of the position along

00:07:53.444 --> 00:07:56.486
the bond axis.
In this case here,

00:07:56.486 --> 00:08:02.000
the nucleus a is here and the
nucleus b is there.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.989
So we have a molecule now.
I am just going to plot the

00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:10.053
probability density as a
function of the position along

00:08:10.053 --> 00:08:13.817
the internuclear axis.
And what is it going to look

00:08:13.817 --> 00:08:16.376
like?
Well, it's going to look like

00:08:16.376 --> 00:08:18.935
this.
It is going to look something

00:08:18.935 --> 00:08:23.677
like that, where the probability
density is the highest right at

00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:28.193
nucleus a and the probability
density is the highest right at

00:08:28.193 --> 00:08:31.708
nucleus b.
Because, after all,

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:35.037
any wave function,
an s wave function,

00:08:35.037 --> 00:08:40.523
the highest value of that wave
function is right at r is equal

00:08:40.523 --> 00:08:45.201
to zero or right at the nucleus.
So that is what that

00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:50.597
probability density looks like.
And I have just been informed

00:08:50.597 --> 00:08:55.994
here that the Xeroxing on that
particular figure did not turn

00:08:55.994 --> 00:09:01.661
out so well, but that is what it
should read, if you cannot read

00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:06.941
it very well.
But the reason I plot this here

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:10.357
is to contrast it with the
following.

00:09:10.357 --> 00:09:15.102
Suppose I take just one
hydrogen atom and the other

00:09:15.102 --> 00:09:19.372
hydrogen atom,
but I take those wave functions

00:09:19.372 --> 00:09:23.642
and I just square them and then
I add them up.

00:09:23.642 --> 00:09:30.000
Suppose I take a hydrogen atom
with its wave function 1sa.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.525
I square it.
And then I take another wave

00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:36.875
function for another hydrogen
atom 1sb.

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.960
I square it.
And I add those two up.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.574
In this case,
what that is doing is taking

00:09:43.574 --> 00:09:48.598
two hydrogen atoms and just
taking their wave function and

00:09:48.598 --> 00:09:51.948
squaring them.
In this particular case,

00:09:51.948 --> 00:09:56.884
what I haven't done is I
haven't allowed any interference

00:09:56.884 --> 00:10:01.389
to happen.
I haven't allowed the wave

00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:04.789
functions to constructively
interfere.

00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:10.210
I did not add up these wave
functions first before I squared

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.518
them.
I squared them and then I added

00:10:13.518 --> 00:10:16.918
them up.
That is different than taking

00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:21.329
those wave functions,
letting them constructively

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:24.270
interfere and then squaring
them.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.508
And you can see the difference
is when I plot this sum and

00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:35.924
compare it to that sum.
So I am going to plot now this

00:10:35.924 --> 00:10:39.044
sum.
When I do that it's going to

00:10:39.044 --> 00:10:42.261
look, well, pretty much like
this.

00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:47.720
But then right at the center,
right here, the probability

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.594
density for this case,
for two hydrogen atoms which

00:10:52.594 --> 00:10:56.981
are now nonbonded,
they're nonbonded because I

00:10:56.981 --> 00:11:01.757
didn't let those two wave
functions constructively

00:11:01.757 --> 00:11:06.083
interfere.
The result is that this

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:11.607
probability density right in the
center here, that probability

00:11:11.607 --> 00:11:16.588
density is less than what it
would be if I let those two

00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:21.388
hydrogen atom wave functions
constructively interfere.

00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:26.732
And that is the key in this
chemical bond is this term right

00:11:26.732 --> 00:11:30.820
here.
It's this term that makes all

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.905
of the difference.
This is our constructive

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:39.088
interference.
This is the extra density that

00:11:39.088 --> 00:11:44.729
we get because those two wave
functions have constructively

00:11:44.729 --> 00:11:48.814
interfered.
That is what gives me this pile

00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:53.386
up of electron density right in
the center here.

00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:57.082
This is the glue in this
chemical bond.

00:11:57.082 --> 00:12:00.000
Make sense?
Okay.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.491
All right.
We have formed,

00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:08.472
now, a molecular wave function,
by this linear combination of

00:12:08.472 --> 00:12:13.655
atomic wave function.
Now, what happens to the energy

00:12:13.655 --> 00:12:17.842
when we do that?
Well, you can imagine what

00:12:17.842 --> 00:12:22.128
happens to the energy.
The energy goes down.

00:12:22.128 --> 00:12:26.315
We are going to form a new
molecular state.

00:12:26.315 --> 00:12:31.000
Let's draw an energy level
diagram.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.340
Energy going up here.
And let me represent here,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.312
by these two lines,
the energy levels of the

00:12:39.312 --> 00:12:44.391
separated hydrogen atoms.
I am going to call this the 1s

00:12:44.391 --> 00:12:47.993
state on atom a,
the 1s state on atom b.

00:12:47.993 --> 00:12:53.073
They're at the same energy.
They are two hydrogen atoms.

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:58.060
You cannot tell them apart.
And each one of them has an

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.379
electron.
Once we allow those two wave

00:13:02.379 --> 00:13:06.798
functions to constructively
interfere, we're going to

00:13:06.798 --> 00:13:11.048
produce a new state.
We're going to call that state

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:14.277
sigma 1s.
And that state is going to be

00:13:14.277 --> 00:13:19.291
lower in energy here than the
two states from the individual

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:23.116
hydrogen atoms.
And that is good because if it

00:13:23.116 --> 00:13:27.110
is lower in energy,
we've got these two hydrogen

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:32.148
atoms stuck together.
We formed a chemical bond.

00:13:32.148 --> 00:13:36.363
These two hydrogen atoms are
not going to fly apart.

00:13:36.363 --> 00:13:39.917
That's what we wanted to do.
And, therefore,

00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:44.545
those two electrons here,
one from each hydrogen atom are

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:48.677
sitting now in this new
molecular state that we are

00:13:48.677 --> 00:13:52.644
calling sigma 1s.
And the wave function then that

00:13:52.644 --> 00:13:57.768
describes the electrons in that
state is the sigma 1s molecular

00:13:57.768 --> 00:14:01.421
wave function.
That's great.

00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:06.562
Everything looks cool,
except now that these are

00:14:06.562 --> 00:14:09.187
waves.
Not only can waves

00:14:09.187 --> 00:14:14.765
constructively interfere,
but they can destructively

00:14:14.765 --> 00:14:19.687
interfere, too.
So we have got to take care of

00:14:19.687 --> 00:14:23.734
that case now,
the case of destructive

00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:28.000
interference.
Let's do that.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.507
In this case,
what is going to happen?

00:14:38.507 --> 00:14:42.394
Well, again,
we have our 1sa wave function

00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:47.513
and our 1sb wave function.
And, now, when I am going to

00:14:47.513 --> 00:14:53.486
bring these two together to the
equilibrium bond length ab here,

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:58.984
what is going to happen is in
destructive interference this

00:14:58.984 --> 00:15:06.000
wave function is going to cancel
this part of the wave function.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.693
When these overlap and I take
this minus sign here,

00:15:10.693 --> 00:15:16.326
or I am superimposing two wave
functions with different sign,

00:15:16.326 --> 00:15:20.363
I am going to have destructive
interference.

00:15:20.363 --> 00:15:25.808
And the result is that the
molecular wave function is going

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:30.399
to kind of look like this.
Right in the center,

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.708
here, there is going to be a
node.

00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:36.417
There is a node because this
part of the wave function

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:39.706
exactly canceled this part of
the wave function.

00:15:39.706 --> 00:15:43.695
Hey, there is no wave function
right there because we have

00:15:43.695 --> 00:15:47.544
destructive interference.
How are we going to label this

00:15:47.544 --> 00:15:50.693
wave function?
Well, we are also going to call

00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:53.282
it a sigma wave function.
It is sigma.

00:15:53.282 --> 00:15:57.200
That is the symmetry because
it's cylindrically symmetric

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.269
around the bond access.
But, because it is a linear

00:16:03.269 --> 00:16:09.566
combination here that is a
consequence of destructive

00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:14.652
interference,
I am going to call this sigma

00:16:14.652 --> 00:16:20.585
star 1s.
And I am going to call that

00:16:20.585 --> 00:16:26.035
sigma star 1s,
which is an antibonding orbital

00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:34.200
or an antibonding wave function.
Now, how do I know that?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.933
Well, let's also calculate the
probability density here for

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:46.333
sigma 1s star.
That is going to be

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:49.533
interesting.
We've got P,

00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:54.066
probability density,
sigma 1s star,

00:16:54.066 --> 00:17:01.933
square it, so I have now a 1sa
minus 1sb times 1sa minus 1sb.

00:17:01.933 --> 00:17:08.891
Multiply that out,

00:17:08.891 --> 00:17:15.194
so I get 1sa quantity squared
plus 1sb quantity squared minus

00:17:15.194 --> 00:17:21.077
2 times 1sa times 1sb.

00:17:21.077 --> 00:17:25.700
I am now going to plot this on
my graph here.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.953
This is what I am plotting
right on my graph of the

00:17:30.953 --> 00:17:35.353
probability density.
When I do that,

00:17:35.353 --> 00:17:39.505
well, way out here,
on one end of the molecule,

00:17:39.505 --> 00:17:42.483
probability density is pretty
low.

00:17:42.483 --> 00:17:47.989
Probability density goes to a
maximum right at the nucleus and

00:17:47.989 --> 00:17:52.140
then it plummets.
And right at the center here,

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:57.285
the probability density is
zero, because the wave function

00:17:57.285 --> 00:18:01.510
is zero.
Because we had destructive

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.760
interference.
I want you to notice something.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.850
Probability density here is
zero.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.258
It is even lower than this
case, which is just the sum of

00:18:14.258 --> 00:18:18.894
two hydrogen atoms,
their wave functions squared.

00:18:18.894 --> 00:18:23.336
In the case when the two
hydrogen atoms are not

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:30.000
interacting, the probability
density is some finite value.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.086
But in the case of this
antibonding state,

00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:38.273
the probability density is
zero, goose egg,

00:18:38.273 --> 00:18:41.662
zip, nada, all of the other
things.

00:18:41.662 --> 00:18:46.546
There is nothing there.
This state here that we're

00:18:46.546 --> 00:18:51.430
forming is antibonding.
It is not even nonbonding.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.717
Nonbonding you've got more
electron density.

00:18:55.717 --> 00:19:01.000
Let me fix my microphone here.
All right.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.374
Nonbonding has more electron
density than antibonding.

00:19:06.374 --> 00:19:09.923
This is antibonding against
bonding.

00:19:09.923 --> 00:19:15.398
That is the kind of state we
just formed by destructive

00:19:15.398 --> 00:19:19.048
interference.
So, where do you think,

00:19:19.048 --> 00:19:23.814
in an energy diagram,
the sigma 1s star

00:19:23.814 --> 00:19:28.479
level is?
Well, you can imagine where it

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:32.582
is.
It is increased in energy.

00:19:32.582 --> 00:19:35.364
It is up here,
sigma 1s star.

00:19:35.364 --> 00:19:40.430
And it turns out that the
amount of energy above the

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:46.192
energy for the two separated
hydrogen atoms that this state

00:19:46.192 --> 00:19:51.357
lies is about equal to the
amount of energy below the

00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:54.933
separated atoms that this state
lies.

00:19:54.933 --> 00:20:00.000
These two energies are about
equivalent.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.285
We now have a bonding state or
a bonding orbital.

00:20:04.285 --> 00:20:09.464
We now have an antibonding
state or an antibonding orbital.

00:20:09.464 --> 00:20:13.392
Now, when do we use that
antibonding orbital?

00:20:13.392 --> 00:20:18.928
Well, we are going to see in a
moment, but one case would be if

00:20:18.928 --> 00:20:23.035
we had an excited state of a
hydrogen molecule.

00:20:23.035 --> 00:20:28.035
In an excited state what we
could do is take one of these

00:20:28.035 --> 00:20:32.727
electrons.
And my eraser is kind of wet

00:20:32.727 --> 00:20:36.818
here so it is not erasing.
Let me dry this.

00:20:36.818 --> 00:20:42.175
I could take one of these
electrons here and populate it

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:47.532
and put it in this state.
That's the first excited state

00:20:47.532 --> 00:20:50.357
of H two,
not H, H two.

00:20:50.357 --> 00:20:56.201
A second excited state would
be, hey, this is permanent chalk

00:20:56.201 --> 00:21:00.000
once it gets wet.
All right.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.918
The second excited state would
be taking that second electron

00:21:04.918 --> 00:21:08.360
and promoting it to this
antibonding state.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.459
That would be the second
excited state of molecular

00:21:12.459 --> 00:21:15.655
hydrogen.
Now, I've got to tell you that

00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:20.000
if you have these kinds of
excited states in molecular

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.016
hydrogen, molecular hydrogen
doesn't stick around.

00:21:24.016 --> 00:21:27.786
It is going to fall apart.
But the ground state

00:21:27.786 --> 00:21:32.950
configuration of H two has these
two electrons here in the sigma

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:38.046
1s state.
I also just want to point out

00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:44.035
here what the significance
physically is of the separation

00:21:44.035 --> 00:21:50.233
in energy between the hydrogen
atom states and the molecular

00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:54.435
hydrogen state.
Here is the significance.

00:21:54.435 --> 00:22:00.108
Remember we drew an energy of
interaction for molecular

00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:04.284
hydrogen?
We talked about the general

00:22:04.284 --> 00:22:08.853
principles, the general
attractions and repulsions that

00:22:08.853 --> 00:22:13.930
take place in every chemical
bond, and the result was a curve

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.415
that kind of looked like this,
where this is hydrogen,

00:22:18.415 --> 00:22:22.646
two separated hydrogen atoms,
this is of course the

00:22:22.646 --> 00:22:27.553
equilibrium bond length of H
two, the molecules bonded here

00:22:27.553 --> 00:22:32.207
everywhere where this energy is
lower than the separated

00:22:32.207 --> 00:22:37.521
hydrogen atom limit.
Well, the physical significance

00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:41.180
here of this energy lowering of
this state is,

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.572
well, this is essentially delta
E sub d,

00:22:45.572 --> 00:22:48.337
right?
This is essentially the bond

00:22:48.337 --> 00:22:52.484
strength of molecular hydrogen.
That is what that is

00:22:52.484 --> 00:22:55.819
physically.
This energy from here to here,

00:22:55.819 --> 00:23:00.454
that's what it is going to take
to pull the hydrogen atoms

00:23:00.454 --> 00:23:03.854
apart.
The bond energy.

00:23:03.854 --> 00:23:10.111
We took care of hydrogen.
We have two molecular states,

00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:16.369
bonding and antibonding.
For the ground state hydrogen,

00:23:16.369 --> 00:23:21.004
both electrons are in that
bonding state.

00:23:21.004 --> 00:23:25.639
Now let's walk across the
Periodic Table.

00:23:25.639 --> 00:23:31.625
Oh, one other thing.
If you were asked to write the

00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:36.615
electron configuration of
molecular hydrogen in the ground

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:40.291
state what would you do?
Well, the electron

00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:43.793
configuration of molecular
hydrogen then,

00:23:43.793 --> 00:23:47.381
the way we would write it is
sigma 1s two,

00:23:47.381 --> 00:23:51.145
meaning two electrons in the
sigma 1s state.

00:23:51.145 --> 00:23:55.522
And, just to be complete here,
you could write this

00:23:55.522 --> 00:24:02.000
antibonding state as sigma 1s
star with zero electrons in it.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
That would be the electron
configuration.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.599
Well, now what we are going to
want to do is to write the

00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:17.700
electron configuration for the
next molecule as we walk across

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.299
the periodic table.
The next diatomic molecule.

00:24:22.299 --> 00:24:27.599
Well, the next diatomic
molecule is going to be helium

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:33.767
two.
Where are the electrons in the

00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:39.669
case of helium two?
Well, in the case of helium,

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:44.693
each helium atom brings in two
electrons.

00:24:44.693 --> 00:24:51.599
Each helium atom has two
electrons here in the 1s state,

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:57.000
so I am now drawing this for
helium.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.567
And the way we draw this
correlation diagram,

00:25:00.567 --> 00:25:03.810
as it is called,
is following this Aufbau

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.621
Principle that we had for
filling atomic states.

00:25:07.621 --> 00:25:12.405
That is, we take the states,
we order them in terms of their

00:25:12.405 --> 00:25:16.945
energy, lowest energy at the
bottom, next highest energy,

00:25:16.945 --> 00:25:21.486
and then we start to put
electrons in those states one at

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:26.432
a time, starting at the bottom,
starting at the lowest energy,

00:25:26.432 --> 00:25:32.678
until we run out of electrons.
So that is what we're going to

00:25:32.678 --> 00:25:36.071
do for helium.
What is going to happen?

00:25:36.071 --> 00:25:40.714
Two of these electrons are
going to be in the bonding

00:25:40.714 --> 00:25:46.071
state, and then two of these
electrons are going to be in the

00:25:46.071 --> 00:25:49.375
antibonding state.
And so the electron

00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:54.464
configuration here for helium is
1s two sigma 1s star two.

00:25:54.464 --> 00:26:00.000
That's the electron
configuration for helium dimer.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.612
But this is interesting
because, look,

00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:07.126
we have now,
in this molecular state,

00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:12.691
two electrons that are at an
energy that is lower than the

00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:18.548
two separated helium limit and
two electrons that are higher.

00:26:18.548 --> 00:26:24.211
It seems like there wasn't an
overall stabilization of this

00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:29.775
molecule because we have one
state that is lower in energy

00:26:29.775 --> 00:26:37.000
and another state that is higher
in energy by the same amount.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.048
So the overall is zippo.
And, indeed,

00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:48.500
that is the case.
We've got a tool for counting

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:57.054
or for telling how strong the
bond is, and that tool is called

00:26:57.054 --> 00:27:03.111
the bond order.
The bond order is defined as

00:27:03.111 --> 00:27:09.666
one-half the number of bonding
electrons minus the number of

00:27:09.666 --> 00:27:16.000
antibonding electrons.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.222
In the case of helium two

00:27:21.222 --> 00:27:27.888
we've got two bonding
electrons and two antibonding

00:27:27.888 --> 00:27:32.746
electrons.
In the case of helium two,

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:36.549
the bond order here is equal to
zero.

00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:40.774
When you have a bond order
equal to zero,

00:27:40.774 --> 00:27:45.000
what that means is that you
have no bond.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.063
And, indeed,
that is the case.

00:27:48.063 --> 00:27:51.760
Helium two has no bond between
them.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.253
Now, accurately speaking,
helium two does have a bond

00:27:57.253 --> 00:28:03.159
between them.
Helium two was discovered,

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:05.590
so to speak,
in 1993.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:11.909
And it was made under really
very special conditions.

00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:18.350
And the bond strength of helium
two is a whopping 0.01

00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:24.305
kilojoules per mole.
That is for He two.

00:28:24.305 --> 00:28:30.381
Whereas, for example,
the bond strength in hydrogen

00:28:30.381 --> 00:28:38.348
is 432 kilojoules per mole.
So you can see how weak a bond

00:28:38.348 --> 00:28:40.580
that is.
Effectively,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.602
this has no bond at all,
practically speaking.

00:28:45.602 --> 00:28:52.075
And so molecular orbital theory
really gets it right in the

00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:57.098
sense that it tells you there is
no bond here.

00:28:57.098 --> 00:29:00.000
Great.
All right.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.843
Now, what we're going to do is
we're going to keep marching

00:29:06.843 --> 00:29:13.451
across the Periodic Table.
Actually, we've got to go down

00:29:13.451 --> 00:29:18.407
one row now.
And let's look at the electron

00:29:18.407 --> 00:29:25.486
configuration for lithium dimer.
Now, if we're going to bring

00:29:25.486 --> 00:29:32.212
together two lithium atoms,
lithium has two electrons that

00:29:32.212 --> 00:29:40.000
are in the 1s state and one
electron each in a 2s state.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.446
And let me put them in.
Those are the electron

00:29:43.446 --> 00:29:47.276
configurations for the two
separated lithium atoms.

00:29:47.276 --> 00:29:50.570
How do we write this electron
configuration?

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.863
Well, again,
we follow the Aufbau Principle.

00:29:53.863 --> 00:29:58.000
We put two electrons here,
two electrons here.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.909
But now, since we've got these
2s electrons,

00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:07.272
what we are going to have to do
is to form molecular states,

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:11.909
molecular orbitals between
these 2s atomic orbitals.

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:17.363
And the 2s atomic orbitals form
these molecular states in the

00:30:17.363 --> 00:30:20.909
same way that the 1s atomic
orbitals do.

00:30:20.909 --> 00:30:25.636
They're all spherically
symmetric, so they form these

00:30:25.636 --> 00:30:30.000
orbitals in absolutely the same
way.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.278
And so you get a sigma 2s
bonding state and a sigma 2s

00:30:34.278 --> 00:30:37.265
star antibonding
state.

00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:40.817
If you want to write the
correlation diagram,

00:30:40.817 --> 00:30:44.208
as it is called,
for lithium two,

00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:48.729
you take all of lithium's
electrons and you now put it in

00:30:48.729 --> 00:30:52.765
the lowest energy state,
put it in the next highest

00:30:52.765 --> 00:30:57.286
energy state and put it in the
next highest energy state.

00:30:57.286 --> 00:31:01.000
That is the correlation
diagram.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.849
We ran out of electrons.
We had six electrons total.

00:31:05.849 --> 00:31:10.318
The electron configuration
written here is this,

00:31:10.318 --> 00:31:15.262
sigma 1s 2, sigma 1s star 2,
sigma 2s 2.

00:31:17.639 --> 00:31:22.108
What is the bond order here?
Let's calculate it.

00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:25.436
We have two,
four bonding electrons.

00:31:25.436 --> 00:31:30.000
We've got two antibonding
electrons.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.183
4 minus 2 divided by 2 is 1.
We've got a bond order of one.

00:31:36.183 --> 00:31:39.808
That means we've got a single
bond.

00:31:39.808 --> 00:31:44.606
That bond strength is 105
kilojoules per mole.

00:31:44.606 --> 00:31:49.617
That is single bond.
It's a weak single bond but

00:31:49.617 --> 00:31:54.202
that is a single bond.
What about beryllium?

00:31:54.202 --> 00:31:59.000
Let's make beryllium 
two.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.533
How did these two get up here?
Okay.

00:32:17.533 --> 00:32:22.076
These electrons are the
electrons on the atom.

00:32:22.076 --> 00:32:27.831
The lithium atom has two 1s
electrons and one 2s electron.

00:32:27.831 --> 00:32:33.384
And this is the energy ordering
for the atomic states in

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:38.429
lithium.
The molecular state for lithium

00:32:38.429 --> 00:32:44.623
here, the sigma 2s state,
it is higher in energy than the

00:32:44.623 --> 00:32:49.601
sigma 1s star.
This is the correct ordering of

00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:56.017
the energies of these states.
I didn't clearly explain that

00:32:56.017 --> 00:33:00.000
to you.
Does that make sense?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.957
Yeah.
Okay.

00:33:00.957 --> 00:33:04.117
Now we will go to beryllium
dimer.

00:33:04.117 --> 00:33:09.095
Now we've got two 2s electrons.
Again, what do we do?

00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:14.265
We put two of the electrons in
the lowest energy state,

00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:20.010
two in the next highest energy
state, two in the next highest

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:23.840
energy state,
and another two in the next

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.865
highest energy state.
The electron configuration here

00:33:29.865 --> 00:33:34.210
of beryllium dimer,
sigma 1s 2, sigma 1s star 2,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:38.000
sigma 2s 2, sigma 2s 
star 2.

00:33:41.605 --> 00:33:45.579
The two is cut off here,
but there is a two.

00:33:45.579 --> 00:33:48.168
What is the bond order?
Zero.

00:33:48.168 --> 00:33:52.605
There is no bond here in
beryllium two.

00:33:52.605 --> 00:33:56.025
Now, again, there is a very
weak bond.

00:33:56.025 --> 00:34:02.256
It is 9 kilojoules per mole.
But, for all practical

00:34:02.256 --> 00:34:07.179
purposes, there is no bond
between beryllium two.

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:12.410
And this molecular orbital
approach gets that right.

00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:17.025
Well, now boron.
Boron has got a p electron in

00:34:17.025 --> 00:34:22.358
the atomic configuration.
Now what we've got to do is

00:34:22.358 --> 00:34:28.512
look at the constructive and
destructive interference between

00:34:28.512 --> 00:34:33.615
these p wave functions.
We've got to do that.

00:34:33.615 --> 00:34:36.230
We've got to make molecular
states.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.461
We've got to let the p wave
functions, the p atomic wave

00:34:40.461 --> 00:34:45.000
functions constructively and
destructively interfere to make

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.076
a new molecular wave function.
You ready?

00:34:48.076 --> 00:34:51.923
Here is how we do it.
Here is the 2px wave function

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:55.307
or the 2py wave function.
They look the same,

00:34:55.307 --> 00:34:57.846
right?
One is just in x-dimension.

00:34:57.846 --> 00:35:03.397
One is in the y-dimension.
They've got a nodal plane right

00:35:03.397 --> 00:35:06.181
here.
What we are going to do is take

00:35:06.181 --> 00:35:09.893
that wave function,
overlap it with the same wave

00:35:09.893 --> 00:35:12.831
function, 2px or 2py from
another atom.

00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:17.239
We're going to bring these two
within the equilibrium bond

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:20.023
length.
We are going to let this part

00:35:20.023 --> 00:35:24.199
of the wave function overlap
with this part of the wave

00:35:24.199 --> 00:35:30.000
function and this part of the
wave function overlap with this.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.149
And we are going to treat
constructive interference first.

00:35:34.149 --> 00:35:38.226
And the result is a wave
function that kind of looks like

00:35:38.226 --> 00:35:40.775
this.
In the center right here we've

00:35:40.775 --> 00:35:44.779
got a lot of wave function,
because right here we've got

00:35:44.779 --> 00:35:48.856
constructive interference.
In the center here we've got a

00:35:48.856 --> 00:35:52.132
lot of wave function.
However, right along the

00:35:52.132 --> 00:35:55.117
internuclear axis we've got a
nodal plane.

00:35:55.117 --> 00:35:59.267
Well, we've got a nodal plane
there because we had a nodal

00:35:59.267 --> 00:36:04.000
plane in the atomic wave
functions to begin with.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.188
So that nodal plane is
maintained here.

00:36:08.188 --> 00:36:11.165
I will try this again.
Okay.

00:36:11.165 --> 00:36:15.354
Now, this molecular wave
function here,

00:36:15.354 --> 00:36:22.188
it is going to have a different
name because it has a different

00:36:22.188 --> 00:36:25.937
symmetry.
This wave function is not

00:36:25.937 --> 00:36:32.000
cylindrically symmetric around
the bond axis.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.550
There is wave function above
the bond axis and wave function

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:41.878
below the bond axis,
but not on the sides here.

00:36:41.878 --> 00:36:47.052
It is not cylindrically
symmetric, so we have a new name

00:36:47.052 --> 00:36:50.062
for it.
It is a pi wave function.

00:36:50.062 --> 00:36:54.202
And we are going to call it pi
2px or pi 2py.

00:36:54.202 --> 00:36:59.000
It's going to be a bonding wave
function.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.652
And, of course,
since it is a bonding wave

00:37:02.652 --> 00:37:06.839
function, if we look at an
energy level diagram,

00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:12.272
the pi 2px and pi 2py are going
to be lower in energy than the

00:37:12.272 --> 00:37:15.568
atomic wave functions,
just like this.

00:37:15.568 --> 00:37:20.913
And since the 2px and the 2py
in the atomic states are at the

00:37:20.913 --> 00:37:26.436
same energy, the pi 2px and pi
2py, they are going to be at the

00:37:26.436 --> 00:37:32.000
same energy in the molecule.
Make sense?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.962
Okay.
Let's do boron.

00:37:40.962 --> 00:37:45.476
Boron two.
Boron has got one p electron.

00:37:45.476 --> 00:37:50.971
It also has some s electrons.
The s states are down here.

00:37:50.971 --> 00:37:54.602
I didn't draw them in on this
diagram.

00:37:54.602 --> 00:38:00.000
I am just treating right here
the 2px electron.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.962
What happens?
Well, what happens is,

00:38:02.962 --> 00:38:07.788
we are going to fill each one
of these states with these p

00:38:07.788 --> 00:38:11.259
electrons.
We are going to use Hunt's rule

00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:13.544
again.
Remember Hunt's rule?

00:38:13.544 --> 00:38:18.031
It says that when you have
states that are degenerate,

00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:22.603
that have the same energy,
the electrons fill such that

00:38:22.603 --> 00:38:27.513
one electron goes in each state
before you can put a second

00:38:27.513 --> 00:38:32.000
electron in either one of those
states.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.433
So that is what we did.
One electron has to go here.

00:38:35.433 --> 00:38:39.406
One electron has to go here.
You cannot put two electrons in

00:38:39.406 --> 00:38:42.705
one of these states and leave
the other one empty.

00:38:42.705 --> 00:38:45.600
That is not the lowest-energy
configuration.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.169
And you've got to put those
electrons in with parallel

00:38:49.169 --> 00:38:52.872
spins, not opposite spins.
That is not the lowest energy

00:38:52.872 --> 00:38:55.364
configuration.
So that is the electron

00:38:55.364 --> 00:38:59.000
configuration here for 
boron two.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.491
Sigma 1s 2, sigma 1s star 2,
sigma 2s 2, sigma 2s star 2.

00:39:05.496 --> 00:39:08.944
And now pi 2px 1,

00:39:08.944 --> 00:39:11.912
pi 2px 1. Let's

00:39:11.912 --> 00:39:14.318
calculate the bond order,
here.

00:39:14.318 --> 00:39:17.927
The bond order is two,
four, five, six bonding

00:39:17.927 --> 00:39:20.413
electrons.
Two, four antibonding

00:39:20.413 --> 00:39:22.979
electrons.
6 minus 4 over 2 is 1.

00:39:22.979 --> 00:39:26.829
We've got a single bond,
289 kilojoules per mole.

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:31.000
That is a pretty good single
bond.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.506
A pretty strong single bond.
That is boron two.

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:39.621
Let's do carbon.
Well, carbon has got two p

00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:43.638
electrons.
We follow the Aufbau Principle.

00:39:43.638 --> 00:39:48.047
Carbon two.
All four of those electrons

00:39:48.047 --> 00:39:54.121
then are going to go into these
pi two px and pi two py states.

00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:57.452
Here is our electron
configuration.

00:39:57.452 --> 00:40:01.854
We keep going.
Here is the pi 2px 2,

00:40:01.854 --> 00:40:05.122
pi 2py 2. Let's

00:40:05.122 --> 00:40:09.803
calculate the bond order.
Number of bonding electrons,

00:40:09.803 --> 00:40:13.247
two, four, six,
eight bonding electrons.

00:40:13.247 --> 00:40:16.427
Number of antibonding
electrons, two,

00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:19.341
four.
8 minus 4 is 4 divided by 2.

00:40:19.341 --> 00:40:23.227
Bond order is two.
And we have a double bond.

00:40:23.227 --> 00:40:27.555
Let's look and see how strong
that double bond is.

00:40:27.555 --> 00:40:33.454
599 kilojoules per mole.
That's a pretty good double

00:40:33.454 --> 00:40:36.363
bond.
Remember the double bond is

00:40:36.363 --> 00:40:39.636
shorter, the double bond is
stronger?

00:40:39.636 --> 00:40:43.636
Our single bonds were at 300,
400 kilojoules.

00:40:43.636 --> 00:40:48.363
This is almost 600 kilojoules.
That is a strong bond.

00:40:48.363 --> 00:40:53.545
And this molecular orbital
picture tells you that you have

00:40:53.545 --> 00:40:58.454
got this double bond here by
virtue of this bond order.

00:40:58.454 --> 00:41:00.000
Yes?

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.878
You don't, but I am just about
to treat the 2pz.

00:41:18.878 --> 00:41:24.439
I will tell you what our
convention is.

00:41:24.439 --> 00:41:30.000
Good question.
Here comes the 2pz.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.554
The 2pz atomic orbitals,
by convention,

00:41:34.554 --> 00:41:40.786
we are going to put along the
internuclear bond axis.

00:41:40.786 --> 00:41:47.258
In the case of the constructive
interference of the 2pz

00:41:47.258 --> 00:41:54.689
electrons, in that case these 2p
wave functions look like this.

00:41:54.689 --> 00:42:02.000
They were no longer coming in
parallel to each other.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.055
Now they're coming in head on.
That is our convention.

00:42:07.055 --> 00:42:11.062
The 2pz is going to be along
the bond axis.

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:14.687
3pz is going to be along the
bond axis.

00:42:14.687 --> 00:42:19.934
We're going to bring these two
atomic wave functions in,

00:42:19.934 --> 00:42:24.799
we're going to let this part
overlap with that part,

00:42:24.799 --> 00:42:31.000
and the result is a wave
function that looks like this.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.528
Lots of electron density or
wave function right in between

00:42:35.528 --> 00:42:37.912
the two nuclei.
Here is a node.

00:42:37.912 --> 00:42:41.408
Here is a node.
Well, these are nodes because

00:42:41.408 --> 00:42:46.095
there were nodes in the atomic
wave functions to begin with.

00:42:46.095 --> 00:42:50.306
We are going to call this wave
function the sigma 2pz.

00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:53.882
It is sigma because it is
symmetric around the

00:42:53.882 --> 00:42:57.616
internuclear bond axis.
So that is the symmetry.

00:42:57.616 --> 00:43:02.983
Call that sigma.
Now, what happens here?

00:43:02.983 --> 00:43:10.117
It turns out that this sigma
state is a little higher in

00:43:10.117 --> 00:43:16.083
energy than the pi states in the
next molecule.

00:43:16.083 --> 00:43:23.087
There are going to be some
exceptions here in a moment.

00:43:23.087 --> 00:43:31.000
Nitrogen has one electron in
each one of the p states.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.155
Let's use the Aufbau Principle
to fill them up.

00:43:35.155 --> 00:43:37.595
Well, there it is.
Two here.

00:43:37.595 --> 00:43:39.311
Two here.
Two there.

00:43:39.311 --> 00:43:44.280
The electron configuration is
the 1s's and the pi 2px 2,

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.887
pi 2py 2 
and now sigma 2pz 2.

00:43:48.887 --> 00:43:54.127
Let's calculate
the bond order in molecular

00:43:54.127 --> 00:43:57.109
nitrogen.
Well, it's the number of

00:43:57.109 --> 00:44:01.212
bonding electrons.
Two, four, six,

00:44:01.212 --> 00:44:05.417
eight, ten minus the number of
antibonding electrons,

00:44:05.417 --> 00:44:09.218
two, four, ten minus four is
six divided by two,

00:44:09.218 --> 00:44:12.695
bond order three,
and this means we've got a

00:44:12.695 --> 00:44:16.172
triple bond.
Boy, this better be a whole lot

00:44:16.172 --> 00:44:17.708
stronger.
And it is.

00:44:17.708 --> 00:44:21.913
If you look at the bond energy
in molecular nitrogen,

00:44:21.913 --> 00:44:24.986
it is whopping 941 kilojoules
per mole.

00:44:24.986 --> 00:44:30.000
We've got a triple bond.
This is a strong bond.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.876
This is short bond.
Now, the next one is going to

00:44:34.876 --> 00:44:39.955
be molecular oxygen.
We've taken care of all of the

00:44:39.955 --> 00:44:44.323
wave functions,
the molecular wave functions

00:44:44.323 --> 00:44:49.911
that we can form from the 2p
atomic wave functions using

00:44:49.911 --> 00:44:55.295
constructive interference.
It is now time to form some

00:44:55.295 --> 00:45:02.000
molecular wave functions using
destructive interference.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.844
Let's do that.
Let's go back to 2px and 2py.

00:45:05.844 --> 00:45:10.582
They are the ones that come in
parallel to each other.

00:45:10.582 --> 00:45:14.248
As we bring them in,
and we're going to do

00:45:14.248 --> 00:45:19.165
destructive interference,
this part of the wave function

00:45:19.165 --> 00:45:23.635
is going to destructively
interfere with this part.

00:45:23.635 --> 00:45:29.000
This part destructively
interferes with that part.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.285
The result is something that
looks like this.

00:45:32.285 --> 00:45:36.018
We've got another node right
along near the center.

00:45:36.018 --> 00:45:40.124
That is a node because of this
destructive interference.

00:45:40.124 --> 00:45:44.529
We've got another node here
where the plane of the molecular

00:45:44.529 --> 00:45:47.291
axis is.
That is because these 2p wave

00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:50.352
functions had nodes in them to
begin with.

00:45:50.352 --> 00:45:53.638
So that is what our wave
function looks like.

00:45:53.638 --> 00:45:56.773
It has some wave function in
this quadrant,

00:45:56.773 --> 00:45:59.312
in this quadrant,
in this quadrant,

00:45:59.312 --> 00:46:03.992
and this quadrant.
This is another pi wave

00:46:03.992 --> 00:46:09.015
function because it is not
symmetric around this bond axis.

00:46:09.015 --> 00:46:14.125
It is an antibonding orbital.
It is pi star because this was

00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:18.110
formed as a result of
destructive interference.

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:21.748
So we have a pi star 2px and a
pi star 2py.

00:46:21.748 --> 00:46:26.251
Let's put those on an energy

00:46:26.251 --> 00:46:29.543
level diagram.
If they are antibonding,

00:46:29.543 --> 00:46:35.000
the energies are above those of
the atomic states.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.660
Now, let's write the electron
configuration for O two.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.811
Here it comes.
There is the four 2p electrons

00:46:44.811 --> 00:46:49.716
for each oxygen atom.
We are going to put two of them

00:46:49.716 --> 00:46:53.962
in the sigma 2pz,
two in the pi 2px and two in

00:46:53.962 --> 00:47:00.000
the pi 2py, and then we are
going to follow Hunt's Rule.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.924
And we are going to put one
electron in the pi star 2px

00:47:04.924 --> 00:47:09.483
and one in the pi
star 2py.

00:47:09.483 --> 00:47:14.863
We didn't put them both in the
pi star 2px or both in the pi

00:47:14.863 --> 00:47:17.781
star 2py.
And we put them in with

00:47:17.781 --> 00:47:20.881
parallel spins,
not opposite spins.

00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:24.072
Thank you.
You are going to ask me a

00:47:24.072 --> 00:47:26.170
question.
Good question.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:32.623
I wanted you to notice that.
Hey, here is a change.

00:47:32.623 --> 00:47:37.153
When we get to Z equals 8 what
happens?

00:47:37.153 --> 00:47:43.949
What happens is that they want
to make this tough for you.

00:47:43.949 --> 00:47:51.223
What has happened is that this
sigma 2pz has dropped in energy

00:47:51.223 --> 00:47:55.157
compared to the pi 2px and pi
2py.

00:47:55.157 --> 00:48:01.000
At Z equals 8 the energy
ordering flips.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.807
At Z equals 7 for nitrogen pi
2px and pi 2py is lower in

00:48:06.807 --> 00:48:11.136
energy than sigma 2pz.
But for Z equals 8,

00:48:11.136 --> 00:48:15.677
oxygen and above,
the energy ordering flips.

00:48:15.677 --> 00:48:19.478
Sigma is lower in energy than
the pi.

00:48:19.478 --> 00:48:23.068
That is something you have to
know.

00:48:23.068 --> 00:48:29.192
It has to do with the fact that
the sigma 2ps has much more

00:48:29.192 --> 00:48:35.000
electron density in between the
two nuclei.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.800
That electron density is so
high that when the nuclear

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:44.690
charge is that of nitrogen,
plus 7e, the nuclear charge

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:49.671
actually isn't large enough to
support all that electron

00:48:49.671 --> 00:48:53.203
density.
But when you get to Z equals 8,

00:48:53.203 --> 00:48:56.373
it is, and those energy levels
flip.

00:48:56.373 --> 00:49:01.664
It is an exception.
I mean it is a change right

00:49:01.664 --> 00:49:04.822
there.
It is one that you have to

00:49:04.822 --> 00:49:07.289
know.
Here is the electron

00:49:07.289 --> 00:49:10.842
configuration for molecular
nitrogen.

00:49:10.842 --> 00:49:15.282
If we go and we calculate here
the bond order,

00:49:15.282 --> 00:49:19.427
what we will find is the bond
order is two.

00:49:19.427 --> 00:49:25.348
That means we've got a double
bond, and that bond strength is

00:49:25.348 --> 00:49:31.046
494 kilojoules per mole.
Now we have got to make one

00:49:31.046 --> 00:49:34.608
more molecular orbital,
and that other molecular

00:49:34.608 --> 00:49:38.701
orbital is between the 2pz
states and it is going to be

00:49:38.701 --> 00:49:42.567
destructive interference.
When this part of the wave

00:49:42.567 --> 00:49:46.584
function overlaps with this part
of the wave function,

00:49:46.584 --> 00:49:49.616
we're going to cancel some wave
function.

00:49:49.616 --> 00:49:54.088
And the result is that we're
going to have a node right here

00:49:54.088 --> 00:49:57.044
in the center.
These are the two nuclei.

00:49:57.044 --> 00:50:02.939
Here is our nodal plane.
We've got a nodal plane right

00:50:02.939 --> 00:50:08.614
here anyway, and one here from
the atomic wave functions.

00:50:08.614 --> 00:50:13.682
This wave function is an
antibonding wave function.

00:50:13.682 --> 00:50:18.648
It's sigma star 2pz.
And if you look at the energy

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:22.905
level diagram,
its energy, that antibonding

00:50:22.905 --> 00:50:30.000
state is higher in energy than
sigma pi 2px and sigma pi 2py.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.951
And so if we go to write the
electron configuration for neon

00:50:35.951 --> 00:50:39.986
two, well,
all of the bonding and

00:50:39.986 --> 00:50:45.938
antibonding states are filled.
The bond order in neon two is

00:50:45.938 --> 00:50:48.157
zero.
There is no bond,

00:50:48.157 --> 00:50:50.757
for all practical purposes,
in neon two.
