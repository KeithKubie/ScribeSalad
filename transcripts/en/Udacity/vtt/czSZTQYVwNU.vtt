00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.850
Building an app that uses Google
Services generally follows this pattern.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.070
First, you'll create a Google API
client, and on that client

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.130
you'll specify the services that
you want to use the desired API.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.590
In this case, it's location services.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.040
Now, the activity that hosts this
client will need to be extended for

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.680
the appropriate callbacks and listeners.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.800
The first of these is
GoogleApiClientConnectionCallbacks.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.010
These allow you to code against
events in the Api Client itself,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.350
such as connecting, or
disconnecting from the services.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.575
The next is the

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:38.650
GoogleApiClient.OnConnectionFailedListe-
ner.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.860
This can alert you when
the connection drops,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.740
so that you can handle failures to
connect to Google Apis Gracefully.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.680
Specifically for location services,
you'll also need the location listener.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.360
And as its name suggests,
it listens to location updates so

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.080
that you can respond to
them in your application.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.790
You then connect your clients and
wait for the on connected call back.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.620
Now for this app, you're going to
have code that makes a request for

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.290
your current location.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.730
You put that in
the OnConnected Callback, and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.620
this sets up another Callback
called OnLocationChanged.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.210
And when the OnLocationChange Callback
fires, it will contain your location

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.350
information so that you can capture
details such as the latitude, and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.730
update your UI accordingly.
