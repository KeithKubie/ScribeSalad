00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:01.434
- [Voiceover] We should talk a little more

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:02.572
about Newtons's Third Law,

00:00:02.572 --> 00:00:04.482
because there are some deep misconceptions

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:06.493
that many people have about this law.

00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:08.148
It seems simple, but it's not nearly

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:09.732
as simple as you might think.

00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:11.358
So people often phrase it as,

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:14.193
for every action there's an
equal and opposite reaction.

00:00:14.193 --> 00:00:16.510
But that's just way
too vague to be useful.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.115
So a version that's a little better,

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:21.821
says that for every
force, there's an equal

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.612
and opposite force.

00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:24.849
So this is a little better.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.933
The equal sign means that these forces

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.567
are equal in magnitude.

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:31.391
And this negative sign
means they're just different

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:33.272
by the direction of the vector.

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:35.771
So these are vectors, so
this says that this pink

00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:38.087
vector F, has the opposite direction,

00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:41.947
but equal in magnitude
to this green vector F.

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.594
But to show you why this is
still a little bit too vague,

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:46.254
consider this, if this
is all you knew about

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.347
Newtons's Third Law, that for every force,

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.167
there's an equal and opposite force,

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:52.117
you might wonder, if you were clever,

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.230
you might be like, wait a minute,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.063
if for every force F,
right, there's got to be

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.152
a force that's equal and opposite.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.418
Well why doesn't that just mean

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.149
that every force in the universe cancels?

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.782
Shouldn't every force just
cancel then, at that point?

00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:12.240
Doesn't that just mean that there's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.024
no acceleration that's even possible?

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:17.918
Because if I go and exert
a force F on something,

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:19.836
if there's gonna be a force negative F,

00:01:19.836 --> 00:01:22.803
doesn't that mean that no
matter what force I put forward,

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:24.501
it's just gonna get cancelled?

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.765
And the answer no, and the reason it's no

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:28.512
is because these two forces

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.474
are exerted on different objects.

00:01:30.474 --> 00:01:31.844
So you have to be careful.

00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:33.225
So the reason I say that this statement

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:35.846
of Newtons's Third Law is
still a little bit too vague,

00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:38.244
is because this is really
on different objects.

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:41.190
So if this is the force on object A,

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.233
exerted by object B,
then this force over here

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:49.400
has to be the force on object
B, exerted by object A.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.554
In other words, these
forces down here are exerted

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:56.712
on different objects.

00:01:56.712 --> 00:01:58.988
I'm gonna move this over to this side.

00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:00.930
I'm gonna move this over to here.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.230
Let's draw two different objects

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.912
to show explicitly what I mean.

00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:07.388
So if there was some object A,

00:02:07.388 --> 00:02:09.919
so I put some object A in here.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.451
Just wanna make sure there's an object A.

00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.413
Let's say this is object A, and it had

00:02:13.413 --> 00:02:16.937
this green force exerted on it, F.

00:02:16.937 --> 00:02:19.651
So this object right here is A.

00:02:19.651 --> 00:02:23.166
Well, there's gonna be
another object, object B.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:26.689
We'll just make it another circle.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.424
So we'll make it look like this.

00:02:29.424 --> 00:02:31.007
So here's object B.

00:02:31.992 --> 00:02:34.015
And it's gonna have this pink force,

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:35.824
F, negative F exerted on it.

00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:37.681
So I'm gonna call this object B.

00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:41.867
Now we're okay, now we know
these forces can't cancel,

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:43.625
and the reason these forces can't cancel,

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.666
is cause they're on two different objects.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:46.925
But when you just say
that Newtons's Third Law,

00:02:46.925 --> 00:02:48.710
is that every force has an
equal and opposite force,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.311
it's not clear that it has
to be on different objects.

00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:53.180
But it does have to be
on different objects.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.630
So these Newtons force law pairs,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.711
often times is called force pairs,

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:00.210
or Newton's third law partner forces,

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.587
are always on different objects.

00:03:02.587 --> 00:03:05.371
So the convention I'm using
is that the first letter

00:03:05.371 --> 00:03:09.548
represents the object
that the force is on.

00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:11.862
So this A represents
that this green force F

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:16.029
this green force F, is on
A and it's exerted by B.

00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:20.946
And this shows that it's exerted on B,

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:23.172
because the first
letter's on the first one,

00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:26.589
and it's exerted by the second object, A.

00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:30.486
So this pink force is exerted on B.

00:03:30.486 --> 00:03:32.425
This green force is exerted on A.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:34.741
They're equal and opposite,
they do not cancel,

00:03:34.741 --> 00:03:38.492
they cannot cancel because
they're not on the same object.

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:40.036
So that's why these don't cancel.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.702
And they are the same magnitude,

00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:43.429
even if the two objects
are not the same size.

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:45.144
This is another misconception,

00:03:45.144 --> 00:03:48.090
if object A is a planet, a big planet.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.885
Or maybe a star, this is
yellow, it looks like a star.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:53.018
Let's say this is some big star,

00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:55.486
and this is some smaller
planet orbiting that star.

00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:59.424
This is not to scale, unless
this planet was enormous.

00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:02.167
So this is some planet,
but this planet could be

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:05.540
hundreds, thousands of
times, millions of times

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.892
less massive than this
star but it would still

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:10.010
exert the same force.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.951
So if this star is pulling on the planet

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.040
with this pink force negative F,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.324
then this planet has to
be pulling on the star

00:04:17.324 --> 00:04:19.144
with this green force
F and they have to have

00:04:19.144 --> 00:04:23.318
the same magnitude, even if
they are different sizes.

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:24.711
So people quote Newtons's Third Law,

00:04:24.711 --> 00:04:27.047
but sometimes they
don't really believe it.

00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:28.571
If I told you this planet
was a million times

00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:31.709
less massive than this star,
people would want to say

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:36.048
that well, then the star obviously
pulls more on the planet,

00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:37.743
than the planet pulls on the star.

00:04:37.743 --> 00:04:40.172
But that's not true according
to Newtons's Third Law.

00:04:40.172 --> 00:04:43.330
And Newtons's Third Law says
that they have to be the same,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.570
even if they're different sizes.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.561
So if this was the earth
and this was the moon,

00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:48.267
the earth pulls on the moon, just as much

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.270
as the moon pulls on the earth.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.945
And you might still object, you might say,

00:04:51.945 --> 00:04:54.577
wait that makes no sense, I
know the star just basically

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:58.600
sits there and the planet gets
whipped around in a circle.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.409
How come this planet's
getting whipped around

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:02.054
and the star's just staying put?

00:05:02.054 --> 00:05:04.867
That's because, just because
the forces are equal,

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:06.492
that doesn't mean that
the result is equal.

00:05:06.492 --> 00:05:08.138
In other words, the forces could be equal,

00:05:08.138 --> 00:05:11.226
but the accelerations
don't have to be equal.

00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:15.940
Acceleration is gonna be the
net force divided by the mass.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.024
So even if the force is the same,

00:05:18.024 --> 00:05:19.426
you divide by that mass, you'll get

00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:22.697
a different acceleration
and that's why the result of

00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.688
the force does not have to be the same,

00:05:24.688 --> 00:05:27.399
even though the forces
do have to be the same,

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.410
because of Newtons's Third Law.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.320
Another misconception
people sometimes make,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.860
is they think there might
be a delay in the creation

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.391
of this Newtons's Third Law partner force.

00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:39.020
And people think, maybe if
I exert this first force

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.048
fast enough, I can catch
the universe sleeping,

00:05:42.048 --> 00:05:43.888
and there might be some sort of delay

00:05:43.888 --> 00:05:45.603
in the creation of this other force.

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:48.581
But that's not true, Newtons's
Third Law is universal.

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:49.719
No matter what the situation,

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.532
no matter what the acceleration
or non acceleration,

00:05:52.532 --> 00:05:54.900
or motion or no motion, whether one object

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.562
is bigger or smaller, if
their Newtons's Third Law

00:05:57.562 --> 00:06:00.447
partner forces, they are
equal they are opposite

00:06:00.447 --> 00:06:02.060
and they are always equal and opposite,

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.372
at every given moment in time.

00:06:03.372 --> 00:06:06.368
So even if I came in all guns a blazing,

00:06:06.368 --> 00:06:09.143
Chuck Norris style, trying
to dropkick some wall.

00:06:09.143 --> 00:06:12.869
That does not look like the
correct form for a drop kick.

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:15.319
But even if I came in,
flying at this wall,

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:18.854
as soon as I start to make
contact with the wall,

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:20.143
I'm gonna exert a force on the wall,

00:06:20.143 --> 00:06:22.215
and the wall has to exert a force back.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.441
So I'd exert a force on
the wall to the right.

00:06:26.441 --> 00:06:30.383
And this would be the force
on the wall, by my foot.

00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:32.069
There'd have to be an
equal and opposite force

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.275
instantly transmitted
backwards, on my foot.

00:06:36.275 --> 00:06:39.221
So this would be the force
on my foot, by the wall.

00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:42.240
This happens instantaneously,
there is no delay.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.743
You can't kick this wall fast enough,

00:06:43.743 --> 00:06:46.962
for this other force to not
be generated instantaneously.

00:06:46.962 --> 00:06:49.664
As soon as your foot starts
to exert any force on the wall

00:06:49.664 --> 00:06:51.798
what so ever, the wall
is gonna start exerting

00:06:51.798 --> 00:06:54.317
that same force back on your foot.

00:06:54.317 --> 00:06:56.085
So Newtons's Third Law is universal,

00:06:56.085 --> 00:06:58.392
but people still have trouble identifying

00:06:58.392 --> 00:07:00.566
these third law partner forces.

00:07:00.566 --> 00:07:01.774
So one of the best ways to do it,

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:03.259
is by listing both objects,

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:05.413
as soon as you list both objects,

00:07:05.413 --> 00:07:06.856
well to figure out where
the partner force is,

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:09.079
you can just reverse these labels.

00:07:09.079 --> 00:07:11.711
So I know over here, if one of my forces

00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:14.211
is the force on the wall by my foot,

00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:16.292
to find the partner force to this force,

00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:18.852
I can just reverse the
labels and say it's gotta be

00:07:18.852 --> 00:07:22.915
the force on my foot, by the
wall, which I drew over here.

00:07:22.915 --> 00:07:24.329
So this is a great way to identify

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:25.913
the third law partner forces,

00:07:25.913 --> 00:07:27.446
cause it's not always obvious

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.417
what force is the partner force.

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:30.920
So to show you how this can be tricky,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.557
consider this example.

00:07:32.557 --> 00:07:34.508
Say we got the ground and a table.

00:07:34.508 --> 00:07:38.031
So this example drives
people crazy for some reason.

00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:40.217
If I've got a box sitting on a table,

00:07:40.217 --> 00:07:42.257
we'll call it box A.

00:07:42.257 --> 00:07:44.260
Box A is gonna have forces exerted on it.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.673
One of those forces is gonna
be the gravitational force.

00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:49.360
So the force of gravity is
gonna pull straight down

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.595
on box A, and if I were to ask you,

00:07:51.595 --> 00:07:54.764
what force is the third law
partner force to this force

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:58.076
of gravity, I'm willing to
bet a lot of people might say,

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.941
well there's an upwards force on box A,

00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:02.578
exerted by the table.

00:08:02.578 --> 00:08:04.000
And that's true.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.081
And if this box A is just sitting here,

00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:08.478
not accelerating, these
two forces are going

00:08:08.478 --> 00:08:09.953
to be equal and opposite.

00:08:09.953 --> 00:08:12.806
So it's even more tempting
to say that these two forces

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:15.183
are equal and opposite
because of the third law,

00:08:15.183 --> 00:08:16.484
but that's not true.

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:18.068
These two forces are equal and opposite

00:08:18.068 --> 00:08:19.592
because of the second law.

00:08:19.592 --> 00:08:21.929
The second law says if
there's no acceleration,

00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:23.688
then the net force has to be zero,

00:08:23.688 --> 00:08:25.301
the forces have to cancel.

00:08:25.301 --> 00:08:26.308
And that's what's happening here.

00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:27.516
These forces are equal and opposite,

00:08:27.516 --> 00:08:29.762
they're canceling on box A.

00:08:29.762 --> 00:08:31.945
Which is a way to know
that they are not third law

00:08:31.945 --> 00:08:34.293
partner forces, cause
third law partner forces

00:08:34.293 --> 00:08:36.894
are always exerted on different objects.

00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:40.165
They can never cancel if they're
third law partner forces.

00:08:40.165 --> 00:08:41.697
So what's going on over here?

00:08:41.697 --> 00:08:43.781
We've got two forces that are canceling,

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.874
that are equal and opposite,
but they're not third law

00:08:45.874 --> 00:08:49.044
partner forces, they're partner
forces are somewhere else.

00:08:49.044 --> 00:08:50.832
I haven't drawn their partner forces yet.

00:08:50.832 --> 00:08:53.331
So let's try to figure out what
they're partner forces are.

00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:55.220
So let's get rid of this,
let's come back to here,

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.126
let's slow it down to figure
out what the partner force is,

00:08:58.126 --> 00:09:00.207
name the two objects interacting.

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:02.868
So this force of gravity,
I shouldn't be vague,

00:09:02.868 --> 00:09:05.571
I should call it the force on object A,

00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:09.625
our box A exerted by, well
you can't just say gravity.

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:11.300
Gravity is not an object.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.804
So the object that is exerting

00:09:12.804 --> 00:09:15.668
this gravitational force
on A, is the earth.

00:09:15.668 --> 00:09:17.578
So this force really,
this gravitational force,

00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:19.865
if I wanna be careful,
is the force on object A

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:21.174
exerted by the earth.

00:09:21.174 --> 00:09:23.827
Now it's easy to figure out
where the partner force is.

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:25.035
The partner force can be found just

00:09:25.035 --> 00:09:26.712
by reversing these labels.

00:09:26.712 --> 00:09:28.683
So instead of the force on A by the earth,

00:09:28.683 --> 00:09:30.390
there's gotta be an
equal and opposite force,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.269
which is the force on the earth, by box A.

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:35.768
So opposite means it has to point up.

00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:37.698
So it has to be an upward force.

00:09:37.698 --> 00:09:40.328
And that upward force has
to be exerted on the earth,

00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:42.734
by box A, and this is kind of weird,

00:09:42.734 --> 00:09:44.984
because you may not have realized it,

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:48.751
but if the earth is pulling
down on a box, or you,

00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:50.905
that means you are
pulling up on the earth.

00:09:50.905 --> 00:09:52.367
And this might seem ridiculous,

00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:55.639
I mean if you jump up, you
jump up, you fall back down,

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:57.577
you move around, but the
earth just sits there.

00:09:57.577 --> 00:09:59.540
If your forces are equal,
how come the earth doesn't

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.765
move around like you do.

00:10:01.765 --> 00:10:03.452
And again, it's because just because

00:10:03.452 --> 00:10:05.594
the forces are the same, the acceleration

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:06.865
doesn't have to be the same.

00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:08.897
The mass of the earth is so big,

00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:11.892
compared to your mass, there's
basically no acceleration.

00:10:11.892 --> 00:10:13.985
Even though the forces on you

00:10:13.985 --> 00:10:16.655
and the forces on the earth are the same.

00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:19.532
So these two are third law partner forces.

00:10:19.532 --> 00:10:22.222
These two are joined together forever.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:25.758
They have to be equal,
no matter what happens,

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:27.891
these two forces will always be equal.

00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:29.812
I don't care if this box is accelerating

00:10:29.812 --> 00:10:33.255
or not accelerating, or that
there's motion or no motion.

00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:35.376
Whether it's hitting a
wall, sitting on a table,

00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:38.436
falling through space,
these two forces must

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:41.512
always be equal and opposite,
because of the third law.

00:10:41.512 --> 00:10:42.833
So how about this other force,

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:45.727
this force that the table was exerting.

00:10:45.727 --> 00:10:48.652
So this is, the force on A by the table.

00:10:48.652 --> 00:10:50.147
So if I wanna label it correctly,

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:54.150
I'd call it the force on
box A, exerted by the table.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.425
Now finding the third law
partner force is easy,

00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:57.978
I can just reverse these labels,

00:10:57.978 --> 00:10:59.664
and I'd get that there must be,

00:10:59.664 --> 00:11:01.168
instead of an upwards force, a downwards

00:11:01.168 --> 00:11:03.008
force on the table, by A.

00:11:03.008 --> 00:11:05.527
So I'm gonna have another
force here on the table.

00:11:05.527 --> 00:11:07.742
It's gonna be a downward force.

00:11:07.742 --> 00:11:09.693
Downward force on the table by A,

00:11:09.693 --> 00:11:12.871
that's the third law
partner force to this upward

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:14.923
force that the table is exerting.

00:11:14.923 --> 00:11:18.734
These two forces are also
third law partner forces.

00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:20.632
these forces are going to be equal

00:11:20.632 --> 00:11:22.736
and opposite no matter what happens.

00:11:22.736 --> 00:11:25.000
This force on box A by the table.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.235
And this force on the table by box A

00:11:27.235 --> 00:11:30.425
must be equal no matter what happens,

00:11:30.425 --> 00:11:32.680
but the force on box A by the table,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.439
does not have to be equal and opposite

00:11:34.439 --> 00:11:36.541
to the force on A by the earth.

00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:38.096
It happens to be equal and opposite,

00:11:38.096 --> 00:11:40.128
in a case where there's no acceleration.

00:11:40.128 --> 00:11:43.489
If we stuck this whole
situation into an elevator,

00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:47.939
or a rocket that had some
huge acceleration upwards,

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:50.052
even if there's acceleration upwards,

00:11:50.052 --> 00:11:52.470
these partner forces have to be equal.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.912
So the force on A by the table,

00:11:53.912 --> 00:11:56.472
and the force on the table
by A will have to be equal.

00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:58.910
Similarly the force on the earth by A,

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.861
and the force on A by the
earth have to be equal.

00:12:00.861 --> 00:12:03.746
But no longer will these
two forces have to be equal,

00:12:03.746 --> 00:12:05.473
cause they're not partner forces.

00:12:05.473 --> 00:12:08.155
They might be equal and
opposite in some circumstances,

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:10.105
but they don't always have
to be equal and opposite.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.730
If we're accelerating upwards,

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.417
this upward force on the box,

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:15.916
must be bigger than the
downwards force on the box.

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:17.533
So these won't be equal.

00:12:17.533 --> 00:12:19.950
Recapping quickly, Newtons's
Third Law is a statement

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.124
about the forces on two different objects.

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:23.819
And because it's about
two different objects,

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:25.993
those forces can never cancel.

00:12:25.993 --> 00:12:28.220
To find the Newtons's
Third Law partner force,

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.362
just reverse the label
after you've identified

00:12:30.362 --> 00:12:32.405
the two objects that are interacting.

00:12:32.405 --> 00:12:36.001
The third law partner forces
have to be equal in magnitude,

00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:38.448
even if one object is
larger than the other,

00:12:38.448 --> 00:12:41.150
or has more charge or
any property that might

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.677
seem like it would convey more
force, than another object.

00:12:44.677 --> 00:12:46.363
If those are the two objects interacting,

00:12:46.363 --> 00:12:47.977
their forces must be of equal magnitude

00:12:47.977 --> 00:12:51.738
and opposite directions,
the forces instantaneously

00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:53.921
generated this partner forces.

00:12:53.921 --> 00:12:58.127
And be careful, some forces
might seem like partner forces,

00:12:58.127 --> 00:12:59.630
and might be equal and opposite,

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.425
but they're not necessarily
third law partner forces.

00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:05.411
They made just be equal and
opposite for other reasons.
