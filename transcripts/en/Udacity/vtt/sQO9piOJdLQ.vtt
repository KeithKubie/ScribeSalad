00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.583
Here are the correct answers. Great job matching each one with its picture if

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:07.602
you got them all right. We know that c is a circle since we'll have a perfect

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:12.362
slice of our cone. And part of the reason that we create a circle is since this

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:16.882
plane is parallel to the base of the cone. The radius from the center to any

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:21.300
point on the blue circle will all be the same. For the ellipse, it's going to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.820
be b. Here we'll have a longer length this way than we will vertically this

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.640
way. d will be our hyperbola since we see the two pieces that point away from

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.940
one another and this leaves a to be our parabola. We just have one curved

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.670
section that's cutting through the cone.
