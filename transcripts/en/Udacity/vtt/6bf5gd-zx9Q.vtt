00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.170
You might know that there's an annual
contest to implement the fastest sort.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.520
Visit sortbenchmark.org for details.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.820
If you didn't before, you now have
the chops to enter and kick butt.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.750
Now, that sorting competition
focuses on disk-to-disk sorting.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.630
But if you go read about the basic
schemes that different teams have used

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.140
over time, they're basically variants of
the sampling or the bucketing schemes.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.290
And now that you've finished this
lesson, you know what that means.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.190
Well, more or less, hopefully more.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.770
As of September 2014 the fastest system

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.420
managed to sort seven
terabytes in a minute.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.380
Now compare that to the first
year of the competition,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.198
1995, when a team sorted just
over 1 GB of data in a minute.

00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:49.788
That's a 7,000 fold improvement,

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:53.333
over 20 years, 7,000!

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:57.367
Think about that, that is [BLEEP] crazy!

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.070
Crazy!

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.466
That means that the amount of data you
can sort in a minute has doubled roughly

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:08.292
every 1.6 years which, curiously enough,
is right in line with Moore's law.
