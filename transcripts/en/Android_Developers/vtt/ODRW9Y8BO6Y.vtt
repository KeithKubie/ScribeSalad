[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:08.060
ED COOKE: I'm Ed Cooke.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.010
I'm the CEO and
co-founder of Memrise.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.130
Memrise is a language
learning app.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.260
And it combines a bunch
of interesting techniques

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.135
for learning into a very
gamified experience.

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:21.730
So it basically makes
learning any language

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:22.930
joyful and entertaining.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.190
KAI HALEY: Today we are here
at Google for a design sprint

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.000
with Memrise.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.190
We're going to
focus on exploring

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.510
a hands-free, eyes-free heads-up
experience for their language

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.650
learning app.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.040
A Google design sprint
is a tool for answering

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.370
a critical business
question through design,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.530
prototyping, and
testing with users.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.720
The benefit here is timesaving.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.250
You don't have to
go down a path,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.700
spend six weeks, two months of
development time on something

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.110
that isn't going to be valuable.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.237
It also increases the
viability of the concepts

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:58.570
because you're bringing
together cross-functional teams.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.153
ED COOKE: I think a
dream result would

00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:02.980
be if we invented a new
learning mode which could really

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.379
take our learners
away from the screen

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.380
and give us all some new
ideas for how to get people

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.330
listening to foreign
language and spending

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.822
more time in the app.

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:15.580
KAI HALEY: On the
first day, we start

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.320
by building shared knowledge.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.310
Then we brainstorm.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.970
We do how might we post it,
sharing an affinity mapping,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.950
and a solution
sketch that really

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.620
articulates some great ideas
for the new experience.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.340
KRISTINA NARUSK: We are using
our imagination for something

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.050
that doesn't exist
yet and trying

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.780
to find a solution to that,
and obviously a product

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.380
feature that users will love.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.355
How can we imagine the
user using Memrise?

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.360
SPEAKER 4: Most of
them use them in bed.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.650
So it could be like a lullaby.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.650
ED COOKE: And over
the course of the day,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.040
we collected hundreds of
these "how might wes,"

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.985
which are which kind
of part questions,

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:48.850
part ideas for features.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.530
We were able to
categorize them and look

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.930
at the different areas of
the experience which we're

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.460
going to want to design around.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.800
KAI HALEY: We try to generate
eight ideas in eight minutes.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.260
And this time
pressure really helps

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.750
people to get beyond
their first idea

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.010
and push themselves towards
more innovative and interesting

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.090
concepts.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.070
ED COOKE: It was quite
astonishing how many

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.990
ideas people produced.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.200
In fact one member of the team,
Matilda, had a list of ideas

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.080
so long that it would take a
group of 500 skilled engineers

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.890
a decade to implement them all.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.800
KAI HALEY: Day two starts
with a presentation and review

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.420
of the solution sketch.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.180
We follow that with a discussion
about assumptions and sprint

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.800
questions, what we want to
have answered in the validation

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.580
phase.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.746
ED COOKE: So, for instance,
we had lots of questions

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.630
around the interaction
design, around how

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.100
we make the
experience as charming

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.302
and fun as the in-app
experiences is in Memrise.

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.260
SPEAKER 5: So that maybe
if you're in the tube,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.550
it doesn't sound so
weird, because it

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.750
feels like you're
talking to someone,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.028
like, hold on for a sec.

00:02:48.028 --> 00:02:50.277
SPEAKER 6: There might be a
cooking mode, for example.

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:52.709
And you say, can it
help me cook Italian?

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.250
KAI HALEY: And then
once we've listed

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.280
out what the prioritized
questions are that we have,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.960
we will do a voting session.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.660
We ask them to select the
features or the pieces

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.600
of the concepts that they're
really interested in trying

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.880
out and testing.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.040
That's usually followed
by a discussion

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.700
of what will be included in
the prototype and a storyboard

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.280
for the user testing.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.304
For this team, we are
doing voice control,

00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:19.345
which is really exciting.

00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:24.456
AUTOMATED VOICE: Now plug
in your headphones and click

00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:26.370
on the [INAUDIBLE]
icon [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.270
to start the conversation.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.870
KAI HALEY: On day three, the
prototyping gets wrapped up.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.260
The user interview
scripts get written.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.034
And we prepare to
put these prototypes

00:03:38.034 --> 00:03:38.950
in front of the users.

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:44.420
AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome to your
first Italian speaking practice

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.920
session.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.660
KAI HALEY: And this is
really the part of the sprint

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.640
where we see the
most value for teams,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520
because they are really able
to get answers and validation

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.800
to their sprint questions
that they're working with.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.980
We record and capture
all of the content

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.060
from the user interviews.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.100
And they're often
quite useful later on

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.730
for helping to articulate
why design decisions are made

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.954
or why development
decisions are made.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.870
KRISTINA NARUSK: There's
so much goodness that

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.510
came out of this design sprint.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.620
You also learn that
one of the ideas

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.260
is very much something that
we could turn into a product

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.717
feature almost immediately.

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.800
I think it was an amazing
experience for everyone.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.383
ED COOKE: And more
excitingly, I think

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:21.820
we've learned enough
about the hands-free mode

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.050
to see what it can't
do and what it can do.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.930
Ijust really can't wait to see
the impact of this adventure

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.200
not only on our ideas but also
on our communication and just

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.069
the general kind of
energy of the team.

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.860
It's rather like Meister
Eckhart's approach

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.980
to spirituality.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.040
Where most kind of spiritual
gurus talk about a long,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.041
winding painful path to
the top of the mountain,

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:43.706
he had this approach
which was basically

00:04:43.706 --> 00:04:46.030
to stick your head down and
to run as fast as you could

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.820
and try and reach spiritual
enlightenment the fast way.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.040
And I think it's similar
with a Google design sprint,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.440
is you just kind of go for it.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.890
