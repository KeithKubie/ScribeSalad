BEN SCHROM: Hello, everyone.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.950
Thanks for spending some
time with us this afternoon.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.910
I'm Ben Schrom.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.470
I'm a product manager on
the Google Expeditions team.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.290
And I'm really excited to be
joined here by Jen and Rob,

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.790
two of my colleagues.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.330
We're really just
a part, though,

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.020
of a small community of really,
really passionate people

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.300
here at Google who think
technology can really

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.630
change education.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.000
And if it's not obvious already
by virtue of the session,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.860
we're especially
excited about the role

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.170
VR can play in education.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.420
So we've just returned,
a little exhausted,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.310
but super-encouraged,
from a year-long trip

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.092
that we've taken.

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:35.800
And that trip has been
to try to bring VR

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.980
to as many teachers and students
around the world as we could.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.940
And as Clay announced
yesterday, we've

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.740
managed to bring expeditions
to over a million students

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.040
since last year.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.470
It's a number we're
really, really proud of.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.900
And it's been an
amazing journey.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.870
But so much of the credit
for what follows actually

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.100
goes to the amazing group
of teachers and students

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.680
who joined us along the way.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.970
We've encountered
so much enthusiasm.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.070
We've received so much
amazing feedback from them.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.110
And we're really, really
grateful to everyone

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.370
who has participated and who
continues to participate.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.620
So I'm going to start with
some thoughts about why

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.902
VR and education are
a really good match.

00:01:13.902 --> 00:01:15.610
And then Jen's going
to talk a little bit

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.840
about Google Expeditions
and our Pioneer Program.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.965
And then Rob's going to
talk about the future of VR

00:01:19.965 --> 00:01:23.020
in education as we see it.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.630
So let's start with the why.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.290
Like, why did we originally
create Google Expeditions?

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.190
And why do we think VR
platforms like Daydream

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.489
will offer so much potential
for educators and learners?

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.030
Why should developers
like yourselves

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.046
be interested in developing
educational apps for VR?

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:41.090
So let's start with a
quick show of hands.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.750
How many of you remember
studying really, really hard

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.610
for a test in school?

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.390
How many?

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.950
Most of you.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.860
How many of you
forgot everything

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.010
that you studied the
second after the test?

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.934
Exactly the same number, right?

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.100
How many of you think you
could do well in that test

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.460
again right now?

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.045
Not a lot.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:01.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.400
So how many of you
remember a trip

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.860
that you've taken to an
interesting place, a country,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.670
a museum, something like that?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.539
About the same number.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.170
How many of you can recall
details about that trip?

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.790
A lot of you, right?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.320
So therein lies
one of the reasons

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.550
why we find the emergence of
widely accessible VR technology

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.340
so exciting for education.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.700
Google I/O is no place to
temper one's enthusiasm.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.730
So I'll make a bold
claim that many of us who

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.770
think about educational
technology, VR

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.290
is the thing we've
been waiting for,

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.290
because it allows us to address
one of the most important,

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.650
but neglected areas of learning.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.640
And I want to spend a few
minutes digging into why.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.631
So to start with, let's take a
really, really big step back.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.130
Historically, most
of the technology

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.760
that we've developed
to aid learning

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.370
has been aimed to enable
access to information--

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.280
facts, details, other
observations about the world.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.960
And for most of human
history, a smart person

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.950
has basically been someone
who knew a lot of facts.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.840
And fact retention is what a
lot of the technology that we've

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.930
built directly supports.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.370
I'm talking about things
like the book, right?

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.630
Or libraries of books, a
catalog that lets you easily

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.960
access tons and tons
of information quickly.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.690
Search engines, like one
you might recognize here,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.730
have only served to make
this kind of fact retrieval

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.880
breathtakingly fast,
comprehensive, and easy.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.680
Even the rapid growth of
technology like laptops,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.640
and tablets, and
smartphones in schools

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.690
has only really served to help
you assimilate information

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.477
and then turn
around and evaluate

00:03:43.477 --> 00:03:45.560
how well you did in absorbing
it and recalling it.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.919
But while information is
super, super important,

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.460
it's not even close
to the full story

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.770
when it comes to learning.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.650
Let me give you one
example of this.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.770
Here is a math problem.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.370
"There are 26 goats
and 10 sheep on a boat.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.260
How old is the
captain of the boat?"

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.970
So a study done in
the US to a bunch

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.570
of fifth graders in the
'90s asked this question.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.040
And three-fourths
of those students

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.860
produced a numerical
answer to this question.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.459
The most common answer was 36.

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.779
There were some 16s.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.822
And amazingly,
there was one 260.

00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:23.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.729
A quote from one of the students
who answered 36 said, "Well,

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.020
for this type of problem,
you need to add, or subtract,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.080
or multiply.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.245
And for this one, it
seemed it was best to add."

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:33.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.780
Right?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.340
And the important point, these
kids are not stupid at all.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.324
These are smart kids.

00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:41.490
But they're kids for whom
the traditional approaches

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.880
to teaching mathematics
are failing.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.100
Let me give you one little
bit more complicated example.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.710
A study done in the '90s found
that when students were taught

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.230
geography in a traditional way
by memorizing all the states

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.760
and where they go and the
state capitals with a worksheet

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.950
like this, they were largely
incapable of naming or placing

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.070
those same states in
the correct places

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.480
when the borders were
removed like that.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.420
They were basically clueless
the second the map changed.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.619
But the study found that
another group of students

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:13.410
who had spent some time
discussing concepts

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.400
like why rivers and
mountain ranges are natural

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.160
borders-- they were much more
capable of placing states

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.210
in the right spots.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.060
And the reason that's important
is that simple techniques

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.520
that literally, in this case,
ground information about which

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.769
states are where serve
students to understand

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:33.310
the important concepts
of why-- like,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.590
why are the borders
where they are.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.200
And learning this
way is powerful,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.230
because it allows for much more
improved knowledge transfer.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.590
It allows you to apply the
same thing you learned there

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:43.302
somewhere else.

00:05:43.302 --> 00:05:45.260
So you could logically
apply these same lessons

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.120
to a map of Europe or whatever.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.530
Let me give you another
very different example.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.720
We've long known that
we have really, really

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.350
powerful and innate
spatial memories,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.780
even if we didn't
understand the mechanisms.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.490
This is the reason why most of
you guys can remember the trips

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.930
and none of us can
remember the test.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.064
And here's actually a
medieval representation

00:06:06.064 --> 00:06:07.730
of the brain that
tried to understand it

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.920
as actually a series
of spaces where

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.670
you crammed memories and facts,
like an attic or something.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.020
They actually
weren't that far off.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.420
It's the same insight
that has given rise

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.150
to that mnemonic device
called a memory palace,

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.420
or a mind palace.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.420
For those of you who
don't know what that is,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.450
it basically involves
using our memory

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.880
of a place, or better
spatial memory, the rooms

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.110
in a familiar building like
your house or your street,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.180
as a structure in which to place
the arbitrary facts that you

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.880
remember, say, in this
picture, like a large number

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.896
of amphibious species.

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:41.520
So each thing that
you want to remember

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.144
gets associated with
the physical space

00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:44.427
that you already know.

00:06:44.427 --> 00:06:46.010
And then when you
want to recall them,

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.889
you visualize that
space you know.

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.180
And you use them as a trigger
for that set of arbitrary

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.030
facts.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.930
And we've known that this
works for a long time.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.670
Cicero used it to remember
long, long speeches.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.570
But it's a capability
that traditional academics

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.510
rarely, rarely tap.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.490
It's one that's easy to
see VR making use of them.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.360
It's only recently
that we've really

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.250
begun to understand why
this works that way,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.930
at least scientifically.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.960
The last 30 or so years
have seen a revolution

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.870
in the study of
cognition, and especially

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.620
in the study of the
science of learning.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.760
For one, we understand
that learning actually

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.930
changes the physiology
of the brain.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.305
And we can actually
look for that

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:31.140
when we're studying learning.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.910
We also know-- we have
scientific evidence

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.490
that being smart is not
about being informed.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.400
For instance, studies have
shown that very young children

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.430
with very little
information quickly

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.944
understand fundamental concepts
of numbers, physics, and logic.

00:07:45.944 --> 00:07:47.610
And they can learn
these really quickly.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.170
So it turns out that
kids like my 8-month-old

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.440
are in fact very smart,
very ignorant little experts

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.840
in learning.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.590
And this one remains
a novice in sleeping.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.730
And now that we have all
supercomputers in our pockets,

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.709
the notion of smartness
really needs to change, right?

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:06.250
Because being smart
isn't about being

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.780
able to repeat and
remember information.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.170
Technology does an amazing
job of doing that for us.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.860
Being smart is being able to
effectively use information

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.190
and locate it within concepts.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.510
So as Herbert Simon
says here, the new smart

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.730
is being able to sort out what's
deserving of our attention.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.850
And given that most of us have
jobs today that didn't even

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.444
exist when we were born,
the ability to learn

00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:29.610
is more important than ever.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:35.380
OK, I'm sure you're all
surprised that I'm not

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.440
a cognitive scientist given
my 30 second recap of 30

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.190
years of nuanced study.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.860
But the thing that I'm
excited to take away from this

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.730
is that it confirms what
great educators have long

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.080
known-- that the days
that people learn best,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.700
that the teachers who inspire
their students the best,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.120
that the days when school
is the most effective

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.050
are the ones that put
learners in the position

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.120
to discover for
themselves, to organize

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.200
those facts into concepts,
to turn misconceptions

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.330
into metacognition, or
these moments where you're

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.340
aware of your own learning
and you can actually

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.867
think and reflect on it.

00:09:07.867 --> 00:09:09.450
And even if we haven't
had the science

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.230
to prove it until
recently, we've

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.230
known about this for a
really, really long time.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.310
It almost seems trite
when you read it,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.260
but Aristotle is actually being
sort of profoundly insightful

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.690
when he claims that we
learn by doing things.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.890
It's all the more profound
when you go into schools,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:30.177
and you see how little learning
actually happens by doing.

00:09:30.177 --> 00:09:31.760
Even more contemporary
people like one

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.996
of the great thinkers
of pedagogy, John Dewey,

00:09:33.996 --> 00:09:35.620
was telling us 100
years ago that if we

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.078
want to foster learning, we
have to give students something

00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:40.760
to do, not something to learn.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.710
And this is when ed tech was
like books on a chalkboard,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.090
right?

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.260
One of our most influential
current thinkers

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.474
about educational technology,
Seymour Papert-- he

00:09:50.474 --> 00:09:52.390
was the guy that created
the first programming

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:54.325
language for kids--
noted that teachers

00:09:54.325 --> 00:09:55.950
should concern
themselves with creating

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.420
the conditions for learning
rather than providing

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.335
information.

00:10:00.335 --> 00:10:01.710
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.310
he was so passionate about
the freedom of expression kids

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.690
get by learning how
to write software.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.880
But even though we've
long had these intuitions,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.440
we've had experts
telling us this,

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.410
and now we have science
confirming this,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.766
we don't really have the
technology to scale this stuff.

00:10:17.766 --> 00:10:18.390
Think about it.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:22.190
The technology that
we use is amazing.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.340
My favorite days that
I remember as a student

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.757
were in science labs, being
able to look at things up close,

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:29.340
not being able to
predict the outcome.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.810
These are amazing moments.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.780
But this technology is
really hard to scale.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.520
It's expensive.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.500
It breaks.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.400
And it's constrained by time
and safety considerations.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.470
In many, many
countries and places,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.240
these moments just don't happen.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.810
And even more recently,
we've seen this explosion

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.010
of really, really
cool robots and stuff

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.480
in schools that help you
learn how to code and help you

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.300
do logic.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.050
Again, though, these
things are expensive.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.290
They're hard to scale.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.540
And they're relatively limited
in the number of things

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.700
that they can do.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.200
Even the classic technology
of this big yellow bus

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.270
that takes us on field trips,
again, amazing moments.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.280
It's really expensive.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.330
And it's super-limited
by time and space.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.040
VR gives us new-found
powers to scale and make

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.500
experiential, dynamic,
engaging learning a much, much

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.250
more regular occurrence.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.070
And the economics
of VR for schools

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.290
looks really different
when a single device

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.300
can be your science lab-- can
be your programmable robot-- can

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.850
give you access to museums,
and can be your school bus.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.480
The very cool thing
that is happening

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.520
is that the same technological
revolution that demands we all

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:39.060
get to be better learners is
the same technology that's

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.220
going to help us scale
that type of learning.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.010
And to talk about our first
project towards that goal,

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.090
I'd like to invite Jen.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:54.380
JENNIFER HOLLAND: Thanks,
Ben, for the history lesson.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.295
So I'm program manager
on Google Expeditions.

00:11:58.295 --> 00:12:01.110
And at Google I/O last
year, we announced

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.390
Expeditions, a new virtual
reality app for schools.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.220
And instead of just
releasing that app,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.310
we actually piloted
with hundreds of schools

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.500
all over the world to better
understand how this could

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.800
be a powerful learning tool.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.000
And it represents the first
deployment of VR technology

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.010
in schools at scale.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:28.090
And so for those of you that
might not know what Expeditions

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.680
is, it combines three things.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.850
One, it's software
built alongside teachers

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:39.430
and students-- two, immersive
virtual reality content--

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.790
and three, devices that are
available to any school.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.350
All you need is a smartphone,
a VR viewer, and a tablet.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:51.940
And you're able to teleport
all over the world.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.290
Actually, you can teleport
all over the Universe

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.670
with Expeditions.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:13:00.280
And you can laugh and learn
like you're actually there.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.870
And so the
expeditions themselves

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.360
are comprised of virtual
reality panoramas.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.950
There are 360-degree
photo spheres

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.780
that are annotated with
descriptions and points

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:14.560
of interests, which make it
really easy for the teacher

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.980
to actually incorporate
it into their lesson.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.410
And when a teacher points
something out on their tablet,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.120
an arrow pops up on the student
device directing the students

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.260
to look in that
particular direction.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.370
And as Ben mentioned, we
were able to bring over

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.020
1 million students on an
expedition in 11 countries.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.390
And I want you to think about
that number for a second.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:42.450
Imagine Shoreline
Amphitheater here

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.880
at Google I/O filled
with students.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.850
Every single seat is a student.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:51.810
Now, multiply that by 150.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.860
And that's how many
students have actually

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:56.720
gone on an expedition
this school year.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.420
And it's still happening today.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.200
If you were to pull out your
phone and look on Twitter

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.450
and look at the hashtag
#GoogleExpeditions,

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.320
you are going to see so many
kids smiling and excited

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.120
about learning.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.786
And I definitely
encourage you to do it.

00:14:09.786 --> 00:14:12.760
Just do it after our session.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.760
And we're able to reach that
many students because of how

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.370
accessible the hardware is.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.520
You don't need all these
cords and fancy headsets.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.100
You just need devices that
you can pull off the shelf.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.660
So let's take a look at
what one of those classrooms

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.810
is experiencing.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.000
And we'll visit the school
that's in Eagle Grove, Iowa.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.150
If we can cue the video.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.930
Actually, don't-- just
kidding-- don't cue that.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:43.950
Before we visited
schools, we wanted the day

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.250
to feel really special.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.460
And we wanted the
kids to be excited

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.690
about their virtual
field trip just like they

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:53.680
would a normal field trip.

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.150
And so we provided the
students with the gear

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:59.270
that they would need to be
able to go on this expedition.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.400
Just like a normal
physical field trip,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.070
you've got to take notes, and
write down your observations,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:07.140
and be able to share
them with your peers.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.130
And so the same thing
applied with Expeditions.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:11.840
And that feedback
has been amazing.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.064
And so now we'll
actually cue the video.

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:15.730

-My name is Lance Teasley.

00:15:18.402 --> 00:15:21.720
I'm in middle school
in Eagle Grove, Iowa.

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.645
Eagle Grove is not
a very tall place.

00:15:23.645 --> 00:15:26.770
It's actually very flat.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.280
This is the tallest
building on Main Street.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.130
It is about 50-feet tall.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.486
When I grow up, I want to
be an architect and design

00:15:34.486 --> 00:15:34.986
skyscrapers.

00:15:38.225 --> 00:15:40.100
Yesterday at school, we
went on a class trip.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.550
But this is was not a
normal trip with buses.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.390
This is something
very different.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.400
The very first
expedition we went on

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.724
was to the Burj Khalifa.

00:15:49.724 --> 00:15:51.140
-Go ahead and grab
with two hands.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.348
And put them up to your face.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.300
-It's so tall.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.620
-OK, we're going to
go to the 153rd floor.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.120
-Yeah!

-Yeah!

[APPLAUSE]

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.975
JENNIFER HOLLAND: The
best part of my job

00:16:25.975 --> 00:16:27.600
throughout this whole
year has actually

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.670
been able to go and visit
these schools-- visit

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.980
students like Lance.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.544
So initially, when we
thought about Expeditions,

00:16:36.544 --> 00:16:38.210
we thought it would
be about taking kids

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.210
to the most majestic
places all over the world.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.450
We thought it was like taking
students to the Taj Mahal.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.490
We thought it might be about
exploring the Great Barrier

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.690
Reef or Mt.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.890
Everest, or even Mars.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:53.440
But what we quickly found
out was that Expeditions

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.100
is so much more than that.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.610
It's actually
about enabling kids

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.800
to visit places that
might be nearby,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.199
but they might not
be able to get to.

00:17:02.199 --> 00:17:03.740
So this picture is
actually a picture

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.430
from a middle school, Pryor
Middle School, in Montana.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.980
And many of the students
are of Crow descent.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.589
And every August, there's this
huge powwow and celebration

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:17.589
of the Crow tribe that
happens in Montana.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.319
And many of these students
who live three hours away

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.750
from where the celebration is
weren't actually able to go.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.030
So we took our Odyssey
rig-- Google's Jump camera

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.850
with GoPro, and we brought it.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.790
And we placed it right in
the middle of that powwow

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.250
and right next to the horses
so that all the students

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.650
could see the horse parade.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.080
And we took it inside
tepees so that students

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.250
could see how a tepee is made.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:44.610
And we built those expeditions.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.440
And then we took it
to the middle school

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.280
so that those students could all
participate in the celebration.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.190
But what was amazing was
that those expeditions

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:59.180
were used around the world
to celebrate that weekend.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.970
And we also know that historical
moments are also really

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.770
important teaching moments.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:08.210
But they sometimes are
difficult to facilitate.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.770
So we've actually found a
way to include rich overlays

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:14.240
and use historical
sound recordings

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.080
to evoke a historical setting.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.940
And one of the other
cool things about this

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.400
is that we were able to use
some of the same computer vision

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.230
techniques that the
Street View team uses

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.390
to align this automatically.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.030
And so let's take, for
example, this recent expedition

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.470
we created in partnership with
Ken Burns, and Major League

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.090
Baseball, and PBS to celebrate
Jackie Robinson's life

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.010
and legacy.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.130
This panorama is one
scene from that tour.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.450
And it's of the
March on Washington

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:50.050
and how Jackie Robinson
played a really critical role

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:54.050
in the Civil Rights fight
for African-Americans.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:59.160
And this 360-degree
panorama was taken recently.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.800
And we found a historical photo
from the March on Washington

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.240
and overlaid it
in the exact spot

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.410
of where it was taken so that
students could get a better

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.890
understanding of that
significance of what took place

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:13.480
over 53 years ago.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:20.180
And current events are just
as equally important teaching

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.110
moments.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.280
But they too are often
difficult to facilitate.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.820
Take two of the most
catastrophic nuclear events

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.280
that took place--
Chernobyl and Fukushima.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.970
These are places that you would
never, ever take students to.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.660
But it's actually a really
important teaching moment.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.190
And teachers have had to rely
on videos and news articles

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.190
to explain what happened.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:46.820
But starting today,
schools participating

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.630
in the Expeditions Pioneer
Program in our beta

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:53.470
are actually able to go and
visit Chernobyl and Fukushima

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.210
and see for themselves
what happened.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.520
And this expedition we
have been creating-- this

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.110
is the first current
event expedition

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.010
that we've created in
partnership with Getty Images.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.400
And we're also going to be
working with Associated Press

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.690
to create more current event
expeditions so that students

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.510
all over the world will
be able to visit places

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:19.630
that time, and safety,
and geographic distance

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.200
make virtually impossible.

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.670
And beyond the
curriculum, we quickly

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:30.850
learn that there's even
broader learning opportunities

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.460
with Expeditions.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.970
And it was the vision of
others that helped encourage

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.190
us to expand beyond that.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:40.410
And so the First
Lady saw Expeditions.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.360
And she had a vision for
how she could use it as part

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.320
of her Reach Higher Initiative.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.960
For those of you who might not
be familiar about the Reach

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.550
Higher Initiative,
the First Lady

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:52.940
has been encouraging
students all over the US

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.910
to apply and go to college.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.800
And she saw Expeditions
as a great tool

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.040
to use in order to be
able to enable students

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.230
to actually visit colleges.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.150
There are a lot of
students out there

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:08.660
who lack the role models who
might have gone to college.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.170
And they themselves might
not be able to imagine what

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.330
it's like to go to college.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.450
They might not see
themselves going to college.

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.390
And so we wanted
to enable students

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.070
all over the world to get
excited about college--

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.020
to envision what it's like, to
see how much fun college is,

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.730
not only all the people and the
friendships that you'll make,

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.330
but also all of the
academic opportunities

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.710
that are possible.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.570
And so being able to visualize
what campus life is like

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.670
helps encourage students
to take that first step

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.510
towards applying for college.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:47.420
And similarly, when Soledad
O'Brien saw Expeditions,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.500
she had a vision for broadening
kids' exposure to careers.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.650
We know that kids
dream about what they

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.190
want to be when they grow up.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.000
But those dreams
are often shaped

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.820
by the professional
people in their lives.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.480
And we know that getting
exposure to careers

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.900
is an important
learning process.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.050
And this usually happens
through internships.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.150
But what happens if you
don't have an internship,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.100
or you don't have
mentors in your life?

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.190
So we've been building a
variety of career expeditions

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.520
to show what it's like and what
professional jobs are out there

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.590
so that students can
explore the day in

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.870
and day out of someone's career.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.160
They can see what
that person studied.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.740
They can find out
what they don't

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.740
like about their job,
which is actually a really

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.510
important learning opportunity.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.770
And we've worked with a number
of professionals, including

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.880
the paleontologist
professor from the American

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.380
Museum of Natural History, and
others like Pam Terrell who's

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.900
an airline pilot for
American Airlines--

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.490
and even an aquarist,
which I didn't even know it

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.990
was a career until we built it.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.599
You can laugh.

00:22:54.599 --> 00:22:55.098
It's OK.

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.350
And it turns out you learn a
lot when you bring your product

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.310
to 1 million students.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.950
So I wanted to share
some of those learnings

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.820
that we've experienced
along the way.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.000
Number 1, we know that teachers
need very specific tools

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.920
to do their job well.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.200
A teacher needs to
be able to direct

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.460
their whole class at once.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.590
They need to be able to get
their students' attention.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.450
And they also need to
be able to see what

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.330
their students are working on.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:33.300
And this remains
particularly true in VR.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.680
Teachers aren't experts of
every single place in the world.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.580
So to make it easy to
direct their class,

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.190
content providers provide
the descriptions and points

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.660
of interests of
particular locations

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.420
so that the teacher doesn't
have to spend all the time

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.760
researching and fact finding.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.610
So let's take this
panorama for example.

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.750
A teacher in the
US may have never

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:00.210
visited Buckingham Palace
before and might not

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:01.860
know that this is
actually the Portrait

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.270
Gallery in Buckingham Palace.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.790
And so with these descriptions
and points of interest,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.330
the teacher is able to point
out the famous Canaletto

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.950
painting that's hanging
above the fireplace.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.310
We wanted to free
teachers' time up so

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.665
they can spend the time
creating engaging lessons

00:24:17.665 --> 00:24:20.690
and incorporate it
into their curriculum,

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.630
not having to research
all these places.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.620
And when we first
built these tours,

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.760
we assigned a grade
and subject to them.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.280
We thought it would make it
easier to find the content.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.600
But what we found was that
the Expeditions were only

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.390
used by those teachers in
those grade and subjects, which

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.910
limited the use of the app.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.690
And we have over 200
expeditions ranging

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.740
from all kinds of topics.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:50.300
And so we decided to remove
those tags for each expedition,

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:53.380
because what we realized
was that the panoramas don't

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.870
actually change.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.030
What changes is how
the teacher actually

00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:00.100
applies them to the lesson.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.300
And the minute we did
that, we saw Expeditions

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.470
used in the most creative way.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.280
Take, for example, this
expedition of Egypt.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.840
An elementary math teacher
used this expedition

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.450
to create a lesson
about how to calculate

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.120
the area of a triangle.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.180
Pretty smart.

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.790
And that same expedition was
used in a high school world

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.980
civilization class to
teach about hieroglyphics

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.680
and how ancient Egyptians
communicated with one another.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.160
And that same expedition was
used in a college art history

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.020
class to teach about
the art and architecture

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.880
of the Egyptian civilization.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.170
Now, if that had been labeled an
elementary math lesson or math

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.790
expedition, there is no way that
art history teacher in college

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.310
was going to use that lesson.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:53.410
And so that was one of the
key learnings that we had.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.520
And just like a normal
class, it can sometimes

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.850
be difficult to get
a student's attention

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.750
during the middle of a lesson.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.540
So imagine that in VR.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.500
Kids are super-excited about
expeditions and VR in general.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.720
And so after a few
pilots, we realized

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.650
that we actually needed
to provide a Pause

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:14.020
button for teachers.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.320
So when the teacher
hits that Pause button,

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.630
the screen goes black.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.210
And it says,
"Paused by Teacher."

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:26.150
And immediately you hear,
awwww, can we go back?

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.970
And instantaneously,
the students

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.210
put down their devices.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:34.040
You don't hear the teacher
say, now put down your devices.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.970
It just happens automatically.

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:38.120
And the Pause
button is easily one

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.200
of the most important
features for teachers.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.420
And jokingly, they ask
me if we can add that

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.880
to all of their student devices.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.190
And we also heard from teachers
that knowing that students are

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:52.760
engaged is really important.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.260
The way a teacher knows
if a student is engaged

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.910
is by looking at what they're
doing-- writing something down,

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.450
or looking up at the board.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:05.110
And that remains really
important in VR as well.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.860
But if you think about it,
when you're in your VR viewer,

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.550
the teacher can't see
where you're looking.

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:12.990
And that was
definitely something

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.260
that was missing from our
app was the student gaze.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.447
And so we realized that when a
teacher points something out,

00:27:19.447 --> 00:27:21.780
they need to be able to see
if the students are actually

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.521
looking at it.

00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:24.020
So if you look on
the screen, you'll

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.520
see these little smiley faces.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.680
And those smiley faces represent
the students in a class.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.920
And so when the teacher
points something out,

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.030
you see this swarm
of smiley faces

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.080
to that point of interest.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.520
Well, if that swarm
doesn't appear,

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.240
and you see students
looking all over the place,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.600
you know that you might need
to use that Pause button

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.690
and refocus the class.

00:27:46.952 --> 00:27:48.410
The other thing
that we learned was

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:52.670
that VR and Expeditions empowers
students to be teachers.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.680
Teachers don't have
all the answers.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.950
And instead of having all
the answers, what we found

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.070
is that the teachers really
serve as a facilitator.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.080
They build upon
what the students

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:10.580
are seeing and exploring
from panorama to panorama.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.760
And across the world,
we saw this thing

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.110
happening where teachers
would ask their students

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:19.260
to explore a panorama, find
something interesting, and then

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.890
would invite a handful
of the students up

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.370
and actually point out that
thing that they thought

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.920
was interesting
and talk about it,

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.640
and share it with the
rest of their class.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.900
And this is exactly what
Seymour Papert was talking about

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.930
in the quote that
Ben referenced,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.330
that the role of the
teacher is to create

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.750
the conditions for invention
rather than provide

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.540
ready-made knowledge.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.740
And interaction
is really critical

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.126
to add to this experience.

00:28:45.126 --> 00:28:47.250
And it's something that we
know we need to continue

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.000
to add to in Expeditions.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.640
And we also know
that learning happens

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.790
outside of the classroom.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.830
Many of us would say that
we're lifelong learners.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.780
And as it turns
out, Expeditions can

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.900
be used for a broad range
of learning opportunities

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.230
beyond the classroom.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:08.570
We've actually been piloting
Expeditions in senior citizen

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.010
homes and children's hospitals.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.630
And the feedback as well
has been incredible.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.940
We have lots of requests
from senior citizens

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.540
to go and visit Verona,
Italy to see the setting

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.460
of Romeo and Juliet.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.660
And a lot of kids and
children's hospitals

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.010
have been asking
to go underwater.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:32.060
All they want to do is pick up
the goggles, hold their breath,

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.540
go underwater, and explore the
majestic Great Barrier Reef.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.940
And for that moment,
those kids are

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.720
forgetting about their illness.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.000
They're smiling.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.960
They're laughing.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.990
And they're asking questions
about what they're seeing

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.870
and what they're learning.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:50.650
So now I'd like to
turn it over to Ben

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:54.314
to talk about group
learning in Expeditions.

00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:56.258
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:00.910
BEN SCHROM: So one of
things that we've seen

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.445
is that one of the primary
features of school-- I

00:30:03.445 --> 00:30:05.320
didn't love going to
school when I was a kid.

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.580
But one of the
things you realize

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.163
is that group learning
is actually one

00:30:08.163 --> 00:30:09.910
of the best features of school.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.370
An early decision
that we made was

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.580
to make Expeditions
fundamentally social.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.360
And many of the
teachers we talked to,

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.690
even the ones who had never
seen the cardboard, who

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.830
thought Oculus Rift was
like a geological phenomena,

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.550
they carried this preconceived
notion that VR was a singular,

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.420
isolated activity.

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.020
So we took steps from the
get-go to make it social,

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.890
something you do with a group
like an actual expedition.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.230
It's not a canned
experience as a result.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.240
Every time is different.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.490
It's a dynamic experience
where your teachers

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.050
and your classmates
are the ones who

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.650
are asking questions, making
comments, and pointing things

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.340
out.

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.060
Though I've seen
some great uses of VR

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.435
to provide singular focus,
it's really, really important,

00:30:49.435 --> 00:30:51.101
I think, for us as a
community of people

00:30:51.101 --> 00:30:53.710
who are beginning to build up
this technology, to counteract

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.930
this notion that VR
is a fundamentally

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.404
isolated experience.

00:30:57.404 --> 00:30:59.070
If you're not convinced
of that, there's

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.486
a good example
from history, which

00:31:00.486 --> 00:31:03.900
was Edison's first attempt at
the camera, the Kinetoscope.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.530
Edison assumed that movies
would turn out to be something

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.070
that you just watched alone.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.540
And he resisted projecting
movies onto a screen

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.500
so that a bunch of people
could watch at the same time.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.430
We all know how that turned out.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:19.800
So lots of signals that VR
is super, super important

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.437
to have a social element to it.

00:31:22.437 --> 00:31:24.770
Another key point, and this
is certainly true, basically

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.186
for all technology,
but especially

00:31:26.186 --> 00:31:28.240
for educational
technology, is that making

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.870
it simple and easy and
especially quick to get going

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.350
is really critical.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.330
I remember reading about there's
some warehouse, in Florida

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.950
of all places, that
the Air Force can

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.800
make super, super cold
like subzero temperatures.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.140
And they put planes in that to
test them before they actually

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.550
put them into high altitude.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.870
Classrooms are like that
subzero warehouse, right?

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:52.080
They are very harsh environments
in which to deploy technology.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.689
And it needs to be simple
and robust, or it will fail.

00:31:55.689 --> 00:31:57.480
So we found that most
teachers are actually

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.720
really skeptical that they could
even use VR in the classroom,

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.230
not because they couldn't
figure out how to use,

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.327
but because they were
really intimidated by it,

00:32:03.327 --> 00:32:05.660
because they thought would
be too complicated to set up,

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.576
because they thought it
would be a distraction

00:32:07.576 --> 00:32:08.530
for their students.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.470
So we were super-committed
to ensuring that teachers who

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.670
hated tech loved Expeditions.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.870
And the best way to do
that was to make it simple.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.820
We found that time
and time again.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:22.020
It's almost defined by
how few features it has.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.800
It doesn't require
an account login.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.260
And we wanted to
counteract as many

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.690
of the technological
prerequisites

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.340
as we possibly could.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:31.400
So we made sure that it worked
well in devices that classrooms

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.139
already had like tablets.

00:32:33.139 --> 00:32:34.930
You don't need a
Cardboard viewer to do it.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.150
You can do it what
we call magic window

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.620
mode where you look in 2D.

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.282
And if you've never used VR,
if you've never used Cardboard,

00:32:40.282 --> 00:32:42.740
that's actually a really, really
magical amazing experience

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.500
by itself.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.190
Another challenge
we encountered was

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.160
that getting Expeditions to
work in environments with little

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.860
to no internet connectivity
was really challenging.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:53.380
And that's a very
common scenario

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.930
not just in affluent schools,
but in disadvantaged schools.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.347
Many, many schools do not
have the network environment

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.430
that would allow them to
pull these super-large VR

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:08.146
assets down out of the
cloud 30 devices at a time.

00:33:08.146 --> 00:33:10.870
And we decided we couldn't
wait for Google Fiber.

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:13.030
So we built Expeditions
to work without the need

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.360
for the internet.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.300
Basically, the
guide's device-- that

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.960
tablet that the
teacher is holding--

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.090
operates as a local server.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.590
And it serves imagery to each
of the connected clients, each

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.560
of the devices in Cardboard,
over the local Wi-Fi network.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.730
So as long as that tablet
has cached the imagery

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:29.760
from the internet at
some point before,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.110
it works without the
internet, which means

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.390
we can take this anywhere.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.390
We can take it to Ghana.

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:35.820
We can take it to
the rural Amazon.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:37.236
We can take it all
over the place.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.080
This is another one.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.620
Getting beyond this wow moment.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.790
Obviously, we love these
moments when students first

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.820
experience Expeditions.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.200
And you saw that in the
video with Lance's class.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.870
Basically, any
chance to see someone

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:55.730
experiencing VR for the first
time is a pretty magical one.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:57.620
It's an amazing moment.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:01.940
But the sort of immersion and
engagement that VR provides

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.800
is a bit of a moving target.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.650
What we consider
mindblowingly immersive

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.090
right now will be
considered table stakes

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.030
at some point in the
not too distant future.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.879
And we should be
excited that technology

00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:15.670
will continue to push
the boundaries of how

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:17.929
immersive VR can become.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:20.920
So you should be really
careful to rely too much

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.330
on the initial moment of
sort of awe and wonder

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.400
that comes from first use.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.210
It won't ultimately
mask poor designs.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.880
And it might
actually distract you

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.719
from realizing design
flaws for a long time.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:35.090
A good piece of VR
learning technology

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.639
still needs to be
actually fulfilling

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:39.540
its fundamental
learning objectives.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.989
It's not just about being fun,
or immersive, or engaging.

00:34:42.989 --> 00:34:45.280
Measuring it can be really,
really hard at first.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.170
But don't start entirely
trusting your feedback

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.860
until your users have been
able to use it for a few hours,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.929
or better yet, a
few days or weeks.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:56.440
Get feedback, iterate,
ship it, do it a lot,

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.400
like basically
fundamental technology,

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.670
but super, super
important for VR.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.540
As Jen mentioned, this
is one of the reasons

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.850
that we embarked on
the Pioneer Program.

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.350
So hopefully we've
seen a little bit

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.808
how we think Expeditions can
transform the classroom today.

00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:12.200
But we're really, really
excited about the possibility

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.110
of more advanced VR
in the classroom.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.559
And to talk a little bit about
that, I'd like to invite Rob.

00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:19.026
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:23.000
ROB JAGNOW: I'm Rob.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.090
I'm going to look into my
crystal ball and in 10 minutes,

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.170
try to tell you the
future of VR in education,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.720
which is going to
be really tough.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:31.960
I built a bunch of
tiny little prototypes

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.250
here at Google in a group
called Daydream Labs.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:36.790
And for the first time ever,
we're finally sharing our work.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:39.300
So I am really excited to
be here on stage and hope

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.850
that everyone can benefit
from sharing and seeing

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.410
what we've been working on.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.000
So for now, a little bit more
about Google Expeditions.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.330
Expeditions is amazing.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.110
And I am really proud to be
on the stage with these two.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.960
But we also are very
cognizant that we're

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.800
in the early stages of VR.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.210
Hardware will improve,
computational power

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.556
will improve, design
patterns will improve,

00:35:58.556 --> 00:36:00.180
and some of the
developers in this room

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.650
are going to find ways
to use VR in education

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.940
that we haven't
even imagined yet.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.830
The slide here is a
pretty common example

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.110
of how evolution is portrayed.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.930
You can think of
it as this forward

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:11.660
moving intention direction.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.200
But that's not what evolution
looks like in species.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.890
And it's not what it looks like
in any other technology either.

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:19.571
In any evolutionary
process, we know

00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:21.820
that there are going to be
false starts and dead ends.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.600
And that's why within
the Daydream team,

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.660
we're spending our time on these
things called Daydream Labs.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:30.130
Put bluntly, even
here at Google,

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:34.037
we really know that we don't
know very much about VR yet.

00:36:34.037 --> 00:36:36.120
So we're looking at highly
experimental ideas that

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.090
push the boundary
of VR, force us

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.599
to reconsider what's possible.

00:36:39.599 --> 00:36:41.390
And we're exploring
this vast new territory

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:43.500
right alongside you.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.400
We've gone back to
first principles.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.880
And we've tried
to set aside what

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.480
we think we know about
education and app design,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.320
because the best
VR experiences out

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.110
there aren't going to be other
forms of media pulled into VR

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.102
and re-imagined in VR.

00:36:57.102 --> 00:36:58.810
They're going to be
built from the ground

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.790
up in a way that really
understands the strengths

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.090
and weaknesses of VR.

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:04.630
And in the near
future, like I said,

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.510
I hope we're going to see
entirely new categories of VR

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.987
educational experiences.

00:37:08.987 --> 00:37:11.070
Now, since we started this
prototyping experiment,

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.790
we've built more
than 60 prototypes

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.796
that cover of a huge
array of use cases.

00:37:16.796 --> 00:37:18.420
So I want to cover
just a few of those.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.300
And this isn't just
to show off our work.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.360
Hopefully, by seeing
some of these examples,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.479
it'll spark ideas
in your own minds.

00:37:24.479 --> 00:37:26.770
If you're curious to learn
more about these prototypes,

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.690
there are two talks that
took place yesterday.

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.420
One is called,
"Daydream Labs-- Lessons

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.000
Learned from VR Prototyping."

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.350
The second talk is called,
"VR Design Process-- Turning

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:36.540
Fantasy Into Reality."

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.530
They're both already
available on YouTube.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.530
But for now, I want to
focus on these prototypes

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.200
that we think can really have
the power to change education.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.240
What we're looking at
here is a molecule viewer.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.830
And so much of what we explore
in education is at a scale

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.030
that almost completely
defies comprehension.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.840
From atoms and
molecules all the way up

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.670
to galaxies and superclusters,
pictures in textbooks

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:59.270
just don't get us excited
about this content.

00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:02.050
But what if you could hold
that molecule in your hand?

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.750
And the app that
I'm showing here

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.100
doesn't just have a couple
of molecules in its database.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.090
It has an enormous collection.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.940
And it builds the model of
the molecule dynamically

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.190
based on what it knows about
the chemical composition.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.273
I don't know if you're
familiar with this molecule

00:38:15.273 --> 00:38:16.002
in particular.

00:38:16.002 --> 00:38:20.795
It's one of the foundations of
life as we know it-- caffeine.

00:38:20.795 --> 00:38:23.407
So now let's go 31
orders of magnitude

00:38:23.407 --> 00:38:25.740
in the other direction and
take a look at the Milky Way.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.220
Here we see our VR planetarium.

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:30.010
And real planetariums
are amazing.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.599
But here you're in control.

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:33.390
You can pull a
constellation from the night

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:36.500
sky-- pull it right in front
of you to get more information.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:38.380
Next up, biology lab.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.710
Here what we tell the
student is that you're

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.530
an explorer from an
alien civilization

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:43.830
in the distant future.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.431
And you've stumbled
upon this skeleton.

00:38:46.431 --> 00:38:48.680
And you're trying to learn
as much as you can about it

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.280
by assembling the bones
into a human form.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.410
So a careful observer will see
the different types of joints.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.830
She'll notice that when slender
bones are paired together,

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.038
those are the ones that go
the farthest from the body

00:38:59.038 --> 00:39:00.500
on the arms and the legs.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.070
Hovering labels tell you that
this is the radius and ulna

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:04.420
or the tibia and fibula.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.530
And all of these
clues give you insight

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.230
into the human body in a way
that a textbook really never

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.040
could.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.020
Here's our physics lab.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.190
And the key here is that
there are two players

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:15.950
in the same virtual space.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.450
Ben was talking about
how participating

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.450
together and having us
be social is important.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.692
And these two players in
the same virtual space

00:39:23.692 --> 00:39:25.150
could be in the
same physical room.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.390
Or they could be across
the globe from each other.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.754
Either can change the physics
parameters of the scene

00:39:29.754 --> 00:39:31.170
like the mass of
the bowling ball.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.910
And the objective
is to set the values

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:36.220
just right so that the bowling
ball knocks over the pin.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.790
And being able to share
this experience really

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:40.910
amplifies the fun.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.140
Next up is language learning.

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.994
And this is such a perfect
example for virtual reality.

00:39:44.994 --> 00:39:46.410
It builds on
techniques that we've

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:48.250
been using in
conversational instruction

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.730
to put you directly
into the conversation.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:52.566
And in this video, we've
turned on subtitles

00:39:52.566 --> 00:39:54.190
to help you understand
what's going on.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.939
But if you've taken
the time to just learn

00:39:55.939 --> 00:39:57.990
a few words in one of
the previous sections

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.199
of this educational
app, you have no trouble

00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:02.240
participating in this
conversation with these two

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.750
young girls.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.845
In this case, VR
does more than just

00:40:05.845 --> 00:40:07.970
make you feel like you're
part of the conversation.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.030
It does that very well.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:11.800
But it also removes distraction
so that you can really

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.515
focus on the lesson.

00:40:14.515 --> 00:40:16.140
Now, when we're
talking about learning,

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.598
sometimes we just
think about kids.

00:40:17.598 --> 00:40:20.030
But really, learning
is a lifelong process--

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.220
professional skills, job
retraining-- how about a skill

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.040
that terrifies most adults,
doing what we're doing up

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.270
here-- public speaking.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.580
What if you could prepare
your talk by presenting

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.380
to a simulated audience?

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:33.960
We've seen VR used to
help overcome phobias.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.721
And this isn't really
that different.

00:40:35.721 --> 00:40:37.970
Public speaking is really
uncomfortable for people who

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.530
don't have experience at it.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:42.560
But in VR, you can simulate
that stressful environment

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.792
without fear of judgment
from a real audience.

00:40:44.792 --> 00:40:47.250
So that's kind of handy.

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.440
Now, let's change pace a
lot and go back to the days

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.200
before Google and talk about
the arc of educational games.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.690
So how many people
here died of dysentery?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.130
Not as many as I thought, but
a third of the audience here.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.860
Personally, I see "Oregon
Trail" as actually leading

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.970
a revolution in
educational games,

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.230
because it was so different.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.020
It wasn't just a
wrapper around a bunch

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.440
of boring educational content.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.600
Kids can see right through that.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.350
And I see a lot of educational
games where kids get

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.860
spoonfed a bunch of facts,
and then they answer a quiz.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.570
And this almost teaches
them-- it almost

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.060
reinforces that learning sucks.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.890
But if you do it,
you get this reward

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:26.065
of the mini game at the end.

00:41:26.065 --> 00:41:27.440
This isn't what
we want to teach.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.785
And "Oregon Trail" took a
really different approach.

00:41:29.785 --> 00:41:31.660
It didn't try to feed
you this list of facts.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.410
It tried to put you in the
shoes of early American pioneers

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.210
so that you can empathize
with the difficulty

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.330
of their journey.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.080
And this word empathy
is really important,

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.536
because it's something
that VR does really well.

00:41:43.536 --> 00:41:44.910
And at the end of
the experience,

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.118
maybe you don't remember
how long the Oregon Trail is

00:41:47.118 --> 00:41:49.570
or what percentage of
travelers died of dysentery.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.290
But you understand that it
was a brutal experience.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.930
And because of that, the people
who undertook that journey

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:58.370
must have been willing
to shoulder a lot of risk

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:00.150
in search for a better life.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.020
Now, today I think this kind
of experience is really hard.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.710
It has a lot trouble for this
kind of game making inroads

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.050
in education, because
it's not easy to measure

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.192
what the child learns.

00:42:10.192 --> 00:42:11.650
And if you can't
prove that they're

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:13.775
going to do better on
the test, it kind of

00:42:13.775 --> 00:42:14.900
looks like a waste of time.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.441
And now you might
really want to come

00:42:16.441 --> 00:42:18.610
to the defense of this piece
of childhood nostalgia.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:20.560
But the critics really
have a point here.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.829
How do you measure the value
of empathy-based education?

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:26.120
And if you think "Oregon
Trail" was on the right track,

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.661
I think you'll agree
VR has potential

00:42:27.661 --> 00:42:28.980
to really revolutionize this.

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.800
But it's not going to be easy.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.170
Let's talk a little bit about
what the ingredients are

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.150
that we're going
to need to create

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.361
great immersive
educational experiences.

00:42:37.361 --> 00:42:39.360
And the three components
that I want to focus on

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.200
are these-- immersion,
interactivity,

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.830
and measured results.

00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:45.530
That third one might
come as a surprise.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.500
Immersion is where
VR really shines.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.380
It's really hard to make
a VR experience that

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.360
isn't immersive.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.710
In this example here,
even though the avatars

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.360
are very simple and
cartoonish, when

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.780
you put that headset
on and those little two

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.955
cartoony little girls
turn to face you,

00:42:58.955 --> 00:43:01.036
you want to respond to them.

00:43:01.036 --> 00:43:02.910
They have included you
in their conversation.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:04.990
And you don't
hesitate to respond.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.240
Then we have interactivity.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.072
Now, Expeditions, like
most classroom experiences,

00:43:09.072 --> 00:43:10.780
is interactive in the
sense that kids can

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.370
look around and ask questions.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:13.920
But ultimately,
the teacher drives

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.105
the content and the pace.

00:43:15.105 --> 00:43:16.730
And that works very
well in classrooms.

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:18.690
But what if we want
a VR experience

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.170
that someone can explore on
their own-- on their own pace,

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.249
on their own time.

00:43:22.249 --> 00:43:24.040
And in this case, adding
more opportunities

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.539
for the viewer to
drive the show can

00:43:25.539 --> 00:43:27.690
do a lot to make the
material more engaging.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.900
In this two-player
physics lesson example,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.150
the students have complete
control over the difficulty

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.420
level that they choose.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.122
And they're also solving
the puzzle themselves.

00:43:36.122 --> 00:43:37.580
And solving that
puzzle on your own

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.705
is a lot more rewarding
than watching somebody else

00:43:39.705 --> 00:43:42.031
do it or talk you through it.

00:43:42.031 --> 00:43:43.030
So here's the tough one.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.690
Finally, it's important that we
measure how students interact

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.022
with the VR experience.

00:43:47.022 --> 00:43:49.230
It's hugely rewarding to
peek into a classroom that's

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.520
doing a Google Expedition,
whether it's kids or adults,

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.186
and see all those
giggling faces as they

00:43:53.186 --> 00:43:54.930
travel around the world.

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:58.670
But in order for VR to make
real inroads in education,

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.560
the subjective evaluation
is not going to be enough.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.520
We need some way to measure how
students interact with the app

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.920
and demonstrate the resulting
knowledge of a subject.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.680
And I'm not going to
pretend that this is easy.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.555
People have been trying
this for a long time.

00:44:10.555 --> 00:44:13.080
And it's really hard.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.900
Just choosing an
appropriate metric is hard,

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.110
and then measuring those
aspects without turning

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.630
your application into a
boring quiz is even harder.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.670
I think we're going to
need to rethink both

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.790
what we're measuring and
how we're measuring it

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:27.320
for these things
to move forward.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.320
And this is why to some
degree these aspects are

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:30.610
in conflict with each other.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.690
I can make an experience
that's more immersive.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:34.470
But it's hard to
measure the impact.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.110
I can measure the impact
by forcing students

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.350
to answer trivia questions.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:41.550
But all of a sudden, it's
not immersive anymore.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.310
So it's going to take a
lot of specialized skills

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:44.060
to get this right.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.830
And those specialized
skills are going

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.730
to come from specific people.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.340
And I am going to run
through each of these here.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.090
The first one, of
course, is teachers.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.620
Teachers understand
their students.

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.460
And they can't be
excluded from this process

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.477
in creating these
VR applications.

00:44:58.477 --> 00:45:00.060
They need the
flexibility to make sure

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:03.880
that the VR experience is tuned
to the ability and the style

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.070
of teaching needed
for their classroom.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.864
Next up, of course,
VR designers--

00:45:07.864 --> 00:45:09.780
they know how to make
an immersive experience.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.500
And even within this
group, I'm glossing over

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.180
a lot of talent that's needed.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:16.880
You need to understand 3D
modeling, interaction design,

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.750
audio design,
environment layout.

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.190
You need to stand understand
what types of motion

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.900
makes people sick.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:24.640
It's really a complicated thing.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.332
Then we have our
classic game designers.

00:45:26.332 --> 00:45:28.040
These people know how
to make experiences

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.600
that are interactive and
sticky and elicit the desired

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.822
behavior.

00:45:31.822 --> 00:45:33.280
Next up, and this
is the one that I

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.910
think is being excluded
too much in this process,

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.345
researchers understand
the metrics of education.

00:45:38.345 --> 00:45:39.720
Now, you might
have heard it said

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.110
before-- if you can't measure
it, you can't improve it.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.570
In the context of getting
your app out there to schools

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:48.570
and really getting impact
there, the more apt expression

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.430
might be, if you can't
measure student improvement,

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:54.227
your app will be discontinued.

00:45:54.227 --> 00:45:56.310
And the final element in
the equation is students.

00:45:56.310 --> 00:45:58.026
Thankfully, this is
a really easy one.

00:45:58.026 --> 00:45:59.400
The students are
the ones who are

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.480
the most open to new
ideas in education,

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.938
because you don't see a fourth
grader come home from school

00:46:03.938 --> 00:46:06.712
and say, mom, I'm not convinced
that this new curriculum

00:46:06.712 --> 00:46:09.170
is adequately fulfilling the
pillars of the next generation

00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:10.730
science standards.

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:12.135
They say, we went to Europa.

00:46:12.135 --> 00:46:14.260
Did you even know that
Europa is a moon of Jupiter.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.093
And it's entirely covered
in a frozen ocean.

00:46:16.093 --> 00:46:18.451
How amazing is that?

00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:19.950
So I've talked about
the ingredients

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.550
for a great educational
VR experience.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:22.820
And I've talked about
who's going to be

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.954
involved in creating them.

00:46:23.954 --> 00:46:25.370
But it's still
really hard to give

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:28.250
a roadmap of what the real
process is going to look like.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.740
With technology, ideas, and
patterns moving so quickly,

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:33.530
it's really hard to guess what's
just six months down the road.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.030
So take it with a
grain of salt as I

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.830
try to predict how the next
generation of educational VR

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:40.820
experiences will come to be.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:45.030
I think it's going to start with
existing VR experiences that

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.616
aren't necessarily
intended for education.

00:46:47.616 --> 00:46:49.490
VR game designers are
going to make something

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:52.340
that's incredibly compelling
and that has a huge audience.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.140
From there, teachers are going
to recognize an opportunity

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:57.850
to use that VR
framework for education.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.680
And "Minecraft"
gives a great example

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.240
of a game that's already
been repurposed for education

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.920
in all sorts of ways.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.670
From there, we're going
to have to involve

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.900
the researchers to figure out
the appropriate metrics that

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.316
allow us to measure the impact
of the app on the students'

00:47:10.316 --> 00:47:13.050
performance without compromising
the overall experience

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.090
of that app.

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:16.904
Working together, the designers,
teachers, and researchers

00:47:16.904 --> 00:47:18.820
are going to figure out
a way to put education

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.340
at the core of that experience
rather than just making VR

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:26.520
a light layer on top of what is
otherwise an educational app.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.160
What I really want you to take
away from these last few slides

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.110
is that a great VR
educational experience will

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.330
require multiple disciplines.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.540
We need to engage
new partners and get

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.280
outside of our comfort zones.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.510
So I think they're going to play
off the stage pretty soon here.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.220
But I'm going to try
to have us all wrap up

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:45.980
with our own conclusions.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:47.170
BEN SCHROM: Thanks, Rob.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.050
Yeah, so as I said
at the outset,

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:49.300
we're really excited about VR.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.142
Hopefully, that's
pretty obvious by now.

00:47:51.142 --> 00:47:53.600
I think it's actually pretty
rare that we get opportunities

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:57.080
like this as a community of
people that build technology.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.230
It's not rare to find
amazing technology like VR.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.860
And it's not rare to find
causes like education.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.910
But it's rare to find technology
like VR that can so profoundly

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:10.320
scale solutions to an imperative
like education in a way

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.610
that long-held
intuition in science

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:15.290
has told us is the right way.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:17.640
If all of us, or even some
of us, get this right,

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.680
it could change the way
that we teach and learn.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:21.060
And one of the
teachers, this one

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.601
that we met on our
Expeditions panel,

00:48:22.601 --> 00:48:24.410
told us that the
superpower she most wants

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.590
is to be able to make
eye contact with all 30

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.700
of her students
at the same time.

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.466
What an amazing idea.

00:48:30.466 --> 00:48:31.840
And it's probably
too late for us

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.590
to have this amazing
teacher in our class.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.200
But it's probably
not too late for us

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.440
to give her that superpower
in the near future.

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.773
So we're just really, really
excited to see that happen.

00:48:42.749 --> 00:48:44.290
JENNIFER HOLLAND:
And virtual reality

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:47.380
will never completely
replace physical field trips

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.410
and travel, nor should they.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:53.500
But it's going to enable
experiences to happen when it

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.230
would otherwise be impossible.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.970
And not only will it be a
democratizer of experience

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:04.240
to individuals around the
world and schools and the home.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.050
It's going to be an
enabler of experiences

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:10.980
to distant galaxies, and Mars,
and microscopic worlds that

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:13.505
would otherwise be
virtually impossible.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.760
ROB JAGNOW: And I will
simply conclude by saying,

I want you to be
prepared for surprises.

look like anything
