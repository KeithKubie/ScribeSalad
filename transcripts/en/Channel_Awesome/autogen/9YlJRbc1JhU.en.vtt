which is effective by the way when they
 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.610
which is effective by the way when they
do those wide-angle shots um but you get

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
do those wide-angle shots um but you get
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.030
do those wide-angle shots um but you get
that you have jets return and for a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
that you have jets return and for a
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.830
that you have jets return and for a

that the earth king does not know
 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.910
that the earth king does not know
exactly what's going on and he's kept

exactly what's going on and he's kept
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.680
exactly what's going on and he's kept
he's kept in secret out of the loop and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
he's kept in secret out of the loop and
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.520
you have the this Battle of first trying
to get Appa back and then probably my

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530
to get Appa back and then probably my
 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.160

what's going on with the with the clips
 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.650
what's going on with the with the clips
telling somebody else but it seems like

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660
telling somebody else but it seems like
 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.030
telling somebody else but it seems like
the biggest people to tell it seems like

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040
the biggest people to tell it seems like
 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.910
the biggest people to tell it seems like
they would have to tell this kingdom and

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920
they would have to tell this kingdom and
 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.320
they would have to tell this kingdom and
