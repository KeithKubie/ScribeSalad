00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.953
From sailors who were turned into pigs,

00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:11.352
nymphs that sprouted into trees,

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:14.461
and a gaze that converted 
the beholder to stone,

00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.162
Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters.

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:22.042
The powerful gods usually changed 
their own forms at will,

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.662
but for mortals, the mutations 
were often unwanted.

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:32.288
One such unnerving transformation 
befell the spinner Arachne.

00:00:32.288 --> 00:00:34.663
Arachne was the daughter 
of a tradesman

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:39.813
who spent his days dying cloth 
the deepest shades of purple.

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:43.073
She had a flair for spinning 
the finest threads,

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:45.012
weaving them into flowing fabric,

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:48.454
and creating magnificent tapestries.

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:52.423
People flocked to watch her hands 
flying across her loom,

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:56.823
as if thread sprung directly 
from her fingertips.

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.415
But as praise for her work grew, 
so did her pride.

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:04.015
Arachne could often be heard 
boasting about her skills,

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:09.914
declaring that her talent surpassed 
anyone else’s—mortal or divine.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:13.865
She refused to see weaving 
as a gift from the gods.

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:18.063
Rather, she flaunted it 
as her own personal genius.

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:22.294
Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom 
and crafts, Athena,

00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:25.175
overheard Arachne 
making these claims.

00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:28.224
Planning to teach 
the ungrateful girl a lesson,

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:33.785
Athena disguised herself as an old woman
and stole amongst the mortals.

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:36.055
She berated Arachne in public—

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:39.786
how dare the weaver claim
herself greater than the gods?

00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:43.946
But Arachne only laughed, 
barely looking up from her loom.

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:49.445
Provoked, the old woman threw off
her cloak to reveal her true form.

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:52.856
If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods,

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:57.437
Athena would challenge her 
to a contest directly.

00:01:57.437 --> 00:02:01.258
Masking her shock at the appearance 
of the grey-eyed goddess,

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:03.746
Arachne accepted the challenge.

00:02:03.746 --> 00:02:10.334
Athena drew up her own glittering loom 
as a great crowd gathered to watch.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:14.325
The weavers began, 
eyes fixed and shuttles blurring.

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:17.218
Athena conjured 
wisps of cloud from above

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:21.838
and slender threads of grass 
from below in a spectacle of strength.

00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:25.319
She wove tremendous scenes 
that showed the power of the gods:

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.587
Poseidon riding the waves,

00:02:27.587 --> 00:02:29.387
Zeus firing thunderbolts,

00:02:29.387 --> 00:02:32.319
and Apollo hurtling across the sky.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.629
In Athena’s splendid tapestry, 
the glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.009
But Arachne had no interest 
in boosting godly egos.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.409
Her tapestry showed the gods
abusing their power:

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.189
squabbling amongst themselves,

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:49.767
drinking and bragging,

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:52.359
and meddling in the lives of mortals.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:57.220
She represented Zeus as a philanderer,
transfiguring himself to ensnare women:

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.667
a swan for Leda,

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:00.420
a bull for Europa,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.259
a shower of gold for Danae.

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.550
Arachne then turned
to the misdemeanors of other gods,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.870
from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.020
to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.270
Even though she cast the gods 
in the most unflattering light,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.310
Arachne’s work shone 
with her dazzling skill.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.511
Her tapestry was almost alive,

00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:24.971
filled with movement 
and lustrous colors

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.300
that winked triumphantly.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.997
When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably
better and flagrantly subversive work,

00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:36.980
she flew into a rage 
and turned on the human weaver.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.191
Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body
shrinking and contorting.

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:46.291
Her fingers waved wildly 
as her arms stuck to her sides,

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:50.052
and black hair
sprouted all over her body.

00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:55.015
The goddess left Arachne with a single 
spool of thread unfurling from her belly,

00:03:55.015 --> 00:03:58.614
a slim reminder of her human talent.

00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:01.584
For challenging the assumption
that the gods were untouchable,

00:04:01.584 --> 00:04:06.864
Athena had shrunk her adversary 
into the first spider.

00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:10.733
To this day, Arachne and her children spin
out her penance—

00:04:10.733 --> 00:04:13.330
or is it undaunted persistence?—

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.486
in the shadows of giants.
