Here's a word cloud of student responses. Now if

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.350
you've never seen a word cloud before, the way

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.620
it works is the bigger the word, the more

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.430
often it was submitted by you and your fellow classmates.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.300
&gt;&gt; Now, obviously, different people describe themselves in different ways,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
so look at the word cloud and see if there's any

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.570
words that you use to describe yourself. If not, that just

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.000
means not than many people use the same words you use.
