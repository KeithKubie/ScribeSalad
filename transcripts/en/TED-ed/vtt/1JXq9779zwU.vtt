00:00:07.182 --> 00:00:10.091
Somewhere between the orbits 
of Mars and Jupiter,

00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:13.482
about 500 million kilometers 
away from Earth,

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:17.992
floats a metallic orb 
the size of Massachusetts.

00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:21.332
That’s no moon...it’s 16 Psyche,

00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:24.938
one of the most massive
asteroids in the solar system.

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:28.909
And it is the asteroid 
our droids are looking for.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.008
We humans have managed 
to send robotic spacecraft

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:34.443
to all sorts of environments in space –

00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:36.490
the gas clouds of Saturn and Jupiter,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.562
the icy wastes of Europa,

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:41.381
and the rocky dunes of Mars.

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:44.443
But Psyche’s surface 
isn’t just hard rock –

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.080
it’s heavy metal.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.474
The asteroid mostly consists 
of nickel and iron,

00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:53.174
by far the largest known body 
with such a composition.

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:55.452
But we don’t yet know what it looks like;

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:58.854
our best current radar images 
show a pixelated smudge.

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:01.605
That’ll change in 2026,

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:05.564
when an unmanned spacecraft sent as
part of NASA’s Discovery Program

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.017
is scheduled to arrive.

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:10.664
So why is NASA so interested in Psyche?

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:14.553
Are we going to mine all that metal, 
or build a giant space magnet?

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:17.952
Actually, the real reason 
is right under our feet.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:22.582
The core of the Earth is thought 
to consist of a solid nickel-iron center

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.804
with a molten outer layer.

00:01:24.804 --> 00:01:31.162
But we’re prevented from studying it up
close by 2,800 kilometers of solid rock.

00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:34.645
The deepest we’ve been able 
to drill is 12 kilometers.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:36.275
Even if we could go further,

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:40.585
the pressure at the core is three million
times higher than at the surface,

00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:44.576
with a temperature 
of 5,000 degrees Celsius.

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:49.735
Simply put, a journey to the center of
the Earth is out of the question for now.

00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:53.725
So scientists have had to resort 
to indirect ways of studying the core,

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:56.335
like measuring earthquake waves 
that pass through it,

00:01:56.335 --> 00:01:59.555
or studying minerals thought 
to have formed there.

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:02.385
But what if the best way to study 
Earth’s inner space

00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:05.077
is by visiting outer space?

00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:09.086
After all, we have a pretty
good idea of how our planets formed.

00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:13.217
Dust and gas orbiting our young Sun 
cooled and collided

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:17.466
to form a few thousand miniature bodies 
we call planetesimals.

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:21.356
As these continued to orbit,
some combined to grow larger,

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.628
eventually forming our planets.

00:02:23.628 --> 00:02:28.528
Others experienced impacts 
that broke them apart into smaller chunks–

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:32.988
the asteroids we see today 
in the belt between Mars and Jupiter.

00:02:32.988 --> 00:02:35.727
What makes Psyche so special

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:38.118
is that it appears 
to have been a planetesimal

00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.608
well on its way to becoming a planet,

00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:43.986
with a rocky exterior 
surrounding a metal core.

00:02:43.986 --> 00:02:48.808
But its progress was cut short 
by a series of hit-and-run collisions

00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:50.589
with other planetesimals

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:55.219
that knocked off the rocky crust 
until only the core remained.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.749
Experiencing that many 
destructive collisions

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:02.489
with no additive ones in between 
is statistically very unlikely,

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.709
making Psyche an amazingly 
rare opportunity

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.949
to study an exposed metallic core.

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:12.211
To do that, NASA’s robotic orbiter 
will be equipped

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:14.608
with an array of advanced instruments.

00:03:14.608 --> 00:03:18.069
A spectrometer will analyze 
the gamma rays and neutrons

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.078
produced when Psyche 
is struck by cosmic rays.

00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:23.100
Each element in the periodic table

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.967
releases gamma rays 
of specific wavelengths,

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.703
so these measurements will tell us 
what elements are found on the surface.

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:32.828
A magnetometer will measure 
Psyche’s magnetic field,

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:34.219
allowing us to learn more

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.940
about how Earth’s magnetic field 
is generated at its core.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.909
And of course, an imager will give us 
a closer look at the surface

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.577
than ever before.

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:48.073
Visiting a whole new kind of world 
is exciting enough on its own.

00:03:48.073 --> 00:03:51.194
But the mission to Psyche gives us 
a unique chance

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:56.710
to discover our own planet’s innermost 
secrets in an orbit far, far away.
