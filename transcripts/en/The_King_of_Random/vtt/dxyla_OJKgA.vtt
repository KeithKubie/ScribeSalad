If you're like most people, you probably use
butter on a fairly regular basis. Of course

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.009
there are plenty of great things you can do
with butter, but in this project, we're gonna

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.089
to be making it.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.040
For this project I picked up a gallon of fresh
cows milk right from the cow. I let this jug

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.050
sit in the fridge overnight, and here you
can see a faint line where the cream has risen

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.840
to the top. Now if you don't have access to
a cow, you'll still be able to do this with

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.240
a heavy cream or whipping cream like this.
We need to separate the cream from the milk,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.620
and it might seem a little counter-intuitive,
but the heaviest cream is on the top. We can

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.380
use something like a ladle to skim it off,
and transfer it to another container like

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.080
a wide mouth mason jar. Let's go ahead and
put the lid back on, making sure it's nice

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.880
and tight. And at this point, it's time to
churn the cream into butter, so start shaking.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.610
..Now you're gonna have to shake it a lot,
and it only takes a few seconds to realize

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.670
this is going to be an amazing work out, but
if standing around shaking cream isn't your

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.740
thing, see if you can get a friend to do it
for you, or give it to your kids, and let

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.790
them work out some energy. You could even
take it with you on your morning jog. After

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.970
shaking your cream vigorously for about 3
minutes, you'll notice that it's transformed

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.010
into a light and fluffy whipped cream. 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.400
Now feel free to

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.810
take a 3 minute break. This will actually
make the process go a lot smoother, and you're

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.530
probably gonna need it. But when you get
back to shaking, shake that cream as violently

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.570
as you can. The harder and faster you shake,
the sooner you'll feel the cream break, and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.070
when everything starts sloshing around in
the jar, you're done. This time when you look

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.330
inside, you'll see a big blob of, human powered,
homemade butter. The leftover liquid is traditional

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.770
buttermilk, and can be used for baking. My
wife used this buttermilk to make a batch

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.119
of these wholewheat buttermilk waffles. With
the buttermilk drained off, you should be

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.760
left with a beautiful ball, of golden yellow
butter. Let's compare the highest grade of

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.520
butter we found at the store, to the butter
we just made. Can you see a difference? 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.340
Now if you're like me, you'll probably want to
eat your butter right away, and that's ok,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.290
but if you added a pinch of salt, it will
help it last longer and make it a little more

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.719
savory. I mixed in some local organic honey,
and a few other ingredients to make a delicious

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:28.480
honey butter, which, by the way, tastes incredible
on your buttermilk waffles. Well there are

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.609
a few ideas to support a healthier lifestyle
by shaking cream into butter. If you liked
