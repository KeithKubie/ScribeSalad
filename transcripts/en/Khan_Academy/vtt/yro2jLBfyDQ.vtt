00:00:00.678 --> 00:00:02.888
We've already studied the
IS curve in some detail

00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:04.801
and just a bit of a review here,

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:09.675
it's just relating real
interest rates to real GDP.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.713
Let me just write that as Y, real GDP.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:16.807
The relationship, there's
2 ways we've viewed it;

00:00:16.807 --> 00:00:19.133
one is real interest
rates driving investment

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.299
which drives real GDP

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:22.627
or I should say real interest rates

00:00:22.627 --> 00:00:27.266
driving planned investments
which drives real GDP.

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.403
If you have a high real interest rate

00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:31.405
then you're not going to
have as much plan investment

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:33.132
and if you looked at our Keynesian cross,

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:34.715
it's pretty clear

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:35.871
that if you don't have as
high planned investment

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.881
you will not have as high of a GDP

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:41.473
or high of a real GDP.

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:44.138
Similarly, if you have a
lower real interest rate

00:00:44.138 --> 00:00:45.966
you'll have more planned investment

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:48.409
and then you will have a higher real GDP.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.865
Our IS curve looks like this.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.911
Our IS curve is downward sloping.

00:00:54.911 --> 00:00:57.204
It's easier for me to draw a dotted line.

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:59.902
Right over there is our IS curve,

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:02.411
stands for investment savings curve.

00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:03.823
This right here is taking it much more

00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:05.331
from the investment side,

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.331
how real interest rates drive investment.

00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.268
You could also view it
from the other angle.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:14.273
You could view how real GDP drives savings

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.128
which drives interest rates.

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:18.664
That interpretation, at low levels of GDP

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:19.933
you have less savings.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.670
That's essentially there
is less excess capital

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.322
to go around and so it is scarce.

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:27.998
The price of that is expensive

00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:30.934
and the price of money is interest rates

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:33.331
and if we're dealing in real
terms, real interest rates

00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:34.664
and so it would be high.

00:01:34.664 --> 00:01:36.598
If you have higher GDP

00:01:36.598 --> 00:01:38.411
and everything else is held constant,

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:40.601
if government spending is held constant,

00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.203
consumer spending will go up

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:44.328
but it won't go up as high as GDP.

00:01:44.328 --> 00:01:45.999
You're going to have more savings,

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.994
there's more stuff to lend around

00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:51.464
and so the price that's
asked for lending that money

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.923
will go down and that price
is real interest rates.

00:01:53.923 --> 00:01:55.331
These are two ways of viewing it.

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.736
This is the savings driven way

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.938
and this is the real interest rates

00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:01.194
driving investment.

00:02:01.194 --> 00:02:03.267
So that's why it's called the IS curve,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:06.405
investment savings curve.

00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:11.078
Now, what I want to talk
about is the LM curve, LM.

00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:12.577
Let me draw a little line over here

00:02:12.577 --> 00:02:14.077
although I'm going to
plot it on top of this

00:02:14.077 --> 00:02:16.796
so that we can start thinking
about the equilibrium level

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:19.822
of real interest rate and real GDP.

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:24.538
The LM curve, LM stands
for liquidity preference

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:25.654
money supply.

00:02:25.654 --> 00:02:41.092
Liquidity preference money supply.

00:02:41.092 --> 00:02:42.933
Liquidity preference, it
sounds like a fancy thing

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.400
but it's actually a very basic,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.197
it's a very basic idea.

00:02:46.197 --> 00:02:50.203
This is, if we hold real money constant

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.570
and when I talk about real money.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.933
Let me clarify here.

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:54.736
If I talk about real money,

00:02:54.736 --> 00:02:58.599
we're talking about the
amount of money in supply

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.484
if we adjust for something like inflation.

00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:02.930
You could measure real money,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.070
in the U.S. you could
measure it as base money

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.313
or maybe the total amount
of federal reserve notes

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.668
or M0.

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:14.730
You could measure it as
M0 divided by the CPI.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.152
Maybe M0 goes up

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:18.487
but if the CPI goes up by the same amount,

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:20.073
by the same percentage

00:03:20.073 --> 00:03:23.334
then you're not going to
have a change in real money.

00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:26.150
If M0 goes up without prices increasing

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.203
then real money has gone up.

00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:31.464
If M0 stays constant but
prices have increased

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:33.563
then real money has gone down.

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.267
All liquidity preference is describing is

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:38.682
if we assume this is constant

00:03:38.682 --> 00:03:40.331
at any given level here,

00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:45.937
assume constant,

00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:48.465
then the more economic
activity that there is

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:52.156
the more demand that
there is for that money

00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:55.151
and so there will be
higher real interest rates.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.073
People will be willing to pay
higher prices for that money

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:00.482
in real terms.

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.664
All it's saying is if you have very,

00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:03.733
let's start over here,

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:05.270
if you have a lot of economic activity

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.664
people will want to hold currency

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.404
so that they can have transactions

00:04:09.404 --> 00:04:10.924
so they have some flexibility.

00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:15.197
The money itself is going to
be circulating much, much more.

00:04:15.197 --> 00:04:17.002
There's going to be higher
demand for that money.

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:18.739
If there's higher demand for that money

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.068
people will either be willing to pay more

00:04:22.068 --> 00:04:23.290
for access to that money

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.234
or you're going to have to pay them more

00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:26.601
for them to give you their money

00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:28.335
because they really want that liquidity.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.601
They really want that
access to their money.

00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.406
And the price of money is interest rates.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:38.244
For the LM curve, when we think
about liquidity preference,

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:41.529
holding real money constant,
high levels of GDP,

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:42.934
a lot of economic activity,

00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:45.076
people want to have currency,

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:46.566
demand for currency is high

00:04:46.566 --> 00:04:47.903
so the price is currency is high

00:04:47.903 --> 00:04:48.997
which is real interest rates

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:52.131
and so we would have
real interest rates high

00:04:52.131 --> 00:04:55.064
due to liquidity preference.

00:04:55.064 --> 00:04:56.411
On the other side of that,

00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.263
if you have low economic
activity people might say,

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:02.603
"Well, there's not as
much demand for currency,

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:04.904
"there's fewer transactions going on."

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.485
And so you will have to pay someone less

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:08.570
to part with their money

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.480
or if someone's willing to pay less

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.998
in order to get access to money.

00:05:11.998 --> 00:05:15.738
So at low levels of GDP,
according to liquidity preference,

00:05:15.738 --> 00:05:18.331
you're going to have
lower real interest rates.

00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:23.068
Our LM curve looks something like this,

00:05:23.068 --> 00:05:25.600
this is IS in this dotted line yellow

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.871
and our LM curve looks
something like that.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.664
When you plot these two
constraints against each other

00:05:32.664 --> 00:05:34.818
the IS is telling us a relationship

00:05:34.818 --> 00:05:37.814
between real interest
rates driving investment

00:05:37.814 --> 00:05:39.000
and how that affects GDP

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.263
or how real GDP affects savings

00:05:41.263 --> 00:05:42.601
affecting real interest rates.

00:05:42.601 --> 00:05:43.936
It's a different constraint

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:45.938
that what liquidity
preference is telling us.

00:05:45.938 --> 00:05:48.931
This is how much people as
things get better and better,

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.669
more and more economic activity,

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.599
people want to hold more money.

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.001
These two different constraints,

00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:55.862
now you take them both into consideration,

00:05:55.862 --> 00:05:57.999
you end up with an equilibrium point.

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.074
There is going to be 1 point
that meets both constraints

00:06:01.074 --> 00:06:04.267
and this is the point at which
the economy is at equilibrium

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:13.584
Real interest rates and real GDP.

00:06:13.584 --> 00:06:15.219
Now, let's think about what would happen

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.061
if the federal reserve decided to print,

00:06:18.061 --> 00:06:19.626
if we'd take a U.S. focus,

00:06:19.626 --> 00:06:23.799
if the Central Bank or the federal reserve

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:29.485
decides to print more money?

00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:32.945
By this definition up
here of our real money

00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:34.441
in the very short term,

00:06:34.441 --> 00:06:36.710
especially when we put
our Keynesian hat on,

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.023
we assume in the very short
term prices are sticky.

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:41.933
This, in the very short term,
this doesn't change much.

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:44.602
If this goes up then real money goes up

00:06:44.602 --> 00:06:46.864
especially in the short term.

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:50.201
Real money goes up.

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.727
If real money goes up,
you're essentially increasing

00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:54.467
the supply of real money.

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:56.347
Anytime you increase
the supply of real money

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:59.532
at any given level of demand,

00:06:59.532 --> 00:07:01.520
people are going to
want to pay less for it.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.801
So what you're going to have happening is,

00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:05.429
so at any given level of GDP

00:07:05.429 --> 00:07:06.864
there's now more money there.

00:07:06.864 --> 00:07:09.198
The price of that money
is going to be less,

00:07:09.198 --> 00:07:10.595
the prices of real interest rate.

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:14.185
If the federal reserve, if
the central bank prints money

00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:15.936
and real money increases,

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:17.591
we're assuming in the very short term

00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:19.466
that prices don't change
because they're sticky

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:20.862
so real money has gone up,

00:07:20.862 --> 00:07:23.658
the price of that real money will go down

00:07:23.658 --> 00:07:25.720
at any given level of GDP.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.386
That would shift the LM curve down

00:07:31.386 --> 00:07:33.396
and so we can start to
see what would that do

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:36.548
to our equilibrium interest
rates and level of GDP.

00:07:36.548 --> 00:07:39.470
In that situation, real interest rates,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.997
the equilibrium real interest
rates clearly went down.

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:44.186
We also see, based on this model,

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:48.186
some expansion of GDP.
